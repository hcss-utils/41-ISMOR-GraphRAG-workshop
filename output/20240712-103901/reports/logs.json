Marxism-Leninism was not only the methodological foundation for military strategy but also provided a whole worldview, which military strategy had to reflect. When the Soviet ideology disappeared, a vehicle to replace it was the introduction of three new documents of security policy: the National Security Concept of the Russian Federation, the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, and the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, with the National Security Concept superior (De Haas 2010, 4). However, the National Security Concept was the last document of these three to be produced in 1997. The delay was the consequence of initial uncertainty over whether the concept was to cover the whole of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) or just the Russian Federation, as well as a power struggle between the departments involved (De Haas 2010, 6) .

The initial outburst of analysis gave way in turn to a second wave, which to a large degree focused on explaining why these concepts were wrong (Galeotti 2016a; Giles 2016a; Renz 2016a; Charap 2015; Thomas 2016a; Bartles 2016a; Galeotti 2018b; Freedman 2014; Kofman and Rojansky 2015) .\nHow war is changing is a perennial topic in military theory. However, few Western studies have engaged in depth with how the Russian understanding is changing. Rather, it seems that\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The 2010 Military Doctrine also saw that information warfare was so effective that it could reach strategic objectives by itself, without the need for armed force. The security doctrines list threats from a civilizational level, interference and destabilization that lead to overthrow of leadership, as well as information warfare and foreign powers using the protest potential of the population. The 2015 National Security Strategy explicitly referred to color revolutions in its threat perception. While none of the security doctrines has explicitly rejected the traditional understanding of war as defined by armed violence (the federal law On Defense understands war as being defined by armed violence), there has been a clear shift between 1993 to today.\nThe foremost factors in changing this understanding have been the increased importance of information warfare and the fear of color revolutions. They are interrelated, and information warfare is perceived to be crucial for the impact of the society to that leads to revolt, destabilizing the Russian state and military. They are the key means in the rivalry between values, cultures, and, potentially, civilizations, as the Military Doctrine, National Security Strategy, and Foreign Policy Concept have pointed out. This way of understanding war also reduces the boundaries between internal and external security when the primary means of external actors are seen as the creation of domestic problems.

Nonetheless, he opened the possibility of these means being perceived as violent, stating that \"non-military forms of struggle can be used in the course of war [and thus] they become violent\" (Gareyev 2003a, 187) . This seems to be a recognition of the increasing potency of these means, while still seeing war as defined by armed force.\nIn a 2005 article, \"Otstaivaya natsionalnyye interesy\" (Defending the national interest), Gareyev again attacked those who wanted to expand the concept of war. He regarded those who referred to economic, information, or trade confrontation as \"war\" as devaluing the uniformed personnel in harsh conditions (Gareyev 2005a ). However, this counterargument was beside the point. Gareyev insisted that war was determined (as history and the federal law showed) by the start and cessation of armed hostilities (voyennykh deystviy) (Gareyev 2005a) . He also contended that the \"main feature of war is the use of armed force and violent acts\" (Gareyev 2005b, 11) .\nA change in Gareyev's thought can nonetheless be noted regarding color revolutions. He contended that world wars and large-scale aggressions against Russia were becoming increasingly unlikely, both due to the existence of nuclear weapons and the growing utility\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The doctrine also emphasized the importance of information warfare in modern conflicts. However, those mentions aside, the major focus was on NATO and larger, conventional armed conflict. An analysis of the doctrine concluded that \"the ideas presented in the doctrine, especially its focus on NATO as a major challenge and . . . the maintenance of a strong mobilization capability, were very much in line with the thoughts of the traditionalist school\" (Bukkvoll 2011, 702) .\nSpeaking a month later, Gareyev argued that the Arab Spring was an example of the disruptive technologies of the West. He stated that the threats from information and subversive activities to create controlled chaos (upravlyayemyy khaos) and provoke unrest to overthrow unwanted powers were \"very real\" (Interfax 2011). He then placed the Arab Spring in the tradition of color revolutions, stating that \"you know how it was done in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, and it is today carried on in the Middle East\" (Interfax 2011).

The 2010 Military Doctrine also saw that information warfare was so effective that it could reach strategic objectives by itself, without the need for armed force. The security doctrines list threats from a civilizational level, interference and destabilization that lead to overthrow of leadership, as well as information warfare and foreign powers using the protest potential of the population. The 2015 National Security Strategy explicitly referred to color revolutions in its threat perception. While none of the security doctrines has explicitly rejected the traditional understanding of war as defined by armed violence (the federal law On Defense understands war as being defined by armed violence), there has been a clear shift between 1993 to today.\nThe foremost factors in changing this understanding have been the increased importance of information warfare and the fear of color revolutions. They are interrelated, and information warfare is perceived to be crucial for the impact of the society to that leads to revolt, destabilizing the Russian state and military. They are the key means in the rivalry between values, cultures, and, potentially, civilizations, as the Military Doctrine, National Security Strategy, and Foreign Policy Concept have pointed out. This way of understanding war also reduces the boundaries between internal and external security when the primary means of external actors are seen as the creation of domestic problems.

However, the long-term lack of attention to Russian military thought made hybrid warfare and the Gerasimov doctrine the bedrock for debates on understanding Russia (Monaghan 2016b, 66) . The key theme in all concepts was that they were introduced to capture the successful Russian conduct in Ukraine with a combination of military and nonmilitary means and especially the use of information warfare (NATO 2014; EEAS 2015; Lasconjarias and Larsen 2015; IISS 2015; R\u00e1cz 2015; Hunter and Pernik 2015; Chivvis 2017) . The initial outburst of analysis gave way in turn to a second wave, which to a large degree focused on explaining why these concepts were wrong (Galeotti 2016a; Giles 2016a; Renz 2016a; Charap 2015; Thomas 2016a; Bartles 2016a; Galeotti 2018b; Freedman 2014; Kofman and Rojansky 2015) .\nHow war is changing is a perennial topic in military theory.

He stated that war has been \"understood as the continuation of politics by means of armed violence\" and that this was how war is interpreted in the law On Defense (Gareyev 2017 ). However, Gareyev saw that \"now, when the scope and technological opportunities of nonmilitary means of confrontation have significantly expanded, it is increasingly being asked whether their use means aggression\" (Gareyev 2017) . Therefore, Gareyev argued that wartime laws, or their interpretation, needed to be changed (Gareyev 2017) .\nGareyev saw that scholars in the Russian debate had started to divide the definition of war into the traditional one-the use of armed violence (nasiliya)and the nontraditional one, which involved nonmilitary means (Gareyev 2017 ; see also Gareyev 2018) . Therefore, Gareyev called for a clarification of the definition of the essence of war, which should be done together by the Academy of Military Sciences and the Foreign Ministry, whose results were to be sent to the UN (Gareyev 2017) . Gareyev saw that the reasons for these military threats was that nuclear weapons had become an impediment for large-scale war and that, \"therefore, the\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The doctrine also emphasized the importance of information warfare in modern conflicts. However, those mentions aside, the major focus was on NATO and larger, conventional armed conflict. An analysis of the doctrine concluded that \"the ideas presented in the doctrine, especially its focus on NATO as a major challenge and . . . the maintenance of a strong mobilization capability, were very much in line with the thoughts of the traditionalist school\" (Bukkvoll 2011, 702) .\nSpeaking a month later, Gareyev argued that the Arab Spring was an example of the disruptive technologies of the West. He stated that the threats from information and subversive activities to create controlled chaos (upravlyayemyy khaos) and provoke unrest to overthrow unwanted powers were \"very real\" (Interfax 2011). He then placed the Arab Spring in the tradition of color revolutions, stating that \"you know how it was done in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, and it is today carried on in the Middle East\" (Interfax 2011).

The doctrine presumed the usage of high-precision weapons to prevent military conflicts, as part of the 'strategic deterrence activities of a forceful character'. 31 Overall, all the strategic deterrence efforts had two endsprevention of war (in peacetime) and de-escalation of conflict (in wartime), supported by forceful (military and non-military) means (political-diplomatic, legal, economic, informational-psychological and spiritual-moral). Back then, however, Russia lacked a unified system of strategic deterrence (codified theory, methodological apparatus and procedures supporting it), as well as a coordinating organ to orchestrate it across all domains. The GS identified the creation of such a unified system, based on complex measures of both a military and nonmilitary nature, as the most important task. 32 During the years leading up to publication of the 2014 doctrine, a leap forward towards 'non-nuclear deterrence' became evident. Annual exercises since 2011 demonstrated the growing role assigned to advanced conventional munitions relative to the previous decade, when\n######################\nOutput:"}}

A particularly noteworthy event in Messner's career and theorizing came in 1919 when he was tasked to run a newspaper, Voluntary Effort, to support the Whites, which Messner recalled as his first step toward specializing in propaganda (Domnin 2005, 24) . In 1921, Messner settled in Belgrade, where he taught, wrote, and became a professor of military science. However, in the spring of 1945, when Soviet and Allied forces approached, Messner fled to Argentina (Domnin 2005, 38) , where he published his most notable works, Lik sovremmeny voiny (The face of modern war) in 1959, Myatezh-imya tretyey vsemirnoy (Subversion-the name of the third worldwide war) in 1960, and Vsemirnaya myatezhvoina (Worldwide subversion-war). Messner's theorizing centered on the concept of myatezhvoina, literally translated as \"mutiny, \" \"insurgency, \" or \"rebellion. \" However, as Messner was referring to myatezhvoina as distinct from guerrilla warfare and referred to eroding moral and societal cohesion\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Confusion has amplified the anxiety about the novel Russian modus operandi and the strategic theory that underlies it. In Ukraine, Syria and the Baltics, Moscow practised coercion by merging military and non-military forms of influence across nuclear, conventional and informational (cyber) domains. Western experts have been impressed and concerned by the scale of application and effectiveness of the Russian approach, which this article dubs 'cross-domain coercion', and have made its understanding essential for international policy and theory. What is the mechanism of the Russian art of coercion? How innovative and unique is it? How does the Russian case inform formal models of deterrence? These are the questions this article addresses.\nCross-domain coercion is the recent evolution in the Russian art of strategy, and one of the instruments of Russian policy. It evolved through three waves of intellectual activity, and out of the continuous effort by the Russian strategic community to transform itself in accordance with its understanding of the changing character of war. The first wave focused on nuclear deterrence, the second scrutinised conventional deterrence and the third explored informational (cyber) deterrence. Eventually, three waves merged into the current cross-domain coercion vision. Chronologically, this evolution had two periods.

However, the long-term lack of attention to Russian military thought made hybrid warfare and the Gerasimov doctrine the bedrock for debates on understanding Russia (Monaghan 2016b, 66) . The key theme in all concepts was that they were introduced to capture the successful Russian conduct in Ukraine with a combination of military and nonmilitary means and especially the use of information warfare (NATO 2014; EEAS 2015; Lasconjarias and Larsen 2015; IISS 2015; R\u00e1cz 2015; Hunter and Pernik 2015; Chivvis 2017) . The initial outburst of analysis gave way in turn to a second wave, which to a large degree focused on explaining why these concepts were wrong (Galeotti 2016a; Giles 2016a; Renz 2016a; Charap 2015; Thomas 2016a; Bartles 2016a; Galeotti 2018b; Freedman 2014; Kofman and Rojansky 2015) .\nHow war is changing is a perennial topic in military theory.

He stated that war has been \"understood as the continuation of politics by means of armed violence\" and that this was how war is interpreted in the law On Defense (Gareyev 2017 ). However, Gareyev saw that \"now, when the scope and technological opportunities of nonmilitary means of confrontation have significantly expanded, it is increasingly being asked whether their use means aggression\" (Gareyev 2017) . Therefore, Gareyev argued that wartime laws, or their interpretation, needed to be changed (Gareyev 2017) .\nGareyev saw that scholars in the Russian debate had started to divide the definition of war into the traditional one-the use of armed violence (nasiliya)and the nontraditional one, which involved nonmilitary means (Gareyev 2017 ; see also Gareyev 2018) . Therefore, Gareyev called for a clarification of the definition of the essence of war, which should be done together by the Academy of Military Sciences and the Foreign Ministry, whose results were to be sent to the UN (Gareyev 2017) . Gareyev saw that the reasons for these military threats was that nuclear weapons had become an impediment for large-scale war and that, \"therefore, the\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He restated his view from 2014 that color revolutions were the main means for foreign powers to pursue their interests. He also made an explicit connection between the protest potential of the population (which the Military Doctrine mentions frequently) and color revolutions (which the doctrine does not mention). It is also notable that the term \"hybrid warfare\" had entered the Russian discussion after its popularity in the West (e.g., see Kartapolov 2015 and Chekinov and Bogdanov 2016 ; see chapter 1). Last, Gerasimov's statement that \"information resources have become one of the most effective weapons\" is a consequential one and notable in relation to whether information should be seen as violent or not.\nA study in the use of different concepts, with a focus on hybrid warfare, was done by Igor Nikolaychuk, head of the regional security center at RISS. He saw that hybrid wars included a number of different themes, such as \"the use of chaos theory . . . , controlled chaos in international politics, the activities to change political regimes in different countries, and the preparation and implementation of 'color revolutions'\" (Nikolaychuk 2016, 88) . Nikolaychuk measured how many times different versions of war were mentioned on RUNET (the Russophone Internet) in the period 2007-15. The type of war mentioned the most was cold war, followed by information war and nuclear\n######################\nOutput:"}}

A particularly noteworthy event in Messner's career and theorizing came in 1919 when he was tasked to run a newspaper, Voluntary Effort, to support the Whites, which Messner recalled as his first step toward specializing in propaganda (Domnin 2005, 24) . In 1921, Messner settled in Belgrade, where he taught, wrote, and became a professor of military science. However, in the spring of 1945, when Soviet and Allied forces approached, Messner fled to Argentina (Domnin 2005, 38) , where he published his most notable works, Lik sovremmeny voiny (The face of modern war) in 1959, Myatezh-imya tretyey vsemirnoy (Subversion-the name of the third worldwide war) in 1960, and Vsemirnaya myatezhvoina (Worldwide subversion-war). Messner's theorizing centered on the concept of myatezhvoina, literally translated as \"mutiny, \" \"insurgency, \" or \"rebellion. \" However, as Messner was referring to myatezhvoina as distinct from guerrilla warfare and referred to eroding moral and societal cohesion\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Indeed, he was compared to Gareyev and Gerasimov in terms of prominence in Thomas's study on Russian theorists' views of the nature of war (Thomas 2016b, 3) . Second, he referred to indirect action as a new type of war, discussed in parallel with what he called \"classical\" war, in agreement with Chekinov and Bogdanov. This also resembles what Gerasimov called the adaptive approach to the use of force. Third, he emphasized the key role of information operations, especially online information, while drawing a direct connection between them and color revolutions. In this way, he has continued Gerasimov's argument, seeing nonmilitary means as more important than military, but he is more specific in saying that propaganda and information operations are the most important.\nChekinov and Bogdanov wrote an article in 2015 in which they argued, along with the traditional, Clausewitzian understanding of war, that \"the substance of future wars, indeed their basic attribute-warfare involving the use of arms-has not\n######################\nOutput:"}}

However, the long-term lack of attention to Russian military thought made hybrid warfare and the Gerasimov doctrine the bedrock for debates on understanding Russia (Monaghan 2016b, 66) . The key theme in all concepts was that they were introduced to capture the successful Russian conduct in Ukraine with a combination of military and nonmilitary means and especially the use of information warfare (NATO 2014; EEAS 2015; Lasconjarias and Larsen 2015; IISS 2015; R\u00e1cz 2015; Hunter and Pernik 2015; Chivvis 2017) . The initial outburst of analysis gave way in turn to a second wave, which to a large degree focused on explaining why these concepts were wrong (Galeotti 2016a; Giles 2016a; Renz 2016a; Charap 2015; Thomas 2016a; Bartles 2016a; Galeotti 2018b; Freedman 2014; Kofman and Rojansky 2015) .\nHow war is changing is a perennial topic in military theory.

After the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Russian government's criticism of the West grew stronger. On December 23, 2004three days before the rerun of the second round of voting in the Ukrainian presidential elections, in which Viktor Yushchenko was elected president-Putin held his end-of-year press conference. In it, he criticized the double standards of the United States and the EU in propagating democracy and human rights but not supporting the Serbs in Kosovo, the Albanians in Macedonia, or the ethnic Russians in Latvia (Putin 2004 ). Putin criticized the promotion of democracy by the US and EU as selective and instrumental, but he did not accuse them of creating the revolution. However, he stated that \"the most dangerous [thing] . . . is the creation of a system of permanent revolutions\" (Putin 2004) .\nThree weeks later, on January 13, 2005, Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov also criticized the West for double standards in its Ukrainian policy.\nIn his view, the Western nations had stated that they would acknowledge the election only if \"their\" candidate won. Ivanov felt that \"in regard to a sovereign state . . . [such statements] are fraught with the most grave consequences. The entire history demonstrates that democracy cannot be imposed upon from the outside\" (Ivanov 2005) . He also stated that the importance of the CIS states to Russia is \"why we react and will\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He stated that war has been \"understood as the continuation of politics by means of armed violence\" and that this was how war is interpreted in the law On Defense (Gareyev 2017 ). However, Gareyev saw that \"now, when the scope and technological opportunities of nonmilitary means of confrontation have significantly expanded, it is increasingly being asked whether their use means aggression\" (Gareyev 2017) . Therefore, Gareyev argued that wartime laws, or their interpretation, needed to be changed (Gareyev 2017) .\nGareyev saw that scholars in the Russian debate had started to divide the definition of war into the traditional one-the use of armed violence (nasiliya)and the nontraditional one, which involved nonmilitary means (Gareyev 2017 ; see also Gareyev 2018) . Therefore, Gareyev called for a clarification of the definition of the essence of war, which should be done together by the Academy of Military Sciences and the Foreign Ministry, whose results were to be sent to the UN (Gareyev 2017) . Gareyev saw that the reasons for these military threats was that nuclear weapons had become an impediment for large-scale war and that, \"therefore, the\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He restated his view from 2014 that color revolutions were the main means for foreign powers to pursue their interests. He also made an explicit connection between the protest potential of the population (which the Military Doctrine mentions frequently) and color revolutions (which the doctrine does not mention). It is also notable that the term \"hybrid warfare\" had entered the Russian discussion after its popularity in the West (e.g., see Kartapolov 2015 and Chekinov and Bogdanov 2016 ; see chapter 1). Last, Gerasimov's statement that \"information resources have become one of the most effective weapons\" is a consequential one and notable in relation to whether information should be seen as violent or not.\nA study in the use of different concepts, with a focus on hybrid warfare, was done by Igor Nikolaychuk, head of the regional security center at RISS. He saw that hybrid wars included a number of different themes, such as \"the use of chaos theory . . . , controlled chaos in international politics, the activities to change political regimes in different countries, and the preparation and implementation of 'color revolutions'\" (Nikolaychuk 2016, 88) . Nikolaychuk measured how many times different versions of war were mentioned on RUNET (the Russophone Internet) in the period 2007-15.

The most interesting part of Korybko's general argument is that he stated that he is creating a new theory of warfare. This theory rested on two ideas: the nonviolent or \"soft\" overthrow via color revolutions and the violent overthrow of unconventional warfare.

Holismstarting from the whole and then analyzing how the different components fit into it-is something the veteran Soviet military analysts Harriet and William Scott say persisted throughout the Soviet era (Scott and Scott 1988, 288) .\nThe second point, which ties in with the first, is that Soviet military science was scientific because of the strict reliance on formal philosophy in the form of dialectical materialism as a guide to action and development (Fedotoff-White 1936, 321) . Western analysts were often led astray when analyzing Soviet military thought because they gave too little attention to the philosophy that Soviet military science relied on (Scott and Scott 1982, 28) . Materialism started with Hegelian dialectics but was modified by Marx and Engels, who discarded Georg Hegel's idealistic metaphysics (Somerville 1945, 24) . The three basic laws of dialectical materialism can be summarized as follows: \"The law of strife and unity of opposites (that is, things are in a continuous process of change because they are made up of opposing forces or elements); the law of transformation of quantity to quality . . . and the law of negation of negation (each qualitative stage becomes negated by a further development\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He restated his view from 2014 that color revolutions were the main means for foreign powers to pursue their interests. He also made an explicit connection between the protest potential of the population (which the Military Doctrine mentions frequently) and color revolutions (which the doctrine does not mention). It is also notable that the term \"hybrid warfare\" had entered the Russian discussion after its popularity in the West (e.g., see Kartapolov 2015 and Chekinov and Bogdanov 2016 ; see chapter 1). Last, Gerasimov's statement that \"information resources have become one of the most effective weapons\" is a consequential one and notable in relation to whether information should be seen as violent or not.\nA study in the use of different concepts, with a focus on hybrid warfare, was done by Igor Nikolaychuk, head of the regional security center at RISS. He saw that hybrid wars included a number of different themes, such as \"the use of chaos theory . . . , controlled chaos in international politics, the activities to change political regimes in different countries, and the preparation and implementation of 'color revolutions'\" (Nikolaychuk 2016, 88) . Nikolaychuk measured how many times different versions of war were mentioned on RUNET (the Russophone Internet) in the period 2007-15. The type of war mentioned the most was cold war, followed by information war and nuclear\n######################\nOutput:"}}

US target selection remains a driving factor, as does the choice to widen or reduce the actual scope of any potential war.\nSimilarly, knowing and understanding the psychological elements of adversary strategy, such as deterrence by intimidation, can help reduce the coercive effect of such actions during a threatened period of conflict resultant from a political or military crisis. Much of the Russian theory behind single or grouped strikes, and inflicting dosed damage, does not rest so much on the material damage caused as on the psychological effect it will have on adversary's leadership and the population. This is especially relevant in an alliance context, as the damage applied is meant to create cascade effects on a coalition by targeting specific members. Hence, both damage to the target and damage to its role within a coalition are calibrated.\nMuch can also be done in how the US chooses to engage Russian counterparts on this subject. Telling the opponent that their strategy won't work, or is dangerous because of the potential for uncontrolled escalation, is likely to confirm their thinking about the benefits of such stratagems. An informed dialogue, that reflects knowledge of the calculus behind Russian planning, may serve better in shaping the other side's confidence levels.\nIn thinking about escalation management, it does not appear that the Russian military is articulating a theory of victory in the same way that US doctrine envisions defeating an adversary.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

For Russia to meet this hybrid war or adaptive approach, Korybko called for \"civilisational safeguards. \" He saw that the strongest deterrent needed to involve the citizens in a project larger than themselves and to encourage them to identify with their government (Korybko 2015, 75) . Therefore, \"the strong promotion of patriotic (in the sense of national or civilizational) ideas by the state and its affiliated NGOs can lead to the eventual creation of a progovernment hive mind that can engage in counter swarms against any enemy insurgents\" (Korybko 2015, 75) .\nIt is noteworthy that Korybko suggested that patriotism and prostate ideas would be an antidote to color revolutions, especially as the public security doctrines had put increasing emphasis on patriotism and the Russian state's role in promoting social cohesion. The most interesting part of Korybko's general argument is that he stated that he is creating a new theory of warfare. This theory rested on two ideas: the nonviolent or \"soft\" overthrow via color revolutions and the violent overthrow of unconventional warfare. Korybko also saw an inverse relationship between the traditional application of direct warfare and indirect means.

However, the encyclopedia also emphasized the role of other means in war while maintaining the principal emphasis on armed force: \"In war the armed forces are used as the main and decisive means, as well as economic, diplomatic, ideological and other means of struggle\" (Grechko and Ogarkov 1976, 361) . Thus, Lenin's view remained, even if the definition expanded to include nonmilitary means of war in some senses. The 1986 military encyclopedia (Voyennyy entsiklopedicheskiy slovar) defined armed struggle as \"the main form of struggle in a war, its specific substance consists in organized employment of armed forces for the attainment of certain political and military ends. It represents a set of military actions of varying scope\" (quoted in Kalistratov 2004, 150-51) .\nIn this definition, armed struggle held a prominent role, and one could assume that if armed struggle was the main method, it was also the defining one. However, the definition does not explicitly dismiss the role of nonmilitary means, as the discussions in the 1960s did. Military theorists B. K. Kanevsky and P. N. Shabardin argued that war was not solely an armed confrontation but rather included nonmilitary means such as economic, diplomatic, intelligence, technological, and ideological to support armed conflict (Kanevsky and Sh\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In this way, Galeotti saw hybrid war in the sense used by Mattis and Hoffman, which has occurred in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. That hybrid warfare was also coupled with political war, seen as \"the pure use of political methods to bring about desired changes in the policy in another state\" (Galeotti 2016a, 7) . A large part of the conceptual confusion stems from the fact that both of these were run in parallel (Galeotti 2016a, 7) .\nThe separation into hybrid war and political war is a helpful conceptual solution, but there are also problems with the term \"political war\" (setting aside those with hybrid war). Political war was famously used by George Kennan at the outset of the Cold War against the Soviet Union when he called for \"the employment of all the means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives\" (Kennan 1948) . This emphasizes the problem at the center of the term. As argued by Hoffman, \"If all wars are political\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Holismstarting from the whole and then analyzing how the different components fit into it-is something the veteran Soviet military analysts Harriet and William Scott say persisted throughout the Soviet era (Scott and Scott 1988, 288) .\nThe second point, which ties in with the first, is that Soviet military science was scientific because of the strict reliance on formal philosophy in the form of dialectical materialism as a guide to action and development (Fedotoff-White 1936, 321) . Western analysts were often led astray when analyzing Soviet military thought because they gave too little attention to the philosophy that Soviet military science relied on (Scott and Scott 1982, 28) . Materialism started with Hegelian dialectics but was modified by Marx and Engels, who discarded Georg Hegel's idealistic metaphysics (Somerville 1945, 24) . The three basic laws of dialectical materialism can be summarized as follows: \"The law of strife and unity of opposites (that is, things are in a continuous process of change because they are made up of opposing forces or elements); the law of transformation of quantity to quality . . . and the law of negation of negation (each qualitative stage becomes negated by a further development\n######################\nOutput:"}}

He restated his view from 2014 that color revolutions were the main means for foreign powers to pursue their interests. He also made an explicit connection between the protest potential of the population (which the Military Doctrine mentions frequently) and color revolutions (which the doctrine does not mention). It is also notable that the term \"hybrid warfare\" had entered the Russian discussion after its popularity in the West (e.g., see Kartapolov 2015 and Chekinov and Bogdanov 2016 ; see chapter 1). Last, Gerasimov's statement that \"information resources have become one of the most effective weapons\" is a consequential one and notable in relation to whether information should be seen as violent or not.\nA study in the use of different concepts, with a focus on hybrid warfare, was done by Igor Nikolaychuk, head of the regional security center at RISS. He saw that hybrid wars included a number of different themes, such as \"the use of chaos theory . . . , controlled chaos in international politics, the activities to change political regimes in different countries, and the preparation and implementation of 'color revolutions'\" (Nikolaychuk 2016, 88) . Nikolaychuk measured how many times different versions of war were mentioned on RUNET (the Russophone Internet) in the period 2007-15. The type of war mentioned the most was cold war, followed by information war and nuclear\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Therefore, the priority was to prepare for a war like that in the former Yugoslavia and develop a reconnaissance-strike system (Slipchenko 2005, 31) . This depended on support from information means to determine the opponent's location, physically disable its communications, and win the information-psychological war in the media (Slipchenko 2005, 33) . The information component and high-precision weapons were the two pillars of noncontact warfare (Slipchenko 2002b) .

US target selection remains a driving factor, as does the choice to widen or reduce the actual scope of any potential war.\nSimilarly, knowing and understanding the psychological elements of adversary strategy, such as deterrence by intimidation, can help reduce the coercive effect of such actions during a threatened period of conflict resultant from a political or military crisis. Much of the Russian theory behind single or grouped strikes, and inflicting dosed damage, does not rest so much on the material damage caused as on the psychological effect it will have on adversary's leadership and the population. This is especially relevant in an alliance context, as the damage applied is meant to create cascade effects on a coalition by targeting specific members. Hence, both damage to the target and damage to its role within a coalition are calibrated.\nMuch can also be done in how the US chooses to engage Russian counterparts on this subject. Telling the opponent that their strategy won't work, or is dangerous because of the potential for uncontrolled escalation, is likely to confirm their thinking about the benefits of such stratagems. An informed dialogue, that reflects knowledge of the calculus behind Russian planning, may serve better in shaping the other side's confidence levels.\nIn thinking about escalation management, it does not appear that the Russian military is articulating a theory of victory in the same way that US doctrine envisions defeating an adversary.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

For Russia to meet this hybrid war or adaptive approach, Korybko called for \"civilisational safeguards. \" He saw that the strongest deterrent needed to involve the citizens in a project larger than themselves and to encourage them to identify with their government (Korybko 2015, 75) . Therefore, \"the strong promotion of patriotic (in the sense of national or civilizational) ideas by the state and its affiliated NGOs can lead to the eventual creation of a progovernment hive mind that can engage in counter swarms against any enemy insurgents\" (Korybko 2015, 75) .\nIt is noteworthy that Korybko suggested that patriotism and prostate ideas would be an antidote to color revolutions, especially as the public security doctrines had put increasing emphasis on patriotism and the Russian state's role in promoting social cohesion. The most interesting part of Korybko's general argument is that he stated that he is creating a new theory of warfare. This theory rested on two ideas: the nonviolent or \"soft\" overthrow via color revolutions and the violent overthrow of unconventional warfare. Korybko also saw an inverse relationship between the traditional application of direct warfare and indirect means. He stated that \"the closer that US destabilization operations get towards their targeted cores (Russia, Iran, China),\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Nonetheless, he continued that the military threat needed to be viewed holistically with means other than armed force to achieve military-political goals (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . Kvachkov then proposed a classification of war that aimed to remedy the failures of theory presented above. It entailed a subdivision of war into \"war with the use of armed warfare\" and \"war with nonmilitary means\" (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . Of the nonmilitary means, he mentioned information, economic, financial, diplomatic, and cultural, giving particular weight to information means. While discussing the argument that the Cold War was the first information world war, he saw that \"a new type of war has emerged, in which armed warfare has given up its decisive place in the achievement of the military and political objectives of war to another kind of warfare-information warfare\" (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . Interestingly, Kvachkov landed on a conclusion similar to Serebryannikov's. On the one hand, he maintained that the essence of war remained as Clausewitz had defined it. On the other, he criticized this very understanding of armed violence as the defining factor of war and proposed a definition whereby war could be perpetrated solely by nonmilitary means.\nDuring the 2000s, Gareyev maintained his traditional view of primary importance given to armed\n######################\nOutput:"}}

However, the encyclopedia also emphasized the role of other means in war while maintaining the principal emphasis on armed force: \"In war the armed forces are used as the main and decisive means, as well as economic, diplomatic, ideological and other means of struggle\" (Grechko and Ogarkov 1976, 361) . Thus, Lenin's view remained, even if the definition expanded to include nonmilitary means of war in some senses. The 1986 military encyclopedia (Voyennyy entsiklopedicheskiy slovar) defined armed struggle as \"the main form of struggle in a war, its specific substance consists in organized employment of armed forces for the attainment of certain political and military ends. It represents a set of military actions of varying scope\" (quoted in Kalistratov 2004, 150-51) .\nIn this definition, armed struggle held a prominent role, and one could assume that if armed struggle was the main method, it was also the defining one. However, the definition does not explicitly dismiss the role of nonmilitary means, as the discussions in the 1960s did. Military theorists B. K. Kanevsky and P. N.

In this way, Galeotti saw hybrid war in the sense used by Mattis and Hoffman, which has occurred in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. That hybrid warfare was also coupled with political war, seen as \"the pure use of political methods to bring about desired changes in the policy in another state\" (Galeotti 2016a, 7) . A large part of the conceptual confusion stems from the fact that both of these were run in parallel (Galeotti 2016a, 7) .\nThe separation into hybrid war and political war is a helpful conceptual solution, but there are also problems with the term \"political war\" (setting aside those with hybrid war). Political war was famously used by George Kennan at the outset of the Cold War against the Soviet Union when he called for \"the employment of all the means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives\" (Kennan 1948) . This emphasizes the problem at the center of the term. As argued by Hoffman, \"If all wars are political\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Western analysts were often led astray when analyzing Soviet military thought because they gave too little attention to the philosophy that Soviet military science relied on (Scott and Scott 1982, 28) . Materialism started with Hegelian dialectics but was modified by Marx and Engels, who discarded Georg Hegel's idealistic metaphysics (Somerville 1945, 24) . The three basic laws of dialectical materialism can be summarized as follows: \"The law of strife and unity of opposites (that is, things are in a continuous process of change because they are made up of opposing forces or elements); the law of transformation of quantity to quality . . . and the law of negation of negation (each qualitative stage becomes negated by a further development\n######################\nOutput:"}}

However, the long-term lack of attention to Russian military thought made hybrid warfare and the Gerasimov doctrine the bedrock for debates on understanding Russia (Monaghan 2016b, 66) . The key theme in all concepts was that they were introduced to capture the successful Russian conduct in Ukraine with a combination of military and nonmilitary means and especially the use of information warfare (NATO 2014; EEAS 2015; Lasconjarias and Larsen 2015; IISS 2015; R\u00e1cz 2015; Hunter and Pernik 2015; Chivvis 2017) . The initial outburst of analysis gave way in turn to a second wave, which to a large degree focused on explaining why these concepts were wrong (Galeotti 2016a; Giles 2016a; Renz 2016a; Charap 2015; Thomas 2016a; Bartles 2016a; Galeotti 2018b; Freedman 2014; Kofman and Rojansky 2015) .\nHow war is changing is a perennial topic in military theory.

US target selection remains a driving factor, as does the choice to widen or reduce the actual scope of any potential war.\nSimilarly, knowing and understanding the psychological elements of adversary strategy, such as deterrence by intimidation, can help reduce the coercive effect of such actions during a threatened period of conflict resultant from a political or military crisis. Much of the Russian theory behind single or grouped strikes, and inflicting dosed damage, does not rest so much on the material damage caused as on the psychological effect it will have on adversary's leadership and the population. This is especially relevant in an alliance context, as the damage applied is meant to create cascade effects on a coalition by targeting specific members. Hence, both damage to the target and damage to its role within a coalition are calibrated.\nMuch can also be done in how the US chooses to engage Russian counterparts on this subject. Telling the opponent that their strategy won't work, or is dangerous because of the potential for uncontrolled escalation, is likely to confirm their thinking about the benefits of such stratagems. An informed dialogue, that reflects knowledge of the calculus behind Russian planning, may serve better in shaping the other side's confidence levels.\nIn thinking about escalation management, it does not appear that the Russian military is articulating a theory of victory in the same way that US doctrine envisions defeating an adversary.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The most interesting part of Korybko's general argument is that he stated that he is creating a new theory of warfare. This theory rested on two ideas: the nonviolent or \"soft\" overthrow via color revolutions and the violent overthrow of unconventional warfare. Korybko also saw an inverse relationship between the traditional application of direct warfare and indirect means. He stated that \"the closer that US destabilization operations get towards their targeted cores (Russia, Iran, China),\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Nonetheless, he continued that the military threat needed to be viewed holistically with means other than armed force to achieve military-political goals (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . Kvachkov then proposed a classification of war that aimed to remedy the failures of theory presented above. It entailed a subdivision of war into \"war with the use of armed warfare\" and \"war with nonmilitary means\" (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . Of the nonmilitary means, he mentioned information, economic, financial, diplomatic, and cultural, giving particular weight to information means. While discussing the argument that the Cold War was the first information world war, he saw that \"a new type of war has emerged, in which armed warfare has given up its decisive place in the achievement of the military and political objectives of war to another kind of warfare-information warfare\" (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . Interestingly, Kvachkov landed on a conclusion similar to Serebryannikov's. On the one hand, he maintained that the essence of war remained as Clausewitz had defined it. On the other, he criticized this very understanding of armed violence as the defining factor of war and proposed a definition whereby war could be perpetrated solely by nonmilitary means.\nDuring the 2000s, Gareyev maintained his traditional view of primary importance given to armed\n######################\nOutput:"}}

However, the encyclopedia also emphasized the role of other means in war while maintaining the principal emphasis on armed force: \"In war the armed forces are used as the main and decisive means, as well as economic, diplomatic, ideological and other means of struggle\" (Grechko and Ogarkov 1976, 361) . Thus, Lenin's view remained, even if the definition expanded to include nonmilitary means of war in some senses. The 1986 military encyclopedia (Voyennyy entsiklopedicheskiy slovar) defined armed struggle as \"the main form of struggle in a war, its specific substance consists in organized employment of armed forces for the attainment of certain political and military ends. It represents a set of military actions of varying scope\" (quoted in Kalistratov 2004, 150-51) .\nIn this definition, armed struggle held a prominent role, and one could assume that if armed struggle was the main method, it was also the defining one. However, the definition does not explicitly dismiss the role of nonmilitary means, as the discussions in the 1960s did. Military theorists B. K. Kanevsky and P. N. Shabardin argued that war was not solely an armed confrontation but rather included nonmilitary means such as economic, diplomatic, intelligence, technological, and ideological to support armed conflict (Kanevsky and Sh\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In response to a question from Rasin as to whether Clausewitz was obsolete, Stalin criticized the premise of the question. In Stalin's view, Lenin had used the parts of Clausewitz-the relation of politics and war, how politics engender war, and war as a continuation of politics by violence-already present in Marxist theory (Stalin 1946) . In Stalin's view, Lenin \"not as a military expert, but as a politician . . . used the works of Clausewitz\" to gain support for the view of the role of war and politics (Stalin 1946) . Therefore, Stalin did not go against Lenin's reliance on Clausewitz; rather he accepted it and justified it as if they were already a part of Marxist theory from the start.\nEager to distinguish Soviet military theory from Western, Byely et al. (1972) restated and amplified the difference between Clausewitz's definition and Lenin's, cautioning that seeing the Marxist-Leninist view of the essence of war as identical to Clausewitz would be \"a gross error\" (7). They saw that Clausewitz denied the class nature of conflict and societies by assuming that politics represented the interest of society. In this way, they argued (like Lenin) that Clausewitz fallaciously understood politics only as foreign policy. On the contrary, war was foremost the continuation of domestic politics in the Marxist\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Western analysts were often led astray when analyzing Soviet military thought because they gave too little attention to the philosophy that Soviet military science relied on (Scott and Scott 1982, 28) . Materialism started with Hegelian dialectics but was modified by Marx and Engels, who discarded Georg Hegel's idealistic metaphysics (Somerville 1945, 24) . The three basic laws of dialectical materialism can be summarized as follows: \"The law of strife and unity of opposites (that is, things are in a continuous process of change because they are made up of opposing forces or elements); the law of transformation of quantity to quality . . . and the law of negation of negation (each qualitative stage becomes negated by a further development\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The key theme in all concepts was that they were introduced to capture the successful Russian conduct in Ukraine with a combination of military and nonmilitary means and especially the use of information warfare (NATO 2014; EEAS 2015; Lasconjarias and Larsen 2015; IISS 2015; R\u00e1cz 2015; Hunter and Pernik 2015; Chivvis 2017) . The initial outburst of analysis gave way in turn to a second wave, which to a large degree focused on explaining why these concepts were wrong (Galeotti 2016a; Giles 2016a; Renz 2016a; Charap 2015; Thomas 2016a; Bartles 2016a; Galeotti 2018b; Freedman 2014; Kofman and Rojansky 2015) .\nHow war is changing is a perennial topic in military theory. However, few Western studies have engaged in depth with how the Russian understanding is changing. Rather, it seems that\n######################\nOutput:"}}

However, the encyclopedia also emphasized the role of other means in war while maintaining the principal emphasis on armed force: \"In war the armed forces are used as the main and decisive means, as well as economic, diplomatic, ideological and other means of struggle\" (Grechko and Ogarkov 1976, 361) . Thus, Lenin's view remained, even if the definition expanded to include nonmilitary means of war in some senses. The 1986 military encyclopedia (Voyennyy entsiklopedicheskiy slovar) defined armed struggle as \"the main form of struggle in a war, its specific substance consists in organized employment of armed forces for the attainment of certain political and military ends. It represents a set of military actions of varying scope\" (quoted in Kalistratov 2004, 150-51) .\nIn this definition, armed struggle held a prominent role, and one could assume that if armed struggle was the main method, it was also the defining one. However, the definition does not explicitly dismiss the role of nonmilitary means, as the discussions in the 1960s did. Military theorists B. K. Kanevsky and P. N. Shabardin argued that war was not solely an armed confrontation but rather included nonmilitary means such as economic, diplomatic, intelligence, technological, and ideological to support armed conflict (Kanevsky and Sh\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Both of these are understood as nonviolent but are seen as so effective that they could amount to violence and blur the boundary between war and peace. Nonviolent color revolutions, largely depending on information warfare, are seen as the West's main approach to the use of force. In the view of Russian elites, the threat perception includes the content of information, which makes the understanding of information warfare very broad. This has led several key members of the elite, such as President Putin and Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov, to declare that Russia is in an information war perpetrated by the West.\nInformation warfare is intrinsically linked to the Russian perception of color revolutions. Color revolutions refer to the nonviolent revolutions in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan in the mid-2000s but have in the Russian mind expanded to include the Arab Spring uprisings as well. Color revolutions are seen to consist of the destabilization of a targeted society with the spread of values and brainwashing of the population so that it will ultimately take to the streets and revolt against its leadership. Color revolutions have grown from being seen as mostly spontaneous uprisings (albeit with foreign support) to a form of warfare orchestrated by the West. After 2014, color revolutions were understood as the West's main geopolitical tool to achieve its political objectives and as a form of warfare (Gerasimov 2014a) .

Holismstarting from the whole and then analyzing how the different components fit into it-is something the veteran Soviet military analysts Harriet and William Scott say persisted throughout the Soviet era (Scott and Scott 1988, 288) .\nThe second point, which ties in with the first, is that Soviet military science was scientific because of the strict reliance on formal philosophy in the form of dialectical materialism as a guide to action and development (Fedotoff-White 1936, 321) . Western analysts were often led astray when analyzing Soviet military thought because they gave too little attention to the philosophy that Soviet military science relied on (Scott and Scott 1982, 28) . Materialism started with Hegelian dialectics but was modified by Marx and Engels, who discarded Georg Hegel's idealistic metaphysics (Somerville 1945, 24) . The three basic laws of dialectical materialism can be summarized as follows: \"The law of strife and unity of opposites (that is, things are in a continuous process of change because they are made up of opposing forces or elements); the law of transformation of quantity to quality . . . and the law of negation of negation (each qualitative stage becomes negated by a further development\n######################\nOutput:"}}

However, the long-term lack of attention to Russian military thought made hybrid warfare and the Gerasimov doctrine the bedrock for debates on understanding Russia (Monaghan 2016b, 66) . The key theme in all concepts was that they were introduced to capture the successful Russian conduct in Ukraine with a combination of military and nonmilitary means and especially the use of information warfare (NATO 2014; EEAS 2015; Lasconjarias and Larsen 2015; IISS 2015; R\u00e1cz 2015; Hunter and Pernik 2015; Chivvis 2017) . The initial outburst of analysis gave way in turn to a second wave, which to a large degree focused on explaining why these concepts were wrong (Galeotti 2016a; Giles 2016a; Renz 2016a; Charap 2015; Thomas 2016a; Bartles 2016a; Galeotti 2018b; Freedman 2014; Kofman and Rojansky 2015) .\nHow war is changing is a perennial topic in military theory.

This type of war was seen to include the use of special forces and the protest potential of the local population, supported by information warfare, to create a permanently operating front on the territory of the enemy state (Gerasimov 2013 ). Gerasimov echoed this in a later speech during 2014. He saw the increasing importance of political, economic, diplomatic, and other measures, as well as the demonstration of hidden measures, such as the use of NGOs and private military companies in Syria and Ukraine and Greenpeace activities in the Arctic (Gerasimov 2014a ).\nGerasimov's speech is notable for three reasons. First, he is the highestranking officer in the Russian Armed Forces, and the General Staff leads the military-theoretical debate. This makes him the utmost authority on militarytheoretical matters. Second, Gerasimov's view of war argued what Gareyev only hinted at. If well-\n######################\nOutput:"}}

However, the encyclopedia also emphasized the role of other means in war while maintaining the principal emphasis on armed force: \"In war the armed forces are used as the main and decisive means, as well as economic, diplomatic, ideological and other means of struggle\" (Grechko and Ogarkov 1976, 361) . Thus, Lenin's view remained, even if the definition expanded to include nonmilitary means of war in some senses. The 1986 military encyclopedia (Voyennyy entsiklopedicheskiy slovar) defined armed struggle as \"the main form of struggle in a war, its specific substance consists in organized employment of armed forces for the attainment of certain political and military ends. It represents a set of military actions of varying scope\" (quoted in Kalistratov 2004, 150-51) .\nIn this definition, armed struggle held a prominent role, and one could assume that if armed struggle was the main method, it was also the defining one. However, the definition does not explicitly dismiss the role of nonmilitary means, as the discussions in the 1960s did. Military theorists B. K. Kanevsky and P. N. Shabardin argued that war was not solely an armed confrontation but rather included nonmilitary means such as economic, diplomatic, intelligence, technological, and ideological to support armed conflict (Kanevsky and Sh\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Putin then stated that mutual US-Russia understanding was not helped \"by regular US attempts to engage in 'political engineering, ' including in regions that are traditionally important to us and during Russian elections\" (Putin 2012c) . It is noteworthy that Putin equated soft power with the outbreak of color revolutions.\nThe Euromaidan protests and the fall of Yanukovych increased the significance of the color revolutions. Putin saw the protests as another achievement of \"controlled 'color' revolutions\" (Putin 2014a ). After the annexation of Crimea, Putin stated that the people's \"feelings were taken advantage of cynically. Standards were imposed on these nations that did not in any way correspond to their way of life, traditions or these people's cultures\" (Putin 2014a ). Furthermore, he argued that \"our Western partners have crossed the line\" (Putin 2014a ). Thus, he emphasized the color revolutions as a pattern and foreign values as part of color revolutions.
