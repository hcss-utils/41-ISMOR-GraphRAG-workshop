It seeks to combine conventional and unconventional capabilities, backed by nuclear capabilities, to swiftly win an armed-conflict before substantial reinforcements can arrive in South Korea. Taking lessons from Hezbollah's hybrid warfare in Lebanon in 2006 and Russia's hybrid warfare in Ukraine in 2014, North Korea is likely to utilize hybrid warfare in future conflicts with increased complexity, due to its ties with Russia and Hezbollah, capabilities, and intention. Meanwhile, Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), the US Army's future war concept, seek to deter and defeat future adversaries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea by optimizing combat power in multiple domains. This thesis examines if the MDO concept can be a viable future war concept for the ROK military in countering North Korean hybrid warfare. The thesis concludes that the MDO concept is both suitable and feasible, but not acceptable, mainly due to excessive budget demands, thus making it not fully viable; however, the ROK should continue pursuing the integration of operations across multiple domains. \nMeanwhile, Multi-D","chunk_id":"8ddf823bc63db4b89282d546707b158a","document_ids":["ac06a4542fd0ed40526ddc68c759e931"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\" \/><\/graphml>"}

In 2006, Israel launched an attack into Lebanese territory. This event, later known as the Second Lebanon War, was in response to a few hostile actions executed by Hezbollah, including rocket fires into Israeli territory and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers. To counter the Israeli forces, Hezbollah used hybrid warfare, incorporating both conventional tactics, such as taking defensive positions with ground forces, and unconventional tactics, including insurgent and psychological tactics. With the international and domestic pressure to end the war, Israel signed an UN-mediated ceasefire agreement without a significant military defeat; Hezbollah seemingly achieved, in their term, \"the Divine Victory\" by utilizing hybrid warfare. \nRussia used hybrid warfare to achieve its political purpose-using a propaganda campaign to divide public opinions in Ukraine, drone technology to call for Multi Launching Rocket System (MLRS) fires, and cyber tactics to disturb Ukrainian information infrastructure-in addition to conventional tactics, such as dispatching Special Forces and mechanized units into Ukrainian territory1 F 2 .
