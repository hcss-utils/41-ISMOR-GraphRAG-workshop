      <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
      <data key="d1">Mikhail Gareyev is a prominent Russian military theorist and expert on military science. He is recognized for his contributions to the understanding of war's evolution, particularly in light of modern non-military means of confrontation.  

Gareyev argues for a traditional definition of war while acknowledging the increasing importance of non-military forms of struggle, such as information warfare and "soft power," which he views as threats to Russia. He emphasizes the need to reevaluate the definition of war in the 21st century due to these evolving threats.  

His book, "Battles on the Military-Historical Front," endorsed by General Gerasimov, reflects Russia's perspective on information warfare. Gareyev has also written extensively about the changing nature of war, including the blurring of lines between military and non-military means, and the significance of moral superiority, technology, and doctrine in modern warfare. He is considered a leading figure in Russian military thought, comparable to Kartapolov and Gerasimov.

He co-authored several articles with Bogdanov, including "The Nature and Content of a New-Generation War," focusing on the nature of modern warfare and arguing that military security is intertwined with other forms of security, particularly information security. 

Chekinov believes that information resources are effective weapons in modern warfare and advocates for the use of propaganda and information operations as key to victory. He also argues that nonmilitary means, such as color revolutions, should be prioritized over traditional military force.  His work explores the impact of informatization and automatization on conventional armed forces and highlights the shifting understanding of war in the contemporary world. Chekinov's ideas are influenced by Slipchenko and he is considered a relevant figure in discussions about modern warfare strategies.

      <data key="d1">Joseph Stalin was a key figure in Soviet military strategy whose ideas remain influential.  He dominated Soviet strategic thought due to his control of both the Communist Party and the military apparatus. Stalin viewed Clausewitz's ideas as already present in Marxist theory, and he criticized the premise that Clausewitz is obsolete, arguing for its relevance in Lenin's thought. His influence extended to the suppression of opposing viewpoints, such as those of Svechin, whose work he placed under restriction. Despite his death marking a potential shift in the relationship between military and political leadership, subordination of the military to political control persisted. Stalin's military art continues to be analyzed and discussed by historians.

      <data key="d1">## Clausewitz: A Military Theorist Whose Ideas Continue to Spark Debate

Clausewitz, a Prussian general and military theorist, is widely recognized for his influential ideas on war. He is best known for his dictum, "war is merely a continuation of politics by other means," which suggests that war is an extension of political objectives pursued through violence. Clausewitz defined war as "an act of force to compel the enemy to do your will," emphasizing the use of force to achieve desired outcomes. 

His work has been both praised and criticized by subsequent military theorists. While some, like Lenin and Stalin, found his emphasis on the relationship between politics and war influential, others, such as Kirshin, Kvachkov, and Orekhov, considered his definition too narrow.  Soviet theorists, while acknowledging Clausewitz's influence, often contrasted his traditional understanding of war with their own Marxist-Leninist perspectives. 

Clausewitz's ideas continue to be debated and analyzed today. His work is referenced in discussions about modern warfare concepts, and his views on achieving victory in war are still considered relevant by military scholars like Gorbunov and Bogdanov. Despite the passage of time, Clausewitz remains a significant figure in military history, whose theories continue to shape our understanding of war and its relationship to politics.

He is a prominent figure in Russian military theory, known for his concept of the "adaptive approach to warfare" and emphasizing non-military means.  Gerasimov argues that the nature of war has changed, with non-military means becoming as important as traditional military force. He believes the lines between war and peace are blurring due to the effectiveness of these non-military tactics, such as "color revolutions," which he views as a new form of warfare instigated by the West. 

Gerasimov's writings and speeches have significantly influenced the understanding of modern warfare, particularly his concept of "hybrid warfare" which combines both military and non-military means. He is considered a key figure in expressing Russia's stance on information warfare and advocates for changes in the laws of war to reflect this evolving landscape.

      <data key="d1">## Lenin: A Revolutionary Redefining War

Lenin is a key figure in Marxist-Leninist theory, renowned for his contributions to shaping the Soviet understanding of war. He is cited as an authority on the militarization of social life under socialism and emphasized the connection between war and revolution.  Lenin viewed war as a necessary instrument for societal transformation and achieving socialism, arguing that imperialist wars are inevitable under capitalism. 

He built upon the ideas of Marx and Engels, incorporating "violent" into the definition of war and defining it as the continuation of politics by violent means. This perspective, while influential, has been critiqued by scholars like Kirshin.  Lenin incorporated Clausewitz's ideas into Marxist theory, appreciating his use of dialectics and agreeing with his view that politics are superior to strategy. He also supported Svechin's similar stance on the primacy of politics over strategy. 

Lenin's early writings serve as a foundational starting point for understanding Soviet military thought. His ideology emphasizes that peace is as much a continuation of politics as war, a notion further highlighted in The Soviet Military Encyclopedia.  His definition of war as an instrument of politics heavily influenced Soviet thought throughout history, even as the definition of war expanded to include non-military means. Lenin's writings on war became foundational for understanding warfare in both the Soviet Union and Russia.

      <data key="d0">"ORGANIZATION"</data>
      <data key="d1">The Soviet Union was a former communist state and a major geopolitical entity that existed from its establishment by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky until its dissolution in 1991. It was a key adversary of the United States during the Cold War, engaging in a nuclear arms race with NATO. The Soviet Union held a distinct understanding of war based on Marxist-Leninist ideology, which was firmly subordinated to the Communist Party. This understanding viewed war as an inevitable tool for accelerating the global communist transformation and as the continuation of class politics by violent means.  

The Soviet Union believed that all wars stemmed from class struggle and that actions could be justified if they furthered the revolutionary process, differing from Western just war theory. They established control over half of Central Europe during World War II and were a major player in both World Wars. The Soviet Union's rise is linked to the revolutionary context. 

The Soviet Union laid the theoretical and methodological foundation for Russian military theory, which persists today.  This foundation was shaped by internal and external threats and heavily influenced by Marxist-Leninist theories about war. The text describes the Soviet Union as the location where understanding of war originated from the Communist Party. It discusses the history and characteristics of military thought within the Soviet Union, its foundational policy and military doctrine, and the nature of war within the context of the Soviet Union.  The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a decline in Western interest in Russian military thought.
