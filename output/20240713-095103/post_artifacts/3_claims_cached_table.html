The doctrine also emphasized the importance of information warfare in modern conflicts. However, those mentions aside, the major focus was on NATO and larger, conventional armed conflict. An analysis of the doctrine concluded that "the ideas presented in the doctrine, especially its focus on NATO as a major challenge and . . . the maintenance of a strong mobilization capability, were very much in line with the thoughts of the traditionalist school" (Bukkvoll 2011, 702).</td>
