The three basic laws of dialectical materialism can be summarized as follows: "The law of strife and unity of opposites (that is, things are in a continuous process of change because they are made up of opposing forces or elements); the law of transformation of quantity to quality . . . and the law of negation of negation (each qualitative stage becomes negated by a further development)" (Somerville 1945, 24) . N. Ya. Sushko and Stefan Tiuskhevich described dialectical materialism and military thought, saying that "the appearance of new means of struggle always brings into being corresponding counter-means, which in the end also lead to changes of military operations. The \'struggle\' of tanks and antitank means, submarines and antisubmarine means, aircraft and antiaircraft defense . . . this is the axis around which revolves the development of military affairs, including the development of methods and forms of armed conflict" (Sushko and Tiuskhevich 1965, 128) .\nDialectical materialism and holism were the foundation for the scientific drive in Soviet military science. In 1917, Lenin decided that all science of war and society needed to be based on Marxism-Leninism (Thomas 2011, 77) .

What is even more striking is that the Soviets were able to place these innovations in a much deeper and broader context, reflecting a far more profound grasp of these developments' implications than the West itself possessed.\n-Dima Adamsky (2010, 32) M any of the particular features of Russian military thought today have roots in Soviet military thought. This is probably unsurprising since the majority of the elites in today's Russia were educated and had their early careers under the Soviet system. The influence, however, goes further. Some of the key debates in contemporary Russia regarding what war is-including the US military's MTR/RMA, which later became network-centric warfare (NCW)-originated in Soviet times. Furthermore, many of the characteristics that set Russian military thought apart from its Western equivalent, such as the reliance on holism and dialectical materialism, were also introduced during the Soviet period. Soviet military theorists and political elites had a different way of approaching military thought, and arguably it was deeper and broader than Western approaches, as the quote above emphasizes.\nThe body of military theory and authoritative views was exceptionally stable throughout the history of the Soviet Union.
