It seeks to combine conventional and unconventional capabilities, backed by nuclear capabilities, to swiftly win an armed-conflict before substantial reinforcements can arrive in South Korea. Taking lessons from Hezbollah's hybrid warfare in Lebanon in 2006 and Russia's hybrid warfare in Ukraine in 2014, North Korea is likely to utilize hybrid warfare in future conflicts with increased complexity, due to its ties with Russia and Hezbollah, capabilities, and intention. Meanwhile, Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), the US Army's future war concept, seek to deter and defeat future adversaries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea by optimizing combat power in multiple domains. This thesis examines if the MDO concept can be a viable future war concept for the ROK military in countering North Korean hybrid warfare. The thesis concludes that the MDO concept is both suitable and feasible, but not acceptable, mainly due to excessive budget demands, thus making it not fully viable; however, the ROK should continue pursuing the integration of operations across multiple domains.\n15.\nMeanwhile, Multi\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She not only endured much without complaint, but also encouraged me to delve more deeply into the subject, so I could become more knowledgeable about the subject. Without her support, I could not have finished the work. I owe much of my accomplishment to her\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She not only endured much without complaint, but also encouraged me to delve more deeply into the subject, so I could become more knowledgeable about the subject. Without her support, I could not have finished the work. I owe much of my accomplishment to her. I am also deeply thankful for my MMAS thesis committee, Mr. Joseph Donalbain, Dr. John Modinger, and LTC Michael Thorpe, for their consistent advice on the structure, logic, and direction of the thesis. They never hesitated to take significant portions of their time to discuss the thesis. I also would like to recognize the Art of War scholars, who, under the guidance of Dr. Dean Nowowiejski, the Ike Skelton Chair of the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), provided me with many insights on how the thesis could be better structured and revised. In 2006, Israel launched an attack into Lebanese territory. This event, later known as the Second Lebanon War, was in response to a few hostile actions executed by Hezbollah, including rocket fires into Israeli territory and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers. To counter the Israeli forces, Hezbollah used hybrid warfare, incorporating both conventional tactics, such as taking defensive positions with ground forces,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Nuclear capabilities often serve as a deterrent to a possible augmentation of additional forces into the theater. The deterrent factor allows the adversary to employ hybrid warfare without external interference, as seen in the case of Russia's operation in Ukraine in 2014. The CFR report analyzes that North Korea's nuclear stockpile is estimated to be between 30 and 60 bombs; the regime seems to have succeeded in testing the Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), capable of reaching the continental United States (See figure \n2\n16\nAnother reason for suspecting the hostile intention of North Korea are the motives revealed by the leaders' comments and speeches. North Korean leaders, at times, published statements that expressed their wishes to unify Korea through force and with their ideology. In a 2014 New Year's address, Kim Jung-Un emphasized that \"external forces must be denounced and the views of our people ourselves must be firmly adhered to.\"2 2F 23 Not many would disagree with the following interpretations: by \"external forces,\" he means the US forces in Korea; by \"our people,\" Kim refers to all Koreans including people in the South; by \"the views,\" he most likely means the socialistic ideology of North Korea.

North Korean military leaders threatened South Korea by saying that they can make Seoul \"a sea of fire\" if they want. This view by the North Korean leaders is a reminder of Russia's hybrid warfare where Russia utilized anti-government activists to use them against the Ukrainian government. In the same way, North Korea will want pro-North Korea activists to lead the revolution when the appropriate time comes. These pieces of evidence show that statements made by the leaders, whether it be by the head of the regime or by the military or party leaders, also contribute significantly to the fact that North Korea possesses the intention to unify the two Koreas under their socialistic ideology.\nNorth Korean hybrid warfare is the central concept of its war strategy to achieve the goal of reunifying the Korean Peninsula with its socialist ideology. With lessons from Hezbollah's and Russia's successful hybrid warfare in 2006 and 2014, it is more than likely that North Korea will fully utilize hybrid warfare in a future conflict, considering its ties with both actors, evolving capabilities, and hostile intention. Without a doubt, South Korea may be the biggest victim of those threats; however, the threats are also crucial for other Asian countries and countries worldwide, because hybrid warfare on the Korean Peninsula affects the regional stability and possible cases of future hybrid warfare elsewhere. If North Korea executes another successful hybrid warfare, more hostile countries or entities will seek to employ similar warfare against neighboring countries.\nMore North Korean detrimental weapons technologies that are prohibited by international law will be disse\n######################\nOutput:"}}

First, North Korean hybrid warfare capabilities inherently possesses multiple domain aspects. As discussed in the previous section, North Korean conventional forces have capabilities across the land, air, and sea. North Korea is also known to have one of the most destructive cyber operational capabilities in the world. The regime also possesses nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, which could extend to the space domain with limited means.

The ROK military is in the process of developing a new future war concept, and this research will inform the process on what to consider. \n46\nThe focus of this thesis is limited to whether applying the MDO concept to the ROK military could counter the hybrid warfare threat; this includes deterrence during competition and defeat during armed conflict. Thus, the thesis will not discuss whether the MDO concept could counter the hybrid threats North Korea poses to advance their political objectives. Also, the discussion of countering North Korean hybrid warfare will be focused mainly on using the military as the instrument of national power to narrow the scope of the research. The use of a nuclear weapon by North Korea will be limited to deterrence in support of hybrid warfare instead of direct use against US and ROK forces.\nChapter 1 describes the potential challenges the Republic of Korea would face with increasing North Korean hybrid warfare threats; the chapter also discusses what the MDO concept is about and why one should consider MDO to counter the threat. It lays out research questions as well as key definitions, assumptions, scope, and limitations for the research. Chapter 2 surveys existing literature on North Korean hybrid warfare threats and the MDO concept.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It lays out research questions as well as key definitions, assumptions, scope, and limitations for the research. Chapter 2 surveys existing literature on North Korean hybrid warfare threats and the MDO concept. It also serves to identify possible gaps in literature that need to be filled, possibly with this research effort among others. It also discusses the literature on elements of successful future war concepts in a strategic context. The chapter ends with the literature on Feasibility, Acceptability, Suitability (FAS) analysis, providing context to the research methodology of the thesis. Chapter 3 describes the methodology the thesis will employ to answer the primary research question of \"Is the MDO concept viable to the ROK military in countering North Korean hybrid warfare?\" Chapter 4 look into each of the secondary research questions. The aggregate of the analysis will support the answer to the primary research question. Finally, Chapter 5 delivers a conclusion with possible counter-arguments, recommendations for decision-makers, and suggestions of further research related to this topic.

CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW Twenty years of COIN operations have diminished the collective knowledge and ability to converse professionally about large-scale combat. In fact, one of the purposes of MDO is to drive the Army to the professional dialogue about largescale combat that used to be second nature to Soldiers.\n-Lieutenant General Eric J. Wesley and Colonel(R) Robert H. Simpson Expanding the Battlefield: An Important Fundamental of Multi-Domain Operations North Korean Hybrid Warfare Although there are various articles related to North Korean hybrid warfare, the scholarly literature generally does not go further than describing the threat; moreover, there seem to be a wide range of definitions as to what the hybrid warfare is.\nSico van der Meer in \"The North Korean Tradition of Hybrid Provocation\" contends that the North Korean hybrid threat is not as new as it may seem and that North Korea has been utilizing the hybrid strategy for many decades already \"to provoke, hurt and bully its perceived enemies, while at the same time mitigating escalation to the level of actual warfare.\"4 6 F 47 He also maintains that the North Korean hybrid strategy and the means used have \"continuously adapted to the\n######################\nOutput:"}}

In 2006, Israel launched an attack into Lebanese territory. This event, later known as the Second Lebanon War, was in response to a few hostile actions executed by Hezbollah, including rocket fires into Israeli territory and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers. To counter the Israeli forces, Hezbollah used hybrid warfare, incorporating both conventional tactics, such as taking defensive positions with ground forces, and unconventional tactics, including insurgent and psychological tactics. With the international and domestic pressure to end the war, Israel signed an UN-mediated ceasefire agreement without a significant military defeat; Hezbollah seemingly achieved, in their term, \"the Divine Victory\" by utilizing hybrid warfare.0 F\n1\nRussia used hybrid warfare to achieve its political purpose-using a propaganda campaign to divide public opinions in Ukraine, drone technology to call for Multi Launching Rocket System (MLRS) fires, and cyber tactics to disturb Ukrainian information infrastructure-in addition to conventional tactics, such as dispatching Special Forces and mechanized units into Ukrainian territory1 F 2 .

Nuclear capabilities often serve as a deterrent to a possible augmentation of additional forces into the theater. The deterrent factor allows the adversary to employ hybrid warfare without external interference, as seen in the case of Russia's operation in Ukraine in 2014. The CFR report analyzes that North Korea's nuclear stockpile is estimated to be between 30 and 60 bombs; the regime seems to have succeeded in testing the Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), capable of reaching the continental United States (See figure \n2\n16\nAnother reason for suspecting the hostile intention of North Korea are the motives revealed by the leaders' comments and speeches. North Korean leaders, at times, published statements that expressed their wishes to unify Korea through force and with their ideology. In a 2014 New Year's address, Kim Jung-Un emphasized that \"external forces must be denounced and the views of our people ourselves must be firmly adhered to.\"2 2F 23 Not many would disagree with the following interpretations: by \"external forces,\" he means the US forces in Korea; by \"our people,\" Kim refers to all Koreans including people in the South; by \"the views,\" he most likely means the socialistic ideology of North Korea. According to his comments, it is easy to determine that the leader Kim Jung-Un pursues\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Majority of weapons systems \n5\n6\nNorth Korea uses today are either Russian-made or remakes of the Russian weapons.6 F 7 Military strategy, tactics, and organizations are also influenced by the former Soviet Union; Kim Il-Sung is known to have adopted the Red Army's Field Manual in 1936, written by Soviet Marshall Tukhachevsky.7 F 8 North Korean communist ideology was derived from that of the former Soviet Union initially, and they subsequently pursued their unique ideology with creative application to Marxism -Leninism over time.8 F 9 The continued influence is an essential factor in analyzing North Korea's strategy since it is likely that the regime would at least take lessons from Russian success in hybrid warfare in Ukraine.\nOfficial exchanges between Russia and North Korea is another factor contributing to their relationship. Though there were times when the relationship was strained after the fall of the Soviet Union, a recent summit between Russian President Vladimir Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jung-Un and frequent exchanges between Russian and North Korean officials show that both countries continue to maintain strong ties.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It seeks to combine conventional and unconventional capabilities, backed by nuclear capabilities, to swiftly win an armed-conflict before substantial reinforcements can arrive in South Korea. Taking lessons from Hezbollah's hybrid warfare in Lebanon in 2006 and Russia's hybrid warfare in Ukraine in 2014, North Korea is likely to utilize hybrid warfare in future conflicts with increased complexity, due to its ties with Russia and Hezbollah, capabilities, and intention. Meanwhile, Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), the US Army's future war concept, seek to deter and defeat future adversaries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea by optimizing combat power in multiple domains. This thesis examines if the MDO concept can be a viable future war concept for the ROK military in countering North Korean hybrid warfare. The thesis concludes that the MDO concept is both suitable and feasible, but not acceptable, mainly due to excessive budget demands, thus making it not fully viable; however, the ROK should continue pursuing the integration of operations across multiple domains.\n15.\nMeanwhile, Multi\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Both of the groups took advantage of the technology in fighting against Israelis by establishing tunnels so they could execute surprise attacks on the Israeli Armed forces.1 2F 13 6 There were also considerable amounts of official exchanges between North Korea and Hezbollah. Judge Ramberth mentioned in his ruling that \"Hezbollah members began traveling to North Korea for specialist instruction as early as the late 1980s; Hezbollah General-Secretary Hassan Nasrallah himself visited North Korea for training purposes during this time.\" He also mentioned that many of Hezbollah's intelligence and security chiefs were trained in North Korea, and North Korean officers were sent to Lebanon to advise and train the Hezbollah soldiers.1 3F \n14\n1\nNorth Korea also retains nuclear capabilities, which can be an advantageous leverage when it comes to executing hybrid warfare. Nuclear capabilities often serve as a deterrent to a possible augmentation of additional forces into the theater. The deterrent factor allows the adversary to employ hybrid warfare without external interference, as seen in the case of Russia's operation in Ukraine in 2014.

North Korean military leaders threatened South Korea by saying that they can make Seoul \"a sea of fire\" if they want. This view by the North Korean leaders is a reminder of Russia's hybrid warfare where Russia utilized anti-government activists to use them against the Ukrainian government. In the same way, North Korea will want pro-North Korea activists to lead the revolution when the appropriate time comes. These pieces of evidence show that statements made by the leaders, whether it be by the head of the regime or by the military or party leaders, also contribute significantly to the fact that North Korea possesses the intention to unify the two Koreas under their socialistic ideology.\nNorth Korean hybrid warfare is the central concept of its war strategy to achieve the goal of reunifying the Korean Peninsula with its socialist ideology. With lessons from Hezbollah's and Russia's successful hybrid warfare in 2006 and 2014, it is more than likely that North Korea will fully utilize hybrid warfare in a future conflict, considering its ties with both actors, evolving capabilities, and hostile intention. Without a doubt, South Korea may be the biggest victim of those threats; however, the threats are also crucial for other Asian countries and countries worldwide, because hybrid warfare on the Korean Peninsula affects the regional stability and possible cases of future hybrid warfare elsewhere. If North Korea executes another successful hybrid warfare, more hostile countries or entities will seek to employ similar warfare against neighboring countries.\nMore North Korean detrimental weapons technologies that are prohibited by international law will be disse\n######################\nOutput:"}}

As discussed in the previous section, North Korean conventional forces have capabilities across the land, air, and sea. North Korea is also known to have one of the most destructive cyber operational capabilities in the world. The regime also possesses nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, which could extend to the space domain with limited means. Second, Russia's military intervention in Ukraine in 2014, which is widely considered to be hybrid warfare, was one of the catalysts that prompted the US transition to Large-Scale Combat Operation (LSCO) doctrine and the MDO concept. Field Manual (FM) 3-0, Operations, mentions Russian military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 as an example of why US military professionals need to be prepared to execute LSCO.3 7 F 38 Third, the concept emphasizes deterrence during the competition and winning during the conflict. These two distinctions are also applicable on the Korean peninsula because North Korea poses similar types of threats 36 TRADOC Pamphlet 525-3-8, iv. \n37\n38\nThe primary research question for the thesis is: Is the MDO concept viable to the ROK military in countering North Korean hybrid warfare?\nThe following secondary research questions need to be sufficiently analyzed to effectively assess a logical answer to the primary research question: There are numerous definitions regarding hybrid challenges among scholars: hybrid tactics, gray-zone tactics, competition short of war, hybrid warfare\n######################\nOutput:"}}

According to his comments, it is easy to determine that the leader Kim Jung-Un pursues the reunification of Korea with a socialistic ideology without US intervention. Likewise, Kim Il-Sung, Kim Jung-Il, and Kim Jung-Un, all three leaders of North Korea, in their speeches maintained a similar concept that was displayed on Kim Jung-Un's New Year's speech in 2014, as this concept has been ingrained in their constitution and the Charter of the Workers' Party of Korea.\nMilitary and party leaders' speeches carry critical meaning when it comes to interpreting the regime's intention. North Korean military leaders threatened South Korea by saying that they can make Seoul \"a sea of fire\" if they want. This view by the North Korean leaders is a reminder of Russia's hybrid warfare where Russia utilized anti-government activists to use them against the Ukrainian government. In the same way, North Korea will want pro-North Korea activists to lead the revolution when the appropriate time comes.

The ROK military is in the process of developing a new future war concept, and this research will inform the process on what to consider. \n46\nThe focus of this thesis is limited to whether applying the MDO concept to the ROK military could counter the hybrid warfare threat; this includes deterrence during competition and defeat during armed conflict. Thus, the thesis will not discuss whether the MDO concept could counter the hybrid threats North Korea poses to advance their political objectives. Also, the discussion of countering North Korean hybrid warfare will be focused mainly on using the military as the instrument of national power to narrow the scope of the research. The use of a nuclear weapon by North Korea will be limited to deterrence in support of hybrid warfare instead of direct use against US and ROK forces.\nChapter 1 describes the potential challenges the Republic of Korea would face with increasing North Korean hybrid warfare threats; the chapter also discusses what the MDO concept is about and why one should consider MDO to counter the threat. It lays out research questions as well as key definitions, assumptions, scope, and limitations for the research. Chapter 2 surveys existing literature on North Korean hybrid warfare threats and the MDO concept.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She not only endured much without complaint, but also encouraged me to delve more deeply into the subject, so I could become more knowledgeable about the subject. Without her support, I could not have finished the work. I owe much of my accomplishment to her. I am also deeply thankful for my MMAS thesis committee, Mr. Joseph Donalbain, Dr. John Modinger, and LTC Michael Thorpe, for their consistent advice on the structure, logic, and direction of the thesis. They never hesitated to take significant portions of their time to discuss the thesis. I also would like to recognize the Art of War scholars, who, under the guidance of Dr. Dean Nowowiejski, the Ike Skelton Chair of the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), provided me with many insights on how the thesis could be better structured and revised. In 2006, Israel launched an attack into Lebanese territory. This event, later known as the Second Lebanon War, was in response to a few hostile actions executed by Hezbollah, including rocket fires into Israeli territory and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers. To counter the Israeli forces, Hezbollah used hybrid warfare, incorporating both conventional tactics, such as taking defensive positions with ground forces,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It lays out research questions as well as key definitions, assumptions, scope, and limitations for the research. Chapter 2 surveys existing literature on North Korean hybrid warfare threats and the MDO concept. It also serves to identify possible gaps in literature that need to be filled, possibly with this research effort among others. It also discusses the literature on elements of successful future war concepts in a strategic context. The chapter ends with the literature on Feasibility, Acceptability, Suitability (FAS) analysis, providing context to the research methodology of the thesis. Chapter 3 describes the methodology the thesis will employ to answer the primary research question of \"Is the MDO concept viable to the ROK military in countering North Korean hybrid warfare?\" Chapter 4 look into each of the secondary research questions. The aggregate of the analysis will support the answer to the primary research question. Finally, Chapter 5 delivers a conclusion with possible counter-arguments, recommendations for decision-makers, and suggestions of further research related to this topic. CHAPTER 2 LITERATURE REVIEW Twenty years of COIN operations have diminished the collective knowledge and ability to converse professionally about large-scale combat.

Evolving North Korean hybrid warfare will be a challenge for the ROK in preparing a future conflict. North Korea's Ties to Russia and Hezbollah North Korea's ties to Russia and Hezbollah increase the likelihood that North Korea would take lessons from their employment of hybrid warfare. It is widely known that North Korea has special ties to Russia. North Korea's military equipment, government organization, and ideology all have connections to the country. The former Soviet Union, of which Russia comprised the most substantial portion, designated Kim Il-Sung, the founding father of North Korea and ex-guerrilla commander who fought against Japan during the 1930s, to be the leader of the country following the brief trusteeship of the Soviet Union in North Korea after World War II.5 F 6 The Soviet Union also approved and supported Kim Il-Sung's plan to invade South Korea during the Korean War with provision of logistics, weapons, and military advisors to North Korea.\nThe former Soviet Union and Russia played the most influential role in establishing and modernizing the North Korean military.

First, North Korean hybrid warfare capabilities inherently possesses multiple domain aspects. As discussed in the previous section, North Korean conventional forces have capabilities across the land, air, and sea. North Korea is also known to have one of the most destructive cyber operational capabilities in the world. The regime also possesses nuclear and ballistic missile capabilities, which could extend to the space domain with limited means.

The concept seeks to combine conventional and unconventional warfare to quickly overwhelm the South before US reinforcements arrive 3 in the South.4 F 5 Taking lessons from Russia and Hezbollah, North Korea is likely to utilize hybrid warfare in future conflicts with increased complexity, due to its ties to Russia and Hezbollah, capabilities, and intention.

In 2006, Israel launched an attack into Lebanese territory. This event, later known as the Second Lebanon War, was in response to a few hostile actions executed by Hezbollah, including rocket fires into Israeli territory and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers. To counter the Israeli forces, Hezbollah used hybrid warfare, incorporating both conventional tactics, such as taking defensive positions with ground forces, and unconventional tactics, including insurgent and psychological tactics. With the international and domestic pressure to end the war, Israel signed an UN-mediated ceasefire agreement without a significant military defeat; Hezbollah seemingly achieved, in their term, \"the Divine Victory\" by utilizing hybrid warfare.0 F\n1\nRussia used hybrid warfare to achieve its political purpose-using a propaganda campaign to divide public opinions in Ukraine, drone technology to call for Multi Launching Rocket System (MLRS) fires, and cyber tactics to disturb Ukrainian information infrastructure-in addition to conventional tactics, such as dispatching Special Forces and mechanized units into Ukrainian territory1 F 2 . In the cases of Lebanon and Russia, one can see that hybrid warfare was the primary tool in achieving the nation's or the entity's political purpose.\nHybrid warfare, according to Sean Monaghan, a strategic analyst in the UK Ministry of Defense (MOD), is \"the challenge presented by the increasing complexity of armed conflict, where adversaries may combine types of warfare plus non\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Without a doubt, South Korea may be the biggest victim of those threats; however, the threats are also crucial for other Asian countries and countries worldwide, because hybrid warfare on the Korean Peninsula affects the regional stability and possible cases of future hybrid warfare elsewhere. If North Korea executes another successful hybrid warfare, more hostile countries or entities will seek to employ similar warfare against neighboring countries.\nMore North Korean detrimental weapons technologies that are prohibited by international law will be disseminated throughout the world, as was seen in the case of Hezbollah and Hamas.

According to his comments, it is easy to determine that the leader Kim Jung-Un pursues the reunification of Korea with a socialistic ideology without US intervention. Likewise, Kim Il-Sung, Kim Jung-Il, and Kim Jung-Un, all three leaders of North Korea, in their speeches maintained a similar concept that was displayed on Kim Jung-Un's New Year's speech in 2014, as this concept has been ingrained in their constitution and the Charter of the Workers' Party of Korea.\nMilitary and party leaders' speeches carry critical meaning when it comes to interpreting the regime's intention. North Korean military leaders threatened South Korea by saying that they can make Seoul \"a sea of fire\" if they want. This view by the North Korean leaders is a reminder of Russia's hybrid warfare where Russia utilized anti-government activists to use them against the Ukrainian government. In the same way, North Korea will want pro-North Korea activists to lead the revolution when the appropriate time comes. These pieces of evidence show that statements made by the leaders, whether it be by the head of the regime\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The ROK military is in the process of developing a new future war concept, and this research will inform the process on what to consider. \n46\nThe focus of this thesis is limited to whether applying the MDO concept to the ROK military could counter the hybrid warfare threat; this includes deterrence during competition and defeat during armed conflict. Thus, the thesis will not discuss whether the MDO concept could counter the hybrid threats North Korea poses to advance their political objectives. Also, the discussion of countering North Korean hybrid warfare will be focused mainly on using the military as the instrument of national power to narrow the scope of the research. The use of a nuclear weapon by North Korea will be limited to deterrence in support of hybrid warfare instead of direct use against US and ROK forces.\nChapter 1 describes the potential challenges the Republic of Korea would face with increasing North Korean hybrid warfare threats; the chapter also discusses what the MDO concept is about and why one should consider MDO to counter the threat. It lays out research questions as well as key definitions, assumptions, scope, and limitations for the research. Chapter 2 surveys existing literature on North Korean hybrid warfare threats and the MDO concept.\n######################\nOutput:"}}

The North Korean regime is known to have provided missile technologies and tunnel building technologies to Hezbollah. In 2013, in a US District Court ruling, Judge Royce Ramberth stated that North Korea and Iran were two countries liable for aiding Hezbollah in their launching of rockets into Israeli territory during the Second Lebanon War in 2006, which caused many Israeli and American civilian casualties.1 0F 11 Judge Ramberth assessed that North Korea provided missile technology and related equipment to Hezbollah which assisted Hezbollah's rocket attacks on Israel.1 1 F 12 North Korean tunnel technology, which became well known after South Korea discovered four of their secret tunnels under the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) into South Korean territory, was also transferred to Hezbollah and Hamas. Both of the groups took advantage of the technology in fighting against Israelis by establishing tunnels so they could execute surprise attacks on the Israeli Armed forces.1 2F\n######################\nOutput:"}}

She not only endured much without complaint, but also encouraged me to delve more deeply into the subject, so I could become more knowledgeable about the subject. Without her support, I could not have finished the work. I owe much of my accomplishment to her. I am also deeply thankful for my MMAS thesis committee, Mr. Joseph Donalbain, Dr. John Modinger, and LTC Michael Thorpe, for their consistent advice on the structure, logic, and direction of the thesis. They never hesitated to take significant portions of their time to discuss the thesis. I also would like to recognize the Art of War scholars, who, under the guidance of Dr. Dean Nowowiejski, the Ike Skelton Chair of the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), provided me with many insights on how the thesis could be better structured and revised. In 2006, Israel launched an attack into Lebanese territory. This event, later known as the Second Lebanon War, was in response to a few hostile actions executed by Hezbollah, including rocket fires into Israeli territory and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers. To counter the Israeli forces, Hezbollah used hybrid warfare, incorporating both conventional tactics, such as taking defensive positions with ground forces,\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Nuclear capabilities often serve as a deterrent to a possible augmentation of additional forces into the theater. The deterrent factor allows the adversary to employ hybrid warfare without external interference, as seen in the case of Russia's operation in Ukraine in 2014. The CFR report analyzes that North Korea's nuclear stockpile is estimated to be between 30 and 60 bombs; the regime seems to have succeeded in testing the Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs), capable of reaching the continental United States (See figure \n2\n16\nAnother reason for suspecting the hostile intention of North Korea are the motives revealed by the leaders' comments and speeches. North Korean leaders, at times, published statements that expressed their wishes to unify Korea through force and with their ideology. In a 2014 New Year's address, Kim Jung-Un emphasized that \"external forces must be denounced and the views of our people ourselves must be firmly adhered to.\"2 2F 23 Not many would disagree with the following interpretations: by \"external forces,\" he means the US forces in Korea; by \"our people,\" Kim refers to all Koreans including people in the South; by \"the views,\" he most likely means the socialistic ideology of North Korea. According to his comments, it is easy to determine that the leader Kim Jung-Un pursues\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It seeks to combine conventional and unconventional capabilities, backed by nuclear capabilities, to swiftly win an armed-conflict before substantial reinforcements can arrive in South Korea. Taking lessons from Hezbollah's hybrid warfare in Lebanon in 2006 and Russia's hybrid warfare in Ukraine in 2014, North Korea is likely to utilize hybrid warfare in future conflicts with increased complexity, due to its ties with Russia and Hezbollah, capabilities, and intention. Meanwhile, Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), the US Army's future war concept, seek to deter and defeat future adversaries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea by optimizing combat power in multiple domains. This thesis examines if the MDO concept can be a viable future war concept for the ROK military in countering North Korean hybrid warfare. The thesis concludes that the MDO concept is both suitable and feasible, but not acceptable, mainly due to excessive budget demands, thus making it not fully viable; however, the ROK should continue pursuing the integration of operations across multiple domains.\n15.\nMeanwhile, Multi\n######################\nOutput:"}}

Both of the groups took advantage of the technology in fighting against Israelis by establishing tunnels so they could execute surprise attacks on the Israeli Armed forces.1 2F 13 6 There were also considerable amounts of official exchanges between North Korea and Hezbollah. Judge Ramberth mentioned in his ruling that \"Hezbollah members began traveling to North Korea for specialist instruction as early as the late 1980s; Hezbollah General-Secretary Hassan Nasrallah himself visited North Korea for training purposes during this time.\" He also mentioned that many of Hezbollah's intelligence and security chiefs were trained in North Korea, and North Korean officers were sent to Lebanon to advise and train the Hezbollah soldiers.1 3F \n14\n1\nNorth Korea also retains nuclear capabilities, which can be an advantageous leverage when it comes to executing hybrid warfare. Nuclear capabilities often serve as a deterrent to a possible augmentation of additional forces into the theater. The deterrent factor allows the adversary to employ hybrid warfare without external interference, as seen in the case of Russia's operation in Ukraine in 2014.

North Korean military leaders threatened South Korea by saying that they can make Seoul \"a sea of fire\" if they want. This view by the North Korean leaders is a reminder of Russia's hybrid warfare where Russia utilized anti-government activists to use them against the Ukrainian government. In the same way, North Korea will want pro-North Korea activists to lead the revolution when the appropriate time comes. These pieces of evidence show that statements made by the leaders, whether it be by the head of the regime or by the military or party leaders, also contribute significantly to the fact that North Korea possesses the intention to unify the two Koreas under their socialistic ideology.\nNorth Korean hybrid warfare is the central concept of its war strategy to achieve the goal of reunifying the Korean Peninsula with its socialist ideology. With lessons from Hezbollah's and Russia's successful hybrid warfare in 2006 and 2014, it is more than likely that North Korea will fully utilize hybrid warfare in a future conflict, considering its ties with both actors, evolving capabilities, and hostile intention. Without a doubt, South Korea may be the biggest victim of those threats; however, the threats are also crucial for other Asian countries and countries worldwide, because hybrid warfare on the Korean Peninsula affects the regional stability and possible cases of future hybrid warfare elsewhere. If North Korea executes another successful hybrid warfare, more hostile countries or entities will seek to employ similar warfare against neighboring countries.\nMore North Korean detrimental weapons technologies that are prohibited by international law will be disse\n######################\nOutput:"}}

It lays out research questions as well as key definitions, assumptions, scope, and limitations for the research. Chapter 2 surveys existing literature on North Korean hybrid warfare threats and the MDO concept. It also serves to identify possible gaps in literature that need to be filled, possibly with this research effort among others. It also discusses the literature on elements of successful future war concepts in a strategic context. The chapter ends with the literature on Feasibility, Acceptability, Suitability (FAS) analysis, providing context to the research methodology of the thesis. Chapter 3 describes the methodology the thesis will employ to answer the primary research question of \"Is the MDO concept viable to the ROK military in countering North Korean hybrid warfare?\" Chapter 4 look into each of the secondary research questions. The aggregate of the analysis will support the answer to the primary research question. Finally, Chapter 5 delivers a conclusion with possible counter-arguments, recommendations for decision-makers, and suggestions of further research related to this topic.

Evolving North Korean hybrid warfare will be a challenge for the ROK in preparing a future conflict. North Korea's Ties to Russia and Hezbollah North Korea's ties to Russia and Hezbollah increase the likelihood that North Korea would take lessons from their employment of hybrid warfare. It is widely known that North Korea has special ties to Russia. North Korea's military equipment, government organization, and ideology all have connections to the country. The former Soviet Union, of which Russia comprised the most substantial portion, designated Kim Il-Sung, the founding father of North Korea and ex-guerrilla commander who fought against Japan during the 1930s, to be the leader of the country following the brief trusteeship of the Soviet Union in North Korea after World War II.5 F 6 The Soviet Union also approved and supported Kim Il-Sung's plan to invade South Korea during the Korean War with provision of logistics, weapons, and military advisors to North Korea.\nThe former Soviet Union and Russia played the most influential role in establishing and modernizing the North Korean military.
