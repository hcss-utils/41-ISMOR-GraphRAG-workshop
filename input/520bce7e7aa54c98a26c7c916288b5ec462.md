Throughout the Syria intervention, Russia iteratively refined CONEMP for manned and unmanned enabler aircraft that it will likely apply to future conflicts.
The VKS increasingly experimented with new capabilities in airborne ISR roles to provide electro-optical and signals intelligence support to dynamic targeting, as well as AEW&C, C2, and command 2 Shield (2018, p. 232) notes that "the geography is more favorable in Syria for rotary-wing operations than it was in much of either Chechnya or Afghanistan," particularly in "the empty expanses of central Syria where Russian rotarywing assets have been pushed forward and appear to be most active.
The lower elevation and less mountainous landscape present fewer night and poor weather navigation hazards, alleviate the tax on engine performance induced by high altitude flight, and reduce helicopters' vulnerability to the mountain-saddle small-arms ambushes that proved effective for both Chechen rebels and the Afghan mujahideen."
