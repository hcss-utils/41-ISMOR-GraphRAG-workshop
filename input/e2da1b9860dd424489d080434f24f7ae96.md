While some steps are being made to loosen the government's control over many of the major institutions within the innovation apparatus, the reality of the country's current economic state and population poses its own problems.
While the Soviet Union was long regarded one of the leading countries in the number of highly educated individuals within its population-Russia still retains one of the best-educated populations in the world according to OECD data-strict divisions between the government, military, universities, and research institutes has led to a smaller number of science and engineering graduates over the years.
Given President Putin's ambitious goals for improving the Russian economy by once again improving the scientific community's ability to innovate, the decreasing population of individuals qualified to take on these jobs may halt the project in its tracks if steps are not taken to reverse this trend.
Secondly, the strong ties between the government and the research institutes mean that all employees are considered civil servants and that the resulting laws governing the firing of scientists and engineers currently employed in the research institutes are notoriously strict.
