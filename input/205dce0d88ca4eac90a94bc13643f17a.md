As the U.S. national security community emerges from the trauma of the COVID-19 pandemic, it must resist the urge to simply return to old ways of doing business. No systematic effort, however, appears to be underway to reassess the IC's long-held priorities, policies, and procedures in light of the pandemic experience. A self-examination would allow the IC to adjust priorities to address issues not usually seen as core to U.S. national security-demographics, economics, energy, environment, religion, and public health. It would also support the modernization of personnel practices to encourage more flexible work options that could promote a distributed, yet still secure, workforce and open the door to employees without full clearances. A blue-ribbon panelsomething that once seemed a certainty-may never convene, and the IC should conduct its own introspective review of its practices to remain competitive and prepare for the next crisis. Documenting the lessons and outcomes would enable the IC to emerge from the pandemic with a useful playbook for similar future scenarios.

T his volume explores how the COVID-19 pandemic may reshape the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC). Yet, it is not a volume about the COVID-19 pandemic. In the pages that follow, the COVID-19 pandemic is a stand-in, a proxy, for a much larger challenge: complexity. Complexity, of course, predates COVID-19. It is something that has always been with us. However, if COVID-19 has taught us anything it ought to be that complexity-in myriad forms-is now the predominant security challenge confronting us.
Before assessing how much strategic complexity concerns the ICnot to mention how much it should-it is necessary to understand what it really means to say that the world is complex. For most national security practitioners (like most people in general) it seems to mean the obvious: that the world is a confusing, disordered, tangled, and convoluted place. And, indeed, all of those descriptions do apply to any genuinely complex system.
Adapted in part from the NIU Research Short: "Complexity, COVID, and the Failure of Strategic Incrementalism" However, using complexity as a mere synonym for those terms is to miss the more important-systemic-meaning of the term. Today's global system is so highly interconnected and interdependent-orders of magnitude more so than the Cold War strategic environment that preceded it-that it is extraordinarily prone to a phenomenon known as "emergence. " Emergence is the organic (not centrally directed) generation and propagation of nonlinear (more than the sum of the parts) phenomena that are systemically disruptive and/or transformative. And it is the crux of complexity. It is precisely such emergent phenomena that are the truly vital issues when one describes the world as complex.
So, what are some examples of emergence in a global context? Well, they run the gamut of today's most pressing strategic challenges: climate change, globalization, urbanization, economic/financial contagion, sweeping political/social movements, critical network failure, extremism, cyber threats, mass migration, technology preference/standardization, infectious propagation of lies, and, of course, pandemics. All of them are, first and foremost, functions of today's extraordinary complexity.
And what of China and the increasingly prevalent strategic notion of renewed great power competition? Well, the same holds. Quite simply, China is ever more enmeshed in today's global networks, and, thus, the key challenges it poses are more likely to be emergent rather than derived from some Cold War-like (i.e., linear, force-on-force) calculation of the country's brute military capability. This is already evident in China's obvious role in so many of the emergent global phenomena described above-most notably at the moment, the COVID-19 pandemic.
The nature of today's complexity is revolutionary, as the COVID-19 pandemic makes clear. Never in history has a pandemic been able Foreword to emerge and spread with the speed, global scope, and impact of COVID-19. Due largely to comprehensive modern transportation links and commerce patterns, few parts of the world and few people are not physically accessible within 20 hours. 
1
Given this growth in interconnectivity and interdependence, it is no wonder that COVID-19 has been able to emerge and spread around the world in the exponential way it has. That emergent behavior-which would have been impossible during the Cold War because there just was not enough physical interconnectivity and interdependence-makes it hard to argue that the complexity of the post-Cold War era is not really different.
But even if one still somehow insists that the above does not represent anything fundamentally different, what about the virtual world's complexity? COVID-19's physical impact has been matched, and possibly exceeded, by its virtual reach. This is largely because it is only in the past 30 years that it has become possible for anyonenot just governments, corporations, and/or the supremely wealthyto broadcast effectively. Today, the World Wide Web (born only in 1989 2 ) permits anyone's ideas, fears, hopes, information, lies-you name it-to rapidly and widely propagate. Is it any wonder then that COVID-19 could be perceived in so many, often conflicting, ways in the public health sphere? Not to mention the pandemic's having such immediate and extraordinary impact in domains beyond public health?
To illustrate this latter point, consider how quickly the COVID-19 pandemic was able to bring the global economy to its knees. It took the Great Depression several years to reach its nadir. It took COVID-19 mere weeks to inflict similar economic carnage.

The Cold War's Complicated Legacy: Ambivalence and Unpreparedness
The world on some level has always been complex. No one seriously disputes that fact. But neither is it disputable that the IC's formative experience-even today-remains the Cold War. And the Cold War was not particularly complex; it was, in systems parlance, complicated. 
5
This enduring prevalence of the Cold War's complicated notions, and the ambivalence with regard to complexity that those notions have bequeathed, can be seen in how stunningly unprepared the broader national security community, including the IC, is for the complexity it now confronts. For evidence, one again need only look at COVID-19. COVID-19 renders irrelevant most of the traditional security assumptions-military, intelligence, diplomatic-upon which the national security community stands. COVID-19 has no central head to be decapitated, shocked, or awed. It has no ships, tanks, planes, or satellites. It has no classified plans to be stolen. And it cannot be bargained with, threatened, or persuaded to stand down.
At the time of this writing, COVID-19 has killed more than 200 times the number of Americans killed on 9/11 and more than 250 times the number killed at Pearl Harbor. 
6
Given the above, it is no wonder that the national security community would look for reasons to question this reality. In its latest form, this doubt argues that increasing complexity-as manifested in globalization-probably has crested and that developments like onshoring (sometimes called reshoring), 3-D printing, the increasing availability of viable local energy sources (fracking, wind, etc.), resurgent nationalism, the United States-China trade war, etc. will now start unwinding the world's interconnectivity and interdependence. 
7
It is certainly true that globalization has been evolving for some time, and COVID-19 will surely influence that process in various ways. However, the old, physical measures of how much stuff is shipped around the world are no longer the best barometer of globalization.

11
All told, the world's interconnectivity and interdependence are not so much going to unwind as take on new forms and patternsespecially virtual. And these new manifestations must become primary drivers for how the national security community conceives itself, its roles, and its responsibilities. Nation-states and traditional military threats still matter. However, short of outright war (and maybe even then), their power probably will be determined more by their ability to manipulate the world's interconnectivity and interdependence-networks: political, economic, social, and military-than by traditional military power.
At the end of the day, the essential question that still needs to be asked is: why does it matter whether the IC and broader national security community truly believe in the fundamental nature of the change that today's complexity-as embodied in the COVID-19 pandemicrepresents? Well, the answer is not that complex. It is actually quite simple: fundamental change demands fundamental changes.
Unfortunately, to look at the national security community's changes-both proposed in assorted strategies and concrete in implementation-is to see mostly incremental initiatives aimed at improving, enhancing, upgrading, and reinforcing. Often these incremental changes get characterized in "powerful" terms-better!, stronger!, faster!, smarter!-that are practically Orwellian in that they aim to "give an appearance of solidity to pure wind. " 
12
It is often said that the first step in any effort to change is to acknowledge you have a problem. Perhaps, if there is a positive to be found in the tragedy that is the COVID-19 pandemic, it will be the understanding-for real-by the national security community, in general, and the IC, in particular, that the world's complexity represents a strategic challenge that is fundamentally different and new. Additionally, maybe it will recognize just how unprepared its incremental strategies have undeniably left it. This volume can assist in catalyzing just such understanding and recognition. O ne year beyond the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic when lockdowns swept the world, cases of COVID-19 have exceeded 185 million, more than 4 million people have died from the virus, and new variants present enduring challenges.

Looking In examines the impact of the pandemic on the IC itself. How have the pandemic/pandemic-associated outcomes affected the intelligence and broader national security communities, and how can we expect these effects to influence future national security enterprise work? What national security vulnerabilities have been exposed by pandemic-associated challenges, and how can this exposure inform and improve anticipation and responsiveness?
Looking Out explores how the pandemic has changed the global national security environment in which analysts work. This section examines the pandemic's impact on geopolitical forces and strategic competition, technology and especially supply chains, inequality, political unrest and instability, violent nonstate actors, and the information ecosystem.
Looking Forward considers the future implications of the pandemic on the IC and the world in which it operates. This section begins with historical comparisons that provide baseline expectations of those effects. Then, the authors explore how they see the intelligence enterprise changing in relation to these effects and how lasting these changes might be.
The perspective we advance in this volume is informed by the recognition that the world in which the IC operates, as well as the community itself, is part of a complex system. The system's complexity comprises many elements: great powers, regional powers, developing nations, terrorist organizations, transnational criminal organizations, populations and ethnic groups, nongovernment organizations, intergovernmental organizations, civil society organizations, multinational corporations, small businesses, and so on. These many elements interact on many levels and often in nonlinear ways. Small events sometimes have disproportionate effects on a complex system, and the reverse is also true; sometimes the impacts of major events, such as the global COVID-19 pandemic, are dampened by negative feedback that tends to bring the system back to a steady state. The contributions in this volume explore what these complex effects might be, and we Introduction: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Intelligence   return to this framework in the conclusion to assess how the pandemic's immediate effects, as identified by the authors, may play out in the complex world in which the IC is asked to operate.
This chapter examines the pandemic's influence on IC enterprise operations and analysis. Manolis Priniotakis considers how the pandemic and pandemic-associated outcomes are affecting the intelligence and broader national security communities, as well as how we can expect these outcomes to influence future national security enterprise work. He argues that, even prior to the pandemic, the IC suffered from a myriad of weaknesses that went beyond basic organization or lines of reporting and broadened into fundamental questions about the validity of the work, the use of technology, and the overall posture of the IC across the full range of national security challenges facing the country. Priniotakis illustrates how the pandemic has exacerbated these problems and urges the nation's decisionmakers to seize postpandemic reflection and recovery opportunities to implement balanced, cleareyed reforms that best serve the IC and U.S. national security.
This section examines the impact of the pandemic on the world in which the IC operates.
Jason Schenker examines the effect the pandemic has had on global supply chains and economic activity. Notably, the pandemic threw into relief issues of food insecurity as even well-off consumers in developed countries faced empty shelves and short food supplies, reminding us all of the fragility of the systems supporting our most basic needs. While the pandemic has been devastating to many small businesses, it has been a boon to e-commerce. Corporations often strive to keep inventories and their associated costs low, which is efficient when supply chains are secure. However, the pandemic has challenged this business paradigm, especially in the case of medical supplies. The politically divisive response to economic disruption and lack of goods in the United States exposed a leverage point that adversaries could target in the future by combining a biological attack with social media disinformation, which has flourished during the pandemic. Schenker proposes a framework to identify and prioritize factors that impact national security in a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This framework, with the acronym NOISE, focuses on necessities (food, water, power, shelter, safety), occupations, information, systems (financial, health, transportation, education), and external factors (international relations, military, supply chains, trade).
Jon Hall, Carolina Rivera Vázquez, Heriberto Tapia, and Jacob Assa examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on inequality through the lens of the UN Human Development Index (HDI), which evaluates the well-being and potential of a country's population in terms of per capita GDP, life expectancy, and education. The authors point out that the pandemic has been detrimental to all dimensions of human development. Their modified version of the HDI, accounting for the adverse effects of school closures on well-being, shows the HDI for 2020 plummeted. Because the adverse effects of school closures are disproportionately felt by people of lower income, the pandemic is likely to exacerbate already growing levels of inequality, and long-term unemployment among youth seeking to enter the labor market may intensify these scarring effects. Hall et al. anticipate growing levels of inequality between and within countries, as well as inequality in terms of ethnicity and gender-all of which are expected to increase instability worldwide.
Cristina Bodea and Christian Houle focus on how major crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbate global inequality. Globally, low-wage occupations have been disproportionately affected because they cannot be performed from home. Because racial and Introduction: The COVID-19 Pandemic and Intelligence ethnic minorities are disproportionately employed in low-wage sectors, racial and ethnic inequality are probably increasing. The authors point out that the combination of inequality and ethnicity often feeds social instability. In addition, authoritarian leaders have used the pandemic to increase and centralize their power. The mixture of increased instability and authoritarianism threatens democratic institutions worldwide. For this reason, Bodea and Houle suggest it is more important than ever for countries to address inequality.
Jimena Blanco focuses on inequality in Latin America. She notes that Latin America has limited capability to recover from the effects of the pandemic. Job loss and business closures have dramatically reduced government revenues by reducing tax receipts. The shrinking legitimate economy will push even more low-wage earners into the informal economy where they are exploited. Increased inequality will exacerbate discontent with governments and increase instability, and these trends will create an environment that is even more favorable for organized crime. This development, in turn, will weaken governments in the region and increase risks to U.S. national security through the illicit drug trade, which will further destabilize the region.
Stacey Pollard, Henry Baraket, Girish Ganesan, and Natalie Kim examine how violent extremist organizations are exploiting insecurity stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic in the Middle East to undermine U.S.-supported counterterrorism efforts in the region. Specifically, Pollard et al. focus on how ISIS is capitalizing on social unrest and a rapidly deteriorating security environment-exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic-to reconstitute in permissive areas of Iraq and Syria. Their chapter analyzes ISIS's pandemic-era ground and information operations through the lens of its state-and nation-making efforts to help analysts and decisionmakers better understand the imminence and scope of the threat.
Layla Hashemi, Sarah Meo, and Louise Shelley's chapter dovetails with Schenker's analysis of supply chains and Blanco's analysis of the rise of organized crime in Latin America. Hashemi et al. describe  how the pandemic's adverse impact on supply chains has provided opportunities for organized crime to expand illicit trade. Furthermore, pandemic-related foreign aid and increased government inefficiency and corruption throughout the world have provided transnational criminal organizations with greater opportunities to expand their operations and siphon off legal funds. These developments have fueled increased human and drug trafficking, environmental and financial crimes, and trade in counterfeits, demonstrating how the COVID-19 crisis poses new and unprecedented threats to public health and human security.
Jim Jones and Anthony Stefanidis analyze how the global pandemic and pandemic responses are affecting the activities of criminal organizations in the physical, social, and cyber domains. Their chapter assesses how the pandemic has interacted with the strength and agility of global criminal organizations. The authors also examine how pandemic-adapted criminal activity and other factors create investigative opportunities including increased data and exposure through risky operations, both of which enable deeper understanding of underlying criminal organization structure and enhance our ability to disrupt and dismantle criminal organizations.
Kacper Gradon analyzes Russian information operations in Western democracies, focusing his research on Russia's disinformation campaign in Poland. He argues that the pandemic has provided Russia a perfect opportunity to exercise its well-honed use of disinformation and deception to weaken Western democracies. Furthermore, Gradon warns that Russia is using Eastern European countries as a test bed before launching new malign influence tactics and techniques worldwide. He draws attention to infodemics, the spread of disinformation about a pandemic in parallel to the spread of the disease agent. Russia has emerged as the primary purveyor of disinformation in the current infodemic, seeking to discredit Western powers and their responses to the pandemic-all in an effort to weaken alliances within NATO and to sow political division within Western democracies. Gradon proposes countering Russia's efforts 
Perhaps ironically, this section begins by looking backward and examines how previous pandemics affected the security of nations in ways that can inform today's IC about challenges the community is facing.
Michael Vlahos reflects on the profound impacts of plagues on ancient Roman and medieval societies, concluding that pandemics are not harbingers of change, but accelerators of changes already underway and weakeners of already eroding institutions. Most adversely affected by major pandemics have been the elites, whose centralized power proves ephemeral, leading to loss of unitary power and social fragmentation. The Roman Empire was already in decline from the top down when the Justinian Plagues (7th century) probably accelerated this decline; central Roman elites lost power to outside, "barbarian" groups who emulated Roman civilization and divided the empire among themselves. The Black Plague (14th century) accelerated transformations of European society from the bottom up; as Europe experienced prosperity and growth, the rising expectations of its peasant and mercantile classes created simmering resentment against the feudal system. The plague depopulated urban centers of power and created an intense demand for now-scarce peasant labor, leading to the feudal system's breakdown and rising power for the peasantry and merchants who laid the foundations for modern Europe.
Lawrence Kuznar compares the underlying conditions and consequences of the 1918 H1N1 flu (Spanish Flu) pandemic to those of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 1918 pandemic came on the heels of a devastating world war, followed by an economic boom as nations rebuilt-for which there is no parallel in the early 21st century. Significant demographic differences also exist: the 1918 pandemic disproportionately infected and killed people of prime working age, whereas the COVID-19 pandemic has primarily killed the elderly. Consequently, the 1918 pandemic reduced the global labor force, creating a favorable market for labor; however, the COVID-19 pandemic has created no similar boon for working-age people, exacerbating inequality as described by Hall et al., Bodea and Houle, and Blanco.  One potentially disturbing long-term parallel may hold between the 1918 and COVID-19 pandemics: the disenfranchisement of specific sectors of society that eventually emerged as full-scale and violent challenges to the status quo. The effects of the 1918 pandemic hit German working-class veterans particularly hard; the COVID-19 pandemic has similarly disadvantaged conservative working-class people and, if the inevitable recovery passes them by, it may plant the seeds for greater challenges to national security in the future.
Finally, Josh Kerbel and Zachery Tyson Brown take a hard look at the IC, arguing that the community still operates, intellectually, from within an increasingly obsolete, 20th century paradigm of what constitutes national security. This paradigm is predicated on the idea of information scarcity, and it views the world largely in terms of "threats to" instead of "risks from"-for example, from the vulnerabilities built into our open system of government, or from the severe social, political, and economic knock-on effects of a brutal pandemic that has claimed half a million American lives. Although the authors conclude there are no simple solutions to this challenge, they discuss six broad areas of reform "the Intelligence Community must consider if it hopes to survive and thrive through an era in which change is the only constant, and more surprise the only certainty. " 
Starting in January 2020, the United States experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic a traumatic episode that will have lasting effects on the popular consciousness and U.S. national security-or at least it should. For the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) and the broader Federal government, the pandemic emptied offices, changed priorities, and even called into question the nature and definition of national security. The pandemic-the worst health crisis to hit the world in more than a century 1, 2 -crippled the international movement of people, inhibited global trade, and raised serious questions about many governments' ability to deal with such a crisis.

As of May 2021, IC agencies are moving forward with a broad "return" to full operations-or at least they are trying to get back to "normal. " They are emerging from shift work or week on/week off schedules, with most employees who had worked from home since March 2020 returning to the office. The "New Normal" predicted to emerge is looking a lot like the "Old Normal. " A real danger exists if the "New Normal" ends up simply being a return to old ways of doing business or if the IC treats the past 18 months as an anomaly to be observed with interest but no serious attempt to understand its lessons. Some agencies are capturing "lessons learned, " but no systematic effort appears to be underway to understand the priorities, policies, and procedures challenged by the COVID-19 experience.
Even with more than 600,000 deaths in the United States alone, billions in economic damage, loss of prestige, and mental and physical effects on individuals that are hard to define, let alone on which to place a value-the virus could have been worse. It could have been more deadly, spread more easily in children, or ravaged the developing world-or at least hit it earlier. The virus could have been more resistant to vaccine development and, perhaps most concerning of all, it could have hit at time of war or been an intentional act by an adversarial state or nonstate actor that got lucky.
Hallway conversations about the impact of COVID-19 on intelligence have ranged from the need for extreme change to the sentiment that disease monitoring and prevention are not "our job. " The reality lies somewhere in between. If the IC can adapt and take the lessons of COVID-19 seriously-changing its focus and how it operates while understanding the limits of intelligence's role-it may emerge from the pandemic with a useful playbook for similar future scenarios. Experts predict this pandemic is unlikely to be the last and the next could be more damaging.

At the time of this writing, it has been almost a year and a half since early public awareness of the pandemic. The interim has seen an assault on the Capitol and a high-profile and challenging withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan, in addition to ongoing contentious partisan political quarreling in the United States that has influenced and been influenced by perceptions of the ongoing pandemic.
It is easy to forget how uncertain life looked in March 2020. Offices emptied out, friends and strangers became health threats, and grocery stores transformed from simple sources of food to lifelines staffed by "front-line workers. " Within the U.S. Government, people who had spent their careers believing themselves to be essential discovered overnight that their work was expendable-at least during a global pandemic.

It is worth reviewing the sequence of relevant events.
• Dec. 31, 2019: Chinese officials reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) that they were treating dozens of pneumonia cases of unknown etiology.   • Jan. 11, 2020: China reported its first virus-related death.

All government agencies had longstanding continuity of operations plans in place to handle related situations but not for the scale or duration they now faced. However, IC agencies, with few employees deemed "telework eligible" based on mission requirements, began to release employees to stay home. Remote system access was available to some-but far from all-employees. As schools closed, dependent care became a serious concern, especially for families with small children. Employees faced the prospect of drawing down annual leave to adjust to the new situation but were not sure how long they could hold out. New definitions for "high risk" began circulating. The world had changed, and IC officers were having discussions about opensource information and use of home systems in ways that almost all would have once found unimaginable. And nobody knew how long any of these measures would last.
For years, multiple directors of national intelligence-echoing health experts-had been warning, in public, of the possibility that a pandemic or epidemic could have tremendous impact on U.S. national security. 
30
The public discussion of the IC's role in predicting the onslaught of the virus began early in the pandemic and continues to the date of publication.

Early in the pandemic, Foreign Policy published an article by Micah Zenko, a professor of political science at Brandeis, with the provocative title: "The Coronavirus Is the Worst Intelligence Failure in U.S. History. " The headline, likely the work of editors rather than the author, did not actually match the thrust of the argument.

Before the pandemic, the IC was already facing a reckoning. As Amy Zegart and Michael Morell argued in Foreign Policy in 2019, technology advances-especially in biotechnology, nanotechnology, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence-were narrowing the United States' advantage over its near peers, in addition to allowing lesser powers to make gains. The changing media landscape had facilitated the spread of disinformation faster than any U.S. ability to respond. Zegart and Morell called for an overhaul of the IC, "a broad-based intelligence-community-wide effort with input from technology companies, civil society, and academia. A blue-ribbon commission, instituted and overseen by Congress, could drive this change. " They also criticized an employment system designed for a different time, for when people spent their careers at one agency. 
38
The pandemic highlighted a longstanding problem for the modern IC. Founded at the onset of the Cold War and in many ways still organized to confront the Soviet Union, the IC has generally emphasized "traditional" national security challenges over other, perhaps esoteric, topics.

Global issues have been pushed to the corners of IC organizations, but a better grasp of these topics would offer policymakers a broader understanding of how the world works and how countries operate. Some large IC agencies' efforts during the past decade to reorganize into "mission centers" integrated intelligence disciplines but left them siloed by topic, which will undercut their capacity to harness computing power's ability to find connections across fields, regions, and topics. Global issues represent the fundamental relationships between governments and the governed worldwide. They address how capitals interact with their populations and how populations interact with the rest of the world. Just as our oceans no longer serve as protective barriers, the virus has demonstrated that no boundary can protect or insulate a country from the ravages of a pandemic that travels on the back of a globalized economy.

COVID-19 has also revealed new avenues for investigation and analysis on new areas of geopolitical competition. In particular, the use of medical equipment and assistance to advance diplomatic objectives. Despite the limited introduction of vaccines in late 2020 and their spread in 2021, the virus will remain a part of the international landscape for the foreseeable future. Poorer countries still struggle to gain access to vaccines and to administer them on a broad basis, and questions remain about the durability of the first wave of inoculations. Vaccine-focused politics highlight new areas of competition, especially related to the global supply chain.

The political and economic impacts on these countries may be among the most prominent of the virus's lasting global effects, but there are opportunities to learn. This period has provided the data for a decade of comparative studies of how societies and governments respond to a crisis. An enterprising researcher could examine any country's response to the COVID-19 crisis to uncover useful information about government leadership performance; effectiveness of lockdowns, restrictions or other policies; economic decisionmaking; performance of emergency services; use of the security services; public and private healthcare responses; media coverage and government treatment of the media; popular reaction to and compliance with restrictions; relationships with neighbors and international organizations; changes in supply chains and illicit markets; and many other COVID-19 related effects. This approach would be useful for understanding the diversity of responses by country: size, region, wealth, political system, access to foreign markets, relative isolation, level of industrialization, ethnic homogeneity, infrastructure connectivity, island vs. landlocked vs. littoral, and military capacity-among other attributes. Resulting analyses could reveal useful insights into each country's strategic culture, ability to plan, and emergency response capabilities.
COVID-19 will have lasting impacts. States could still fail and adversaries strengthen, especially if countries at the forefront of vaccine development are unwilling to share their largesse or do not act on President Biden's May 2021 advocacy for patent relinquishment by pharmaceutical companies holding related intellectual property.

The IC's purpose is to help policymakers understand the world as it is, not as they would like to see it or even binned by regional divides, especially with the prospects of further pandemics a likelihood. To make this work, the IC will need to break down the attitudes that have relegated these "global issues" to second-class status and to properly cover them-rather than downgrade their offices and minimize their budgets. Some elements, such as DoD's National Center for Medical Intelligence and the Biodefense Knowledge Center at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, exist to tackle important aspects of global public health from a national security perspective, but these are modest and dispersed efforts. A serious attempt will challenge decades of practices and require hiring more hydrologists, epidemiologists, and others with technical backgrounds into both analytic and collections roles, as well as retaining them by empowering them to layer their expertise onto information that only the IC possesses. It may mean hiring individuals who only work with open sources and may not require the same level of security clearance as traditional IC officers-and then figuring out how to work with them.
Of course, such an approach does not mean an abandonment of support to military operations. Joshua Rovner has argued that the lesson of the pandemic should be the opposite of tackling more "global issues" and that the IC should instead retrench and recenter around secret information.

Beyond substantive considerations, the other area where the pandemic experience will have an impact is workforce management. In a sense, the U.S. population was lucky that the pandemic did not occur before Federal Communications Commission reforms, begun in 2009, encouraged the nationwide expansion of broadband.

The term "Before Time" has passed from science fiction into the pandemic-related lexicon. 
75
There has also been an element of guilt and even martyrdom, leading to condescension, resentment, and shame. Some IC employees felt pressure in the office, and others experienced feelings of inadequacy and even guilt over not being present. Others appear to have lorded their office access over others deemed non-mission essential. While employees have faced being identified as nonessential beforewhenever the government has shut down over lapses of appropriations or political disagreements over the debt limit, most recently in 2018-19-the pandemic brought this reality into starker relief. Some agencies' claimed abilities to maintain high levels of productivity have raised uncomfortable questions about their previous productivity if a global pandemic did not demonstrably undercut their performance.
For some Federal employees, the pandemic requirements comported with their regular practices or available options. For most IC officers and other national security professionals, however, it did not. In fact, the idea of working in nonsecure spaces is anathema to the intelligence ethos, even with the increase in open-source work during the past 20 years. Reasons for that attitude are rooted in managers' reluctance to lose sight of their employees and legitimate concerns about security. The outset of the pandemic prompted a diversity of responses to the need to reduce the number of people in offices to minimize transmission at a time when the mechanics of the virus were not well understood. Agencies able to transition work to telework status did so, while others simply removed people from the office.
Two RAND reports produced for the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in 2018 illuminated the challenges: "Understanding Government Telework: An Examination of Research Literature and Practices from Government Agencies" and "Moving to the Unclassified: How the Intelligence Community Can Work from Unclassified Facilities. "

Of course, that is where the pandemic took the IC. RAND broke the challenges into six categories: policy, legal, technology, security, financial, and cultural, with specific analysis of emergency response and Continuity of Operations (COOP) activities. The papers provided insights and recommendations on how to prepare employees to shift their activities out of SCIFs. On emergency response, the operative commentary relative to the pandemic was:
• "[E]mployees [must] understand the job functions they are allowed to conduct remotely and have access to the data and systems they need to conduct those functions, as well as to the collaboration tools to remain in communication with their own colleagues and with other offices. " 81 • "Agencies should … adopt clear, detailed, and easily understood security classification guides; implement policies on how to digitally access and handle CUI [controlled unclassified information]; and implement policies about how to handle and secure hard copies of CUI. " 82 • "In preparing for a COOP event, how should agencies balance the risk-mitigation benefits of dispersing employees across geographic locations and across the power grid and other critical infrastructure against the benefits created by the hardened systems that agencies may have available on-site?" 83
The pandemic of 2020 represented such an extreme crisis. Information garnered from informal discussions across the IC indicates some agencies adjusted better than others. Training was uneven across IC elements, as were human resources measures, with agencyspecific requirements probably accounting for the bulk of the differences. Some made unclassified systems available to employees; others did or could not, especially in the absence of widespread distribution of government-furnished equipment.
There may also be good news. The second RAND paper suggests: "[I]f agencies create systems and processes for employees to work remotely and identify unclassified functions that could occur entirely off-site, they could increase the pool of talent available for recruitment by allowing employees to work in other parts of the country or by attracting employees who may meet skill and capability requirements but not necessarily meet security clearance requirements. " 84 Of course, some parts of the IC workforce cannot and will not ever transition from working in nonsecure spaces; others operate in the field. But some agencies may find the RAND assessment to be true.
When this current crisis dissipates sufficiently to assess agencylevel performance, it will be worthwhile to conduct thorough studies on how each agency responded. Plenty of lessons will be learned across a range of U.S. Government activities, but, for the IC, this question will be among the most important. It is not yet clear what lasting impacts the pandemic will have on the nature of work in the contemporary U.S. economy, but learning those lessons is imperative, as all other employers seeking to hire knowledge-economy workers have taken note.

86
The pandemic opened new possibilities for improved work practices and highlighted procedural and security shortcomings. The key lessons include the need for more flexible and alternative work schedules and the possibility of increased unclassified work. Provided security can address systems accessibility, these steps could allow greater worker flexibility; allow for a distributed workforce; and help with recruitment by opening the door to more employees without full clearances. Such an evolution could decrease costs, reduce the number of employees who wash out during the clearance process, and create opportunities for recruiting workers with specific skill sets. Such measures could be the key to recruiting the technical workforce needed to cover current and emerging global issues.
Implementing new approaches will not be easy, but it cannot happen slowly. The pool of people from which the IC will draw its workforce of the future was already transforming before the pandemic and has now probably become accustomed to a new employment paradigm. Some companies are saying they are never going back to the office in the same way as before, and smaller cities are offering cash and tax incentives to compete for individuals who can work remotely but may want a more relaxed or lower-cost standard of living.
IC officers have gotten a taste of the possible during this period. While most employees longed to return to the office and some could do little or nothing outside of it, much of the IC continued to operate with some level of effectiveness under pandemic conditions. It is probable that employees will expect a different experience after this year of workplace flexibility. Having some agencies return to their previous approaches while others retain some pandemic-era practices is likely to spark an intra-IC competition for talent, with those agencies willing to adopt greater workplace flexibility poaching from those that do not. In addition, the IC should not underestimate the competition for talent with a private sector learning from the pandemic. Amazon's arrival in the National Capital Region will be worth watching. 
87
Some IC agencies will attract people based on the allure of intelligence work alone. These individuals have a focus on national security and will be willing to take what conditions they can get. Inequities in salary and workplace flexibility that exist across the agencies demonstrate that some people are willing to overlook those considerations to enter the IC. That tendency may not persist, or at least not at previous levels. For the marginal employee interested in IC work but not necessarily committed to it, whose marketable skills attract higher salaries and more benefits, workplace flexibility could be more important than ever. Generational change and evolving attitudes about work may decrease the size of the pool of people focused on IC work in the years to come.
Since its arrival, the pandemic has sparked discussion about a "New Normal" across all activities: schools, businesses, and government.

At same time, the danger exists that the IC will engage in another longstanding tendency: over-correcting to respond to the latest threat. The U.S. Government has long taken drastic responses to real or perceived poor intelligence practices or performance, to include establishing the Director of Central Intelligence after Pearl Harbor; lowering risk appetite after the Church and Pike Committee hearings in the 1970s; focusing on terrorism post-9/11; standing up the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in response to 9/11 and the Iraq WMD misstep in 2003; and imposing restrictions after Edward Snowden's unauthorized disclosures. A drastic correction occurred after Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf 's famous criticisms that intelligence had not provided sufficient support to the invasion of Iraq in 1991, which led to a focus across agencies on support to military operations. The DoD-based intelligence agencies, which make up the bulk of intelligence budgets, developed into "combat support agencies, " with a primary function to aid military operations. This focus transitioned with little difficulty to counterterrorism operations after 9/11, likely causing the IC to lose sight of other trends developing during these years.

It will be necessary to resist the temptation to return to status quo ante. The virus will have an impact on many activities including how office spaces are organized and organizations' ability to carry out their mission remotely. This important debate is underway and will continue, as it should. From a substantive or subject matter perspective, another debate will occur, largely focused on priorities. There was a disruption, and the question now is how severe. It will be tempting to treat it as a blip, but also to treat it as a complete break from the past. Neither approach will best serve IC professionals or the IC mission.
For its 2019 publication Preface to Strategy, Johns Hopkins University's Applied Physics Laboratory put together an august panel of former senior national security officials, spanning multiple organizations, administrations, and fields to examine the preconditions for a new national security strategy. Led by former Secretary of the Navy Richard Danzig, the report was not a national security strategy or even a roadmap for a strategy but instead an in-depth treatment of the underlying realities of U.S. national security conditions and perceptions. The "prelude" of the title spoke to a fundamental review of how national security thinkers and decisionmakers understand the strengths, weaknesses, and even basic conditions that underpin U.S. planning, the views adversaries hold of the United States, and even our biases. The report asked national security experts to do the uncomfortable work of looking inward before looking outward. The bottom-line assessment: the attributes we once thought protected us from danger-our economic might, scientific and technical supremacy, and geographic isolation-are no longer the dependable buffers we once thought. The authors argued that the United States required a reset on how it looked at itself. 
97
Similarly, the 2020 pandemic created a need for the IC to undertake a course of introspection on par with resets in the 1940s, 1970s, and 2000s. The self-examination would address the fundamentals of IC work, going beyond any in IC history-even those that resulted from unauthorized disclosures, revelations of wrongdoing, or even high-profile intelligence failures that contributed to policy or military mistakes or disasters. The pandemic has raised basic questions about the broad mission of the IC down to every single member: Do we need this person to do their job, and, if so, when, and where?
Although most IC agencies will do some level of "lessons learned" analysis, such a comprehensive review is likely to be difficult for the IC to do on its own, and a Congressional review could end up overly politicized, given the sharp divides in Congress and country over the pandemic. As argued by Zegart and Morell, the IC was due for a large-scale review even before the pandemic.

The United States experienced multiple traumas in the 20 years before the COVID-19 pandemic: the 9/11 terrorist attacks and subsequent Afghanistan invasion; the 2003 Iraq invasion; the 2008 global financial crisis; and foreign interference in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Others, like the H1N1 flu in 2009, could enter that list, but these four had widespread national security implications and affected the average American, albeit in the case of Iraq, in a more diffuse way than the other three. The first even changed the way people traveled and, combined with the invasion of Iraq and the nuclear issues that served as predicates for it, led to an overhaul of the country's national security infrastructure. The 2016 Russian election interference is perhaps too recent-and controversial-to have truly been understood to be the "Cyber 9/11" or "Cyber Pearl Harbor" it was.
Dahl calls COVID-19 a warning failure, either through the failure to warn or for policymakers to heed the warning.

The twin traumas of 9/11 and Iraq led to such a review, which suggested major changes, many of which were implemented-but not all. The global financial crisis, which had widespread and massive domestic and foreign impacts, resulted in a collective national security shrug. No one questioned that Pearl Harbor or 9/11 fell squarely in the IC's job jar. But a global economic meltdown with its roots in the U.S. housing market? That was harder to understand as falling in the IC's purview. Unfortunately, it is possible that the pandemic will be seen the same way. The Biden administration's mandate that the IC review the intelligence on the origins of the pandemic offered a glimmer of hope, but its narrow focus will limit its impact.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, references to supply chain security most commonly evoked associations with national defense. During the darkest moments of the pandemic, however, Americans saw widespread images of sparse grocery store shelves, where paper products, fresh fruits and vegetables, meat, and other goods were in short supply. E-commerce technologies supported social and economic stability through the worst of the pandemic, but broader supply chain risks were exposed. In the post-pandemic period, supply chain is likely to remain a concern for consumers and policymakers, as well as military strategists. Reflecting the increasing technological complexities of supply chains in the decade ahead, the national security approach to protecting U.S. supply chains-especially of critical goods like pharmaceuticals, high-technology goods, aircraft parts, rare earth minerals, and materiel-will need to be multifaceted and embrace futures thinking. Identifying new ways to use technology to bridge economic and social stability gaps presents tremendous opportunities for the future of national security.
Maintaining a secure supply chain has often been a deciding factor in maintaining operational advantage in conflict. Supply chain security is also critical for economic health and social stability, especially maintaining access to food. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the importance of supply chain was something the civilian population blissfully ignored. The pandemic, however, opened the aperture in many ways, revealing open secrets and overlooked risks to our society, economy, and security. Supply chain vulnerability has continued to color the path forward as the period of mass vaccination began. For national security, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the importance of being vigilant with our borders. And it highlighted the risks of overly lean supply chains, as well as the potential downside of being dependent on the global supply chain for critical goods like medical supplies, medical devices, basic necessities, and personal protective equipment (PPE), including gloves and masks.
Although food insecurity and shortages are persistent concerns and risks for many countries around the world at any point in time, it is uncommon for this to be a concern in the most developed Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries like the United States. But the COVID-19 pandemic, shutdown, and recession changed that. Images of stores without paper products or with limited selections of food were reminiscent for many Americans who lived through parts of the Cold War of the widespread images seen during the death throes of the Soviet Union.
Despite the relative abundance of agricultural production in the United States, which is one of the world's biggest net exporters of agricultural products, resilience issues and risks related to the food and agricultural supply chain have remained top of mind for many Americans. Media stories of meat shortages and other limited supplies were widespread during the spring 2020 surge of COVID-19. And while some might decry these as overblown, in truth, our entire economy and society were probably a lot closer to the edge than we would like to admit to ourselves. The British Security Service MI5 has long held the motto that society is "four meals away from anarchy. "

Maintaining a secure supply chain is inherently difficult when the goods come from a country that is far away. Generally low levels of inventory as well as long, lean supply chains revealed risks to national security in the United States in 2020. The corporate playbook for most companies has been to keep inventories and supply chains lean. That works well during times of supply chain stability, but lean inventories coupled with geographic distance became an issue for supply chain security during the COVID-19 pandemic. This was especially critical for medical devices and PPE.
Trade risks were already a national security issue related to metals for materiel in the United States, which was the impetus behind the implementation of the U.S. Section 232 tariffs on aluminum and steel. Additionally, the Section 301 tariffs highlighted risks to U.S. national security from Chinese threats to U.S. intellectual property. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, PPE and medical devices may now very well end up on lists of essential goods as well. There may even be a bipartisan political push to secure supply chains for critical medical devices, PPE equipment, and pharmaceuticals to prevent the loss of American lives in the future-and to minimize the potential disruption or devastation of the American economy in the event of another pandemic. After all, one of the big reasons it was necessary to slow the spread of COVID-19 in the United States and "flatten the curve" was because there were not enough ventilators, gloves, masks, or other equipment to handle a pandemic. If we could ensure greater stability in the supply chain for PPE and medical devices, we may be better able to protect the economy and the American people in the future.
The COVID-19 outbreak revealed that the United States can be exploited in a pandemic-type event in myriad ways. Making the economy of the United States seem reminiscent of the Soviet Union's financial state during the last days of the Cold War is no small feat. It also exposed U.S. supply chain vulnerabilities and revealed that, if the United States had been solely targeted, it would have significantly threatened national security and the ability of the United States to project influence globally. In general, COVID-19 revealed that a pandemic-level biological attack on the United States would be beyond economically devastating. Plus, the vulnerability of the American public to media and social media messaging and potential manipulation was also revealed. Devastatingly hot buttons of bias that parts of the public clung to included anchoring bias, confirmation bias, and false consensus bias-even when related to something fundamental, like wearing a mask. With poignant and punchy memes, parts of the civilian population were influenced into actionor inaction-in the face of the deadliest pandemic in a century. The social media activity and public response to COVID-19 highlight the at-risk status of the American public to future psychological operations (PSYOPS) in a post-truth world dominated by the mass adoption of subjectivist truth.
A most worrisome scenario would be if adversaries of the United States were to intentionally pair a biological attack with widespread social media and traditional media disinformation. Such a plan would be designed to cause maximum disruption, political destabilization, and economic devastation, and it would likely be successful for at least a brief time. These kinds of risks may sound extreme. But the COVID-19 pandemic was an extreme situation, and, as a pandemic and public health crisis, it may not be singular in the decades ahead. Plus, the powers of the world-great and small-have seen how a pandemic plays out. For those countries and entities that seek recognition, power, or chaos, COVID-19 offers a glimpse into the scale of instability that can be rapidly created in the world by a pandemic that could have been much worse.
Following the outbreak of COVID-19, The Futurist Institute was approached by the Strategic Foresight and Futures Branch of the U.S. Air Force Warfighting Integration Capability (AFWIC) to help frame the importance of the COVID-19 pandemic for national security.

Necessities-Food, Water, Power, Shelter, Safety Occupations-Jobs, Vocations, Hobbies Information-Access to Accurate, Complete Information Systems-Financial, Health Care, Transportation, Education External-International Relations, Military, Supply Chain, Trade   The first items The Futurist Institute included are the necessities of food, water, power, shelter, and safety. After all, the most important driver of most governmental policy and social change is what economists often call the economics of the stomach. In short, if people lack access to food or other basic necessities, there are significant risks of political instability. This is why supply chain is so critical-and why it became such a critical topic in 2020. If necessity factors are stable, then a country or economy is likely to remain on an even keel. In the most recent experience of the COVID-19 pandemic, concerns about safety and food emerged. But man does not live by bread alone, and the other components of the NOISE framework are also necessary for stability in the face of significant risks and upheaval. Maintaining the U.S. supply chain and basic services as well as utilities (like power and water) was critical, as was sustaining safety and access to food.
Second are occupations. These made the list because of the notion that people-at the population level-need things to do. Can people be retired and do essentially nothing? Yes, of course. But as a nation, people need jobs, vocations, and hobbies. They just need to be doing something. The need for this stabilizing force is tied to the proverbial notion that "idle hands are the devil's workshop. " Occupational risks and instability became critical during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, as people were forced to shelter in place. Some people could still work, but others were concerned about their jobs. This is why the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the United States, as well as other forms of fiscal stimulus at home and abroad, has been so important. After all, even if people could not work, they needed to know their chance of still having jobs would be high after the pandemic. Yet, even with fiscal and monetary policy stimulus, the U.S. labor market suffered significantly.
To put the job situation in perspective, in 1933-the worst year of the Great Depression in the United States-there were around 12.8 million unemployed people.

Systems are fourth on the list. National security depends on the proper functioning of several critical social and economic systems, including the financial system, the health care system, the transportation system, and the education system. All of these were disrupted or at risk of being disrupted during the most severe outbreaks of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The fifth and final element of national security stability The Futurist Institute identified is external. This factor includes international relations, the existence of and ability to deploy the military, the global supply chain, and trade. When most people consider national security risks, this is the category they think of first. There is a simple reason for that: they take the other four categories for granted. If COVID-19 showed us anything, it is that almost every aspect of society believed to be stable can be rapidly destabilized. Fortunately, some of these core elements, like international relations and the military, were relatively undisrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. But global supply chains and trade were disturbed, which had second order impacts on systems, occupations, and necessities. Plus, supply chain disruptions also exposed information elements of the framework to misinformation and disinformation.
When considering the NOISE framework, it is easy to see how the COVID-19 pandemic has actually threatened all of these different pillars of national security and political stability in one way or anotherand how supply chain disruptions and uncertainty fed that instability risk. The risks posed by COVID-19 justified, in large part, the unprecedented levels of fiscal and monetary policy stimulus enacted globally. Of course, there will also be a legacy of record high global government debt and ballooned central bank balance sheets as a result of those necessary actions. The long-term implications of those dynamics remain to be seen, but one thing is clear: the COVID-19 pandemic threatened to push U.S. national security, the global economy, supply chains, and society as we know it to the brink. This time, we held the line because of significant and swift action. Next time, we may not be as lucky. And we may not have the same ability to issue as much debt or enact as much monetary policy accommodation as we did in 2020. For these reasons, shoring up risks could prove critical-especially because the next incidence of pandemic or plague might not be an accident.
As for the minimization of risk to national security, it will be critical to control for and support those elements in the NOISE framework that represent the fundamental building blocks of stability. That is where the risks are, and only if those levers of stability are firmly in place can the risks to national security and society be minimized. This is just as true now as it was in the first days of the COVID-19 pandemic. And it will remain true whenever the next public health crisis rears its ugly head.
In addition to broad-based national security risks that the COVID-19 pandemic revealed, The Futurist Institute also identified risks that have specific implications for national security industries. This includes the potential for disruptions to national security vendors, including the airplane manufacturers and airplane parts manufacturers that were economically devastated by challenging economic and business conditions engendered by a massive slowdown in air travel. Although this risk was a critical second-order impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, it is of primary importance for national security entities. Looking ahead, national security organizations will need to more aggressively monitor economic and business risks of critical vendors. This is just as true for large vendors as it is for startups that provide essential materiel to the defense industry. How the government addresses these risks in the future is up for debate, but one thing seems certain: Even if national security vendors are not too big to fail, they may be too important to fail.
At times in 2020, when the greatest number of Americans were forced to shelter in place or quarantine, the most visible part of the supply chain-e-commerce retail-helped keep the economy functioning. The applications and offerings for retail goods, restaurant food, and grocery delivery, which had been expanding for years, found their moment in the sun and kept people supplied with necessities-even if, at times, an almost overburdened system required scheduling food delivery several weeks in advance. In the face of COVID-19 challenges, the food and grocery parts of the e-commerce supply chain grew significantly. In fact, e-commerce as a sector expanded rapidly in 2020. In the second quarter of 2020, U.S. e-commerce retailers accounted for 15.7 percent of all retail sales. This was up from 11.4 percent in the first quarter of 2020 and up from the 10.7 percent average for all of 2019.

For supply chain, this means e-commerce percentages of total retail sales in coming quarters may be lower than those seen in the second quarter of 2020. But e-commerce percentages of total retail sales are still likely to exceed the e-commerce activity of 2019. Plus, U.S. e-commerce dollar levels are poised to remain strong and rise further to new highs. In fact, e-commerce spending in the first quarter of 2021 hit a new record level that eclipsed the previous peak in the second quarter of 2020.
These dynamics of the new, new normal are also likely to impact various industries and sectors that experienced significant changes in 2020, including remote work, online education, telehealth, real estate, and travel. Another lasting impact of the new, new normal is likely to be people's situational awareness of supply chain. It will hopefully be a very long time before people wait up in the middle of the night for the clock to strike midnight and food delivery slots to open up for a date three weeks in the future. But the memories of food insecurity during the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to cast a long shadow over consumer behaviors for many years. In fact, consumers may continue to remember the importance of supply chain and e-commerce technologies, even when these are no longer top-of-mind concerns in a post-pandemic world.
While e-commerce and technology are levers of opportunity for supply chain, enhanced security will also be increasingly critical in the next decade-especially for supply chains. Security issues could pose a number of disruptive impacts. Supply chains are likely to be disrupted by transportation hijacking, hacking, and cyber ransom. Alternatively, on-site machinery, flying warehouse drones, or even entire fleets of autonomous trucks could be hacked and held for cyber ransom. And, of course, customer data could be stolen, and financial accounts could be hacked. In truth, there are myriad risks from different kinds of security threats. There are also growing counterfeiting risks.
Cybersecurity risks are likely to be detected, either by software or because of a ransomware demand. But the big security risk posed by counterfeiting technology is likely to remain intentionally difficult to identify. Plus, over the next decade, counterfeit goods are likely to become increasingly more difficult to detect. The most vulnerable goods to this kind of risk are military goods, dual-use technology goods, pharmaceuticals, and high-value consumer technology goods, putting national security risks in play as well as financial and business risks. Many technologies are likely to be deployed over the next 10 years to ensure the integrity of the supply chain, including blockchain as a more comprehensive and permanent record as well as other new kinds of physical marking and virtual technologies. Marking goods is a way to prevent counterfeiting and to protect intellectual property. Although likely to be used initially for goods of high technological, high intellectual property, or military value, marking goods will become increasingly important for many parts of the supply chain as the transition continues to an intellectual capital economy.
There are a number of value-adds from securely marking goods at the beginning of the supply chain and testing them throughoutand at the end of-the supply chain. These value-adds include ensuring the vendor of goods can be verified, the intermediary location of goods can be verified, and the end customers can verify that they have received genuine goods. Even simply deploying this technology may reduce counterfeiting and hijacking of goods shipments-especially if markings are a critical part of verifying the authenticity by end consumers. In practical terms, nanotechnology markings, which are invisible to the naked eye, could be placed on inverted delta parts for airplanes and verified by the customer. Blockchain technology could also be integrated with marking technology to verify the supply chain parties involved in every physical transaction of the goods throughout their chain of custody. As with other blockchain technology use cases, the integrated use of securely marking goods and blockchain will be most valuable for protecting individual consumers and for providing greater transparency for high-value supply chain goods.
Unfortunately, marking goods and using blockchain will not mitigate or solve all supply chain risks. After all, drones could be increasingly used for hijacking with little risk to the individuals involved, and supply chain security technologies will not protect the intellectual capital value chain. Plus, there are still risks posed by the people in any system. No one technology is likely to be sufficient.
Even though we may think that supply chains are secure or imagine new technologies like blockchain to be a panacea, there are still risks. Perhaps most importantly, from a cybersecurity standpoint, will be the impact of quantum computing as a means to crack encryptions and wreak havoc. If blockchain and current forms of cryptography are the better mousetrap, quantum computing threatens to be a better mouse. Nothing will be safe. Most disconcertingly, China has been taking a significant lead in quantum computing technology for years and made tremendous technological strides during 2020. It is a race we cannot afford to lose-because of risks posed not just to supply chains and the cybersecurity of corporations, but also to national security encryption.
The risks to supply chain during 2020 were all too clear-as were the benefits of e-commerce technologies that supported societal and economic stability. Looking to the decade ahead, the technologies that guide and threaten our supply chains will become increasingly complex. Opportunities and risks will be even greater with increased complexity. This means that the solution to securing U.S. supply chains-especially of critical goods like pharmaceuticals, hightechnology goods, aircraft parts, rare earth minerals, and materielwill also need to be multifaceted and complex. There will not be one silver bullet solution that gets us to-or at least temporarily keeps us living in-a more secure world.
Necessary and sufficient conditions for secure supply chains require a leveling up. Tracking numbers is not enough. Blockchain is not enough. Securely marking goods with nanotechnology is not enough. The future approach to supply chain security will require a broad array of technologies that incorporate and integrate higher volumes of data, real-time imagery, and documentation. This is especially true as the greatest risks to the supply chain remain people who could be compromised. Yes, blockchain can provide records that allow for potentially easier forensic accounting and examination. But all that really does is provide a list of the usual suspects to round up if something goes awry. Blockchain cannot prevent the supply chain from being compromised in real time. And I suspect that the main sources of compromise in the future will be the same as they have been in the past. These are best represented by the acronym MICE: money, ideology, compromise, or ego. Furthermore, blockchains could prove to be significantly less resilient in the face of Chinese quantum supremacy.
In the same way that passwords and logins for sensitive and financial accounts are moving to two-way authorization systems, there is likely to be a greater need for a multi-pronged approach to mitigate the risks across the supply chain. A digital record as well as visual imagery, coupled with invisible, inviolable markings, could help ensure authenticity of goods. In a post-COVID-19 world, this is critical enough for vaccines. But it will also be increasingly critical for technological goods-especially if there is an eventual bifurcation of global supply chains as the great power competition between the United States and China heats up in the decade ahead and beyond.
The notion to consider here is that if man can make it, he can break it. This represents the two sides of each technology coin: the upside opportunity and the downside risk. An example of this idea is how industrial drones that may transport pipelines to remote oil pads can also be used to hijack shipments of exotic fruits, auto parts, or cobalt. This concept is the origin of my final recommendation regarding the future of supply chain. To deal with increasingly complex dynamics, the approach to future supply chain security, from a national security perspective, needs to be one that embraces futures thinking. It is important for national security professionals to approach the challenges of the future in a way that recognizes the trends of the past and the data of the present, as well as the myriad future outcomes that could be driven by emerging technologies-and by those that are yet to be discovered.
This analytic process involves examining trends and data, as well as identifying fundamental truths and recognizing that "this time" is never different. In the supply chain world, this means that long-term economic and societal stability will continue to hinge on access to food and goods as well as the associated public belief in the security and surety of those supply chains. Additionally, there is a need to recognize that we live in a Rousseauian world of limited resources. This means there will be incentives for disruption of a system that favors legacy participants. The United States faces tremendous challenges, but-in a decade-we may find something surprising. We may find that China's supply chains are being disrupted even more than our own.
The best thing we can do now to prepare for the future is to understand the levers of risk and opportunity that will determine the future. COVID-19 is a salient example of how supply chain systems can be exposed and contribute to uncertainty. But COVID-19 has also revealed the opportunities of e-commerce, underscoring the value proposition and potential for technology to support economic operations and social order at a time of human distraction, disorder, and suffering. Finding more ways to use technology to bridge potential social and economic stability gaps represents a tremendous opportunity for national security, and I expect it will be increasingly important in the future.

Will Iredale and Jack Grimston, "Britain 'Four Meals Away from Anarchy, '" Sunday Times, October 10, 2004,  
The Human Development Approach-now more than 30 years oldwas born in part to challenge thinking that saw economic growth as synonymous with increases in well-being and progress.
For the latter half of the 20th century there was "an implicit assumption that economic growth was synonymous with progress: an assumption that a growing gross domestic product (GDP) meant life must be getting better. But now the world recognizes that it isn't quite as simple as that. " 1 Yet GDP was never designed to be used as a proxy for wellbeing. Simon Kuznets, one of the fathers of the system of national accounts, showed remarkable prescience in 1934, writing to the U.S. Congress that "the welfare of a nation can scarcely be inferred from a measurement of national income. "

Too much and too long, we seem to have surrendered community excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our gross national product ... if we should judge America by that-counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for those who break them. It counts the destruction of our redwoods and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and the cost of a nuclear warhead, and armored cars for police who fight riots in our streets. It counts Whitman's rifle and Speck's knife, and the television programs which glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children.
Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education, or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages; the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage; neither our wisdom nor our learning; neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country; it measures everything, in short, except that which COVID-19 and Inequality in Human Development makes life worthwhile. And it tells us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.

As Amartya Sen, one of the creators of the Human Development Approach, has said, "Human development, as an approach, is concerned with what I take to be the basic development idea: namely, advancing the richness of human life, rather than the richness of the economy in which human beings live, which is only a part of it. People: Human development focuses on improving the lives people lead rather than assuming that economic growth will lead, automatically, to greater well-being for all. Income growth is seen as a means to development, rather than an end in itself.
Opportunities: Human development is about giving people more freedom to live lives they value. In effect this means developing people's abilities and giving them a chance to use them. For example, educating a girl would build her skills, but it is of little use if she is denied access to jobs or does not have the right skills for the local labor market. Three foundations for human development are to live a long, healthy, and creative life; to be knowledgeable; and to have access to resources needed for a decent standard of living. Many other things are important, too, especially in helping to create the right conditions for human development. Once the basics of human development are achieved, they open up opportunities for progress in other aspects of life.
Choice: Human development is, fundamentally, about more choice. It is about providing people with opportunities, not insisting that they make use of them. No one can guarantee human happiness, and the choices people make are their own concern. The process of development-human development-should at least create an environment for people, individually and collectively, to develop to their full potential and to have a reasonable chance of leading productive and creative lives that they value.
Measurement is an important facet of quantifying and promoting human development thinking. Human Development Reports, since the first in 1990, has published the Human Development Index (HDI) that ranks all the world's countries by their level of human development (see Figure 
1
That said, the dimensions of human development include:
• Education, Health, and Command over Resources: Particularly income and nutrition. • Participation and Freedom: Particularly empowerment, gender equality, and civil and political rights. • Human Security: In daily life against chronic threats, such as hunger, and abrupt disruptions including joblessness, famine, conflict, crime, etc. • Equity: In the distribution of all of the above.
• Sustainability: For future generations in ecological, economic, and social terms.
And so, when considering the impact of COVID-19 on inequality, we will consider its impact on many facets of human development. All of these elements are important and, when taken together, paint a much more detailed picture of life than would be presented using a narrower focus on income inequality. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has hit all the key dimensions of human development. By late January 2021, it has caused within one year more than 2 million confirmed direct deaths, surpassing the annual deaths caused by malaria, HIV/AIDS, interpersonal violence, conflict, and international terrorism combined.

It is too early for a comprehensive assessment of the consequences of COVID-19 on human development (as we write in early 2021, daily deaths were higher than at any point during 2020). The likely impacts on people's capabilities can be simulated, however, using a version of the HDI that is more sensitive to the effects of COVID-19. This adjusted index retains the standard HDI dimensions but modifies the education indicators to reflect the effects of school closures and other COVID-related impacts on education.
During 2020 the capabilities accounted for in the HDI-health, education, and income-were all severely affected:
• Income: Global gross national product per capita is estimated to have fallen more than 5 percent in 2020. 12
• Education: Whether students are actively engaged in education depends on physical and virtual access to learning. The disruption in education has been unprecedented. During 2020 schools closed in most countries at some point, affecting more than 1.4 billion young people-around 86 percent of the world's student population-in April 2020 at the peak of school closures.

In many countries, schools and universities have moved their courses and learning online. Yet access to technology is unequal 20 because, while there is convergence in access to basic technologies such as mobile phones, digital gaps between and within countries are widening in areas like access to computers, Internet, and broadband. These are all examples of what the Human Development Report in 2019 defined as "enhanced capabilities" (or the new necessities for life in the 21st century). 
21
With widespread school closures during 2020, technology was used to continue the learning process. This positive development from the technological revolution has supported the resilience of education for some in the face of shocks.
After accounting for those still learning from home, what was the effective out-of-school rate during the peak of school closures in April 2020? Adjusting the percentage of primary school-age children facing school closures to account for those in households with Internet access sheds some light, yielding an optimistic estimate of the out-of-school rate that assumes every child with Internet access can continue learning. Assuming Internet access ensures continued learning also provides an optimistic estimate of inequalities between countries because it does not account for differences that will arise according to how wealthy countries are, whether broadband is widespread, and so on.
The effective out-of-school rate jumped substantially everywhere in 2020 (even under optimistic assumptions). For primary education, the out-of-school rate was highest in low human development countries, 22 rising to 86 percent of primary school-age children, an increase of 59 percentage points. This was followed by medium human development countries (74 percent, an increase of 68 percentage points-the largest reversal) and high human development countries (47 percent, an increase of 41 percentage points). Only in very high human development countries have most primary school-age children been able-potentially at least-to continue structured learning, with an effective out-of-school rate of 20 percent (an increase of 19 percentage points). 
23
Notes: Data account for 86 percent of students in primary school-age children worldwide.
The effective out-of-school rate has several caveats. First, a different indicator could be used to reflect access to online learning. Second, the rate does not account for other factors such as access to a device, least of all a personal device. Overall, this measure provides a rough estimate of the disruptive impacts of school closure.

The COVID-19 crisis is a systemic human development crisis, and its effects go far beyond its impacts on health, education, and income. The pandemic's effects on inequality have been diverse, not least because some of the consequences of COVID-19 have had a greater impact on people who were already disadvantaged.
During the first months of the pandemic, without vaccine or therapeutics, most of the measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 were nonpharmaceutical interventions. The strategy of reducing contagion aimed not just to protect the most vulnerable populations, but also to avoid strain on health care systems. Even countries with plenty of hospital beds became overwhelmed during the pandemic's peaks, 24 so reducing virus transmission was important. In general, developed countries were faster to react (see Figure 
4
More developed countries have secured access to most of the vaccine doses. The Duke Global Health Innovation Center estimated that, as of January 20, 2021, high-income nations had secured 4.2 billion doses. On the other hand, more populous, lower income countries had secured orders for only 680 million doses. 25 Note: Single doses are counted, which may not equal the total number of people vaccinated, depending on a vaccine's specific dose regime (e.g., some vaccines call for an individual to receive multiple doses).
Source: Coronavirus (COVID-19) Vaccinations, Our World in Data, accessed March 4, 2021, https:// ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations.
Vaccination rates between countries also vary enormously. Although data should be interpreted with caution, in part because some vaccines require two doses and others one dose, the scale of difference in vaccinating one's population is stark. As of January 20, 2021, Israel had administered a total number of doses equal to almost one-third of its population, while Brazil's total was fewer than 1/1000th of the Brazilian population (see Figure

These effects are intertwined with varying propagation patterns. Very high human development countries, for the most part, suffered the health shock first and responded with strong health systems and supportive monetary and fiscal policies. By September 2020, $12 trillion had been devoted to finance emergency fiscal programs, most of them-around $10 trillion -in the G20 economies.

Women are also more often on the frontline of the COVID-19 response, putting them at a higher risk of exposure to the virus. They make up 70 percent of the workers in the health and social services sector globally, 49 and they constitute most health facility service staff.

Widespread lockdowns around the world mean many women and girls are being asked to stay home and isolate in a space that is supposed to be safe but often is not, increasing the risk they will go hungry or suffer gender-based violence. Already toxic social norms, combined with increased economic and social stress from the pandemic, have driven an increase in gender-based violence, with many women in lockdown with their abusers. 
57
Globally, women spend an average of 3.2 more hours a day on unpaid care and domestic work than men. 
58
59

Note: Refers to the population ages 15 and older. Education is crucial to allowing women to increase their ability to make decisions and act on them. School closures and lockdowns, however, mean that as many as 10 million girls at the secondary-school level could be out of school due to the crisis. 
60
Looking even further beyond the crisis, it becomes more difficult to predict the impact of the pandemic on inequalities. But the forecast is not rosy.
First, there might be scarring effects particularly among young people. Education shutdowns or long-term unemployment when first entering the labor market, for example, might hurt people for the rest of their lives.
Second, inequalities in some of the less tangible aspects of life, such as trust in institutions and in each other, have also widened between and within countries. 
62
63
• In the United States, the impact of the pandemic on people's emotions-including depression-appears to have been worse among those who have little trust in others. 64 • Inequalities in trust also impact our ability to manage shocks in the future: "trust in government by citizens and businesses is essential for effective and efficient policy making both in good times and bad. " 65 Even before the COVID-19 pandemic struck, the 2019 Human Development Report had showcased remaining gaps in traditional areas of inequality along with widening gaps in new domains. 
67
Notwithstanding the pandemic, climate change and technological transformation have exacerbated these growth trends in enhanced-capability inequality, as the most vulnerable populations are often the most severely impacted by shocks. Climate change, in particular, is slowing economic progress and sharpening inequalities, as explored in the 2020 Human Development Report. 
68
70
71
Some of the public policy responses to the pandemic have aimed at a green recovery, but these have mostly been pursued by high-income countries. 
72
73
The effects of COVID-19 are unprecedented in their impact on inequality. The effects are real and significant between countries, within countries, and across almost any aspect of human development you might consider: from the health of people to the health of our planet's climate; in education, employment, and income; and from our trust in each other to inequality between men and women.
Moreover, in many cases, an individual's place in the pyramid of existing inequalities has played a role in determining the direct and indirect impacts of the pandemic. In the United States, for example, "Black and Latino Americans have experienced a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, reflecting persistent structural inequalities that increase risk of exposure to COVID-19 and mortality risk for those infected. " 
74
This chapter has touched on just some of these areas to convey the sweeping scale of the challenge. Much of the data are preliminary, and it would be courageous to try to put more precision on what has happened-and will happen-to inequality in light of COVID-19.
We can be certain that inequality is set to worsen around the world because of COVID-19. And we can be sure that inequality-at all levels of geography-will have an important influence on national security. We saw the impact of growing inequality in 2019 with social unrest in several countries. But the future is not set in stone. As always, every country has a choice in determining where its people will head, as we try to "build back better" from the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has already contributed to political unrest and the deterioration of democracy worldwide. In multiple countries, leaders immediately used the exigencies of a health emergency to centralize power and reduce democratic freedoms. We argue that, beyond this direct, and perhaps short-term effect, the pandemic is likely to have long-term indirect consequences arising from its effects on the economy. Studies show that economic crises often increase economic inequality. Ample evidence suggests this has been particularly true about this pandemic, notably because most low-wage occupations cannot be done from home. Moreover, racial and ethnic minorities have suffered greater harm, which has increased inequality between racial/ethnic groups.
Research also has demonstrated that inequality, particularly when it overlaps with race/ethnicity, is a leading determinant of political instability and democratic deterioration. Thus, this pandemic is likely to increase instability and harm democracy worldwide, and the impact is likely to be long-lasting, because inequality is highly sticky within countries over time-only changing in response to major events, such as wars.
We conclude by pointing to potential policies that could help preserve political stability and democracy; primarily that inequality should be squarely addressed as policymakers design their economic aid packages.
The COVID-19 Pandemic, Economic Inequality, and Democracy
The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has already contributed to political unrest and the deterioration of democracy in multiple countries, including Bolivia, Brazil, 1 Hungary, India, Israel, the Philippines, and Thailand.

The pandemic has also given license to authoritarian countries to further restrict dissent, under the cover of enforcing social distancing rules needed to quell the virus. For example, China and Russia have doubled down on controlling their populations through the ever more intrusive use of artificial intelligence and social media.

Our work using cross-country data analysis shows that concerns about the long-term inequality effects of the economic crisis provoked by the pandemic are warranted. Looking at 66 countries between 1960 and 2010, we show that economic crises are drivers of income inequality. 
31
The Long-term Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic crises play out in the long run, and, thus, the political consequences of a major financial crisis, like that of 2008 or the ongoing economic slump linked to the pandemic, have yet to be fully realized.
The mechanisms behind our findings have ample empirical support. Most directly, the unemployment spikes and lower economic growth that characterize economic crises more severely affect lowskill, low-income individuals.

Most of the large body of literature on the effect of inequality on political unrest focuses on a country's overall inequality level, often called vertical inequality: that is, the inequality among the country's citizens, regardless of their cultural (ethnic or religious) group. This is often measured using Gini coefficients. Some also use capital shares as an indicator of inequality between the social classes. Capital shares measure the proportion of created wealth that accrues to the owner of capital, as opposed to the laborers. Most authors find that vertical inequality and interclass inequality fuel diverse forms of political unrest, such as antigovernment demonstrations, riots, and even small-scale popular rebellions.

In short, the previous literature suggests that the rise in inequality and reduction in social mobility caused by the coronavirus will, at a minimum, foster low-level civil unrest worldwide. Horizontal inequality has arguably already contributed to the protests associated with the Black Lives Matter movement. As explained above, the COVID-19 pandemic has had more impact on some groups than on others. In the United States, for example, racial minorities have experienced greater economic harm, which has increased racial inequality. If inequality between culturally defined groups increases in other countries, we could also witness an increase in the number of civil wars across the world.
An established body of literature has investigated the effect of economic inequality and social mobility on democratic stability and survival. Most authors find inequality and low social mobility destabilize already established democracies. 
57,
58
59
A number of mechanisms drive the relationship between inequality and social mobility, on the one hand, and democratic stability, on the other. First, as explained above, inequality and downward social mobility foster political unrest. Political unrest often, in turn, leads to authoritarian responses by governments, as exemplified by the clearing of peaceful protesters in Lafayette Square in Washington, DC, on June 1, 2020. 60 More broadly, political instability erodes the public trust necessary to maintain a viable democracy and creates opportunities for governments to adopt oppressive measures.
Second, inequality also fosters distributional conflicts, which, in turn, destabilize democracy.

In sum, the coronavirus induced rise in inequality is likely to harm democracy worldwide by breeding political instability, fostering distributional conflicts, and weakening support for democratic norms. The fact that the coronavirus has increased inequality between culturally defined groups suggests that its adverse effect on democracy may be particularly pronounced.
The COVID-19 pandemic has already weakened democracy in Brazil, Ethiopia, Hungary, Russia, Tanzania, Uganda, and other countries. We argue that, even after the health situation has stabilized, the coronavirus is likely to exert long-term damage to democracy and political stability worldwide. This is because the COVID-19 pandemic will also have an indirect effect: the economic crisis it caused has led to an increase in inequality, which according to the literature is likely to increase political unrest and destabilize democracies, even in the long run. Inequality is notoriously sticky within countries over time.

Latin America experienced the second biggest pandemic-induced economic contraction of any region in 2020, just behind the Euro-zone,

Several compounding structural factors will weigh heavily on Latin America's ability to recover from the COVID-19 crisis; the region's inherently high civil unrest risk is among the most significant. As the socioeconomic fallout from COVID-19 mounts, global protesters' ranks are likely to swell during the next two years, and unrest will sweep across developed, emerging, and frontier markets alike.
According to data from Verisk Maplecroft's Civil Unrest Index projections, 75 countries are likely to experience an increase in protests by late 2022. Of these, 34-predominantly in Europe and the Americas-are likely to see a particularly significant deterioration, defined as a projected decrease of 0.5 or more on the Civil Unrest Index score. 
6

Initially, governments' emergency spending helped quell demonstrations, but those measures largely came to an end, or were reduced, in 2021. The belt-tightening is affecting food and fuel subsidies-a textbook catalyst of unrest. Argentina, projected to experience the eighth most significant rise in unrest risk by August 2022, is one of the countries most exposed to protests driven by government aid withdrawal. Meanwhile, in Brazil, growing political polarization and the massive economic and health toll of the COVID-19 pandemic are expected to deepen the risk of protests from both sides of the political divide. Figure

Rising political instability will dominate Latin America in the early 2020s. In addition to increasing the potential for supply chain disruption, the region's civil unrest risk makes for a more volatile political landscape, undermining elected governments' stability across the region. The outbreak of COVID-19 did not start the fire. Still, it has undoubtedly aggravated the underlying socioeconomic tension that provoked mass street protests across the region in 2019, which in turn eroded political stability-a trend that intensified in 2020.
Verisk Maplecroft's Political Stability Index indicates that 77 percent of the 26 countries in the Americas included in the dataset are likely to see an increase in political instability during the Index's two-year timeframe.

At the executive level, the main threat to stability in 2021 will be along the Pacific coastline of South America. Protests were already ticking up well before the pandemic hit, indicating heavy public disillusionment with elected officials embroiled in serious corruption scandals. Chile, Ecuador, and Peru all experienced extended social unrest and political instability in 2019 and 2020, which threatened or succeeded in toppling the governments. Chile and Peru have seen the most unstable cabinets in a generation, and the ministerial revolving doors have all but eliminated the effective implementation of government policies. Governments from Santiago to Quito remain on the back foot as the pandemic has further eroded public support for high-profile presidents and emboldened legislatures and other institutions to challenge these executives. In Peru, the legislative branch forced a change in the executive in November 2020, which triggered mass mobilizations that caused another change in government. Verisk Maplecroft's Political Stability Index identifies the most significant risk of further deterioration in Peru, where the revolving political door has seen three presidents serving since the election in 2016. That year, Peru experienced the most challenging election and transition since the country's return to democracy. The Index projects, with a 75.9 percent probability, that the country's stability score will worsen during the next two years. The collapse of traditional national parties under the weight of corruption scandals has created a fragmented political scene that resulted in a wide-open and unpredictable second round runoff between far-right and far-left candidates. Peru's glut of small populist regional parties have benefitted from the economic crisis and social discontent, with each gaining solid support. Although Peruvians traditionally place a very high value on macroeconomic stability at the ballot box, the 2021 presidential contest could propel an untested radical newcomer-rather than the typical moderate-over the line.
In Ecuador, the outcome has been only marginally better, and political stability will be on a knife-edge during the next two years. The presidential election pit the radical left against the traditional right, with the latter returned to office after 15 years in opposition. And although the more business friendly candidate, Guillermo Lasso, emerged victorious, the unicameral National Assembly will remain very polarized, threatening to derail policy implementation. The return of the government's traditional right means policy continuity with the pro-business reforms of the outgoing President, center-left Lenin Moreno. However, it also means a continuation of the current International Monetary Fund-supported austerity program and public sector reform agenda. In the context of a very depressed economy and a restive, potentially uncooperative National Assembly, this intensifies the risk of widespread popular discontent under a new government.
Last, Chile is caught up in an electoral Iron Man race that will see voters heading to the ballot box no less than four times in 2021 to vote on constitutional reform and municipal and general elections. With Chile's Political Stability Index score having already deteriorated dramatically after the 2019 unrest, Verisk Maplecroft's current forecast sees a 47.9 percent risk of further deterioration in the next two years.

As Latin American populations grow increasingly disillusioned with political leaders at both the local and national levels, political instability risks will rise, and the widespread backlash against government authorities will provide opportunities for criminal groups to infiltrate the political system and to control territory, production, and distribution networks. The pandemic had an unexpected impact on the profitability of DTO activity. The containment measures implemented across the region included border closures and enhanced screenings by transit and customs authorities, severely disrupting the licit supply chains that drug traffickers rely on to ship narcotics. The resulting decrease in drug supply caused street prices to rise, which, in turn, triggered a spike in violent competition within local consumer markets that fuelled preexisting turf wars. 
11
12
DTOs and smaller criminal organizations have capitalized on the pandemic to tighten territorial control and capture the state's role. The pandemic provided an opportunity to broaden a strategy already used in remote rural areas. Indeed, criminal groups violently enforced lockdown measures and provided relief to communities. In Mexico, for instance, the Jalisco Nueva Generación Cartel, Los Viagras, the Gulf Cartel, and the Sinaloa Cartel delivered branded packages of food and personal protective equipment. 
13
The COVID-19 crisis hit the Americas at a time when social tension was already building. The unrest that erupted in Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, and Ecuador in 2019 and early 2020 remained at high levels in many countries during 2020. Peru joined the list of the jurisdictions where protests included fatalities and allegations of human rights violations by the security forces. Albeit less disruptive, demonstrations also remained at 2019 levels in Brazil and increased in Argentina and Mexico. The pandemic's impact-and that of the response strategies that have accompanied it-have only made the social discontent underlying this unrest all the worse. The Recovery Capacity Index shows that Latin America is the world's least economically dynamic region after Africa, constraining the region's ability to rebound. Most countries are highly dependent on primary commodity exports. Weaker global demand and the pandemic-related disruption to local and international supply chains have heavily damaged these exports, which have dropped sharply across the board.
Given all of this, the pandemic threatens to reverse a decade or more of gains against poverty. In most countries, unemployment has spiked, pushing more people into informal jobs and outside the social safety net. The International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that the average unemployment rate in Latin America, which it put at 8.1 percent at the beginning of 2020, could increase by as much as five percentage points by year-end. 14 This is a conservative estimate, considering that unemployment levels have already reached much higher rates in several countries. In Colombia, for instance, unemployment in May 2020 had reached 21.4 percent, more than double the 10.5 percent in May 2019. Although the rate had since come down to 14.7 percent in October 2020, that is still four percentage points above the 2019 rate. 
15
Although exacerbated by COVID-19 and its inflicted economic malaise, protests continue to be primarily driven by domestic structural issues, such as socioeconomic inequality, the rising cost of living, and the rise in nativism and populism. Indeed, 2020 is unlikely to be an outlier-but rather a harbinger of things to come, not just within the next two years but also for much of the coming decade.
In the most vulnerable countries, the ranks of protesters marching against longstanding grievances are likely to continue to swell, with millions of newly unemployed, underpaid, and underfed citizens posing a risk to domestic stability, a scenario with few parallels in recent decades. Organized criminal groups in the region will seek to exploit this situation as an opportunity to increase their power by expanding recruitment and seeking to co-opt the political system at the local level and influence national politics.
The pandemic has opened opportunities to deepen and expand illicit activities, which are likely to lead to stronger, localized criminal cells. This will sustain high levels of violence and increase common criminality, particularly in vulnerable communities. The pandemic's economic fallout is likely to bolster the role of organized crime as the employment needs of remote localities increase. The decline of living standards in rural areas will increase the availability of recruits for organized crime groups. The strong presence of criminal organizations will increase violence around common crimes.
During the next two years, governments in Latin America will need to ensure continued support, through economic growth and formal employment, to vulnerable communities. Failure to do so will exacerbate popular discontent with political elites, undermining political stability and increasing the risk of 'outsider' candidates seizing power. Across the region, local gangs, drug trafficking, and organized crime groups would have the opportunity to grow stronger. The depressed economic and political landscape would open a two-track opportunity to increase operational capacity, territorial control, and formal institutions' capture. Law-abiding citizens taking to the streets to denounce political elites' failure to meet their needs may find the result is not what they bargained for.

Background: Analytic Oversight and the 2014 Ascent of ISIS
In June 2014, U.S. and partner intelligence and national security strategists were taken by strategic surprise when ISIS exploited state and nation failures in Iraq and Syria to establish the so-called Islamic Caliphate. This area, which stretched for more than 280,000 square kilometers from Aleppo, Syria, to Diyala, Iraq, was home to more than 10 million people.

State failure occurs when a government fails to deliver political goods to citizens on a scale that undermines the legitimacy and existence of the state. These political goods include security, a legal system to adjudicate disputes, provision of economic and communication infrastructures, some form of social services, and opportunities to participate in the political process. 
12
13
According to counterterrorism scholars, the ground and information operations ISIS undertook to create its nation-state entailed capturing and defending territory; extracting revenue to finance its institutions and war efforts; building systems of government to sustain these gains; and cultivating a shared sense of citizenship within this establishment.

In 2019, the U.S. Operation INHERENT RESOLVE-led coalition significantly degraded ISIS's military capabilities and liberated former ISISheld territories in Iraq and Syria, dismantling the physical caliphate, minimizing its ability to extract revenue, and eliminating its system of government. However, the transnational organization, although decentralized and globally dispersed, is loyal to new ISIS-core leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurashi, and the caliphate's national identity remains intact. This study considers prospects for ISIS to reclaim territory in Iraq and Syria and restore its national identity within established borders. We weigh pandemic-era conditions in Iraq and Syria and current ISIS ground and information operations against the criteria necessary for ISIS to regain a monopoly of force to help analysts and decision makers better understand the imminence and scope of the threat. These criteria include a permissive regional environment; organizational prowess; strategic selection of targets; and ideological uniformity and motivation-adding to the last the reassertion of shared citizenship.
Pandemic-accelerated U.S. and coalition drawdowns and diversions of forces are creating security vacuums in Iraq and Syria. Iraq's fractured security forces are overwhelmed by popular unrest, Iranian attacks against the United States and U.S. targets in Iraq, and clashes between Iranian-backed militias and Iraqi forces. In Syria, the Kurdish-dominated Syrian Defense Forces (SDF), backed by the U.S.-led coalition, are beset by Turkish incursions in the north and are battling regime-affiliated and violent extremist challengers Syria-wide. As a result, they are struggling in some areas to provide security to local populations belonging to other ethnic and sectarian groups that dispute the SDF's legitimacy.
Iraq's early attempts to contain COVID-19 failed largely because Iraqi disillusionment with the government made it difficult to implement and enforce protocols. 17 As a result, Iraq has had more than 500,000 cases and 12,411 deaths, although these numbers and their context are difficult to confirm because the Iraqi government forbids medical personnel from publicly discussing the situation.

The number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in Syria is unknown because the government requires all information to be channeled through the Ministry of Health, which the government tightly controls. However, on October 8, 2020, Syria Relief, the UK-based Syrian advocacy NGO, citing independently gathered data, declared COVID-19 an emergency in Syria. Syria Relief 's Head of Advocacy, Charles Lawley, called on the international community to provide aid.
The destruction of hospitals and medical facilities during Syria's civil war has depleted the medical infrastructure and equipment needed to cope with the pandemic. Approximately 40 percent of Syria's healthcare facilities have been destroyed, and roughly two million displaced people live in overcrowded camps 25 where self-isolation is nearly impossible and proper sanitation and hygiene are hard to maintain. The risk of an outbreak is high, and the camps lack the healthcare capacity to manage the virus and treat patients.

ISIS evolved from its progenitor organization the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) by capitalizing on post-Arab Spring regional destabilization, insecurity stemming from the U.S. military withdrawal from Iraq, and spillover effects of the Syrian civil war.
• The sectarian conflict between Sunni and Shia groupings in Iraq allowed ISIS to offer an alternative to the increasingly Shia dominated government.
• As the uprisings across the Arab world erupted, ISIS infiltrated Syria, exploiting longstanding animosities between the Sunni majority and President Assad's repressive Shia-Alawite minority regime and offering stability relative to the chaos of the Civil War.
The spread of COVID-19 has allowed ISIS to exploit insecurity, weak governance, and social unrest in Iraq and Syria.
• The Iraqi Security Force's violent reaction to Iraqi protestors demonstrating against Iranian influence is aggravating sectarian tension.
• Pandemic-associated security vacuums and the fraying social fabric in both countries allow ISIS to move between western Iraq and central Syria and restore access to critical infrastructure and networks.
• ISIS is increasing kinetic attacks and information operations to exacerbate ethno-sectarianism, discredit both governments, and hasten Iraqi and Syrian state and nation failure.
In August, the United Nations estimated approximately 10,000 active ISIS militants were operating in Iraq and Syria, a level equivalent to 2012 and roughly a third of their estimated 31,500 presence in 2014.

The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has revived ISIS-core information operations as the organization attempts to capitalize on deteriorating conditions to advance its nation-rebuilding ambitions. ISIS is using insurgent operators and various media platforms to amplify pandemic-exacerbated insecurity in Iraq and Syria; erode Iraqi's and Syrian's sense of citizenship; galvanize ideological uniformity and motivation among its ranks; and reclaim ISIS national identity. These operations-consisting of word-of-mouth influence activities, propaganda material, social media campaigns, and ISIS publications-promote and reinvigorate existing ISIS narratives, which are experiencing increased power and currency as a result of the pandemic's erosion of material, political, and ideological conditions in the region, while also renewing a commitment to action among its followers. ISIS online recruitment has also been reenergized, emphasizing an increased sense of urgency, and the group is well-funded, with reserves estimated at between $50 million and $300 million.

Although still in the nascent stages of resurgence, ISIS appears to be poised for recovery given the release of ISIS leaders, fighters, and families from camps and prisons; the increasingly permissive conditions in Iraq and Syria; and the lack of direct pressure to stop the organization. All indications suggest analysts can expect progressively permissive conditions; increasingly sophisticated and targeted attacks; an expanding, ideologically unified militant force; and thus, a growing capacity to reclaim territory, populations, and resources. In the past, ISIS's success in nation-making was based on dogmatic compliance to its principles, adhering to the notions of religious imperative and divine inevitability. 58 ISIS media's framing of COVID-19 as "divine punishment" builds on this established national identity, and the organization is likely to reap the ideological gains. By portraying enemy nations as weak and vulnerable, ISIS may be able to energize its followers, posing security threats now and in the future.

Although ISIS's current approach to nation-and state-making is similar to its previous efforts, the effects of COVID-19 deepen the grievances on which the organization's influence depends.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been much more than a health crisis.
In addition to killing millions of the more than 180 million infected worldwide, 1 it has caused significant economic and social harm and poses new and unprecedented threats to public health and human security. The global economy declined more than 4 percent in 2020,

The challenges of online criminal activity, evident before the COVID-19 pandemic, have accelerated in 2020 and 2021. Criminals have capitalized on health vulnerabilities, isolation, and economic hardship to make significant profits during this challenging period. Massive amounts of fraudulent equipment and medical supplies such as counterfeit masks have entered supply chains, which has possibly compounded the death rate as individuals are not adequately protected by masks or are treated by personnel with inferior or substandard counterfeit respirators.

In addition to pandemic's impacts on transnational crimes, including human and drug trafficking, this chapter will focus on environmental and financial crimes, as well as the trade in counterfeits. At the March 2021 United Nations Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice, speakers highlighted the need for continued international cooperation in combating cybercrime and environmental crime.

As the pandemic has pushed large parts of society onto their phones, tablets, and laptops, online fraud has grown rapidly. In its COVID-19 Cybercrime Analysis Report, INTERPOL noted a sharp rise in online scams and cybercrimes, including phishing, disruptive technology, data harvesting, malware, malicious domains, and pandemic-related misinformation schemes, all of which capitalize on the uncertainty of the pandemic.

The rise in unemployment also enables the spread of malware such as info-stealers and more sophisticated banking Trojan horses. According to the Organized Crime Corruption and Reporting Project (OCCRP), in conjunction with the cybersecurity firm Check Point, malware is being dispersed through employment-related documents such as curriculum vitae (CV) and medical leave forms. The number of malicious CV files doubled in just two months in 2020.

Trends in the drug trade have fluctuated in response to the COVID-19 outbreak and countries' subsequent containment measures. Country lockdowns and movement restrictions initially disrupted global drug supply chains, and widespread flight cancellations placed considerable stress on those working as drug mules. 39 However, traffickers proved resilient and quickly adapted to the "shock" of the pandemic by shifting routes, production, and distribution and using the dark web for certain substances.

The spread of COVID-19 has exacerbated the underlying circumstances which contribute to human trafficking and has motivated an enormous increase in online child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Rising unemployment and global economic insecurity have increased the vulnerability of groups already disproportionately exploited in human trafficking-including women, migrants, refugees, domestic workers, and children. 
61
Lockdowns and pandemic containment measures have heightened the exposure to trafficking for women and girls in households with domestic violence and for domestic workers who may be trapped in quarantine with their abusers. The significant global increase in domestic abuse observed in relation to social distancing-which UN Women, an organization dedicated to gender equality, describes as a "shadow pandemic"-only intensifies the danger of intimate partner trafficking victims.

The pandemic has created windows of opportunity for corrupt networks that facilitate money laundering, counterfeiting, and other transnational crimes. The shutdown and resulting economic stagnation led to the implementation of financial management systems, such as cash transfers, that involved several corruption risks especially in developing countries where levels of corruption are high.

As noted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other intergovernmental organizations, a massive "infodemic"-or overabundance of information-has accompanied the COVID-19 pandemic. Similar to the virus, medical misinformation and disinformation spread rapidly, threatening national health and security. This flood of information, both accurate and false, impedes individuals' ability to obtain trustworthy guidance critical to preventing the spread of the virus and protecting public health. In some cases, this public information mismanagement fomented distrust of governments and medical professionals and hindered efforts to stop the virus's spread. In other cases, medical misinformation and rumors of false cures proved deadly. For instance, in Iran, false claims that drinking methanol can cure the coronavirus led to more than 500 deaths; dozens went blind, and thousands were hospitalized. The Iranian government and traditional media outlets initially denied that COVID-19 was present to influence voter turnout during national elections in February 2020. Once public information was made available, much of it was unreliable.

Shortages of PPE and medical supplies encouraged the counterfeiting of COVID-19 related products, including respirators (N95 masks), ventilators, and other medical supplies, such as gloves, gowns, and sanitizing products. Shortages of toilet paper, paper towels, and cleaning supplies led to price gouging. In response, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) launched Operation Stolen Promise in April 2020 to combat COVID-19 related fraud and other criminal activity.

Criminals are often highly flexible and innovative. Although it is hard to identify beneficiaries of the COVID-19 pandemic, criminals and their corrupt associates have certainly been able to profit in this difficult time. This is particularly evident for those engaged in fraud and financial crime against the vulnerable, as well as for those who operated effectively online and through social media. The damage caused by criminal elements is not confined to the virtual world; it is occurring in the real world as well. Environmental destruction proliferates, individuals can still access narcotics, and the large-scale distribution of counterfeit PPE through existing supply chains is exacerbating the costs and morbidity of COVID-19.
The isolation required to prevent the spread of COVID-19 has inhibited the response to this growth in criminality. Moreover, the sheer volume of online trade in child sexual images and counterfeit medical products, as well as other forms of cybercrime, strains a law enforcement system more accustomed to on-the-ground investigations than the investigative techniques required to address this new criminality. The large-scale data analytics and artificial intelligence needed to address these phenomena are not adequately applied by law enforcement. Methods only now in development need to be applied with alacrity.
The growth of life-threatening criminality under COVID-19 shows that traditional response methods are not adequate. To address this activity, we need a whole-of-society perspective that requires the cooperation of civil society, corporations, journalists, governments, and international bodies.

AGILITY ACROSS THE PHYSICAL, SOCIAL, AND CYBER SPACES
The global COVID-19 pandemic and response affected every aspect of our society, including the activities of criminal organizations. In this chapter, we discuss several examples of criminal organization agility during the pandemic, drawn from the physical, social, and cyber domains. We assess that criminal organizations are emerging from the pandemic stronger than before, the pandemic presents a unique opportunity to study criminal organization agility, and criminal organizations are more exposed after their pandemic-driven adjustments. We also assess that this adjusted criminal activity and other factors, including risky operations that expose discoverable data, create investigative opportunities that will enable a deeper understanding of criminal organization structure and will enhance our ability to disrupt and dismantle the organizations behind a broad range of illegal activity.
The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy were substantial and broad reaching. Harvard economists David Cutler and Larry Summers estimated in 2020 that the combined financial cost of pandemic-related lost output, as well as current and longterm health expenses, amounted to $16 trillion in the United States alone, 1 making this the biggest economic crisis since the Great Depression. With the illicit economy accounting for a not insignificant part of the global economy-estimates put it at 5-10 percent of the global GDP 2 -it was expected that this subset too would be affected by the pandemic.
In addition to upending everyday life worldwide, pandemicrelated disruptions affected numerous activities that are integral parts of the operations of transnational criminal organizations. For example. restrictions on travel, border closings, and worldwide lockdowns temporarily obstructed the global illicit drug supply chain.

In this chapter, we focus on the agility demonstrated by criminal networks around the world during the COVID-19 crisis, as they diversified their operational portfolio to take advantage of the opportunities emerging during the pandemic. We do so by examining illicit activities that relate to the trade of substandard health supplies and certain cybercrime activities that capitalize on the Zoom-dominated workplace environment that characterized the initial 12-month pandemic period. These representative examples of the agility and resourcefulness displayed by these organizations support an argument that we should be viewing such organizations as functional networks in pursuit of opportunities, rather than rigid structures that are exclusively pursuing specific types of operations.
The sensationalistic means and broad societal impact of illicit activities tend to dominate attention when we try to understand and respond to such activities. However, studying them under the light of economics principles provides additional insight on goals and methods, especially regarding organized illegal entities like cartels.

The pandemic changed the business environment by making medical supplies a scarce and, therefore, highly profitable commodity. Events in the early stages of the pandemic were indicative of individual illicit entrepreneurship, rather than organized efforts.
The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and the United States declared a national emergency under the Stafford and National Emergencies Acts on March 13, followed on March 23 by Executive Order 13910, to prevent hoarding of health and medical resources, and eventually by the establishment of a Department of Justice (DOJ) COVID-19 Hoarding and Price Gouging Task Force.

Cybercriminal adaptation to the pandemic environment occurred in two distinct stages. First, email and web-based scams immediately pivoted to pandemic-related goods and services. 
19
Prior to the pandemic, enterprise networks were in something of a steady-state environment. Broadly speaking, these systems had reasonably robust technical countermeasures in place to secure their digital assets against external attackers and to secure communications between themselves and business partners, and less-secure home users were somewhat isolated from enterprise networks, as suggested in Figure

From an attacker's point of view, home users who were of limited value as targets before the pandemic abruptly became easy gateways to enterprise targets of considerable value. Attackers could monitor the network endpoints of traffic on a shared medium (e.g., neighborhood, public WiFi, etc.) and establish likely individual-employer relationships even without access to the encrypted network traffic contents. If an attacker wanted to be a bit more direct about a target, a moderate amount of effort using open sources could identify the home locations of at least some employees from almost any organization.
Unfortunately, the risk posed by the rushed implementation of remote access is not limited to the pandemic timeframe. Considering the challenges faced by IT teams to implement remote access at the pandemic lockdown's outset, it is too much to hope that all steps taken were thoroughly documented so that they could be fully undone after the lockdown was lifted. These unintentional residual configurations, combined with the set of capabilities deliberately left in place, 25 present an undesirable departure from the prepandemic security posture of enterprise networks and systems. For those organizations desiring to retain work-from-home capabilities for their employees and contractors, much work remains to secure these endpoints and the systems they access.
Additionally, networks and systems were compromised during the lockdown, 
26
27
28
Fortunately, not all implications of the lockdown-driven, enterprise access changes are bad from a cybercrime investigation point of view. Cybercrime actors were more active during the pandemic lockdown, for example, performing reconnaissance activities against a greater number of targets. Expanding the target set increased not only the likelihood that cybercriminals might hit a honeypot, but the likelihood that investigators might discover this activity through routine detection, and in both cases gain a richer dataset for correlation and analysis. This richer dataset has increased our ability to discover and understand cybercriminal activities and infrastructure, both key aspects of preventing and mitigating attacks. Additionally, multiple non-cybercriminal organizations and others entered the cyberattack space with weak operational security and without the requisite skills, tools, and tactics. Returning to the Colonial Pipeline example, the attackers represented a loose coalition of at least two different cybercriminal groups, one writing the ransomware tool and another executing the attack. The ransom, paid in Bitcoin, was transferred through multiple Bitcoin wallets in the days after the attack, but a sizeable portion (about 85 percent) wound up in a wallet that the FBI was able to seize. 
29
One way to describe the universe of illicit activities is through the taxonomy presented in Figure 
4
The pandemic affected the connections of this taxonomy in two ways. First, it broadened the previously unknown connections by adding novel links between known actors and unknown actors/ unknown operations (red-outlined arrow). At the same time, we gained additional clarity on these connections, as some of them were revealed through apprehensions (solid red arrow).
Seen through an investigative lens, these developments have advanced our understanding by revealing new actors and operations, such as small-time opportunistic criminals engaged in price gouging or other illicit activities. Although these new insights are not expected to have lasting or substantial effects, the connections established during the pandemic between known actors and unknown actors/unknown operations can be viewed as both challenges and opportunities. Challenges because these previously known and unknown actors may be empowered, as may be the case when they enjoy heightened support by local communities, or they may form more complex networks, with more sophisticated operational modi operandi and capabilities that were up to now untapped. At the same time, as some of these organized criminal networks may have stepped beyond their traditional operation spaces, we may gain additional opportunities to study them and advance our understanding of their structure and membership. Returning to the question of criminal organization agility that we posed in this chapter's introduction, we find:
• The cartels and other criminal organizations are strengthened and emboldened in the aftermath of the pandemic. Many staterun institutions were weakened during the pandemic, both in terms of actual weakness (e.g., budgets, staffing, infrastructure) and in terms of public trust. This damage will take years to repair, and, in the interim, criminal organizations will continue to step in and exploit the current voids. Similarly, cybercriminals learned much during the pandemic and will use these new skills going forward; they also built a significant backlog of compromised systems for later exploitation. • The pandemic offered, and still does offer, a unique opportunity to study the agility of criminal organizations. First impressions suggest that these actors are remarkably resilient and adaptable. On the other hand, the new activities and associated indicators have not been invisible. Ongoing and future research and analysis promise a better understanding of how these adaptations occur, what data and indicators we might collect and develop, and how we might detect and disrupt such activities in their early stages. • Criminal organization structure is more exposed than it was prepandemic. As these organizations moved into new areas of activity, sometimes unprepared and ill-equipped to do so, we have found abundant data to support analysis and discovery of criminal network activity and structure. Analysis of these new areas will lead to connections, discovery, and understanding of previously stealthy activities, facilitating disruption and dismantling of the underlying criminal organizations behind the activities rather than simply addressing criminal activities in a surface and piecemeal fashion. 
COVID-19 disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus came to the world's attention in December 2019 when, after originating in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the malady quickly spread to other parts of the world.

The World Health Organization (WHO) observed the information overflow and associated potential problems in the early stages of the SARS-CoV-2 crisis. In March 2020, the WHO adopted the term "infodemics" to label the phenomenon. "Infodemics" was first used by foreign policy scholar David Rothkopf, who noticed during the 2003 SARS epidemic that narratives and ideas about SARS spread through populations in a way strikingly similar to the disease itself. 
12
13
The WHO Conference of Infodemiology in 2020 called for agreement on the terms of infodemics, which are frequently used as synonyms although they describe different problem sets. Scholars and experts specializing in this field shared the WHO's concern, 14 and the following definitions are now generally accepted in infodemics management: 15
• Disinformation is false information that is deliberately created or disseminated with the express purpose to cause harm; the producers of disinformation typically have political, financial, psychological, or social motivations.
• Misinformation is information that is false but not intended to cause harm; for example, individuals who do not know that a piece of information is false may spread it on social media in an attempt to be helpful.
• Malinformation is genuine information that is shared to cause harm; this includes private or revealing information that is spread to harm individuals or their reputations.
• Propaganda is true or false information spread to persuade an audience, but it often has a political connotation and is usually connected to information produced by governments.
Public health professionals and infodemiology experts are increasingly rejecting the popular catch phrase of "fake news." This common term was coined to describe the use of disinformation and misinformation in news reporting and further to label manipulative online information,

The COVID-19 pandemic has created several opportunities for Russia to weaponize its malign influence tactics to attack the Kremlin's adversaries, especially the United States and its European Union (EU) and NATO allies. Anxieties arising from the SARS-CoV-2 crisis, combined with contemporary over-reliance on social media and electronic sources of information, have made people particularly vulnerable to disinformation, and Russia has recognized the benefits of leveraging conspiracy theories, malinformation, misinformation, and disinformation about COVID-19.

The Russian Federation is the direct descendant of the Soviet Union, and Russian political warfare practitioners have inherited the USSR's political warfare theories and practices.

At the governmental level (both nationally and internationally among Western allies), it is also essential to appraise the opportunities for the use of artificial intelligence, data science, and machine learning to aid and assist responsible government agencies, health care providers, news media of all types, and civil society organizations to process and analyze information, in order to deliver reliable and actionable information to stakeholders and decisionmakers. Such an approach requires collaborative action on a global scale because crises such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic are borderless and cannot be tackled by individual nations, regardless of their wealth and power. The implementation and enforcement of integrated preventive procedures necessitate the internationalization of infodemic management.

CAN A "GREAT LEVELER" BE OUR ELITES' BEST FRIEND?
The great coronavirus pandemic is seen everywhere as world shaking and world changing. That it is. Yet it should be seen not as a grand historical force, but rather as a force enabler. COVID-19 does not leave earthshattering wreckage in its wake. Rather, it removes popular residual restraints so that ruling elites may wreck-and thus reshape-our world as they will. Past great upheavals were authentic, multivalent events, where plague, climate change, migrations, and war transformed our human landscape-often for the better. This handcrafted upheaval, in contrast, collars our deepest memories of old terrors-through the urgent press of continuous emergency-to lock in an elite-bespoke world order, forever. Hence, while antecedent world calamities had the power to bring elites and their oppression down, this elite-curated event has deployed calamity to ensure the elites' globe-girdling command of humanity.
"Great Leveler" refers to Walter Scheidel's book, The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2018), which charted the crucial role violent shocks have played in human history in reducing inequality around the world.
W hen COVID-19 began to spread, elite wisdom promptly declared the world transformed. As early as mid-March 2020, Politico Magazine published a wise man survey entitled, "Coronavirus Will Change the World Permanently. Here's How., " 1 in which dozens of "smart, macro thinkers" weighed in on the profound changes to come. Yet of the 34 predictions in the Politico piece, only two have stood the test of a single year. * The sampling size of this exercise helps us appreciate the poverty of elite analysis: the forecasts fail because they are entirely unconnected to history.
History is quite clear about how pandemics effect "Big Change. "
• A pandemic is not the bearer of change but rather its helpful midwife. • A pandemic's arrival in a near-crisis world system will help push that system over the edge. • Pandemic intervention most strongly impacts weakened or brittle elites.
These factors are history's yardsticks for pandemics and world change-not the plague's relative severity in terms of human death tolls. Change flows from how the epidemic interacts with the dynamics of a society or larger system already under intense pressure. Let's take a look.
After 10,000 centuries of evolution, the last remaining human species has developed a peak value proposition which, for the past 50 of those centuries, we have called "civilization. " This competitive advantage is a vision of human society as a matrix of cities linked to a spoke-and-hub network, which has been built out worldwide. This human constellation concentrates people into dense communities, with each city connected to the entire mesh. These city networks have been the germinator and driver of human cultural evolution and a continuum of change.
We describe the history of civilization as relentlessly positive and draw our progress on an ever-ascending-even soaring-curve. But civilization's bounty has its downsides, too-both cultural and material. The cultural downside inheres in society's continual tendency to move toward segmented, stratified, and unequal development, which in practical terms operates as a limit on the success and relative life expectancy of governing regimes and their constitutional paradigms. Civilization's material downside concerns the collective physiology of cities' and networks' health. Since the beginning, dense human communities have created fertile petri dishes for culturing disease. Moreover, the networks connecting these communities have served as a primary and efficient pathway for disease spread. This proclivity toward pathogenesis and epidemy, in practical terms, has operated as a historically recurring limit to physical growth of the world-city matrix.
Pandemic's Destruction . . . At their most severe, pandemic episodes can intersect with a weakening of ruling paradigms to disrupt the integrity of the current global-city matrix and trigger an abrupt discontinuity in civilization itself. During civilization's 50 centuries, just two pandemic episodes-the Justinianic Plague (541-49) and the Black Death (1346-53)-were vast enough to disrupt the world-city matrix. In each episode, civilization survived, presenting an uneven topology of subsidence, but the world-city matrix broke into smaller, more self-referent networks. 
2
3
During the second and more familiar great pandemic, the Black Death, Yersinia pestis again killed as much as 60 percent of the population across Europe, Eurasia, and North Africa.

Even with these huge death tolls, both events reveal an ability to maintain political and economic continuity. The life patterns of society were unbroken-even in the face of 6 out of 10 mortality. What such notable world calamities tell us is that it takes an awful lot to disrupt human civilization's world matrix, and even when that matrix is disrupted, the effects are impermanent and evanescent. The larger significance of mini apocalypse is not in the direct damage and disruption of the plague episode in itself, but rather in the additive impetus of the plague dynamic on other human things. In other words, the power of pandemic lies in its capacity to push dynamic changes in civilization already underway or to unleash forces so pent up that only an exogenous force might intervene. The Chart shows plague's influence long after the pestilence has departed.
The statuses of the human communities of Late Antiquity and the High Middle Ages seem to be in total contrast. The Greco-Roman-Sassanian world was already coming apart in the 6th century; hence, the Justinianic Plague provided the fissiparous force to accelerate its breakup. In contrast, when the Black Death hit, 14th century human society was rich and living large. Yet the deeply intertwined world of the High Middle Ages also came apart, even though its marquee societies were rich and powerful.
What the networked world societies of Late Antiquity and the High Middle Ages shared was an elite architecture of rule that was highly corrupt and under pressure from below. Yet what are "elites, " or the "ruling class, " or even "aristocracy?" Simply, elites are the secret of the success of the world of cities (i.e., civilization) and, just as surely, the core source of their failure. Millennia ago, elites grew into leadership among emerging, late-Neolithic (or Chalcolithic) communities, the proto-city-states of early civilization. Elites became a new, necessary, and yet ineradicable institution in the new human society-groomed to lead and yet insatiable of privilege. Their capacity to inspire or oppress would become the heart of civilizational success, and failure.
For the Greco-Roman-Sassanian World of the 6th and 7th Centuries:
Trade declined. In the year 530, Italy imported 35 percent of its wine; by 560, that level had fallen to 10 percent.
Circulation of coins collapsed between 550 and 600, first in the West, then in the East.
Egypt's population from 30 million in 540 to 10 million in 700.
After 600, Sassanian, then Arab and Slav, invaders overran the Balkans and Levant.
The world system remained segmented into three separate culture areas for 500 years.
For the Eurasian World of the 14th and 15th Centuries:
The Mongol network's collapse and the Ottoman Empire's rise cut Europe off from Eurasia a second time.
Social mobility in the West surged, and new aristocratic lineages emerged. Serfdom broke down; labor was suddenly in high demand, and technology became a valued good as labor costs rose.
England's prepandemic population, estimated at 4 million in 1348, did not reach that level again until at least 1700.
Europe broke out of isolation, building out a global oceanic network.
Here is the oppression scorecard: In Late Antiquity, concentrations of wealth, counterpoised with the grinding misery of the people, became unsustainable.

In the High Middle Ages, population had maxed out and had been exploited to its productive limit. Feudal society was a tyranny. The supply of serfs exceeded demand, and a corrupt Church owned the majority of the region's assets.
The evidence leaves no doubt. The collapse of the Western Roman state between 450 and 550 and the near collapse, and then reconstitution, of a new Byzantine state (550-700) brought great benefit and relief to the people of the Mediterranean world. The tripartite successor subsystems-Latin West, Greek East, and Arab Levant-saw declines in trade, urbanization, and literacy, although less so in the Levant. But-bottom line-people were more free.

Why was it good? Those long-established social and political patterns were-to be polite-perhaps too hard and too fixed. By 541 and by 1346, civilization had reached the point where regular people had zero chance of upward mobility and, thus, zero hope of social advancement and economic betterment. Moreover, the wealthbuilding networks of the system had become a wired racket for the elite. The anointed aristocratic caste (making up perhaps 1 percent of the population) and its accompanying privileged servant class (adding another 9 percent) got ever richer and richer, while an increasingly excluded and oppressed 90 percent of the population would forever have no voice, no outlet, and no hope.

In practical terms, although existential pandemics threaten the very life of society, for elites the pandemics threaten what they value most-their accumulated wealth and right to rule. Stratified and unjust elite orders, no matter what their titular authority, are actually quite brittle. The Roman order of Late Antiquity and the "Latin" church order of the High Middle Ages initially survived as ruling institutions, yet in several generations they had either collapsed or radically reformed. Today's Western elites eerily mirror the 1+9 percent aristocratic and privileged servant demography of Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages described above, yet our grandee class may actually be wealthier and their regimes even more sclerotic than their ancient and medieval antecedents. 
16
The long national shutdowns have wiped away constraints on the state, creating, in effect, a clean slate for new constitutional norms. Moreover, asserted as precedent with instant standing, these new norms will constitute a major expansion of state power. For example, drawn-out, draconian Blue state lockdowns have established a strong precedent for open-ended state emergency powers. Summarily invoked and enforced like martial law, rule-by-fiat now has the constitutional standing to drive future "Green New Deal" reordering and regulation of society.
Expanded state ruling and its enforcement implicitly mean expanded privileges and protections for preferred groups. The time of lockdown has also amplified wealth concentration. High-skilled, high-paying virtual jobs ensure that elite income is untouched, while the great working class shift to tomorrow's labor market-the "gig economy"-is correspondingly accelerated. 17 New analysis shows that, in terms of the 1 percent, wealth concentration in the United States is double that of the Roman Empire. 
18
The impressionistic vision from this wide-ranging, uncoordinated sampling is unusually consistent in presenting the elite worldview. It also generally harmonizes with the sweeping "future of humanity" assessments from the 2020 World Economic Forum in Davos. 
19

Yet there is a correlation between COVID-19 and its existential plague ancestors. Like in Late Antiquity and the High Middle Ages, the people are restive under elite "management" regimes. Moreover, COVID lockdowns have intensified gathering rebellion: See intense clashes with mounted police, for example, in New South Wales-or massive street protests in France over vaccine passports-or the bitter recall campaign against California Governor Gavin Newsom because of his lockdown policies. † Continuity and cohesion are consistent with very distinct ruling elites. We still celebrate the iconic mindset of the ancien régime, for example. Arguably, elite solidarity today, under the panopticon of social media, is even more monolithic and entrenched. Twitter demography strongly skews elite-80 percent of users are affluent millennials-and this class groupthink is more often not self-conscious.
So what was at first a strategic opportunity for Western elites may, in the end, generate a more clamoring insurgency, building on frustration and collective anger already boiling among those left behind. Those for whom the rewards once dangled by an ever-richer world are now visibly, painfully, withdrawn, with no end in sight.
Robert Frost wrote in 1915: "Two roads diverged in a yellow wood …" We Americans want to believe that "The Road Not Taken" is a "paean to triumphant self-assertion ('I took the road less traveled by'), " but, as David Orr makes clear "the road he will later call less traveled is actually the road equally traveled. The two roads are interchangeable. " 
22
The plague did not cause this, nor did it bring us here-it simply made the revelation. Pandemic urgency and emergency ruthlessly stripped away the restless, seething heart that inevitably bursts with the recognition of a sacred vision betrayed; and assuredly, also, the unclothed, narcissistic ruling class that led us here.  COVID-19 and 1918 H1N1 flu pandemics provides an opportunity for a disciplined examination of the conditions and the short-and long-term effects of a pandemic on the world and U.S. national security. Taking into account the different geopolitical, epidemiological, and social contexts of these two periods, this comparison leads to several projections. Because the underlying conditions for pandemic (e.g., population growth, urbanization, interconnected trade and travel) persist, future pandemics are inevitable; continued vigilance and preparation are necessary. China and Russia will try to leverage the pandemic against the United States, but the United States has an opportunity to assume a leadership role in combatting the pandemic. U.S. and global economic recovery is likely, although an increase in real wages and standard of living-typical after a pandemic-is not expected. Current inequalities are likely to increase due to differential unemployment between service industries and manufacturing, on the one hand, and higher-paid, white collar industries where people can continue to work from home. The politicization of the pandemic in some Western democracies is likely to be exacerbated by growing inequality along social divisions. Therefore, the COVID-19 pandemic presents the danger of political instability and weakening Western democracies in competition against their autocratic rivals.
M any expert opinions have been offered regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world and U.S. national security, but disciplined, data-based assessments are needed. Disciplined historical assessment moves beyond speculation and toward a sounder evaluation of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. No two historical periods are the same; however, by accounting for key factors in historical context, similar conditions and effects can be isolated from those that might be specific to a particular time and place.

Global Political Disruptions. In both 1918 and 2020, there have been important political disruptions. Communist revolution erupted in Russia in 1917-18 and eventually spread worldwide. The Arab Spring and color revolutions, as well as global Jihadist movements and Hong Kong's democracy movement, have recently challenged existing orders. However, as noted above, these do not appear to have impacted the 2020 pandemic globally.
Economic Conditions. Despite the devastation of WWI, wartime economies generated wealth for many. 21 Major wars are often followed by major economic booms because of the need to rebuild from the destruction.

Demographic Impact. Both pandemics have had unusual demographic impacts. Most epidemics attack those with the weakest immune systems, the very young and the very old, producing a U-shaped distribution of mortality by age. The 1918 pandemic was notable in that it not only attacked the very young and very old but curiously also killed those in the prime of their lives, the most economically productive people between 15 and 44.

Inequality. Addressing inequality from the 1918 pandemic is complicated. In the short run in the United States, manufacturing jobs were most jeopardized, as well as jobs that employed African Americans, and so inequality increased between poor and wealthy, and white and black. 80 However, a major migration of African Americans to northern industrial cities occurred during WWI that opened opportunities and a standard of living not possible for them in the rural south. During the "Roaring 20s, " blacks experienced the "Harlem Renaissance. " 81 Global post-war economic developments probably erased some temporary inequalities brought on by the pandemic,

83,
84,
85
Because the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted low-wage jobs held by people with little savings, combined with the uncertainty of a post-pandemic wage hike, an increase in inequality should be expected. Although unemployment rose only 1 percent above normal in the developed countries hardest hit by the pandemic, reducing the likelihood that inequality will be widespread globally, 88 the unemployment spike in the United States of 11 percent leaves a much larger proportion of the population vulnerable to permanent wealth loss.
Government Response. In 1918, national governments were limited in what they could do to respond to the pandemic, 89 due in part to being at war and/or in a state of political turmoil. The U.S. Government response in 1918 was largely nonexistent, apparently because of a combination of cultural factors: Americans did not like to be told what to do, libertarian values (no government intervention in personal freedoms) prevailed, and once President Woodrow Wilson committed to the war effort, he was unwilling to pull back, even though the epidemic had begun.

It is too early to know what the political impacts of COVID-19 will be. Some pundits argue that COVID-19 is likely to strengthen China's influence in the world at the expense of the United States. They assert that China's seemingly more effective mitigation of the pandemic, combined with a diplomatic charm offensive of providing aid to developing and even Western countries, will increase China's prestige and influence.

The 2020 pandemic has impacted domestic politics, most notably in the United States. The pandemic hit during what was a contentious election year. Some analysts argue that COVID-19 decided the election, given President Trump's high disapproval ratings for his handling of the pandemic.

Urban-Rural Migration. The 1918 pandemic did not appear to cause any major migratory shifts, and the same appears to be true of 2020. Media have sounded an alarm over a mass exodus from urban centers to escape COVID-19 that threatens to hollow out cities; 130, 131 however, a comprehensive analysis of U.S. real estate sales has found no evidence of a general urban exodus. 
132
133
Because the pandemic is a complex phenomenon impacting complex systems, single points of comparison provide limited insight into the current COVID-19 pandemic. However, taking these points together and considering their interactive effects can lead to some cautious projections.
The global war on terror and its many manifestations have not created the widespread devastation and disruption that WWI did. Therefore, there is no reason to expect a postwar reconstructive boom to help the world bounce back from the COVID-19 recession. Because the world economy was experiencing strong growth before the pandemic and was structurally sound, however, the conditions for a rapid recovery exist.
Both 1918 and 2020 were periods of great power competition, and one would expect each power (i.e., the United States, China, Russia) to look for opportunities to leverage the pandemic to its advantage. China and Russia have tried to position themselves as humanitarian aid providers, but in reality, the aid they have provided is limited and has been faulty. The United States has not been seen as a leader in the fight against the pandemic, but-with the largest economy, most robust medical research infrastructure, and strongest potential international reach (diplomatically and logistically)-should the U.S. Government choose, it could assume the role of leader in the fight against the pandemic. Therefore, the great powers may muddle along in their competition over this issue, or the United States could take a leadership role.
Other forms of social disruption neither have been much impacted by nor have they impacted geopolitics. The only potentially disruptive change is the pandemic leading to further political divisions within major democratic powers, namely the United States and Germany, which would weaken these democracies at home and diminish their ability to counter challenges from China and Russia.
In 1918, the global movement of armies created the ideal vectors for disease spread. European populations were under nutritional and other stresses and had large armies packed in close, unsanitary conditions, creating fertile ground for pandemic once the disease reached them. In 2020, populations were arguably far healthier, but global trade and ease of travel presented risk conditions for the spread of disease. As travel restrictions relax, a key underlying facilitator of pandemic will return. Another key factor is continued population growth and expanding urbanism, which will put potential animal vectors in contact with dense human populations, allowing future pandemics to erupt.

The expected post-pandemic recovery may exacerbate preexisting inequalities. Pandemic unemployment has disproportionately impacted low-wage service and manufacturing sectors of the economy. These jobs should come back, but the economic losses these laborers experienced will not be recovered without the typical wage hike that accompanies pandemic recoveries. Furthermore, people in white-collar industries have been much more likely to remain employed and consequently experience no loss in wealth. The net effect is likely to be a further shift in wealth to well-educated, upperclass sectors of society and greater inequality, which is associated with increased homicide,

In conclusion, the post-COVID pandemic world is unlikely to be radically different from the pre-COVID world. Great power competition will continue, and the global economy should recover given its previous strong structural base. However, some changes are expected to persist and, given the complex nature of the systems they impact, have the potential to spiral out of control and cause major disturbances if not monitored and mitigated. The logistical conditions (e.g., population growth, urbanization, trade, and travel) for the eruption of pandemic remain. There will be another, and this future pandemic is likely to exacerbate existing urban/rural, education, and class divides; inequality is likely to increase, as will the grievances that inequality often generates. The politicization of the pandemic in Western democracies has already interacted with social divisions, potentially weakening democratic resistance against challenges from authoritarian states such as China and Russia. In this future scenario, the world may muddle along with its current competitions and conflicts or divisions in Western democracies could metastasize into weakness and internal divisions upon which competing world powers could seize.

The world has been fundamentally transformed since 1947, the year the modern Intelligence Community was founded. Why then has the IC stayed much the same across the intervening decades? As constituted, the IC is optimized for an era of strategic competition that has long since passed and is not coming back. The truth is that the community will need more than new technology and fresh talent to rebuild itself for 21st-century national security challenges. It will also need to reexamine the assumptions that underwrite the business of intelligence itself and to be prepared for a structural overhaul that in our judgment is long overdue.
T he coronavirus pandemic should be a wake-up call for the IC. Not only has it been the most significant crisis of the 21st century in terms of its staggering death toll, it has also wrought significant social, political, and economic consequences both here at home and around the world.

Intelligence has a history; it also has a future. Its history exhibits faults of understanding, of organization, of administration and planning. We can rest on our laurels and wait for future disasters to shock us into sporadic correction. Or we can study the lessons of experience and implement those lessons now.
-GEORGE S. PETTEE, 1946

The generation of emergent phenomena, or emergence for short, is a process to which highly interconnected and interdependent systems-like today's strategic environment-are particularly prone. Emergence often seemingly comes out of nowhere and is difficult, if not impossible, to predict. That said, conditions for emergence have usually been building for some time, and, thus, it is often possible to anticipate it. Examples of emergence include the Arab Spring and the current spread of a novel respiratory infection that has sidelined much of the world for the past year.
The pandemic is not the last emergent crisis we will face in this turbulent era. It almost certainly is not even the last pandemic-and the next one could be even more lethal.

Since the IC's modern establishment nearly three-quarters of a century ago, generations of American intelligence officers have diligently provided the nation's political and military leaders with the secret information they needed to make better decisions. Today's officers, however, are increasingly challenged to do so within a competitive environment that is remarkably dissimilar to the one the IC was created to address.
Established in 1947, the IC initially had two purposes. The first, and initially most salient, was the prevention of another surprise attack on the scale of Pearl Harbor.

The United States and its allies built a veritable armature of information acquisition during the decades of the Cold War: a technical collection architecture that eventually grew to cover the world with spy planes, satellites, and listening posts. The IC also built up a cadre of officers who spent their entire careers building deep expertise on every aspect of the Soviet adversary, from the makeup of Soviet tank divisions and the personality dossiers of its commanders to net annual potato harvests and myriad other specialties. 
6
7
The combination of information acquisition and reductive analytical thinking served the IC remarkably well during the Cold War, despite several noteworthy failures, lapses, and scandals. By the latter years of the conflict, the IC had developed extensive, expansive, and granular knowledge of the Soviet Union's military and economic capabilities-a fact that, according to one former Director of Central Intelligence, did much to prevent the sort of miscalculation that might have destroyed the world.

When Mikhail Gorbachev officially dissolved the Soviet Union on Christmas Day, 1991, a geopolitical glacier that had shaped the contours of the global order for the better part of a century suddenly melted away, unleashing a torrent of change in its wake. That flood quickly inundated the political landscape of the so-called "post-Soviet space, " washing away the old and leaving a morass of debris in its wake.
Even in the still nominally communist People's Republic of China, Deng Xiaoping's more open economic reforms had taken root, swiftly overpowering a reactionary freeze in the wake of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. China's rapid transformation earned it World Trade Organization membership in 2001 and fostered its deep integration into the world's economy. It has become a leading geopolitical actor and a true peer of the United States across the full spectrum of national power. By some measures, it has even surpassed the United States, for example as the world's leading economic power. 
10
Put simply, the world the IC is tasked with helping our nation's leaders better understand no longer resembles the one for which it was created. That world was slower-paced, having operated at the speed of the carbon copy and ambassador's cable. It was less connected and more easily divided into issues and regions. Power in that world was more concentrated, most often in the hands of a relatively small number of societal elites who could be easily identified and targeted for intelligence collection. In that world, America squared off against the Soviet Union, a monolithic and hierarchical adversary. Our leaders' principal challenge was a decided lack of information about that complicated adversary-a problem the IC was invented to solve. Today, in sharp contrast, the speed of relevance is often measured in hours, if not minutes. Instead of unitary sovereign states with clearly demarcated borders and easy distinctions between foreign and domestic power, our modern world is one of overlapping webs of influence that run over, under, and through states, institutions, political parties, and even individuals. Security issues that were once separate now regularly brush up against one another or even at times seem to converge. Because people, from Silicon Valley to Central Asia's Ferghana Valley, are more mobile and more connected than ever before, power is far more evenly distributed than in the past, and significant issues can arise from many more sources across a vast influence network. Instead of being confronted by a monolithic superpower like the Soviet Union, today the United States is challenged by a diverse array of greater and lesser threats-some conventional, others quite novel. This threat spectrum is compounded by a parallel matrix of systemic vulnerabilities, some of which we have let accrue to the point where they pose existential risks by themselves. Instead of thirsting for information, today's national security leaders are drowning in it.
Complexity is a loaded word, one whose power has been diluted from overuse. It is often-incorrectly-used as a synonym for complicated. Both derive from Latin but are subtly distinct. The Latin verb plicare means to fold. Complicare is to fold together. The Latin past participle plexus can mean to weave, braid, or entwine. Therefore, complication denotes layers, one atop another, while complexity implies merging individual strands into a single, braided, or woven whole. 11 A given system's complexity is, in short, measured by the level of interconnectedness of the elements within that system. 
12
13
Yet despite the fundamental changes in the external environment that the IC exists to comprehend, our internal organizational and intellectual frameworks have remained remarkably consistent. Yes, we have made plenty of individual, incremental reforms-creating, merging, and splitting agencies, for instance, and dramatically improving our ability to gather secrets from all over the world through the growth of the enormous technical collection architecture described above. Yes, to be fair, intelligence officers have significantly improved the drafting and delivery of finished analysis-most notably with reforms implemented as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which established the Director of National Intelligence and codified standards for analytic writing. 
14
It is still organizationally optimized to deal with closed, hierarchical systems like the Soviet Union, when very few of the convoluted threats we face today resemble that of the communist behemoth. Beholden to an antiquated planning process 
that Robert McNamara bequeathed it in 1962, 15
One that is predicated on the idea of information scarcity and views the world largely in terms of threats to instead of risks from-from, for example, the vulnerabilities built into our open system of government or from the severe social, political, and economic knock-on effects of a brutal pandemic that has claimed a half million American lives.
No simple solutions exist for the challenges outlined above. There are, however, a few broad areas of reform the IC must consider as part of any effort to set the conditions for the requisite changes demanded by an era in which change is the only constant, and more surprise the only certainty.
First, IC leaders must recognize that the reductive analytic scaffolding we cling to is particularly unsuited to the sort of complex, systemic, and emergent challenges the United States is unfortunately certain to face in the 21st century. Instead of placing undue value on deep niche expertise that invariably creates information silos, the IC will need to develop a cadre with the creativity and synthetic thinking skills that facilitate much broader approaches to issues, emphasizing the anticipation of systemic possibilities.
Next, IC leaders must recognize that, very often, little can be gleaned from classified collection techniques that is not already openly available. Since its outset, the IC has been seduced by the characteristically American conceit that it will one day be able to know all the world's secret information and accomplishing this would prevent surprises. But even if it were possible to collect every bit of information relevant to national security in the 21st century (it is not), it would not serve policymakers as well as some intelligence planners might think. Although we tend to find the things we look for, we are surprised when the things we are not looking for find us instead.
Human susceptibility to cognitive errors, such as availability bias and the observer expectancy effect, means that we arrange for classified collection against the problems we already know about and are convinced those problems exist even when we fail to find the needle in the haystack. We are then surprised by exogenous events that did not appear from where we were looking. In other words, the IC's expensive collection apparatus is often largely impotent against the emergent complex issues we have been describing and can, at times, even make our challenge more difficult.
Thankfully, the information revolution has spawned freely accessible sources of every sort imaginable in the public domain-from hundreds of new publications in any language to crowd-sourced videos and photographs that provide access that intelligence collection managers could once only dream about. The real value of open-source information is not in the perspective of any of these individual sources, however, but in the aggregate-numerous sources all looking at the same issue or event. The IC would be worse than remiss, it would be negligent, if it did not seriously consider the value of triangulating this multitude of perspectives to make our own view of reality more accurate.
Third, IC leaders must take a hard look at organizational transformation. Although the old saw tells us that culture eats strategy, structure creates culture. The IC will never be able to change its cognitive framework or break its addiction to classified collection along the lines described above if it does not also evolve organizationally. Presently, the IC remains a funhouse mirror reflection of the closed, hierarchical system it was designed to combat-the Soviet Union. That made sense for an era in which classified information was the price of admission and reductive analytic thinking prevailed. But in an open age of rapidly evolving networks, such structures are not neutral, they are actively harmful. Closed, hierarchical structures, with their sharply drawn boundaries and bins, compel the very analytic thinking that is simply no match for the rapidly morphing, complex networks with which they must contend. Until the IC becomes a truly open network that can think synthetically, it will struggle with the complexity of a century that really is just beginning.
Fourth, IC leaders must address an era of rapidly advancing technology. We are not technologists, so we will not pretend to have a comprehensive understanding of the digital tools that come online each month. But as analysts and leaders of analysts, we do know that if the IC hopes to succeed in the 21st century, it must be able to adopt these new tools quickly and combine existing tools in new ways to let analysts do new things. Too often, the community's leaders have thought only in terms of using new capabilities to do the same things it has always done, only a little bit faster and a little more efficiently.
We question the utility of such an incremental approach. A much larger discussion must be held about what the IC should do differently-holistically and synthetically. Then, IC leaders must seek out technologies that will help to realize that vision. To be sure, doing the same old things better and faster has appeal, but it is important that the IC not let marginally improving the old things it is already good at impede creating something entirely new and fundamentally different.
Fifth, the IC needs to break free from some of its historical inhibitions-limitations that may have once made sense but no longer do in a world that bears little resemblance to the one for which the community was created. Two of these limitations stand out to usthe IC's historical prohibition against examining the actions of the United States itself and the more unspoken, but nonetheless binding prohibition against becoming too close to the policymakers intelligence officers support.
In the first case, borders are increasingly irrelevant in the complex, integrated world we have been describing. Prohibiting analysts from examining the actions (or inactions) of one of that world's most significant actors results in analyses with little resemblance to what is a messy reality. In the second, this same reticence prevents intelligence officers from helping policymakers understand that they are themselves contributing to the creation of the world the IC is meant to help them navigate.
Last, the IC should take a good hard look at its measures of success. Metrics are ultimately incentives. What we measure is usually constrained by what is measurable, such as the number of classified reports used in an analytic paper, for instance. What we measure also sends a message about what we value, both to our own people and to the consumers of intelligence we seek to help.
Consequently, those metrics drive what the workforce works on, and when it comes to intelligence, that means production. And so, the community produces-a lot. Indeed, an argument can be made that the IC produces so much for so many (and really for no one at the same time) that the net result is not clarity or understanding but obscuration and confusion, so much dust thrown in the eyes of the policymaking class.
Here is a final point worth consideration. It is very easy for successful institutions-particularly those with storied legacies like the IC'sto believe that because they have been successful in the past, they will continue to be successful in the future. As long as they keep getting better at doing the things they have always done, this line of thinking goes, they will maintain and even expand their history of accomplishment. Blinded by their very success, they mistakenly conflate their way of doing things with the way of doing things. They inadvertently create the conditions for their decline as newer and nimbler competitors arise to meet the challenges of a world that is itself always changing. 
16
The bad news is that getting even better at things the IC is already quite good at is not enough in a changed world. Today, past pedigree counts for little, and past accomplishment is no guarantor of future success. The good news is that the IC is well-positioned to begin doing new things that new technologies now permit, if only it can muster the collective will to do so. Intelligence officers are sharp, diligent, and famously dedicated to their mission. They have performed admirably all over the world-often in austere conditions, and not infrequently under fire. Several of them have paid the ultimate price in defense of their country. But the community simply cannot afford to rest on its laurels, making incremental advances here and there. As former Principal Deputy Director of National Intelligence Sue Gordon once put it, "We've never been as good as we are now, but we have to be better.

Zachery Tyson Brown is a former defense intelligence officer and independent researcher who writes about the changing strategic environment and the future of the art and profession of intelligence. Insights offered in this volume's chapters represent a complex system of relationships between the COVID-19 pandemic and factors influencing U.S. intelligence and national security. We use these insights to construct a network of influences from which we derive second-and third-order cascading effects. The results of our analysis corroborate the contributing authors' research findings and illuminate the interconnectedness and compounding nature of the relationships examined throughout the volume. The model indicates that several destabilizing social, economic, and political factors stemming directly from the pandemic have coalesced to exacerbate each other, deepen existing threats to human security, and yield new ones. This dynamic has been accelerated and intensified by floods of disinformation. Governance and security-indeed, the social contract-have been put to the test, making nations including the United States and U.S. partners more vulnerable to adversarial threats and creating permissive environments in which illicit economies and transnational criminal, as well as terrorist, organizations can thrive. Finally, the model indicates that, while pandemic-associated problems are fracturing domestic and international political cohesion, some pandemic-associated solutions are strengthening aspects of global economic cooperation and interdependence. This fragile and yet interdependent system represents the state of play as the world emerges from pandemic.
A Holistic View: Understanding the Changed World System
The authors of this volume provide illuminating perspectives on a broad range of influences the COVID-19 pandemic is having on variables critical to U.S. intelligence and national security. While clearly each of these analyses is valuable on its own, the variables they examine interact in complex ways. Therefore, this study seeks to maximize the full value of the authors' insights and expertise by examining them holistically from a complex system perspective.
Our analysis pools together key variables examined by each author, maps them to Fragile States Index (FSI) indicators, * where appropriate, and analyzes the variables' relationships to the pandemic and to each other, creating a holistic picture of the pandemic's short-and long-term impacts and implications for intelligence and national security. In our review of the contributed chapters, we identify 25 variables that the authors proposed as related to the COVID-19 pandemic and their relationships to FSI indicator categories (see Table ). Note: Although governmental effectiveness promotes security among the citizenry, the overall effect in this model is negative-or diminishing-because the fragmentation of elites has damaged governmental effectiveness.

The direct, first-order effects are those that immediately impact other variables in the system. The first-order effects of the COVID-19 pandemic implied by the model are depicted in Figure

Exploring economic variables, Schenker illustrates how ecommerce has boomed as people in developed countries have transitioned to the virtual environment to do business, find entertainment, and shop to satisfy even basic needs. Kuznar demonstrates a feedback loop between the pandemic and economic globalization: travel associated with economic globalization was the primary driver of the pandemic's spread, 3 while the pandemic intensified economic interdependence for scarce resources, stressing the international supply chains upon which economic globalization depends.

According to the model, the pandemic has triggered a spike in disinformation (see Figure

The variables most influenced by disinformation include governmental effectiveness and the illicit economy and TCOs. Governmental ineffectiveness and disruptions in the provision of essential services foster democratic decline. These factors also fuel crime, inequality, powerlessness, and displacement, eroding governmental capacity and creating insecurity. Moreover, disinformation has an inherently self-perpetuating effect, exhibiting classic positive feedback within the system. In other words, disinformation begets more disinformation in the system and, therefore, is a particularly pernicious and destabilizing weapon of war. This model illuminates how disinformation campaigns, especially from Russia and China, represent a critical threat to the United States.
Similar to disinformation, corruption has a negative influence on governance-including the provision of essential services and governmental effectiveness-fostering democratic decline. When combined with corruption, as described in depth by Hashemi et al., these factors lead to unequal protection, increased crime, and a growth in the illicit economy and transnational criminal organizations. Corruption also has a strong influence on feelings of powerlessness, driving racial and ethnic divisions and, most of all, eroding a nation's ability to secure its citizenry. The highly disruptive influence of corruption on political stability in this model mirrors the results of recent empirical studies demonstrating a similarly strong and negative impact of corruption on political systems.

The model of the world system during the COVID-19 pandemic, developed and analyzed in this chapter, illuminates the dynamic and interactive multiplicity of temporary and enduring challenges that U.S. and U.S. partner intelligence and national security establishments have experienced by failing to adequately anticipate the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated outcomes. At the time of this writing, the pandemic is reproducing and perpetuating deadlier variants of the virus-including the Delta variant, which is sweeping unprotected regions of the world-regions where domestic and international political and public health arenas are fraught with turmoil and infodemic-related distrust and where the vaccine is most needed to stop the spread. The COVID-19 pandemic has weakened governmental and civil institutions, as well as social cohesion, leaving governments less capable of countering obstacles such as economic decline and criminal activity and challenges from non-state violent actors and illegitimate political rivals.
The pandemic has exacerbated and exposed the vulnerabilities of relatively resilient, advanced industrialized, institutionalized democracies, such as the United States. In less stable regions and conflict zones of the developing world-such as the Middle East, Latin America, and the Caribbean, in particular, where human insecurity was already a problem-the delicate fiber of the state-society relationship is fraying, unraveling, and, in some cases, disintegrating. In Tunisia-the Arab Spring's only success story-the lethality of the Delta variant is overwhelming the health care system, heaping pressure on the country's nascent democracy, which has already resulted in fragmentation.

In Latin America and the Caribbean, failure to mitigate pandemicassociated economic shocks is exacerbating popular discontent with political elites, undermining political stability, and increasing the risk of outsider or illegitimate actors seizing power. Local gangs, as well as drug trafficking and organized crime groups, are supplanting legitimate officials and elites, as noted by Blanco. This model of the breakdown of formal state institutions and disintegration of the social contract is most clearly playing out in Haiti where the pandemic has put that country's already weak political, economic, and social institutions to the test, grinding public services in many areas to a halt. Working-class neighborhoods have descended into zones of lawlessness as public institutions have been abandoned, and the lives of ordinary people have become subject to the will of well-armed gangs. The political crisis deepened in July 2021, when armed mercenaries assassinated Haitian president Jovenel Moise at his home in the night, leaving the government in disarray, with no parliament or

A WORLD EMERGING FROM PANDEMIC employing new techniques and initiating new trade routes and delivery strategies. Online exploitation has grown significantly during the pandemic as young people become victims of child sexual exploitation and senior citizens are targeted by financial scammers. Criminals exploit timber and other natural resources as these environmental products are inadequately protected during COVID-19. The drastic increase in the volume of the online activity surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic makes it difficult to combat these transnational crimes and requires new strategies and tactics.

A WORLD EMERGING FROM PANDEMIC the authentic field of asymmetric warfare operations. The know-how gained could then be adjusted to the American setting and tested in wargaming exercises, allowing for the design of proactive, sound, and empirically-based policies for the prevention, mitigation, and interdiction of foreign malign operations in the United States.   Our interpretation of the authors' statements regarding the causal relationship between the pandemic and these variables, as well as the variables' relationships to each other, enables us to produce a network of influences among all the variables. The network is represented by a matrix of direct (first-order) relationships between each of the variables, in which a negative relationship receives a -1, a positive relationship, 1, and no relationship, 0. The connections between variables were not weighted, even though some variables are likely to have a stronger impact than others. We extracted as much information as we felt we responsibly could from the authors' works and tried not to infer more than was reasonable. Also, the analysis is static in that it assumes that the first-order effects do not change with time. History shows us that this probably is not the case, as noted by Kuznar and Vlahos. As the pandemic subsides and economies recover, the second-order effects in these variables are likely to change. An analysis like this, therefore, is best suited for identifying unforeseen n th order effects in a system as it currently exists. Finally, the assumptions of our model should not be taken as authoritative or final. Further work with the experts who contributed to this volume and a fuller consideration of the relationships among these variables are necessary.
Nonetheless, our study provides preliminary results and serves as an example of how such a technique can provide intelligence analysts and national security end users with insights into the systemic effects of a pandemic-or any shock on a complex system-and expectations that can be tested with further data collection. Bearing in mind the limitations, our findings appear to confirm some of the higher-order effects anticipated by the authors and other researchers assessing the pandemic's effects. The network we created for this chapter is best understood as a world system that has existed during the COVID-19 pandemic. A world without the pandemic, or under a different shock (e.g., global economic collapse), might look different. Note: This network of COVID-19's effects on each variable examined by the authors of this book, as well as the variables' effects on each other, conveys the complexity of the pandemic's impact on the world system (as captured by the FSI of social, political, cohesion, and economic indicators). Because many thousands of pathways can be traced throughout the model, understanding the indirect effects of the connections among the variables and identifying the drivers requires an analytical approach that measures the degree to which a particular variable is related to the others. One straightforward approach involves matrix multiplication. Second-order relationships are calculated by multiplying the matrix of first-order relationships by itself; third-order relationships are calculated by multiplying the matrix by itself three times.

exacerbating structural inequalities, incentivizing crime, and deepening poverty and economic decline-especially among the world's most vulnerable populations. Their work demonstrates this is particularly true in countries that were already fragile or unstable before the pandemic began. Finally, as the various works of Blanco, Bodea  and Houle, Hall et al., Kuznar, Hashemi et al., Pollard et al., Jones and  Stefanidis, and Vlahos show, forced displacement and group grievances-stoked by inflamed racial and ethnic rivalries, as well as the growing powerlessness of underprotected groups-create permissive environments in which illicit economies and transnational criminal, as well as terrorist, organizations can thrive. These combined effects have most undermined the security of citizens around the globe, as illustrated by the greatest decline (-4) in Figure

A variable's effect usually diminishes with distance in a network, and downscaling the effects of each higher-order relation can account for this typical decay of influence. In this bar chart, each order is scaled by its largest number of connections between two variables.
This section focuses on the potential influence of specific factors that adversaries of the United States and its partners might leverage and provides measures of the threat potential that these factors have on other variables in the world system. Our application of the FSI model demonstrates that every variable, even COVID-19, is influenced to some degree by other variables, although some are less impacted (e.g., COVID-19)  and some are impacted by many others (e.g., food and water scarcity, essential services, economic inequality, governmental effectiveness). Variables introduced from outside the system (e.g., COVID-19) have few leverage points for control and are poor candidates for levers of control. Similarly, variables that are caused by a blend of other variables are difficult to leverage because orchestrating the confluence of many variables for a desired effect is tricky. Variables in the "sweet spot" for  Note: In this figure, the variable of disinformation (red bar) has exacerbated the first-through third-order effects of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout the world system, generating (as illustrated by blue bars) the greatest decline in security (-6) and the greatest rise in citizenry powerlessness (+4.9) and illicit economic activity (+4.6).
As shown by the model and examined in each of the contributions to this volume, the pandemic's most damaging effects have been on security and the citizenry's well-being, with correspondingly intensified perceptions of powerlessness and racial and ethnic divisions.
Examining these relationships more closely, the model indicates that corruption has the most salient adverse effect on security; therefore, the impacts of corruption throughout the world system are explored A WORLD EMERGING FROM PANDEMIC here (see Figure
