Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) tary operations against secondary targets such as the Netherlands and Naples either unilaterally or in conjunction with the Russians.
However, London's 1808 decision to commit the British army to the Iberian Peninsula marked a monumental policy change for the maritime economic power.
Yet this was not enough.
Although the British distracted Napoleon and tied down vital imperial resources in Iberia and the Mediterranean, they realized that Napoleon's hegemony over the Continent could only be broken in Central Europe.
For this reason, the British could not turn their backs on Austria, Prussia, and Russia even after all three counted among Napoleon's allies following the failed Franco-Austrian War of 1809.
The British understood that when the time came for Europe to a rise against France, Britain would be expected to support it both with arms and money.
