The industrial revolution first influenced the battlefield during the Crimean War, when the rifled musket, telegraph, and steamship combined to allow Britain and France to deploy forces and win against superior Russian numbers.
But neither side was willing to seriously mobilize national passions, manpower, and resources.
It was left to the opposing sides during the Civil War in the United States, South as well as North, to combine the "benefits" of technology (the railroad, steamboat, rifled musket and artillery, and telegraph) with the French Revolution's mobilization of the populace and national wealth.
The result was a terrible killing war of four years which owed its duration to a combination of the three "military revolutions" that had occurred up to that time: the strength of the nation-state, its ability to mobilize society, and the enormous | resources and new weapons of the in-Â£ dustrial revolution.
