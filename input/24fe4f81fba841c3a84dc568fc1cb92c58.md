In less than two hours, the F-16s were gone, and the C-17 was taxiing for takeoff.
The next base was Łask in Poland where a flight of US F-16s was scheduled to join them.
The C-17 could do this three more times before it had to return to Ramstein and refit.
NATO forces were repeating this scene all over Eastern Europe.
The war is going well; Russia simply doesn't have the capacity to fight across such a broad front.
This scenario is fictional, but it depicts the high end of a new concept called untethered operations (UTO), which leverages robust basing and North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)/partner interoperability to complicate Russian targeting and create an arsenal of options for allied combat operations in Europe.
The Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and continued aggression toward Ukraine provide both insight into Russia's intentions and a grim reminder of its lethal potential to accomplish its goals.
As Russia reasserts itself in Eastern Europe and NATO gears up to respond rapidly, UTOs offer a glimpse of the future for allied air forces in the European antiaccess/area-denial (A2/AD) environment.
