At present, Russian leaders appear to have chosen to maximize petroleum revenues without making the long-term investments in oil fields that would increase oil and gas production over the long term.
With its riches in oil and gas, Russia is in a position to modernize and repair its ancient and dilapidated infrastructure and improve the welfare of its long suffering people.
Nevertheless, the current leadership has displayed little interest in such a course.
Instead, it has placed its emphasis on Russia's great power status.
For all its current riches, the brilliance of Moscow's resurgence, and the trappings of military power, Russia cannot hide the conditions of the remainder of the country.
The life expectancy of Russia's male population, 59 years, is 148 th in the world and places the country somewhere between East Timor and Haiti.
