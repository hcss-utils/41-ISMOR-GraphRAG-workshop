In the Information Age, nation-states compete in the space between peace and declared conflict.
The most significant instrument of national power in this space is information.
Russia is more able to dynamically operate in the Information Environment (IE) than the United States.
Russia leveraged the information instrument of national power in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine to set conditions for overt military action.
Russian New Generation Warfare activities in Ukraine from 2013-2017 frame threats the United States faces from Russia in the IE, both in the gray zone and in the event of large-scale combat operations.
The fundamental problem facing the Department of Defense ability to support a whole-of-government approach to competition with Russia in the IE is a misunderstanding of information operations and the IE.
Some areas in which capability gaps exist that contribute to this misunderstanding are doctrine, organization, and leadership education.
Reforms in these three areas can significantly improve the defense enterprise's understanding of information and operating in the IE.
