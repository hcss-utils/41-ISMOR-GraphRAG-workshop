France, by contrast, was bigger and richer than Britain and almost as oceanic as Britain throughout modern history, yet the French repeatedly squandered their assets by trying to be dominant on land and on sea simultaneously.
They invariably lost out in both theaters.
Imperial Germany was as bottled up as Russia, since the British could plug the North Sea; yet the Kaiser bought Admiral Tirpitz's theory that once a German High Seas Fleet reached a critical mass, the British would not risk a war and instead would grant Germany global concessions.
That strategy of threat and extortion only ensured the encirclement of Germany by a hostile alliance.
But sea powers can also make mortal blunders.
Japan enjoyed regional naval supremacy -indeed, a sort of Japanese Monroe Doctrine -from 1904 to 1937.
But rather than seeing insular Japan as the Asian mirror of Britain and privileging naval power, the Mikado saw Japan as the Asian mirror of Germany and privileged the army.
Hence, Japan exhausted itself in a suicidal bid for a mainland empire.
One might even say that the British, too, lost their maritime supremacy by engaging in two exhausting world wars on land.
One might even wonder whether the United States is in danger of squandering its supremacy through a serious of discretionary land wars in Asia.
