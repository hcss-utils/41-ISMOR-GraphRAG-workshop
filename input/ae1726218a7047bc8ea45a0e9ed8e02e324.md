Each of the case studies in this research looks at slightly different conditions, but generally the same problem, with the challenge being to find the correct application of lethality and military force.
One of the challenges of research was identifying case studies which could potentially reflect future conditions of competition and conflict in which the U.S. may find itself.
The case studies of Colombia, Philippines, Afghanistan, and the Greek Civil war all deal with sub-state conflicts.
The Greek Civil War, and Crimea each deal with conflicts that transcended the state level, whose effects were felt on the global stage by great powers.
It was important for case study selection to find case studies that had ample data and previous research that could describe the nature of the conflict, and depict U.S., or in the case of Crimea-Russian, intervention.
Some approaches in the cases of internal state conflict may still provide only context and insights at the state and sub-state levels.
