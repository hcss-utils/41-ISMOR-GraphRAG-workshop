While difficult to disentangle fully from geopolitical factors, as noted above, ideological factors emerged in our case studies as important parts of the explanation for why states have historically pursued robust proxy warfare programs.
On this front, the current environment and anticipated trends are not as grim.
Neither of the two current major U.S. competitors, China and Russia, has a particularly ideological regime, certainly not in comparison with the regimes of China and the Soviet Union during the earlier Cold War period.
Neither represents a globalized ideology with a readymade set of potential partners throughout other parts of the world (and, conversely, potential local partners lack a ready-made ideology to appeal to China or Russia for assistance).
Indeed, the main professed ideological difference that China and Russia represent relative to the United States and its allies is a focus on state sovereignty and the continuity of existing governments, regardless of those governments' behavior or treatment of their people. (
Russia's activities in Ukraine since 2014 and other activities of both Russia and China justify some skepticism of how sincerely these ideologies are held.)
This stated ideology may or may not increase their willingness to provide support to governments in the midst of civil conflicts, but it does not seem likely to increase their interest in providing support to VNSAs.
