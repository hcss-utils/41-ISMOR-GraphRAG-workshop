Russia's experience with the armed conflict with Georgia shows that in case of short-term military campaign of August 2008, Russia employed its cyber-warfare capabilities as a corollary to its extensive ground military operation.
These cyber-measures aimed at hindering the Georgian Government's efforts to resist and retaliate the adversary's superior ground and naval forces.
The major achievement of Russian cyber-operations during the war was psychological, having demonstrated Moscow's ability to disrupt Georgian Government's communication channels with its own population.
However, for Russian armed forces, these cyber-measures did not bring about any qualitative advantage over Georgia.
