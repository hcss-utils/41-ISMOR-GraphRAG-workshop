In a future conflict with China or Russia, these nations will leverage advanced capabilities to degrade, disrupt, or deny U.S. operational-level communications.
One of three scenarios will occur.
In the first and most unlikely scenario, the enemy will be ineffectual in their attempts to degrade, disrupt, or deny U.S. operational-level communications; thus, the joint air operations process will continue as it has for the last three decades.
In the second scenario, the enemy will be effective in degrading or disrupting operational-level communications, forcing an alternate or contingency method of ATO dissemination within the existing joint air operations process.
Finally, in the third scenario, the enemy will be effective in denying operational-level communications, cutting off the JAOC from tactical units, and forcing the joint air operations team to operate based on commander's intent, MTO, and CBA.
