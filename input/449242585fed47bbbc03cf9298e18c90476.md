Russia, formerly an ally of Britain and France, had withdrawn from the war in a state of collapse, then to succumb to the Bolshevik Revolution.
In response Washington sent troops, with others, to intervene in an ongoing civil war on the side of forces loyal to the discredited monarchy, with hopes of strangling the communist baby in its cradle.
This armed intervention in Russia is all but forgotten in the United States, but what would American history books say had Russian troops ever intervened in America's own past?
Many historians date the actual onset of the Cold War to this armed incursion into Russia.
One thing is certain: the extremely hostile response of the western capitalist nations to the Russian revolution had the effect of tightening the grip of totalitarianism in that country.
