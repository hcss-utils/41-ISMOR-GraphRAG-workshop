Advocates of engagement tend to argue that China today, even under Xi Jinping, is quite different from the China or Russia we confronted in the Cold War era, and that Chinese leaders' commitment to high levels of trade give them an incentive to act moderately, even if China catches up and overtakes the United States in total GDP.

High trade levels do not constrain such states and indeed may only make things worse by increasing China's ability to project power and to leverage its trading partners.
