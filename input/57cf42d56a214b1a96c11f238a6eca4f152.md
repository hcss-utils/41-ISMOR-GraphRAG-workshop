The Russian Army deployed to Chechnya in December 1994 to defeat a band of Chechen separatists who were looking to carve an independent Muslim state from Southern Russia.
The separatists wanted autonomy for Chechnya in much the same way the populations of Bosnia and Croatia wanted autonomy from the Former Republic of Yugoslavia.
In his report to the U.S. Marine Corps titled "David Slays Goliath: A Chechen Perspective on the War in Chechnya," Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Jackson relates that the Russians entered Chechnya "with the intent of removing Chechen separatist leader, Jokhar Dudayev, and replacing his government with one more favorable to Moscow.
Two years later, the last units of the Russian force withdrew from Chechnya" without fulfilling their objectives.
