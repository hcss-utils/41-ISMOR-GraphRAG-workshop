The discussions regarding deployment of the GTA to Belarus surfaced in the months and weeks leading to the Zapad-17 quadrennial operational-strategic exercise when the Russian MoD announced a tender for 4,162 wagons for the implementation of rail transportation to Belarus and back for 2017.
However, because of Zapad, the entire year was marked with an increase in the exercise tempo of the Russian units deployed in the Western JSC and within Belarus.
Between May and August, Russia and Belarus conducted joint exercises to test their electronic warfare (EW), logistics, engineering, C2, CBRN, and air defense capabilities, which prepared the ground for further testing during Zapad in September.
According to Pavel Kovalev from the Belarusian Military-Political Review, even with all the exercises conducted in 2017 between Russia and Belarus, only 1,254 railcars were earmarked for Zapad-17, which was akin to the 2013 figure.
