Part of ensuring security for U.S. territory is the continuing issue of strategic deterrence.
The START agreement is the current guide for reducing the tens of thousands of nuclear warheads currently distributed between the U.S. and the fjr former Soviet states to a mere 4000-6000 warheads on either side of the Atlantic.
2 8 If Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan continue to reduce their nuclear arsenal, the United States might revise its nuclear deterrence strategy into a multi-lateral force de frappe dissuasion of renegade states, analogous to France's nuclear employment policy.
As many as 12 Third World countries now possess ballistic missiles, but some analysts see proliferation of extended range delivery systems as the essence of post-cold war multi-polar expansionism.
While the world is becoming more dangerous in this regard, dissuasion of such states by means of large nuclear arsenals is a dubious assumption for non-rational actors.
A new nuclear deterrence strategy of "minimum sufficiency" would imply reducing ballistic missiles and submarine deployments down to the levels of the French and British. "
