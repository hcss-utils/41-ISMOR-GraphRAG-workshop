The Russian approach is an effective strategy for Russia because its primary competitor, the US (in the peacetime zone), only has peacetime or wartime options to deal with this situation.
The US military, with its focus on conventional war, needs Russia to be in the war zone of the spectrum in order to have effective military options that are palatable to the international community.
The US is ill-equipped technically and strategically to deal with the subsequent gray zone gap.
Thus, the gray zone comprises the US military's strategic flank and it is exposed.
In recognition of this vulnerability, the senior leaders of the land components of the US military, the senior leaders of the Army, Marines Corps, and SOCOM, think they have found the beginnings of an answer: the Human Domain (HD).
