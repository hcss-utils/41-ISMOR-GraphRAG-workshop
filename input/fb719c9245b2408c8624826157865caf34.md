Russian military doctrine for the use of nuclear weapons has also continued to develop, even disavowing the long-standing Soviet pledge of no first use.
Indeed, Russian military planners have argued that limited use oflow-yield nuclear weapons could reasonably be expected to de-escalate a conflict and curtail a conventional war of attrition.
If the United States eliminates its remaining nonstrategic nuclear weapons, it must rely on threats of direct escalation to strategic nuclear war if Russia vows to use its nonstrategic nuclear weapons.
MAD has been the hallmark of nuclear deterrence throughout most of the Cold War and is still generally considered sufficiently credible for attacks against the United States.
However, it is not as easy to credit the notion that the United States might respond to first use of a nonstrategic nuclear weapon on a battlefield with either a civilization-ending barrage or even a single strategic nuclear weapon.
