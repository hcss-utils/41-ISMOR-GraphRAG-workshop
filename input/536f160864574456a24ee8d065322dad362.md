-The Period of Reform: With the challenge of Napoleon in the beginning of the 19th century there began a time of important reform for the Prussian and, ultimately German, military.
After disastrous military defeats at the battles of Jena and Auerstaedt (1806-1807), a team of civilian and military leaders under the direction of such men as Hardenburg, Baron vom Stein, and Generals Scharnhorst and Gneisenau totally reformed the Prussian army system.
In addition to the short-term defeat of Napoleon, these reforms also would lead eventually to an almost continuous attempt to identify German nationalism with an army-led militarism.
