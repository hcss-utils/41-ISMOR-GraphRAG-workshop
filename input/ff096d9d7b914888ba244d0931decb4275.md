Additionally, Russia has undertaken much more aggressive and directed short-term gray zone actions that involved the threat of or actual use of violence, usually when it perceived its vital interests to be at risk, which is displayed in the lower right-hand box.
This category includes Russia's 2008 war in Georgia and the 2014 war in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine.
From the start, the former was a conventional military offensive disguised as a peacekeeping operation, which included a small number of gray zone tactics, including cyberattacks to interrupt Georgian government communications, and a media campaign to promote the Russian government's narrative in the breakaway region of South Ossetia and to the international community.
