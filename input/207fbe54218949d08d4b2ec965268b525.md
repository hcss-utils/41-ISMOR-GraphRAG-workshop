To examine this subject, over the following four sections, this monograph addresses Russian military reform, the advent of Russian SOF within the context of that reform, and the deduced Russian approach to special operations.
Russia's modern theory of special operations and its conception of SOF employment requires an understanding of the larger context of Russian military reforms, as well as the recent employment of the Russian military, and the capability gaps identified therefrom.
Famously, irregular warfare featured prominently in Russia's intervention in Ukraine in 2014.
While their actions in Ukraine remain an important example of Russian irregular warfare, the reform of Russian special operations capability developed in a larger security context.
Fortunately for the study of this subject, Russia waged a military campaign on either side of its reform efforts -Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine in 2014.
In light of the broader Russian security context and conventional military reforms, the reform of its special operations capability suggests that Russia has identified a need for an elite unit designed for both direct action and unconventional warfare.
Consequently, they designed a force tailored to provide such options for Russian leadership.
