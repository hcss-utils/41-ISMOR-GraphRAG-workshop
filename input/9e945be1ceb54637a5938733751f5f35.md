The end of the Cold War has not brought an end to the need for careful thought about the defense of peace and security in the world. On the contrary, the collapse of the system on which international relations were based for a half-century, the rapid development of new military technology, and the predictable demand in the United States and its allies for sharp reductions in expenditure for defense, together require the most serious and penetrating consideration of what should be the shape and character of the forces needed to preserve the peace and defend American interests in the years to come.
There is broad agreement that we are probably in the midst of what is called a revolution in military affairs that is rapidly altering the character of warfare. Because this has been driven largely by the availability of new or greatly improved technologies, the temptation has been to look primarily to the application of advanced technology as the answer to current and future military challenges. The temptation is to seek victory through the use of accurate and deadly bombs and missile fired from aircraft far above the ground or from ships far out at sea, to find a "silver bullet" that will achieve the goals of war without casualties and without, for the most part, any serious use of ground forces.
The development and use of such weapons will certainly be important, but it is wrong and dangerous to imagine they can do the job alone. The Gulf War showed the potentiality of such weapons, but they were not a "silver bullet." Bombardment at a distance played an important role in the victory over Iraq, but it did not defeat Saddam's army. That crucial task was accomplished chiefly by ground forces, and it would be reckless to imagine that such forces will not be vital to success in wars of the future.
Ground forces must be equipped with the best weapons and equipment of the new era, but that will not be adequate if the new devices are merely grafted onto a military organization that is not designed specifically to use them to best effect. True revolutions in military affairs depend on the reconfiguration of forces to meet new conditions, and they require new fighting doctrines. Lieutenant Colonel (P) Douglas A. Macgregor's study, Breaking the Phalanx, economically and convincingly makes the case for the inescapable importance of land forces in wars of the future and, no less important, in helping to deter such wars. Colonel Macgregor brings a remarkable panoply of training, education and experience to the task. A professional soldier, he is a graduate of West Point and an experienced leader of American combat troops in action during the Gulf War. Beyond that, he is a student of history and a scholar of the military art of the first rank. This rare combination allows him to understand current events and developments with the wisdom
In the perspective of history, there are very few models for a 21st Century American Army designed to dominate areas of American strategic interest, convey ideas, exert influence and control the pace of human events through superior organization, leadership, discipline and technology. However, one stands out.
In 200 BC, the Macedonians in alliance with Sparta and Syria set out to regain control of Greece and the Aegean coast of Asia Minor from Rome's Greek allies. After two years of inconclusive fighting, the Roman and Macedonian Armies finally met in the hill country of Thessaly. When the two armies collided in battle, the Macedonian right wing drove back the Roman left; but while the Macedonian left was deploying from march column on uneven ground, it was struck in the flank and routed by the Roman right. Part of the advancing Roman right suddenly swung around-apparently without orders-hitting the Macedonian right wing and driving it from the field in confusion. Macedonian losses were about 13,000; Roman, a few hundred. Without the means to continue the war, the Macedonians renounced all claims to Greece and the Aegean coast. Rome's victory made Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean an integral part of the Roman Empire for half a millenium. And the Phalanx, the backbone of the Macdeonian military system, was broken.
Until the smaller, more agile Roman Legions (4,500-6000 men) deployed in checkerboard formation destroyed the Phalanx, the ancient world regarded the Macedonian Phalanx as invincible. In a typical phalanx nearly ten thousand heavily armed soldiers stood 16 deep. Their tactic was simple and deadly: a perfectly aligned charge at a dead run against the enemy's weak point. But these tactics failed in action against the Roman Legions which could maneuver more easily without fear of losing alignment, and without the need for concern about gaps in the line-the gaps were built in! For efficiency in attacking, subduing, occupying, administering and pacifying hostile territory, the Roman legion has seldom been equaled by another military organization. The same legions who routed the enemy in battle, could handle disarmament control, police patrol and general administrative supervision.

Like it or not, the logic of international relations that positioned Rome at the center of world affairs also compels the United States to remain engaged in the world at a time when America's economic dominance is substantially reduced from what it was just after World War II. There is no going back, in other words, to the assumption on which the traditional American nation-state was founded: that a small army, augmented by large numbers of reservists, is all that is needed to hold the enemy at bay while civilian economic facilities are converted to wartime production. 
2
For strategic planners, though, rethinking warfare is not easy. The end of the Cold War saw the beginning of the end of another, equally significant era in world history-that of industrial age warfare. That era opened in the nineteenth century with the first appearance of mass-produced modern artillery weapons and culminated with the American-led Coalition's victory over Iraq in the Gulf War. Iraq's dramatic defeat suggested new ways in which the United States could attack an opponent technologically.

Recognizing that the evolution of the United States Army into a new form will depend on more than the incorporation of new technology, this monograph seeks answers to questions which confront the United States Army today: Is landpower essential to American strategic dominance? Can the Army's elected and appointed leaders shape warfighting organizations that are skilled enough, smart enough and enduring enough to maneuver within a joint framework through the treacherous environment of contemporary and future conflict? How do political and military leaders ensure crisp execution of complex operations and winning performance in battle without restricting human potential and suffocating the American soldier's individual brains and initiative? Answers to these questions must be found before key choices are made by defense planners.
But the first step in the process of finding answers to these questions, however, is that policymakers understand that future control of events on land in areas of pivotal strategic interest cannot be achieved without a substantial American Army. In this connection, the most important factor in evaluating the importance of landpower to American strategic dominance, is not being blinded by the immediate consequencessuccessful or not-of a single event.

DESERT STORM demonstrated for the first time, really, that American landbased air and rapidly deployable Army heavy ground forces are global weapons like the legions of the ancient world.

Even if reasonable and promising strategies for the near-term adaptation of existing warfighting structures achieve an incremental improvement in the Army's warfighting capabilities, today's military leaders will want to develop new warfighting formations that can effectively exploit both new technology and increased human potential. Whether there is a current revolution in military affairs is still being debated. What is certain, however, is that organizational change in armies can produce revolutionary change in warfare.

On the grounds of logic, politics and the absence of an impending war, many will dispute the notion, that fielding a new, reorganized Army within a joint strategic framework is at least as important to the nation as welfare reform, deficit reduction and health care. Many defense analysts are already suggesting that reducing the Army to eight or even six divisions would produce quick savings that could be plowed into the high technology areas of electronic warfare, aircraft and missiles.

Unfortunately, because this approach promises American influence abroad without US Forces on the ground it appeals to a rising tide of isolationist sentiment in America's domestic politics and reduces national defense to its raw economic rewards.

What transpires on prospective battlefields is influenced vitally years before in the councils of the staff and in the legislative halls of Congress. Time is the only thing that may be irrevocably lost, and it is the first thing lost sight of in the seductive false security of peaceful times... The sums appropriated this year will not be fully transformed into military power for two years. Persons who state that they see no threat to the peace of the United States would hesitate to make that forecast through a two year period.

Having said this, reshaping the Army force structure to reconcile trends in the technology of warfare and the new strategic environment with the Army's immediate need to preserve its readiness to fight and win today is easy in theory. In practice, reorganizing the Army for future missions in peace and war has never been easy and no new strategy will make it easier. But even if defense planners underestimate the scope of the necessary organizational changes or their short-term consequences, this would not in itself be sufficient grounds to reject organizational change unless the consequences of inaction are also taken into account.

• On the morning of October 21, 1805 the French and British fleets collided, just off the coast of Spain's Cape Trafalgar. When the day closed, eighteen French and Spanish ships had struck their colors. The most spectacular sea victory of the age had been won in four hours and the Royal Navy's greatest Admiral, Horatio Nelson, had achieved immortality. Six weeks later on December 2, 1805 the French Army met and defeated the combined armies of Austria and Russia near a small town named Austerlitz in Central Europe. It was a French strategic victory so complete and so overwhelming that French dominance of the European continent would not be successfully challenged again for eight years. It would take ten years and the combined efforts of several allied
European Armies to roll back French political dominance.
• In 1846, after difficult negotiations, Texas was formally annexed to the United States, despite Mexico's threat that this would mean war. Mexico, a second-rate military power without a navy, fought the United States for two years. Until a US Army landed unopposed near Vera Cruz and fought its way into Mexico City, the Mexican government could not be induced to accept peace on American terms.
• The Royal Navy subdued the German High Seas Fleet and dominated the world's oceans throughout World War I. But until America entered the war and American Ground Forces joined the British and French Armies on the Western Front, the British and French faced an unbeatable enemy and the prospect of probable defeat.
• Few challenges to Europe's stability have been as serious as the NATO's governments' decision to deploy the American intermediate range nuclear force (INF) on German soil in the 1980s. Concerted efforts on the part of the German anti-nuclear movement and the Soviet state nearly, succeeded in disrupting the INF deployment and splitting the Atlantic alliance. Western observers wondered why NATO's leadership insisted on deploying the Pershing II missile in Central Germany when a comparable missile system could be launched from US and British submarines in the North Sea. The Former German Chancellor, Helmut Schmidt, reminded the German public that the deployment had to be visible to have the desired political impact.
• Forty days of near constant air and missile attack during January and February 1991 neither dislodged the Iraqi Army from Kuwait nor destroyed Iraq's nuclear facilities and mobile missile launchers.

These accounts illustrate the centrality of landpower to the achievement of America's strategic objectives in war and peace. Why, then, given this record of experience, is there remarkably little appreciation in contemporary America for the strategic role of landpower? Part of the answer can be traced to America's reluctance to commit ground forces before conflict erupts to achieve important political objectives.
To understand the political forces that influence this thinking, it is essential to appreciate the beguiling notion that the US is unassailable because it is protected by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.

What the isolationist impulse obscures is the larger question of how best to maintain an international political and economic order that is consistent with the requirements of American national security? Had America's government sought an answer to this question instead of asserting international claims that could not be secured without landpower, America could have decisively influenced the circumstances which resulted in a series of twentieth century conflicts. 
10
Woodrow Wilson, (like Jefferson a century earlier), embraced grand objectives in the world but overlooked the need for an American Army to achieve them. Wilson perceived no connection between the prevention of aggression in Europe or Asia through the selective and skillful use of American Landpower and the preservation of American security. The notion that threats to regional security could be closely linked to threats to global economic prosperity was understood by Wilson only insofar as these threats related to commerce. Since the world's oceans were the medium of transport for American commerce, this only justified the maintenance of American seapower.

If unpreparedness for war is one pattern in twentieth century American politics, another is the swift return to an isolationist military posture immediately after conflict. This is based on the belief that military power held no relevance to the task of establishing new political institutions in the aftermath of war. After World War I, America's political leaders avoided the political and military commitments to achieve international stability along liberal capitalist lines-the conquest and occupation of strategic territory to secure the peace. Sensing the incompleteness of the allied victory over Germany in 1918, General Pershing, President Wilson's Army Commander in Europe, advised a longer and more thorough occupation of Germany. In urging the President to occupy Germany with US and allied troops, General Pershing may have recalled any number of examples suggesting that occupation was necessary to secure the peace. America's war with Mexico provided one.

Curiously, America's elected leaders in the 1920s continued to express confidence in the survival of an international order that was quickly passing. Technological, economic and political changes were steadily eliminating the circumstances of America's geographic isolation. Dramatic advances in aircraft, automotive and communications technologies coincided with the onset of the depression and the rise of anti-democratic states in Germany, Russia, Italy and Japan. Yet these developments did not yield an increase in funds for the modernization or enlargement of the US Army. When Army Chief of Staff, General Douglas MacArthur, urged Congress to appropriate money in 1934 for the modernization and modest expansion of the US Army to cope with the interwar revolution in military affairs, President Roosevelt's Republican friend and confidante, Senator Gerald Nye, called the Army Chief of Staff a "warmonger." Republicans in Congress were uninterested in the Army and rejected most of MacArthur's appeals to stockpile strategic materials as well as his plans for industrial mobilization-recommendations they would all remember five years later.

Wedemeyer reasoned that the technology of the twentieth century-railways, automotive and aviation technology-placed insular America at a disadvantage unless she could seize a foothold on the "world island" and one as close as possible to the heartland-European Russia. He persuaded Roosevelt that while air and sea forces would make vital contributions, effective and adequate ground forces would be needed "to close with and destroy the enemy inside his citadel." In order to take the strategic offensive, the United States would require an army capable of defeating the Germans. Though a citizen of the richest nation on earth, Wedemeyer was sensitive to the need for economy. He pointed out that a large scale invasion of Europe with the use of allied bases and staging areas would be less expensive than the cost of building amphibious forces for operations along the periphery of the world island. Eventually, his argument in favor of economy persuaded the President. The result was a plan to field a ground force consisting of 89 Army divisions and 6 Marine divisions.

By 1948, however, the strategic situation began to change. President Truman's Secretary of State negotiated the North Atlantic Treaty, which granted military assistance and endorsed strategic collaboration. In fundamental terms, the American policy of containment was conceived as the global strategy of an insular power to defend the Eurasian periphery against postwar Soviet Russia's formidable outward pressure from the Eurasian heartland.

The Army had almost no combat effectiveness. Ike had left me an administration rather than a military force. Half of the 552,000 officers and men were overseas on occupation duty, serving as policemen or clerks. The other half were in the states performing various administrative chores.

Western leaders had long been aware of Kuwait's strategic importance. Britain was the first to grasp the significance of Kuwait's central strategic position on the Eurasian landmass and cultivated a close relationship with the region's ruling elites during the eighteenth century.

Why Iraq invaded Kuwait when it did will be the subject of debate for many years. One important reason was the absence of any capable ground force in the region that could mount an effective counterattack against the attacking Iraqi Army. 
54
55
The decision to use force was a bold one since reductions in the Army were underway before the war with Iraq and indeed continued immediately after the war ended. One reason the President was able to opt for the use of force was the level of public support for action in the Gulf. This sent a signal to Congress that the President deserved support to fight a regional conflict in defense of unambiguous US and allied security interests.

In truth, the results of the air campaign were mixed. The claim by the US Air Force that airpower alone defeated the Iraqi Army, made in the first flush of victory, has not withstood even brief examination. 
60
61
Still, great claims were made regarding how effective the Coalition aerial onslaught had been on the Iraqi Army. General Merrill McPeak, the USAF Chief of Staff, insisted that this was the first war time in history that a field army had been defeated by airpower. He clearly had his own definition of defeat. In the war with Iraq, defeat meant the removal of Iraqi ground forces from Kuwait, something that required Coalition ground forces to attack and liberate Kuwait. It was true that Iraqi military morale in Kuwait was largely destroyed by forty days' exposure to Coalition bombing, but this may be attributed in part to the poor quality of Iraqi troops. Recent history is full of examples of good-quality soldiers withstanding devastating bombardments and then fighting back against ground attack with considerable success. 
63
65
The more important military event that largely escaped public detection was the US Navy's role during the Gulf War. Without American control of the sea lanes, American Ground Forces would not have been able to reach the Arabian Peninsula in great strength for many months. American dominance at sea made the strategic offensive to liberate Kuwait possible. Nearly 90% of the Army's equipment and ammunition was moved by sealift from the United States and Europe to the Arabian peninsula.

Iraq's behavior since 1991 has buttressed this opinion. Iraq's threatening moves in October 1994 precipitated a large deployment of Army heavy forces to Kuwait and, later, US Marines to Jordan. Airpower enthusiasts in the Pentagon insisted that this deployment was unnecessary. However, as a Kuwaiti officer made clear to an American member of the United Nation's headquarters in Kuwait: "If the US Army comes, we will stay and fight the Iraqis. Otherwise we will retreat to Saudi Arabia."

As the preceding sections illustrate, US national security interests and needs do not completely determine the structure of the American national military establishment. An American cultural disinclination to international engagement and popular misinterpretations of 20th Century conflict are at least as powerful as defined national interests. Assumptions that have changed very little over the last seventy years continue to yield consequences in the present that are distressingly similar to the past. Perceptions of US interests and defense needs today are reminiscent of the postwar perceptions that deprived the United States of a capable, ready Army when it was needed in the past. The following comments made in the aftermath of the Gulf War continue to reflect conventional wisdom and are all too familiar to those who have not lost sight of the historical record: '
• Peace between the major European and Asian powers themselves will be quite robust well into the distant future.
• The possibility of war between smaller European states, though a serious concern, is more a political problem for European and other multilateral security institutions than a taxing military contingency for US Forces.
• US interests in the Third World are neither vital nor significant; rather they are vague and ambiguous.
• US Forces will not become involved in the vast majority of Third World conflicts.
• But the subtler tools of power projection-security assistance, air power and naval forward presence in the context of crisis response will have frequent use.
• Simultaneous contingencies affecting US interests could occur, but it is extremely unlikely that more than one would require substantial levels of US combat power.
A continuity with the past runs through these words at a deeper level, regarding the intellectual underpinnings of an understandable American reluctance to engage in war as well as the assumptions concerning the dynamic international forces that link American strategic interests with American military power. These assumptions ignore the fact that wealth and power, or economic and military strength are always relative. Since all societies are subject to change, the international balance of forces is neither still nore permanent. These predictions also reflect a return to the American optimism that sprang up after World War I, the wishful thinking of the Roosevelt administration before World War II and the guidelines by which a succession of administrations have determined what and how much American landpower is enough since 1945. They also discount the value of landpower to a nation that cannot withdraw from world affairs. These predictions constitute a wish for an effective foreign and security policy while escaping the realities of international politics.
Although the Soviet threat has vanished, new threats are emerging. In 1995 and 1996, China launched ballistic missiles from bases on the Chinese mainland into the sea 84 miles north of Taiwan.

• Only seven countries in the world today have enjoyed a form of representative democracy for more than one hundred years and five of them speak English: Great Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Switzerland and France. Democracy is still strongest in those insular regions of the world where security has been strongest.
• Stable democracies do not suddenly appear. They develop. The social and institutional infrastructure requires time to be created. 
75
76
The consequences for US security interests of a broader anti-democratic roll-back in regions where American Landpower is absent should not be underestimated.
• American interests can only be inferred from visible ties America has to other states. Regional crises with the greatest chance for misperceptions of US resolve will be ones in which US interests are ambiguous. In this connection, sea-based systems and virtually present aircraft do not constitute visible ties. As America's experience in every major conflict and more recently in Kuwait, Haiti and Bosnia demonstrates, "boots on the ground" is the only visible tie that deters and defends US and allied interests and promise to defeat America's adversaries. It is no accident that, as of this writing, 40% of the US Army's Patriot batteries are deployed overseas and that two of the Army's heavy task forces are defending Kuwait while an additional two heavy brigades are operating in Bosnia.
• America's security interests are not limited to the continental United States.
Though vulnerable to Soviet missile attack for many years, North America is now vulnerable to attack from many states.

host of new relatively inexpensive weapon systems.
• US regional deterrence strategy will continue to rely on conventional military threats to deny a future adversary's war aims promptly. American landpower is an impressive threat to any regime whose hold on power will not be undermined by "hightech" military threats to the economic infrastructure. Army overseas presence is a key element in a preventive defense strategy that seeks to keep potential dangers to US security from becoming full-blown threats. 
81
• Finally, the United States must consider the possibility that a new, hightechnology military superpower could emerge Today, this possibility seems remote. If, however, the American strategic alliance with traditional allies is allowed to lapse and the international environment becomes more and more unstable, other states may feel compelled to develop substantial military power to protect their interests. 
82
Avoidance of war has been the foundation of American defense policy since the end of World War I. The desire to avoid war will continue to animate American thinking about security well into the 21st Century. Americans also understand that security is the real basis for economic growth; not the other way around. Money flows into secure areas and out of flashpoint areas. Economic growth is the wellspring of democratic institutions.
American Landpower has the capacity to enable states and peoples to develop political and economic structures that secure domestic prosperity and international peace. Japan's war with its neighbors and America did not end in 1945. It ended with the implementation of a new constitution and Japan's incorporation within a broader alliance of democratic states. Germany's war with Europe and the United States ended with its entry into NATO and the European Economic Community. These transformations were not simply the byproduct of American military victory in World War II. America contributed to victory in World War I and no such change occurred. This is because the transformation of Japan and Germany into modern democratic states was achieved behind a defensive line drawn on the ground by American Landpower.
But the evidence suggests that there are challenges requiring the commitment of American Landpower which the United States may face sooner than it thinks. Some of these challenges will involve containing the spread of weapons of mass destruction through a readiness to preemptively strike with special operations forces the production facilities that provide these weapons. Other challenges will involve intervention in regions where instability in one state threatens an entire region with disintegration. Recent events in Bosnia, Rwanda and Southwest Asia provide a glimpse of what may lie ahead in China, India, Pakistan and North Korea. America's Ground Forces will have to be prepared to perform the tasks Caesar assigned to his legions-win wars, restore order, and preserve a stable and prosperous peace wherever direct American influence is required.
Landpower alone cannot possibly solve all of the nation's future security problems in a world seething with disaffection and change. But without the application of landpower to areas of strategic importance to American and allied security international political order will deteriorate. Today's international security order is an order with the United States at its center. But an order built without ground forces is an order whose foundation rests on sand. Ships, planes, bombs and missiles cannot do the job alone.

On reflection, the history of military affairs can be seen as a continuous quest for victory, and evolution is simply the term given to that process by which the structures of military organizations change over time in pursuit of battlefield success. How modern Armies meet the demands of war helps to explain why the factors of science, technology, social change, organizational culture and economic strength all interact to shape warfighting organizations and repeated revolutions in military affairs (RMA). In this sense it is important to distinguish between evolutionary and revolutionary change. In evolutionary change, progress is made by improving the last generation of military equipment and organizations, but continuity still exists between the old and new generations. In periods of revolutionary change, almost no continuity exists between generations-we are looking at something entirely new.' This chapter argues that RMAs are not necessarily driven by huge and obvious advances in technology. The long-bow, which certainly revolutionized warfare, was a relatively small technological advance over the "short bow" -a simple question of materials technology and manufacturing technique. Likewise, the change necessary to allow bullets to fit snugly into gun barrels, thus making possible first rifles, then fully automatic weapons, was a metallurgical change which is minor when compared with the enormous changes in microcircuitry which have occurred over the last 15 years. Rather, RMAs come about not because technology has improved, but because armed forces devise new ways to incorporate new technology by changing their organization, tactics and, sometimes, their whole concept of war.

The need for understanding the nature of organizational change in military affairs is particularly acute today. Most arguments for or against change in the comtemporary US Armed Forces contain a large measure of vested interest. Military leaders with strong allegiance and nostalgia for the arms to which they have devoted their lives do not relish the idea of change. 
3
Because the development of modern military organizations has often been characterized by problems and processes of strategy and structure analogous to those experienced by corporate business, this chapter begins with a brief discussion of how America's private sector is coping with the information age. A distinguishing feature of the modern world has been that superior economic competitiveness and superior military power have tended to accompany oneanother.

General Krulak, Marine Corps Commandant, had sound reasons for sending his senior officers to the New York Stock Exchange in December 1995. Wall Street traders are among the world's fastest decisionmakers. What better way to determine whether there are methods already in use that enable military leaders to change the way they organize forces and think about combat in order to act more quickly and effectively?

Rather than trying to perfect flawed, inefficient systems, the most successful corporations opted for fundamental change. This is because tinkering around the edges through incrementalism could not produce the needed improvements in performance when the demand for success in an extremely competitive global market required profound change. Traditional adaptive organizational paradigms impose an overly mechanistic and orderly vision of change on organizations that are already full of complexity, change and disorder. 
7
At the same time, successful companies which were unwavering in their core ideology and values were still willing, even eager, to overthrow everything else: strategies, structures, procedures, measurements and incentives. They understood the difference between "what we stand for" and "how we do things."
Successful companies maintained ideological control, but promoted operational autonomy. In the last decade, their story in business can be characterized as the triumph of distributed brains over centralized brawn*
• What looks in retrospect like brilliant foresight and preplanning is more often the result of "Let's just try a lot of stuff and keep what works."

Bill Gates' Microsoft is among the best known, so-called "visionary" corporations. Microsoft's first operating principle is simple: radical autonomy. From the beginning, members of the Windows NT group organized themselves into small units with their own rules, styles and ways of working. With the ideological goals and values of Microsoft for orientation, these groups struck out in whatever direction seemed promising.
The organizational process, however, is referred to as "flattening the organization." Organizations flatten their structures by eliminating the need for intermediate management by exception. In the private sector, a structure such as the insurance pricing bulletin board reduces the need for supervision of agents by raising the level of authority of the individual agent. Electronic posting of the limits of the authority affords centralized transmission of standards and immediate processing of requests by subordinates for exceptions to policy only. 
10
The second principle was minimal top-down coordination. 
11
Microsoft's success in the private sector further demonstrates that the ideal horizontal structure produces the least disorder in information flow. 
12
Microsoft's transformation into a "visionary corporation" was also premised on dramatically improving the corporation's performance to achieve extraordinary results. This transformation required changing the organization's culture, work-force management methods, and information management. Under Gates' leadership, top management imposed a new vision of high performance to be achieved through increased commitment to exploit new technology, along with performance measurement systems, to assess attainment of the organization's goals. In the Army where performance evaluation of units and commanders is thoroughly subjective, this may mean developing objective criteria in peacetime training to determine who is and who is not competent to command in combat before the shooting starts! Attempts to develop these in the past have been resisted on the grounds that such criteria are too hard to identify. 
13
14
15
Of course, whenever emphasis is placed on performance data and more efficient utilization of manpower, management creates a new organizational culture focused on its performance, productivity and goals. This produces success and success, in turn, breeds more success. Accomplishments become linked to new methods and new attitudes.

Frustrated with rising labor costs in the sixties and seventies, especially skilled labor, auto industry executives searched for information age technology in the early eighties that would provide them with full visibility on production and reduce the need for skilled labor. Their best engineers built detailed models of decision processes, input and objective functions and designed an impressive production control system. Still, the system was too rigid and too dependent on centralized authority and control to keep pace with changing market conditions. One analyst observed that "the American auto industry had perfected the methods of fighting the last war and, this time, the Japanese beat the pants off them!" Why? Auto industry executives failed to recognize the dynamic nature of their production processes. They became fixated on winning wage battles with organized labor and limited the goal of their system to cost reduction. In doing so they consolidated control and limited the ability of subordinates to adapt and modify the process. By imposing these restrictions on a process requiring continuous adaptation they firmly entrenched the organization and set the conditions for failure. The failure precipitated wholesale changes in leadership and organizational structure. It took the new team ten years to reengineer the organization around a productivity enhancement system. n
In the end, efforts to minimize the cost-benefit ratio through the carefully coordinated action of thousands of little cogs, all to be interconnected and fine-tuned to the performance of their special tasks in the hands of a supreme management team, did not work. Like many large institutions, the auto industry was well-adapted to periods of incremental change, but could not manage transforming change. For the auto industry, the information age business environment proved to be an unstable one, filled with fluctuation, uncertainty and unwelcome change. The industry's leaders attempted to impose order through the use of technologically sophisticated, information age decisionmaking aids on the fluid information age market and failed.
In retrospect, it seems clear that only organizational strategies which link the work activities of organizations at every level by treating chaos and instability as sources of creative renewal will succeed in producing organizations that can effectively exploit information age technology. Innovation, that is, the application of knowledge to produce new knowledge, is not, however, a product of simple inspiration, best done by loners in their garages. It requires systematic effort, decentralization and diversity, that is, the opposite of central planning and centralization.
Unfortunately, without the violence of war to impart the inspiration for change through the need for survival, very few military establishments turn out to be capable of maintaining a degree of order in peacetime which makes change possible. Yet, when professional military establishments think about future conflict and embrace change in peacetime, the results in war are frequently "revolutionary" in character.
Knowing whether or not there is a new revolution in military affairs requires some basis for judging the extent to which contemporary warfare is actually changing into a new form which diverges dramatically from previous experience.

In the execution of dominating maneuver, however, an attacking force conducts decisive operations incorporating some or all of the features of an RMA. Armed forces execute dominating maneuver when they successfully exploit technology, organization, training and leadership to attain qualitatively superior fighting power as well as dramatic positional advantages in time and space which the enemy's countermeasures cannot defeat. Such operations result in a paralyzing blow against an opposing force with near-simultaneous effects on every level of war-strategic, operational and tactical.
An important precondition for the conduct of dominating maneuver is battlespace dominance by the attacking force. Battlespace dominance implies a superior knowledge of and influence over events within a defined space or area of operations for a specific period of time. For a conceptual understanding, it is necessary to examine the evidence provided by three examples of revolutionary change in modern military history in which dominate maneuver was featured: Napoleon's Ulm campaign in 1805, the German attack on France in 1940 and Operation DESERT STORM in 1991. 
23
Of Napoleon's campaigns, none is more important to an understanding of dominating maneuver than the Ulm campaign of September-October 1805. Alerted by French intelligence agents in Germany to Austrian and Russian military mobilization, Napoleon moved his 200,000 troops 300 miles from their encampment in Boulogne in a wide envelopment along multiple axes across Western Europe to converge on the Austrian rear in Ulm. Thanks to careful French diplomacy, strict security measures and the elimination of the French Army's dependence on fixed supply points, the operation was completed in only seven weeks! Separate corps-size elements (25,000-30,000 troops) were given independent missions with mutually supporting objectives. Occupied with a 30,000-man French cavalry screen in the Black Forest region, the Austrians unwisely discounted the possibility that the main body of the French Army would advance on a broad concentric front over difficult terrain. Moreover, the Austrians thought, French forces would have to concentrate before attempting any significant attack and this French military build-up would provide the Austrians with adequate time to concentrate their own forces for a counter-strike. Surprised and isolated by the crushing rapidity of the French advance and by the presence of the French Army far behind their front, the Austrian forces at Ulm were compelled to surrender. Yet the Ulm campaign was not only an overwhelming victory for the French, it also decisively set the terms for Napoleon's subsequent battle with the combined Austrian and Russian Armies at Austerlitz in December-a titanic action which ended with the virtual destruction of the Austro-Russian Armies. 
24
First, prior to Ulm armies were generally small-30,000-70,000 troops-and the battlefield rather than the theater of war was the commander's arena. Social and industrial revolution in France radically changed this condition and created both mass armies and the means to mass-produce standardized weapons and supplies. To an extent not thought possible in an age without radio communications, this facilitated decentralized control of forces moving simultaneously on multiple axes of advance. Standarized artillery, improved artillery munitions, glass jars for preserving food and rifled muskets were all part of the industrial age RMA. Napoleon's appreciation of these new battlefield dynamics enabled the French to wage a war of greater spatial scope and duration.
Second, Napoleon organized his forces into today's familiar system of battalions, brigades, divisions and corps. In fact, put aside the weapons and vehicles modern technology has provided, and there is really little difference between Napoleonic organizations and those of today. But, in their time, these organizational innovations had a revolutionary impact!

27
Third, the Ulm and Austerlitz campaigns of 1805 were the first test of the new Napoleonic cavalry system and the first of its triumphs.

On reflection, Napoleon's willingness during the Ulm campaign to delegate command, to accelerate the tempo of operations, to risk dispersion on the approach march, and to concentrate large, independent bodies of troops at critical points on the battlefield produced a relatively inexpensive victory in terms of French human and materiel resources as well as a new conception of time and space. Of course, for full effect, Napoleon had to ensure that the points in time and space which were selected for attack had a strategic impact. Napoleon's superior knowledge of the area of operations, his acute sense of timing and the depth of his operational focus guaranteed that the effect of the whole French campaign was greater than the sum of its individual parts-single engagements, actions and battles. In this environment of French battlespace dominance, the Austrians imploded and their will to resist collapsed under the weight of Napoleon's theater-wide offensive. Strategically focused, sequential operations and engagements culminated in a dominating maneuver to destroy the enemy's armed might.
Napoleon's demonstration of dominating maneuver became the organizing imperative of the great offensive campaigns of the late 19th and 20th centuries. Analyses of subsequent Prussian-German campaign strategy in 1866, 1870, 1914 and 1940, for example revealed that the intent of the Prussian and German opening operations was to repeat Napoleon's achievement in the campaign of 1805. They sought to bring on a battle of annihilation through dominating maneuver by inflicting a strategic defeat on the enemy which his tactical measures could not remedy. Later Soviet/Russian concepts of theaterwide offensive operations extended the Napoleonic emphasis on speed and decisiveness to argue that mutiple successive operations and strikes against the enemy's center of gravity would be necessary to achieve dominating maneuver on an even larger scale.
It was, however, not until the innovative application of automotive, aviation and communications technology to military use in the context of the 1940 German Blitzkrieg that the operational dimensions of time and space along with the organization, training, leadership and equipment of the armed forces were again subject to radical change. The details of the German plan to execute an armored sweep through the Ardennes to the French coast and split the Allied armies in two are too well known to recount here. But it is worth noting that the failure of the German 1918 offensives to achieve similar aims fostered a compulsion for self-examination that led to a keen appreciation in the German officer corps for the potential impact of new technology on organization, leadership and training. 
32
Clearly, these points reveal differences in the methods of command, in the ways new technology is exploited, and in the preparation of forces for combat, all of which endowed the 1940 Blitzkrieg with an advantage in the observation-decision-action cycle. Whereas British, American and French armies

In the air war, differences in the perception of how air power could be employed also influenced events.
Although the British and French military establishments understood that aviation allowed for the deep attack of many targets beyond the visual range of attacking ground forces, they also believed that opposing air forces would spend most of their effort attacking each other. Thus, while the Allies envisioned aerial bombing to incapacitate the enemy's strategic resources by destroying critical warfighting and industrial facilities, the British and French did not anticipate the use of air power in close coordination with ground attack. Predictably, the timely arrival of German air power over the battlefield to impart momentum to a stalled German attack came as a complete surprise to the British and the French. The thought that air power might supplant artillery as the principal means of fire support for attacking ground forces in order to sustain the momentum of the armored thrusts had not occurred to those in command of the allied forces.
Thus, in 1940, a radically new German concept of warfare -Blitzkrieg -that compressed timelines for operations and expanded battlespace was put into action. Unlike Napoleon's aim of physically destroying the enemy through a battle of annihilation, Blitzkrieg had the aim of paralyzing the enemy through the revolutionary use of armored, motorized and air forces. It combined human potential with innovative technology to stretch the battlefield further and to create a warfighting environment which was critically unbalanced in favor of the attacking German armies. Thanks to the "near-right" mix of technology, organization, prewar training and leadership, the Germans achieved battlespace dominance in the first hours of the conflict and maintained it throughout the campaign. In fact, the conduct of dominating maneuver on the scale of the 1940 Blitzkrieg was more than ever before a function of Germany's capacity to dominate the battlespace.
These points not withstanding, the German offensive failed to deprive Britain of the means with which to carry on the war. Nearly 365,000 Allied troops (nearly a third French and Belgian) escaped to England from Dunkirk and other channel ports while the German Army consolidated its position for a final, set-piece assault on the coastal cities. The reason for this failure is simple. It arose out of the unanimous lack of appreciation on the part of Germany's national leadership for the potential of Germany's new combined arms force.

Much like Napoleon's Ulm campaign and the German Blitzkrieg of France, the campaign to liberate Kuwait was not true military contest. Contrary to what many predicted before the war began, it was a strategic victory so complete and so overwhelming that the issue was never seriously in doubt. 
41
What changed in 1991 was the sudden availability of precise deep strike delivery systems on land and aboard ships and aircraft, combined with a vast inventory of lethal conventional munitions and long-range aircraft which could be guided by target acquisition instruments to enemy targets under near constant surveillance. Equally important for the outcome was the decisive American overmatch in the direct-fire battle and the integration of tactical and strategic systems to support the tactical fight. There is also no doubt that the Iraqi Air Force was no match for the Coalition Air Forces deployed against it. Soviet Major General Nikolai Kutsenko stated at the time of the Coalition's war with Iraq that "Iraq's armament, including that which is Soviet made, was primarily developed in the 1960s-1970s and lags at least one-to-two generations behind the armament of the multinational forces." 
42
Having said this, to a much greater extent than ever before, the Coalition theater commander was technologically positioned to influence action on the battlefield by directing global military resources to the points in time and space he regarded as critical to the campaign's success. For the Iraqi enemy, whose air defenses (ranging from highly sophisticated to antiquated) failed and whose intelligence-collection capability was either destroyed or deceived, the deep, close and rear battles were compressed into one seamless continuous fight. From the vantage point of the Iraqi command structure, the catagories of American capabilities and weapon systems directed against Iraqi forces in terms of their strategic, operational or tactical points of origin were indistinguishable. In effect, Iraq was attacked by US Forces from various points around the world and subjected to a new form of multidimensional envelopment.
Of decisive importance was not the effect of a single factor, but rather a combination of factors. On the one hand, the doctrine the Iraqi armed forces assimilated as a result of the decade-long conflict with Iran militated against Iraq's use of decentralized, mobile warfare. Although these attrition tactics-which incorporated many advanced forms of military technology, including Exocet missiles, Scud missiles, and remotely piloted vehicles-eventually wore down the Iranians, they were ineffective against the American-led coalition that differed dramatically from the Iranians. Being steeped in this ponderous doctrine prevented the Iraqis from a adopting a different form of warfare consistent with Iraq's new political-military objectives, strategic situation in 1990-1991 and opponents. Clearly, similar technology in different hands can be used in different ways and with different degrees of success. From all indications, the Iraqis anticipated that their defensive posture would result over time in a stalemate. Based on the rapid retirement of American Marine Forces from Lebanon in 1982 after the bombing of a Marine installation in Beirut, this may have been a reasonable expectation. However, Kuwait lies at the heart of vital US and allied strategic interests. Lebanon does not. Iraq seems to have missed this salient point.
If the problem of projecting military power is viewed in an historical context, it is not hard to understand the Iraqi perception of time. In the months preceding the Allied landings in Normandy during June 1944, 2500 heavy bombers dropped thousands of tons of explosives while 7,000 fighters and fighter-bombers pulverized German forces in Northern France. Nearly two years were required to assemble the naval transport and ground forces to support the invasion. What once took months, even years, was accomplished during DESERT SHIELD and DESERT STORM in weeks or even days by fewer but more specialized forces. By quickly establishing qualitative and quantitative superiority in the pre-ground attack, strike forces were enabled to secure the initiative, accelerate the pace of events, increase the intensity of the total coalition attack and reduce the time needed to prepare the Iraqi enemy for ground assault. Before the ground campaign began, large numbers of demoralized Iraqi troops began deserting or surrendering.
In this connection, American concepts of time and space were clearly different from the Iraqi concepts. American AirLand Battle doctrine predisposed the American armed forces to deploy specialized combat formations to exploit Iraqi weaknesses throughout the depths of the Iraqi defense system. New intelligence and target-acquisition sources substantially reduced the climate of uncertainty which had plagued the senior leadership of earlier operations. Knowing precisely where to direct the main attack against the Iraqi defense was not a hit-or-miss proposition. Combined with real-time communications, these surveillance capabilities created the opportunity to direct redundant warfighting systems against Iraqi targets throughout the Southwest Asian theater of operations during all phases of DESERT STORM.
Redundant strike systems such as the Army Tactical Missile System (ATCMS) and sea-launched cruise missiles (SLCMS) hastened the collapse of the Iraqi will to resist-a condition which had characterized the campaigns in 1805 and 1940. Since nominally strategic, operational and tactical capabilities could now be integrated for employment at any level of war simultaneously, Iraqi forces throughout the theater were compelled to operate as though they were all within visual range of American Forces. Global positioning systems (GPS) guided the smallest American combined arms units into action with clinical accuracy as to location, even in hours of total darkness. Thanks to GPS, the US VII Corps was enabled to attack from a direction and at a time for which the Iraqi leadership was least prepared. In response, the Iraqi armed forces (like their ill-fated predecessors, the Austrians and the French) simply lost coherency and fled the field or succumbed to destruction. However, not every undertaking was an unqualified success. The hunt for Iraq's mobile Scud missiles was a miserable failure. Between 17 January and 2 February 1991, Iraq launched 57 missiles, 29 against Saudi Arabia. As during the Iran-Iraq War, the missiles were employed as strategic weapons, and were targeted primarily against cities. Tel Aviv (19), Haifa (9), Riyadh (13), Dahran (14) and Hafr al Batin (1). Of these 57, there is evidence that the Patriot Missile System intercepted 36. Although Iraq launched 9 missiles on one day, on average, Iraq launched between 3 and 4 missiles a day. In most cases, the missiles were launched either during the hours of darkness or under heavy cloud conditions.

Although senior military leaders stressed that the air and ground campaigns against Iraq were joint operations, naval forces clearly played a subordinate role. Part of the reason is that no other nation in the world has a navy that can challenge the US Navy for control of the seas. Another reason was that carrier-based aviation, especially those naval fighters launched from the USS Saratoga and the USS John F. Kennedy in the Red Sea, were heavily dependent on the US Air Force in-flight refueling capability in order to reach Iraqi targets. Moreover, naval fighter aircraft carried fewer bombs and missiles than their USAF counterparts and were able to fly far fewer sorties against the enemy. During the conflict, a planned amphibious assault on Iraqi forces in Kuwait was cancelled after two Navy combatant ships struck mines and it was determined that the Iraqis had heavily mined the sea approaches to the Kuwaiti coast.

The foregoing historical discussion points to the possibility of dramatic change in the American concept and practice of warfare. New equipment and weapon systems, employed in great numbers at the critical points in time and space, now offer the potential for continuous offensive operations. They permit the retention of intitiative and the exploitation of opportunities for the annihilation of the enemy's forces in a high speed, integrated campaign. Lethal, precision-guided munitions are launched at still greater ranges, for the most part well beyond the visual range of the enemy. Smaller combined arms combat formations with advanced indirect and direct-fire weapon systems dominate larger areas than in the past. Aided by enhanced surveillance capabilities in the form of unmanned aerial vehicles, airborne radars, and satellites, fewer armored and air mobile ground forces are able to concentrate the effects of combat power against the enemy. Rather than move to contact, "all arms" units electronically search and then destroy the enemy on the battlefield.
All of this suggests that in the future the tactical, operational and strategic levels of war as separate and distinct loci of command and functional responsibilities, will be spaced and timed out of existence. This form of warfare (which we shall call information age warfare) enlists the tactics of fire and movement directly in behalf of the strategic goal. This does not mean, however, that there is no longer a requirement for commanders to think about tactical goals, their coordination and combination into operational goals and the translation of the attainment of operational goals into strategic results. This simply suggests that the merging of the levels of war takes place in the area of execution while the conceptual framework of operations remains in place. What follows is one short example of what land warfare may look like in the near future.
In the early phases of future war, precision-guided missiles will play a decisive role in the effort to gain and retain the initiative. Carefully timed mass strikes will paralyze large ground and air forces in the theater of war that are dependent on fixed installations for frequent refueling and resupply. The vulnerability of static ground forces to mass strikes creates the incentive for military leaders to conduct high speed ground offensives to strike deep into the enemy's territory where the enemy is less likely to employ weapons of mass destruction. Modern air defense systems will drive jet-driven aircraft to higher and higher altitudes with the result that stealthy, rotor-driven aircraft along with unmanned strike aircraft will gradually supplant traditional airframes in the close air support role. Unmanned aircraft will operate day and night over the field of operations collecting information and targeting enemy forces. In sum, the effects on US Forces will be to further extend the depth of warfare, forcing all elements of American JTFs to operate as if within visual range of the enemy, tending to compress rear, close and deep combat operations into one continuous fight.
Recognizing that the development of American military tactics, doctrine and warfighting organizations for future conflict has been rendered more difficult because the character of the threat is no longer specified, it is not surprising that the Army's FORCE XXI program has not resulted in any significant change in the warfighting structure of Army Forces since DESERT STORM.

• Sixth, after its introduction to warfare, the technology of aviation (manned and unmanned) begins, on the one hand, to reinforce the effects of existing trends, and, on the other, to assist military organizations to cope with the aforementioned effects.
When integrated with ground elements, aviation provides ground forces with information, security, protection, "operational reach" and increased tactical efficiency. In 1945, the victorious advance of the 14th British Army in Central Burma was made possible by the combination of air and surface transportation. The combination of air-landed infantry and armor achieved a tempo which the lightly equipped, foot-mobile Japanese could not resist. General MacArthur employed General George Kenney's Air Forces and General Eichelberger's Ground Forces in the Pacific in a similar fashion with equally impressive results. To a large extent, the US Army's reconnaissance and attack helicopters have been developed to permanently acquire a close air support capability that receives low priority in the US Air Force. 
58
59
To the strategic environment may be added two of the US Army's most pressing needs: (1) the need to emphasize qualitative improvements to compensate for reduced numbers of Army ground forces; and, (2) the need for adaptable warfighting structures which can fulfill a wide range of mission requirements to include operations other than war (OOTW) more flexibly. The Army's ability to adapt its warfighting structure to these trends will, in large part, determine whether the US Army will retain the capability to dominate maneuver within a joint strategic framework in the next century.
The implications of this analysis are many. Of these, the point that the technology of warfare rarely serves as the driving force behind doctrinal military innovation is by far the most important. Military history suggests that technological advantage is rather transitory in nature, readily copied and countered. Truly large payoffs require changes in strategy, doctrine and organization. 
60
In addition, there is the notion that to be strategically decisive, landpower and airpower must be employed together in pursuit of complementary goals. For instance, the ground and air campaigns against Germany were so interdependent that it is impossible to judge what either of them might have accomplished if either one had gone unassisted by the other. If the Germans had been able to devote resources to aerial warfare without concern for the protection of France and Italy against atttack, they might have been able to mobilize enough fighter and antiaircraft strength to turn back the bomber offensive. Air and ground forces together achieved the goals of the American strategy to defeat Germany. 
61
Finally, in order to realize the immense potential inherent in new information age technology, the US Army must modify its existing organization for combat. Furthermore, today's technological menu is so rich in comparison to the buying power afforded by contemporary Army budgets that organizational change must of necessity outpace the procurement of promising new military technologies. It is against this background that an examination of the Army's options in its effort to assimilate the weapons technology of the current age into a consistent pattern of military theory, organization and leadership must begin. 
55
While military strategy concerns the use of military power to achieve strategic goals, how military power is actually organized to fight and win in combat is the concern of organizational or force design. The concrete results of these designs are expressed in different types of organizational structure, the ways in which military resources are allocated and the lines of command authority and information flow.

During the last years of the twentieth century, however, the US Army has the opportunity to shape itself into a force prepared to face a fundamentally changed warfighting environment. The opportunity is unique because the Army has both a temporary respite from major conflict and because the Army has taken the time to study the force design implications of information age warfare outlined in FORCE XXI Embedded in the FORCE XXI vision are important implications for how the army should organize to fight in the future. These implications point to future organizations for combat that can capitalize on information age technologies to confer greater warfighting capabilities on smaller combat formations. Among these implications is the recognition that success in future warfighting rests on the foundation of information dominance. Thus, FORCE XXI strongly emphasizes the importance of armed and manned reconnaissance along with surveillance assets in the context of future conflict. When these enhanced reconnaissance and surveillance systems are linked to deep strike weapons, their combat capability is multiplied.
In addition, FORCE XXI envisions the capability to allow early entry ground forces to fight their way in from the air and greater modularity in tactical logistics. Finally, FORCE XXI establishes the need for absolute unity of effort among all arms and services as the cornerstone of future success in warfighting.

But how should the US Army's senior leaders organize the army in peacetime to respond to these requirements in wartime? Or put a different way, can America's Army begin the process of organizing to fight within the trendlines outlined earlier and still preserve its capacity to cope with contemporary threats? If the need arises, the Army must still be ready to deploy and fight with existing active forces and with some elements of the Reserve Component (RC).

General John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has said that the "main purpose of the armed forces is to fight and win the nation's wars."

As mentioned earlier, LTG McNair was instrumental in the design of the division which is still the basis for the Army's current structure for war on the tactical level. In contemporary Army thinking, the division is still the dominant US Army organization that trains and fights as a team. Five types of divisions exist in the current force: armored, mechanized, infantry, airborne and air assault. 
6
• Division headquarters with C2 for units assigned or attached to the division;
• (3) brigades of infantry, mechanized and tank battalions to destroy the enemy and to seize and hold key terrain;
• (1) brigade of artillery to provide fire support for maneuver brigades.
• (1) Aviation brigade to provide attack helicopter support and air transport capability.
• (1) Engineer brigade for combat engineer support
• (1) brigade-size division support command (DISCOM) to provide combat services support to all units assigned to the division.
• Division Troops: (1) cavalry squadron for reconnaissance and security, (1) signal battalion for communications; (1) military intelligence battalion for intelligence collection, analysis, dissemination and deception; and, (1) air defense battalion to protect the division from air attack.
In retrospect, General McNair's understanding of the linkage between strategy, technology and force design seems impressive. When McNair began developing the division structure, he wanted the Army division to have only the minimum essential forces that it needed to conduct offensive operations in fluid maneuver warfare against relatively limited resistance. Based on British and French experience during World War I, Army planners in 1917 were primarily concerned with the ability of the division organization to conduct sustained combat from prepared positions-trenches. Logistics and fire support were placed in depth behind the lines of entrenched infantry. In response to these conditions the division grew in strength to 28,000 troops. From the beginning, then, the limiting factors on a division's size were those of time, space and the requirements of contemporary warfare.
Consequently, to maximize the proportion offerees available for combat and to reduce paperwork and related obstacles to rapid decisionmaking, McNair insisted on small division staffs and he restricted the number of wheeled vehicles in the division support units. The fewer vehicles that were organic to a division, McNair reasoned, the less shipping space would be necessary when the division was moved overseas. This meant that when the war began the standard division base consisted of the three infantry regiments, four artillery battalions, one ground reconnaissance troop and an engineer battalion.
General McNair also eliminated specialized units from the infantry division structure that were required only for specific situations or missions. Eventually, McNair consigned antiaircraft artillery, nondivisional tank battalions, mechanized cavalry and combat engineer battalions to the command of group headquarters under Corps command when not attached to divisions. Some group headquarters, notably those of mechanized cavalry, also acted as tactical control headquarters. 
7
These observations, however, mask the true manner in which these divisions were internally organized to fight.
Many of the nondivisional elements were permanently organized with the division's infantry regiments to form regimental combat teams (RCT). The RCTs had their own artillery, engineers, tank destroyers, self-propelled antiaircraft guns, medical and logistical support. In practice, the RCT evolved into a small division in itself. As the Second World War in Europe progressed, the division headquarters provided support to the RCTs which actually fought the tactical battles. 
9
By early 1943, however, British experience against the Germans and American intelligence evaluations of German performance against the British and Russian armies reinforced McNair's earlier insistence on a less cumbersome division structure For that matter, the one US Army armored division employed in the closing months of the North African campaign never operated as a coherent division. 
10
The new armored division also included three battalions each of tanks, armored infantry and armored artillery. Again, in practice, the armored division's forces were further subdivided and organized to fight as combat commands under Brigadier Generals. The actual task organizations of these commands varied, but a typical combat command included elements from all the arms of combat and service. 
Though doubtless inspired by the German concept of the combined arms battlegroup, the combat command was a distinctly American solution to the problem of incorporating and exploiting new technology. 
11
A German defender unfortunate enough to find himself in the path of the 4th Armored Division in August 1944 first had to deal with the fighter-bombers of the XIX Tactical Air Command (TAC), which maintained constant patrols in advance of Wood's armored columns. Army Air Force liaison officers riding in the lead tanks provided targets to the fighter bombers and kept the ground troops informed as to what lay ahead of the column...Behind the fighter bombers came the division's light liaison aircraft, from which the combat commanders guided their columns around obstacles because experience had shown that the medium tanks could generally cut through any resistance encountered. Self-propelled artillery placed well forward in the column and ready to fire engaged any defenders too strongly emplaced for the medium tanks to dislodge. Engineers also accompanied the lead elements to remove obstacles...Wood also took medical and maintenance detachments out of the division trains and added them to the combat trains so these services were immediately available to the leading elements.

In the strategic environment of uncertainty after the Korean War, the Army's affirmation of the prevailing triangular division-centered force design actually resulted from the absence of any consensus among senior Army leaders concerning the requirements for future warfare. 
14
13
16
At the moment, the Army's senior leaders are considering options for a new division structure ranging from retaining today's basic structure while inserting new technologies to adopting a flexible, brigade-based division structure that could be tailored for specific missions. 
17
On a political level, it is difficult to anticipate what will happen next in Congress, but further cuts in the Army's size would mean the disestablishment of at least one or two divisions. For a global power like the United States which is constantly in search of strategic alternatives, the elmination of a large warfighting formation like a division could significantly constrain contingency planning and response options. 
18
One way to modify the division organization without dramatically changing the existing warfighting structure is to disestablish divisions as standing organizations and to convert the current brigade task force into what amounts to a regimental combat team. This similar to the brigade-based division option mentioned above. Brigade task forces would continue to wear division patches and to maintain their traditional links to parent divisions. But division headquarters would assume the role analogous to the combat commands of the Second World War's armored divisions. In this setting, division commanders would assume command and control of whatever type and number of independent brigade task forces were needed for the specific mission. This approach is appealing for several reasons.
First, due to basing constraints, seven of the Army's ten active divisions have brigades which are based separately from their parent division organizations. Structuring these brigades to operate more or less independently will be necessary to ensure their deployability in most cases. Second, it would not be difficult for the Army to permanently assign brigades those elements-artillery, engineer, air defense, signal, military intelligence, and combat service support-which are routinely cross attached to brigades for deployment to combat or training. Brigade commanders often complain that these elements are too infrequently task organized with their units in training to ensure their smooth cooperation in war. Thus, converting ten divisions to thirty standing brigade task forces would add cohesion and continuity to the Army at a level where it is most critical to success in combat. It also creates more deployable maneuver forces that will influence the national command authorities as they decide what course of action to take in a crisis. Third, the various branches and services of the Army are less likely to obstruct a change which does not fundamentally alter current professional and career development paths. This arrangement could also result in more than ten division headquarters once these are no longer tied to a large fixed base. As an example, Active Component divisional headquarters could be established that are specifically designed to command, control and train the 15 Army National Guard Enhanced Brigades or to conduct deep operations such as Mobile Strike Forces with Corps Aviation Brigades, Armored Cavalry Regiments and Rocket Artillery (MLRS) Brigades. In addition, one or more divisional headquarters could be oriented on contingency operations that entail peacekeeping or humanitarian relief duties. 
19
Actual reorganization of the Army along the lines discussed above is one way to cope with the near-term need for change within the trendlines. In the long-run, however, the disadvantages of this approach may outweigh its obvious near-term advantages. This option fails to flatten the Army's warfighting organization genuinely by eliminating redundant echelons of command and control that simply slow the observation-decisionaction cycle. Why preserve the existing industrial age command and control structure: company/battery/troop-battalion/squadron-brigade/regiment-division-corps-army 
9
In the environment of future conflict, air and space-based sensors will be linked to digitized information systems to identify key elements of the enemy's armed strength thoughout the depth of his deployment. Armed with this real-time information, future JTF commanders will be able to conduct precision guided missile and rocket artillery strikes from air, land and sea to prepare the enemy for rapid exploitation by highly mobile airground forces through a combination of enveloping maneuver and paralyzing offensive action. Why can't advances in microcircuitry and weapons technology assist in eliminating one or more of the aforementioned echelons as well as in reshaping combat formations? Why can't new technology extend human potential in new, more economical and efficient ways that are within reach today? The answer, of course, is that it can.
In contrast to industrial age warfare, information age operations are conducted in an environment where the possibilities for deception are endless, the weapons of mass destruction are everpresent and the requirement to dominate the battlespace is paramount. In addition, the capability to dominate maneuver in the future described by FORCE XXI is critically dependent on the ability of an armed force to achieve information dominance; increasingly the essential precondition for battlespace dominance.
This observation implies a continuous fight for critical information both inside and outside the organization for combat. As illustrated in the context of Ulm, Blitzkrieg and DESERT STORM, for military operations to be coherent, in addition to seeing, deciding and orchestrating the movement of forces, the commander must be able to conduct operations in predictable periods of time and be able to adjust quickly to changing circumstances.

The point is that successful warfighting organizations are simply better organized and more adept than their opponents at sharing the critical information quickly and at blowing what information is critical at what echelon of command. 
25
The nature of the task to be performed is not the only determinant of the amount of information required for its performance; equally important is the structure of the organization itself. The more numerous and differentiated the departments into which an organization is divided, the larger the number of command echelons superimposed upon each other, the higher the decision thresholds, and the more specialized its individual members, then the greater the amount of information processing that has to go on inside the organization. Uncertainty, in other words, is not dependent solely on the nature of the task to be performed; it may equally well be a function of a change in the organization itself

Part of the answer lies in understanding at what echelon all the needed combat arms and components are united under the command of a single force commander. Depending on the circumstances, in the United States Army, this echelon is either the division or the corps. As mentioned in the preceding chapters, field armies normally consist of more than one corps. In the evolving structure of "joint" operations this echelon is normally the Joint Task Force (JTF). Because this work assumes that future conflict will be a joint affair, it is important for the reader to understand how JTFs are constructed.
In most cases, JTFs are not built from scratch. The JTF for Atlantic Resolve was built around V US Corps, the Haiti JTF around XVIII US Corps, Somalia's relief and evacuation task forces around 1st Marine Expeditionary Force, and, more recently, NATO's peacekeeping force in Bosnia around the ACE Rapid Reaction Corps. More often than not, the Army Corps Commander becomes the JTF Commander who augments his existing staff from the other Service components. The Deputy Corps Commander becomes the "Commander, US Army Forces" and the other components of the JTF are treated in the same way with the result that the various Service forces continue to operate independently. LTG Cushman, a retired Army General has observed that "While this command structure suffices for administration such as personnel management, to fight using these component commanders as operational commanders of their forces alone simply will not work For fighting, the forces must be mixed in a task organization that is designed for the mission" 2 * Still, mixing these forces is easier said than done. Contrary to popular belief, resistance to closer integration is not simply a function of parochial attitudes in the services. It is based to a much greater degree on the absence of a common operating environment created by flexible and robust joint command, control, communication, computer and intelligence (C4I) systems embedded in the warfighting organizations of the services. 
29
If the need for Joint and integrated C4I can be seen as an effort to exploit existing capabilities across service lines in new ways, the best approach is to provide an Army organization at every level of command that can serve as a joint "clearing house" for information processes to which all services are connected. Because the Army Corps structure is frequently the nucleus around which JTFs are built, the Army should be in a position to furnish the backbone for joint C4I in the same way that it provides the foundation for logistical support in joint operations on land to the Air Force and Marine Corps. In the new information warfare paradigm, this organization is called the C4I battalion.
In the C4I battalion organization shown below, the structure has an internal and an external orientation. Internally, the command and control company includes the communications elements necessary to link the command group horizontally and vertically with other JTF components. This means communications consisting of ultra high frequency (UHF) and super high frequency (SHF) satellite communications; tropospheric scatter; and UHF, very high frequency (VHF) and high frequency (HF) radio. Externally, the Information Warfare Company incorporates technical means for intelligence collection, transmission, and analysis that are essential to sharing information. Internally, digital systems can transmit this information to subordinate elements. This company also includes the electronic warfare capabilities to target, deceive and disrupt the enemy's C4I.
The non-line-of-sight (NLOS) battery includes unmanned aerial vehicles and overthe-horizon attack systems that specifically support countersurveillance, operational security as well as command and control warfare. The incorporation of tactical air and chemical defense systems into the C4I battalion establishes an instantaneous interface with the system of information dissemination and collection. When the C4I battalion is equipped with technology that is compatible with and linked to systems like the Air Force's joint surveillance target attack radar system (JSTARS) and airborne warning and control system (AWACS) or the Navy's program for Space and Electronic Warfare (SEW), it is easy to anticipate the utility of this organization to a JTF Ground Component Commander (GCC) who needs a standing C4I structure that can be quickly established in an austere theater of war Without detailing all of the technologies and capabilities that could be included in this organization, it is important to remember that this organization (like most from now on) must be designed from the outset for adaptation to future demands, even though we cannot be sure today what those demands may be.
In wartime, the C4I battalion would operate in a fragmented organization designed to extend information processes over vast distances. Employing the deep/close/rear Breaking the Phalanx <>

Keeping in mind the desirability of maintaining the JTF (corps/MEF level) Commander as the integrating mechanism for joint operations and the parameters depicted in the intermediate force design illustration, it is possible to determine the likely structure of the Army component(s) of a future JTF:
• A warfighting organization that is both smaller in size and more numerous in quantity than the existing division organizations. Some portion of these organizations are configured for delivery by air from bases in the continental United States
• In its form, command structure and composition, an organization for combat which reflects the shift of warfighting functions and activities to lower levels. While the composition of the organization will vary depending on the specific mission orientation, all information age military organizations are modular in character insofar as they share a common architecture for C4I and logistics.
• An organization that has high operational and tactical mobility so that it can concentrate the effects of its weapons against the enemy and still evade destruction by the enemy's weapons of mass destruction. It can dominate much larger areas with new technology than is now possible by sensing and engaging the enemy at long ranges while simultaneously maneuvering at high speed to exploit the enemy's weaknesses in close combat/ 0
• An organization that can sustain itself within the JTF multi-Service framework for extended periods. Its equipment is capable of supporting near-continuous operations without extensive maintenance.
In broad outline, the information age organization should incorporate the force design directions indicated by the RMA trendlines. For simplicity, this information age warfighting organization is called a "Combat Group." The building blocks of the Combat Group are drawn directly from the implied FORCE XXI design parameters illustrated by the intermediate force design. The C4I structure has been addressed. It is enough to reinforce the point that the C4I architecture will permeate the organization. In a similar vein, to be self-sustaining, the Group must incorporate a support formation that provides all of the transportation, maintenance, supply and repair needs for the Group to operate independently for longer than a few days.
Continuous advances in technology have reinforced the need for a mobile and highly trained reconnaissance element that can mobilize combat power out of proportion to its actual size while rapidly reporting critical information to the wartime commander. However, none of the technological advances to date have invalidated the need for the trained soldier in this special capacity. To assess enemy strength, resistance, location and movement over wide areas; to communicate with and coordinate over great distances; to accurately position forces; and to acquire targets and guide ground and air forces to those targets beyond the normal visual range requires technology that extends the human potential of air and ground reconnaissance forces/ 
1
In this depiction, the components of the design parameters are converted to combat organizations which integrate all of the combat arms at a lower level than is the case today. All of the organizations examined here comprise a soldier strength of roughly 4,000 to 5,000 troops. In the illustrations that follow, four possible types of Combat Groups are depicted. Taken in succession, each of the Combat Group structures organizes existing capabilities in ways that are calculated to confer a degree of combat power that is proportionally greater than the size of the actual unit. Take for instance the heavy combat group:  The 4,600 man heavy combat group consists of three balanced combined arms battalions, a recon squadron, a hybrid indirect fire battalion, a C4I battalion and a support battalion. As balanced task organizations, the combined arms battalions require no further internal modification or cross attachment to be effective. With organic engineer mobility assets, these units can execute deliberate or hasty obstacle breeching operations as necessary. In addition, the group has an armed recon capability and an indirect fire capability that facilitates independent combat operations over great distances. Modernized rotor-driven aircraft augmented by UAVs create the capability to quickly orchestrate MLRS (ATACM capable) and 155mm artillery fires in support of a wide range of offensive and defensive combat operations. Until RAH66 Comanche aircraft^2 are added to the Army's inventory, (12) Kiowa Warrior aircraft 
33
In the Active Army, there are ten UH60-equipped lift battalions consisting of (300) UH60s (Blackhawk medium lift helicopters) configured for the assault mission. These ten battalions are scheduled to increase in number can be organized with the roughly (182) CH47 Chinook heavy lift helicopters into (4) General Aviation Support Groups to support the air assault operations of the (7) Airborne-Air Assault Groups. Like the Light Recon-Strike Group, this Group can be entirely transported by either military air transport or a mix of military and commercial air transport. (Army overseas presence in USEUCOM could be structured to include both an Aviation Support Group and an Airborne-Air Assault Group).
The advanced aviation warfighting systems in the organization provide reconnaissance, protection and firepower to attacking infantry formations whether they are moving in the air or on the ground. These systems are also critical links in the system that integrates air and naval power with the maneuver of attacking ground elements. Aviation elements whose vision is often obstructed by undulating or densely forrested terrain benefit from the infantryman who directs their fire and, they, in turn, help to shape the airborne infantry's encounter with the enemy on terms that are favorable to the infantry. Like all Combat Group formations, indirect fire support is an integral part of the organization for combat. Towed artillery is the mainstay of airborne and air assault infantry formations. When and if high mobility artillery rocket systems (HTMARS-truck mounted MLRS) become available, a HTMARS battery would become part of this battalion-size element. 
With somewhat different purposes in mind, the 5,000 man Heavy Recon-Strike Group is equipped with the aviation and ground assets to reach far ahead of advancing Heavy Combat Groups to develop the situation and to facilitate close cooperation with Air Force and Army deep battle systems. The significant infusion of advanced manned and unmanned aviation warfighting systems enables this formation to overcome the land forms that mask vision in close combat, orient the JTF Commander to the true disposition of the enemy and harmonize as well as integrate the movement and fires of attacking ground forces with air and naval striking power. This formation is particularly effective against the moving enemy that seeks to avoid detection and destruction by outpacing electronic surveillance. More than any other formation, this one is equipped to both discover and destroy the enemy.
The Heavy Recon-Strike Group is designed to protect and secure the JTF while it assembles or deploys for decisive operations. Such a force is critical in the task of disrupting the enemy formations throughout the entire depth of its deployment and preventing if from responding coherently to the deployment/attack of the main JTF forces. The enemy's disruptive actions will consist of long range tactical ballistic missile, air strikes and even diversionary or spoiling attacks. This force also assists in the Joint Force Commander's effort to deceive the enemy as to the timing and location of the main attack. Strategic mobility requires a mix of capabilities that will allow early entry ground forces to fight their way in or, soon after arrival, expand their battlespace to quickly establish control or win the conflict.

With MLRS and (15) UH60s fitted with rocket pods and hellfire missile mounts, this organization can fight and survive across the spectrum of conflict. Since this organization is designed to operate in an austere logistical environment, this Group has only two types of armored chassis-AGS and LAV (Pl)-and two types of air frames-UH60 and RAH66. Again, until the RAH66 comes on line, a larger number of Kiowa Warrior aircraft will be needed. As always, the MLRS is ATACM-capable. Not shown are the numbers of hand-held and vehicle-mounted laser designating elements.
With the exception of very few items of equipment/ 9 all of these Group organizations can be constituted from existing Army assets today. In the current ten division Active Army structure, there are roughly 2,000+ Ml A1/A2 Tanks, 2,000+ M2/3A2 Bradley AFVs, 500 SP 155mm M109 Howitzers, 40+ MLRS batteries (9 launchers each), 800+ AH64s, 300+UH60s, 130+AH58s, 
40
More important than the details of the Groups' composition is the larger aspect of orchestrating the actions of a Combat Group comprising 4,000 to 5,000 troops. Given the self-contained character of the formation and the degree of tactical autonomy which the information warfare paradigm will confer on this organization, a Brigadier General with a robust, experienced staff will be needed to command a Combat Group. A deputy commander not shown in this scheme may also be appropriate. How this command and staff structure could be organized is shown in the following illustration: In line with the requirement for closer integration of warfighting activities to maximize the combat value of new technologies, the traditional Gl, G2, G3, G4 and G5 staff structure is modified in favor of one that more closely aligns mission-essential functions with mission-oriented activities.

-General Support Groups. A Corps Support Command (COSCOM) includes nearly 22,000 troops in supply, medical, transportation, police, etc...This approach assumes that the robust sustainment at the Group level facilitates some economy at the JTF level. To achieve the desired level of modularity outlined in FORCE XXI, this will entail converting the COSCOM to (3) 4-5000 man Ground Component Support Groups. The current structure of the COSCOM is shown at appendix B.
-Engineer Support Group (combat and construction engineer battalions); Breaking the Phalanx n -Rocket Artillery Group (MLRS/ATACM Battalions as deep strike assets); -THAAD Group (anti-tactical ballistic missile assets); -Air Defense Group (tactical air defense for ground forces); -Aviation Strike Group (AH64 attack helicopter battalions); -Aviation Support Group (logistical and helicopter lift assets); -C4I Group (could include elements from corps signal brigade, military intelligence brigade, military police brigade, psychological operations & civil affairs brigade) Again, each group is organized with the forces, organic sustainment, and the C4I capability appropriate to the operational level of war. For instance, a Rocket Artillery Group could have four MLRS battalions that are capable of firing several different types of rocket propelled munitions to include ATACMs. An Air Defense Group could consist of some mix of Patriot and other air defense battalions. An Aviation Support Group would include a mix of assault and heavy lift helicopters. An Aviation Strike Group could have four AH64 battalions. A C4I Group would consolidate intelligence and signal formations. Current corps-level combat service support elements could be reorganized into Support Groups that sustain multiservice operations ashore. Groups like the one pictured above will be subordinated to one of the three corpsbased JTF command posts (CP): Sustainment Operations CP, Deep Operations CP or Close Combat Battle CP. Clearly, any of these Group structures can be plugged into a MEF, subordinated for specific missions to the theater-level Joint Forces Air Component Commander (JFACC) or integrated with the theater missile defense force as well. While the Group organization for combat supplants the brigade and division maneuver echelons, the augmented Corps Command structure orchestrates the operational activities of the JTF. In this way, the JTF is actually greater than the sum of its parts. Thus, the echelonment of forces changes from brigade, division, corps, army (Joint Forces Land Component Commander or JFLCC; currently 3rd US Army), theater/strategic or warfighting CINC to: Group, JTF, and Joint Land Force with the warfighting CINC or theater commander potentially "double hatting" as the Joint Forces Land Component Commander. 
44
Currently, the requirement to deploy forces quickly and for unspecified periods (Haiti, Somalia, Bosnia) compels the Army to remove key elements from division organizations in order to create smaller, more deployable ad hoc formations. This renders the division vitually unusable for any other operation. Within the framework of the Group-based force, this is no longer necessary. Instead of stripping out the command, control and support elements of a division in order to reinforce brigade task forces for deployment to contingencies, the Army can deploy a Group structure with robust C4I and support elements under the command of a General Officer with a complete staff. In a JTF based on flexible Groups, structural uniformity in terms of C4I, logistics and reconnaissance throughout the Army's combat, combat support and combat service support formations all create tremendous organizational flexibility. Any Combat Group organization may be directed to conduct joint operations across the spectrum of conflict. In response to a set of mission-specific conditions, battalion-size elements can be plugged into or unplugged from a Group structure and Groups can be added to or subtracted from a JTF as necessary. As self-contained and self-sustaining organizations, Combat Groups also retain the capability for independent operations while providing whatever mix of forces the mission demands. Thus, the presumed advantages of cross-attaching units within the division structure are not sacrificed.
When viewed in the context of the current Army missions, the "Group" structure suggests new ways to organize Army Forces to operate as corps-based JTFs. By eliminating division headquarters and adding more corps headquarters, the Army could provide in conjunction with resources from other services standing JTF headquarters to the regional unified commands. In the current environment of "no-notice" conflict and crisis, Army Forces must be able to reach a potential conflict area quickly with sufficient combat power to influence the situation. A mix of forces linked to the APA and prepositioned equipment sets ashore could be kept ready for deployment to JTF commands on a rotating basis. At home, the Active Component could also begin the process of integrating portions of the Army National Guard within an AC C4I structure. Additional Corps/JTF structures could be maintained to command, control, train and prepare Army Forces overseas and in CONUS to include the Army National Guard (more about this later). A willingness to eliminate unnecessary echelons of command and control could lead to the emergence of new joint warfighting headquarters capable of controlling a mix of Army Heavy and Airborne-Air Assault Combat Groups.
Since the end of the Gulf War, the US Army has considered how it could reorganize and still field a force capable of fighting decisively at all levels of conflict. Technological improvements in the lethality and accuracy of weapons, information systems, and human potential point to the kind of organizational change outlined here. Of course, this is not the only way to organize. The four basic combat structures and the Group organizations at echelons above the Combat Groups incorporate the processes of flattening and consolidation that have been implemented to produce revolutionary results in many fields of human activity. 
45
More important, the Group approach organizes Army Ground Forces in peacetime for the way they are likely to fight in war without imparting rigidity to a structure that will require flexibility. 
46
For equally important reasons, this information age structure emphasizes the requirement for armed manned reconnaissance in war. This is based on the recognition that while surveillance provides information, reconnaissance provides knowledge. Armed reconnaissance allows the friendly force to probe and test where remote, unarmed sensors can only display. These points allude to the difference between dominant battlespace awareness (DBA) and dominant battlespace knowledge (DBK). The difference between the two is that DBA simply alerts friendly forces to where enemy forces are operating. On the other hand, DBK tells the friendly force what the enemy is likely to do. DBK allows the friendly force to fight more efficiently and effectively. Armed reconnaissance is the difference. The information age Army provides the base piece of this action in land warfare which is further enabled through integrated multiservice C4I by the constellation of JSTARS, UAVs, U2, Guardrail and many other systems.
The overreliance on technology to gather intelligence has been cited by many as the single shortage that hit the Coalition Forces the hardest in the Gulf Conflict.

Using technology to compensate for an increased span of control at the corps/JTF level facilitates increased coordination of tactical units, increased speed in the intelligenceanalysis-decision-action loop, and, enhanced coordination of tactical missions with operational objectives. If, however, the tactical commander does not have the initiative, authority and doctrine along with the information to make decisions based on his understanding of the operational goals and situation, no amount of technology will result in winning decisions. At the very least, flattening the Army's warfighting structure will necessitate a radical revision of the Army's current programs for educating and training leaders at every level; especially the operational level. Ideally, immersing tactical commanders in operational doctrine will enable them to cope more effectively with the information overload that will inevitably result no matter what C4I structure is developed.
In moving past a global strategy that focused on containment to one of rapid response to regional crisis, tactical logistics must not be allowed to obstruct change in the Army. Meaningful information to improve asset visibility will help, but modularity in the structure and delivery of supplies and equipment is vital. No amount of infrastructure renewal will suffice to compensate for dependence on fuel, water, food and ammunition if the Army continues to operate from a framework of abundance. 
50
What is also clear from developments in international military affairs since the end of the Gulf War is that the United States' closest NATO allies are moving in force design directions that are consistent with the "Group" approach. The British have long regarded the division structure as an echelon of command and control rather than as a fixed formation. Today, the combinations of reductions in numbers of units and troops has driven the British Army to orient contingency planning on reinforced brigade structures commanded by Brigadiers. Contemporary German Army doctrine organizes warfighting around large mobile brigades. Within the constraints of economy and technological change, none of America's traditional military partners can avoid moving to a fixed allarms structure smaller than the current division.

The AGS is ideally suited for the C-17 because the C-17 can land on shorter runways than either the C141 Starlifter and the C-5 Galaxy. If all the C-17s flew, the most Ml Als that the USAF could deliver in a 24 hour period would be 120 tanks. This would not include any of the regiment's additional equipment. At the same time, none of these points address the fuel and repair part issue for the Ml Al. In contrast, the institute for defense analysis estimates that a Light Recon Strike Group could be delivered in 55 C-5 sorties in less than 24 hours. The C5A upgrades and C-17 probably reduces this overall number. See "Force Planning for the 21st Century", IDA Paper P-2640. October 1992.
These items include the RAH66 Comanche and the new improved Paladin self-propelled 155mm Howitzer or Crusader (advanced artillery system). Other items may include new unmanned aerial vehicles and over-the-horizon attack systems that are now in development. 
40
The fiscal analysis of this proposed forces structure is discussed in detail in the chapter on "Streamlining Defense for Strategic Dominance."
While exact totals are unknown, the services spend billions of dollars each year on simulation programs, initiatives and demonstrations. Most of these activities are enormously helpful to defense planners. Yet, many civilian and military leaders are increasingly skeptical of the way in which many high technology weapons are modeled and simulated. While serving as Commandant of the Marine Corps, General Carl Mundy warned against what he called the "Spielberg effect," in which the impact of simulation overwhelms and frequently misrepresents the genuine capabilities and limitations of new technology. l Experienced military leaders know that although simulations can greatly improve the military's understanding of what weapon systems may or may not work in the future, the most realistic computer simulation cannot replace actual field work with ground troops and aircrews. This is because all computer simulations are by their very nature only mathematical approximations of wartime reality. Notwithstanding these limitations, the Department of Defense has implemented the Joint Warfare System (JWARS) initiative which will consolidate all OSD, service and Joint Staff analytical efforts under one theater-level modeling architecture.

• It is the year 2003. Israel, Syria and the United States have signed peace accords resulting in the placement of an Army Heavy Combat Group in the Golan heights to demilitarize the area. This ends the Israeli-Syrian conflict, but the agreement also prevents both states from directly participating in any conflict between the US and other regional actors. This does not prevent Israel from linking the sensors in its own anti-missile defense system with deploying US systems. 9
• After sanctions against Iraq are lifted in late 1997, Iran and Iraq negotiate a secret Nonaggression Pact obligating both parties to cooperate militarily against the united States and its Allies in the event of conflict. The two countries begin work on establishing a secure C4I network in the region. In the three years following the lifting of sanctions, Iraq's leader, Sadam Hussein resolves the internal dispute with the Shi'a Arab population in the South and reestablishes control in the North. Under pressure from the Turkish military, the Kurds are forced to submit to Iraqi governmental control.
• Once sanctions are lifted, infusions of Russian, Chinese and North Korean military aid assist Iraq in recovering most of its former military capability along with improved air defenses and modern theater ballistic missiles.

Encouraged by events in the Arabian peninsula, Iranian and Iraqi leaders conclude that it is time to attack to seize the oil fields and to strike back decisively against the West. When Iraqi and Iranian military leaders meet in early October 2002 to plan their offensive to capture the Arabian peninsula, their thinking is dominated by the Gulf War experience. This thinking underpins a plan of attack that is focused in its early phases on the American military's traditional centers of gravity-ports, airfields, fuel, water and prepositioned equipment sites.
Before the detailed planning begins, the Iraqi and Iranian military representatives agree to a set of guiding operational principles: First, Iraq will focus its military effort on the area north of Bahrain to include Kuwait, Northern Saudi Arabia and Jordan. Second, Iran will focus its military effort on the area from Bahrain to Muscat with the object of denying US Forces access from the sea to the Persian Gulf region. Third, how and when Mecca and Medina will be seized and occupied will be determined after the Eastern half of the Arabian peninsula is firmly in Iraqi and Iranian hands. This geographic focus eventually produces a three phased plan for Iranian and Iraqi Forces. Fourth, Iraqi and Iranian military leaders agree that weapons of mass destruction should not be employed against Muslim population centers. Ports and airfields that lie in close proximity to Muslim populations must be attacked in other ways. However, all weapons can be used against ships at sea.
In phase I, Iran deploys its MIG 29 fighters, new tactical ballistic missiles (TBM) and ground launched cruise missiles (GLCM) batteries to key points along the Persian Gulf .coast from which strikes can be launched against ships within 100 miles of the Iranian coastline and against targets in the Emirates. 
18
In phase 2, Iran quietly begins to seed the Straits of Hormuz with approximately 500 sea mines from its islands and ships near the Straits 
19
Phase 3 begins with the launching of TBM and GLCM strikes to disable harbors, airfields and American prepositioned equipment sites. Having weaponized a limited number of warheads for chemical munitions, the Iraqis want to use these early against targets on the peninsula to establish the credibility of this threat for American and allied forces Simultaneously, Iranian and Iraqi forces attack on the ground and across the Gulf to seize the objectives mentioned earlier After much discussion, the senior military leaders of both states agree to 13 January, 2003 as the earliest date for execution The Iranians make no mention of the fact that they have a limited number of low-yield nuclear warheads for their TBMs and cruise missiles.
Before the Iraqi and the Iranian National Defense Councils agree to the proposed plan and date for the operation, questions arise concerning Jordan's possible role as a bridgehead for US and allied military action. The Iraqis acknowledge this as a possibility, but argue that the offensive through Kuwait can be executed quickly enough to make a later American offensive from Jordan irrelevant. They also point out that King Hussein of Jordan is in ill health and that several Palestinian organizations will cooperate in the effort to subvert Jordan's internal order if King Hussein grants the US access to his country. The Iraqis are also quick to remind the Iranians of the importance of keeping Oman out of the conflict. If Oman decides to provide access to the Americans, Iran's hold on the Straits becomes tenuous. There is also much discussion about the incomplete C3I networks in both states. However, with Arabia in chaos and American access to the Gulf Ports and prepositioned equipment sets denied, both parties are confident of success.
Knowing the fragile nature of the Gulf States' political structures and keeping in mind the US President's public commitment to the government of Kuwait that US Forces will fight to prevent another Iraqi occupation of the country, the Commander-in-Chief of US Central Command (CINCCENT) sets aside plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that presuppose US access to airfields and harbors on the Saudi peninsula. Although nothing in the US intelligence summaries as of 1 January points to a massing of Iraqi or Iranian ground combat forces near Kuwait, the deployment of the two countries' TBM and GLCM batteries to points along the Euphrates and the Iranian coastline near the Straits of Hormuz convince him that some form of armed action is imminent. When he receives reports of a mine sinking an oil tanker in the Straits of Hormuz on 3 January, CINCCENT asks CJCS for assistance in establishing a US military bridgehead in Jordan. In the meantime, he reads with special interest the US intelligence community's appreciation of the Iraqi enemy: The Iraqi command should not be expected to take rapid advantage of a favorable situation or to carry out any maneuver with speed or precision. The movement of Iraqi ground forces is extremely slow and there are long delays in the issue, transmission and execution of orders. When fighting the Iraqis, US Forces may attempt maneuvers which would be impermissible against a European or North Korean opponent. 
20
-Inform CJCS Of his intent to launch immediate offensive operations against Iraq and Iran from Jordan and the Indian Ocean in the event of hostilities. Recommend to CJCS that US Forces in Kuwait prepare to fight to retain Kuwait. In CINCCENT's view, successful defeat of a short-warning Iraqi and/or Iranian attack depends on offensive action by US Forces in Kuwait and throughout the region. CINCCENT argues that Kuwait City must be retained for the same strategic purpose for which Tobruk was defended by the British in 1941. Whatever gains Iraq and Iran make in the Gulf, they will be unable to consolidate these gains as long as Kuwait City and its surrounding area threaten Iraqi and Iranian Forces on the peninsula. An Iraqi-Iranian offensive which does not result in the capture of Kuwait City will fail as assuredly as the German-Italian offensive to take Egypt did in 1941. Reflecting on this experience, CINCCENT reasons that the combined offensive efforts of US Ground Forces already in Kuwait along with the double envelopment of the peninsula through the attacks of two JTFs-one from Jordan and the other from the Indian Ocean-will have the same effect on Iraqi and Iranian operations in the Gulf region. Knowing that this will involve the deployment of two Joint Task Forces to two separate areas within the same theater, he adds the following requests to his message: *D k -that CJCS approve the immediate deployment of a Light Recon-Strike Group to Jordan with the object of cooperating with Jordanian forces to secure Jordan's border -that CJCS move the Army Preposition Afloat (A WR3) in its entirety under US Navy escort through the Red Sea from which it can ultimately disembark its equipment in Aqaba, Jordan.
-that CJCS release the Airborne-Air Assault Group stationed in Italy for immediate self-deployment to Jordan.
-that the 1st MEF be designated JTF South and begin preparing operations to open the Straits of Hormuz with the objective of breaking through to Kuwait City from the sea.
-that the III US Corps Commander be designated to command JTF North.
-that the Army's JFLCC deploy immediately to Egypt from which it will move forward to command and control JTF North and JTF South. CINCENT will retain overall command within the theater, but CINCCENT concludes that the JFLCC will add greater depth to the command and control of the two Joint Task Forces. Until JTF South begins operations to come ashore, the JFLCC will concern itself only with the Ground Component of JTF North.
-that the Army National Guard elements in the Strategic Reserve Corps be mobilized for deployment.

The JFACC is irritated by the proposal to provide any close air support in the first phase of the campaign, instead preferring to allocate all assets to strategic strike. Centralized control of air assets is a basic tenet of air campaign planning.

On 6 January after several days of consultation with the Secretary of State and the President, the Jordanian Ambassador in Washington, DC, finally communicates Jordan's agreement to the US proposal and US Army and Ar Force deployments to Jordan begin immediately. Jordan also closes its border with Saudi Arabia to prevent terrorist groups from entering the country. Careful not to force Iraq's hand sooner than desired, CINCCENT presses for the rapid deployment of the APA from the Indian Ocean to the Red Sea and the Arborne-Air Assault Group from Italy to Jordan. By 9 January, the Airlift to move the light Recon-Strike Group into Jordan is complete and the Group is moving to the Iraqi border.
On the same day, the APA arrives in Aqaba, Jordan from Diego Garcia. The APA ships return to sea after disembarking (2) Heavy Combat Groups, (2) JTF Support Groups and 30 days' supplies 2 ^ The trip through the Red Sea, however, is not without incident Two Russian-build diesel submarines operating presumably from bases on the Sudanese coast launched torpedoes that sank one commercial container ship and damage a US Aegis-class cruiser. Fortunately, the CVBG was shadowing the movement of the APA and was able to destroy one submarine before it could escape to Sudanese waters. Whether these are Iranian submarines that somehow managed to evade detection or Sudanese Forces is unknown. Afterward, the APA heads through the Suez Canal for Italy where the ships load equipment for (2) more Heavy Combat Groups and additional supplies on 12 and 13 January before beginning the return trip to Jordan on 14 January. The airlift continues in the effort to move an Aviation Strike Group (4 AH64 Bns) from the United States to Jordan.
However, only 60% of the US Army's theater missile defense forces in Egypt and Jordan are operational on 10 January with the result that Amman remains unprotected from Iraqi missile strikes until 15 January when 100% of the theater missile defense systems will be operational. In response, CINCCENT urges that additional Aegis-class destroyers position themselves in the Gulf of Aqaba, the Red Sea and the Mediterranean to provide anti-TBM defense coverage until the Army's THAAD Group is fully operational. Without this coverage, the damage to port facilities in Aqaba could be severe.

On January 9, 2003 Sadam Hussein watches a videotape from an Iraqi UAV orbiting over Amman, Jordan showing US Forces disembarking from C-17s 2 at a Jordanian air base and urges the Iranian National Defense Council to begin its offensive operations immediately. At home, Hussein begins moving Iraqi forces into attack positions on the south side of the Euphrates. Because Russian intelligence informs Iran and Iraq that US Marine Amphibious Forces will not be ready for an all-out assault for at Breaking the Phalanx l )5 least another ten days, however, the Iranians refuse to act until 13 January as originally planned. Sensitive to his need for Iranian support, Hussein abandons his effort to press Iran for an earlier attack and returns to his preparations for the January 13 offensive. The stage is now set for a new Gulf War.
Although Iraq's activities are consistent with a series of Iraqi maneuver exercises conducted since the lifting of sanctions, CINCCENT is convinced that Iraq's current moves are in preparation for a real offensive. CJCS is cautious, but agrees to move one of the Army's Rocket Artillery Groups from Fort Sill, Oklahoma to Jordan. Even with TRANSCOM's improved airlift capability, however, this means that the Rocket Artillery Group will not be deployed and ready to sustain offensive operations before 17 January On 13 January, CINCCENT awakes in Cairo at 5 AM (local time) to a message from the JTF North Commander in the Jordanian desert which reports that ail US prepositioned equipment sites in the Gulf region have been hit with 53 theater-wide TBM strikes. The accuracy of the strikes suggests that the enemy has access to a commercial global positioning system. Fortunately, the US site in Kuwait was already empty and there were very few US and Kuwaiti casualties. However, the Kuwait City and Amman, Jordan airports along with all major Saudi Arabian and Emirate airfields were hit by a mix of TBM warheads containing conventional high explosives and toxic agents of an unknown type. Worse still, rebellious Arabian troops in Eastern Arabia have closed the border with Kuwait. As a result, Kuwait's population has no alternative, but to stay in Kuwait City.
Though there are no reports of Iranian airmobile assaults on the Emirates or an Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, satellite photos provide evidence for the westward movement of these forces. In the same message traffic, CINCCENT receives authorization from the President to begin combat operations against both Iran and Iraq. The objective of these operations, states the President, is the destruction of Iraqi and Iranian weapons of mass destruction, the destruction of attacking enemy ground and air forces and the restoration of "legitimate government and stability" in the Gulf region. CINCCENT is further authorized to employ all military means short of nuclear weapons.
Reading the reports of the damage inflicted on the airfield facilities in Amman during the early morning hours of the 13th, CINCCENT realizes how vulnerable his ports, airfields and logistics will be if he can not reduce their exposure to enemy surveillance and weapons of mass destruction. He directs the JFACC to begin operations against Iraq immediately. Since the Rocket Artillery Group will not be operational for another three days and Iraqi ground forces in Northern Iraq are far weaker than in the South, the JTF North Commander suggests that by positioning his forces in Jordan closer to the Iraqi border, the three MLRS batteries in these Groups can add their firepower to the joint % suppression of air defense. At the same time, he urges the JFACC to employ his stocks of sensor-fused munitions against the Iraqi forces attacking Kuwait. The JFACC agrees and the first phase of the air campaign begins with B-2 bombers carrying 32 tons of sensorfused munitions toward Southern Iraq.
Keeping in mind CINCCENT's initial guidelines for the development of the air campaign, the JFACC launches the first strikes shortly after dark on the 13th. However, the air strikes on suspected air defense sites in and around Baghdad, Basra, Ahvaz, Bandere Abbas and Tehran along with other suspected key command, control, communications and transportation nodes result in an unexpected development. When the initial strike packages are sent in, it is assumed that the vast numbers of American surveillance and airborne warning systems will detect the phased array radars and assist the fighters in destroying them. More important, the US airborne jamming capabilities are thought to be so overwhelming that a C5A could fly through the Iraqi and Iranian air defenses without being detected. This, however, does not happen.
First, the EAC2 aircraft are lost. Then 3 1 more aircraft to include F-15Es and F16s are mysteriously lost to enemy air defense missiles including Russian SA-10s." A similar experience is repeated in the Straits where 43 Navy F/A-18s are lost. In response to these losses, the JFACC suspends further attacks until he can employ the 590 Tomahawk missiles (TLAMs) in theater to destroy every possible radar and air defense site in and around Basra, Baghdad and the Straits/ 0 In the meantime, he diverts fighters to attack Iraqi troop concentrations in the Southern Iraqi desert. Attacks with inertially guided sensor fused munitions are conducted by B-2 bombers from 50,000 feet, but the effects on the widely dispersed Iraqi combat formations are difficult to assess. It appears that these attacks slow the pace of attacking Iraqi ground forces and drive them further into the open desert where dispersion offers protection. When Iraqi formations are found in assembly areas or in column along roads, sensor-fused munitions turn out to be much more effective than when they are dropped on already dispersed combat elements."

TBMSka MS that the enemy definitely has stealth tracking technology. Although this makes little difference to the B-2s which operate at altitudes of 50,000 feet, enemy air defense systems can apparently track and engage Fl 17s at altitudes of 20,000 to 30,000 feet." CINCCENT is furious. Dominant battlespace knowledge has turned out to be an illusion! In addition, the passive detection sites do not radiate at all making it extremely difficult to identify or locate them

34
Watching these events unfold on 13 and 14 January from his Deep Battle CP in Jordan, the JTF North Commander also learns of an Iraqi air force fighter attack on US troops near Amman. Although all 25 Iraqi fighters are destroyed by US Fighters and Army Air Defense assets, this is a sobering experience that leads him to consider a different course of action to support the JFACC. 
35
Using sophisticated Air Force attack operations together with a battalion of Rangers and the Army's Special Operations Aviation Regiment, the JTF North Commander is confident of finding and destroying the TBMs, as well as the outlying air defense sites. This is important because the Iraqi air defenses are also protecting the launch sites for as many as 30 TBMs a day against Amman, Aqaba, and the Suez Canal. Theater Anti-Missile Defenses have been remarkably successful, but the shield is not leakproof 17 missiles have penetrated TBM defenses and reached the port of Aqaba and the Suez canal.
In addition, the JTF North Commander argues that a limited penetration would both divert Iraqi military resources from the attack on Kuwait and position the MLRS/ATACM batteries closer to Central Iraq from which they can launch deeper attacks against Iraqi Air Defenses. Thanks to real-time links to surveillance satellites, JSTARS and the UAVs at Group and JTF levels, the JTF Commander is certain that he can coordinate this operation directly with the JFACC to match the right weapon system with the right target. Because of enormous pressure from the President to reverse the apparent defeats of the first 48 hours, CINCCENT and the JFACC agree that this course of action should be attempted immediately. Planning gets underway at the JTF Deep Battle CP while the JTF commander goes forward to co-locate with the Recon-Strike Group commander until the remaining Heavy Combat Groups arrive from Aqaba. This decision turns out to be fortuitous. As the Recon-Strike Group moves forward on 16 January, space-based infrared systems spot Iraqi ground forces as they assemble to attack the JTF's air-ground penetrations into the country Digitization of the battlespace in the air and on the ground allows both land-based and sea-based aircraft to focus their attention on the concentrations of Iraqi ground troops that are revealed by JSTARS, Guardrail and other means of electronically-collected intelligence while the Recon-Strike Group avoids direct contact and speeds to their rear. Before Iraqi mobile GLCM batteries can be withdrawn for protection over the Euphrates river, the batteries are discovered by combinations of UAVs and Comanche 36 teams searching in areas where Army Special Operations Forces report launches have taken place Although some of these batteries are dummy formations, most are not. After the Rangers and attack helicopters from the Recon-Strike Group destroy the surrounding air defense assets, the GLCM batteries are, in turn, destroyed by AT ACM strikes or precision guided missiles and munitions delivered from Air Force fighters. Elements from the Airborne-Air Assault Group augment the Rangers and the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. Occasionally, when no alternative exists, RAH 66-equipped Army Special Operations elements employ their own missiles to accomplish the mission.
With the arrival of two more Heavy Combat Groups from Aqaba late in the evening of 19 January, the JTF North Commander obtains permission from CINCCENT to attack on 20 January through and around the defensive positions of Iraqi Forces between Rutbah and the Euphrates River. In addition to the Light Recon-Strike Group already in Iraq, he has (4) Heavy Combat Groups, (1) Aviation Strike Group (45 AH64s and 27 RAH66s), a Rocket Artillery Group (108 MLRS/ATACM launchers) and three JTF Support Groups (JTF sustainment). Ignoring the larger concentrations of Iraqi ground forces east of Rutbah and along the main highway to Baghdad, he sends the Heavy Combat Groups in a double envelopment with instructions to reach the bridges over the Euphrates at Ar Ramadi and Karbala as soon as possible.
Having "atomized" the Iraqi forces defending Iraq's border with Jordan with the Recon-Strike Group and elements of the Airborne-Air Assault Group between 16 and 20 January, the JTF North Commander decides to establish a blocking position with his Airborne-Air Assault Forces near Karbala behind the shattered Iraqi defenders while the Heavy Combat Groups are moving forward. He directs the Airborne-Air Assault Group Commander to prepare his elements and the two German Paratrooper Brigades in theater for an attack during the night of 21 January. He describes this operation as an attack to penetrate to Karbala to take advantage of the confused state of the Iraqi Forces. He also hopes that this will divert the Iraqi command's attention from its main attack to seize loo Kuwait. Knowing that his ability to conduct this air assault operation will necessitate the neutralization of Iraqi air defenses in the area, he turns again to the JFACC.
With the extended range AT ACM, MLRS and AH64 longbow attack helicopters, the JFACC is certain that the air defenses around Karbala can be obliterated Then, he points out, the rocket artillery assets will be in range of Baghdad's air defense sites. The JTF North Commander agrees and discusses how to employ the unmanned aerial vehicles, RAH66 helicopters and satellites to systematically establish precise locations for the passive arrays Flying only 15 feet above ground, the RAH66s are undetectable to the passive arrays/

From his Close Battle Commander, he learns that the initial Iraqi thrust into Kuwait was on the high speed avenue of approach from Basra. Iraqi Forces, however, encountered the dense air-delivered anti-tank minefields just North of Al Jahrah and were forced to swing northwest around Kuwait City into the open desert. Orienting their fires on the city's outlying defenses where Iraqi unmanned aerial vehicles identified what appeared to be Kuwait's main defensive belt, they were surprised by the arrival of large numbers of .American armor and attack helicopters in their rear areas and on their flanks JTF North's Close Battle Commander indicates that some 24 hours of TBM strikes have passed, and that the Iraqi command structure-to judge by the attacks with tanks that began to build-up in the early morning of 15 January-is only now finally aware that their initial thrust South from Basra failed.
Although Iraqi air defenses succeeded in protecting the attacking Iraqi armor and TBM sites during the initial phase of the operation, deep strikes through the holes in Iraqi air defenses created by advancing ground forces in Northern and Central Iraq to disrupt and confuse the Iraqi command structure are now beginning to show some effect Only (1) RAH66, (11) AH64s, (15) MlAls and (

With the Heavy Combat Groups ready to attack and most of the JTF Support and Rocket Artillery Groups in place, the JTF Commander begins moving all of his forces West toward the Euphrates. Watching the Combat Groups pick their way through Iraqi defenses and minefields that failed to show up on JSTARs, the Aviation Strike Group Commander hears request after request to the JFACC for close air support go unanswered. Because of the close nature of the fighting and the concern for the safety of friendly ground troops, the JFACC is directing air strikes from sea-based and land-based platforms well beyond the fire support coordination line (FSCL). 
41
The Aviation Strike Group Commander begins rotating AH64 companies forward to the attacking Heavy Combat Groups. He concludes that with four AH64 battalions, he can easily commit two battalions to the close fight while keeping two more in reserve for Breaking the Phalanx in" possible deep operations at night. Kiovva Warrior teams organized with the Recon Squadrons of the Combat Groups assume operational control of the companies and help position the arriving AH64 companies so that they can direct their fire from behind the line of advancing friendly troops against enemy targets that cannot be attacked by either high flying, fast moving jet fighters or ground combat troops. 
42
For almost 30 hours, the Airborne-Air Assault Group maintains control of the main route over the Euphrates to Baghdad forcing the retreating Iraqi Forces to crossing points further South. At the same time, the 7,000 US and German troops in Karbala have acted as a magnet for Iraqi forces from Baghdad with the result that US attack helicopters and fighters have had a field day attacking the Iraqi troop concentrations as they move out from under the protection of Baghdad's still robust air defenses.
But now the JTF Commander wants to regain contact with these troops on the ground. He also wants to ensure that the Heavy Recon Strike Group in Kuwait does not pause. He directs the JTF CP in Kuwait City to move the Heavy Recon-Strike Group to points along the river where the Iraqis are attempting to cross. The Close Combat Commander objects to this on the grounds that the troops are exhausted CINCCENT who is tied into the discussion thanks to a real-time C4I structure intervenes to insist that the Recon-Strike Group attack regardless of its condition.
When the forward security outposts of the Airborne-Air Assault Group Recon Squadron make physical contact on the ground with the RAH66 pilots of the Light Recon-Strike Group for the first time in 48 hours, the JTF commander is relieved. The task now, he believes, is to establish contact in the air and on the ground between his remaining Combat Groups in Kuwait and North-Central Iraq. He decides to attack directly to Baghdad with the Airborne-Air Assault Group, the Light Recon Strike Group and (4) Heavy Combat Groups. With the failure of Iraqi forces to capture Kuwait City, the US Forces in Kuwait can regain control of the oil fields and parry any unlikely Iraqi counterattacks from Basra. In the meantime, the arrival of French troops in Jordan and the Sinai ensures that the long lines of communication from Aqaba and Egypt will not be threatened by growing unrest in Egypt or terrorist attacks from Saudi Arabia. The Egyptian unrest is a byproduct of radical religious elements who, encouraged by the TBM 1 < '4 strikes along the Suez Canal, demand the removal of all US and allied aircraft from Egypt Though the Iraqi and Iranian TBMs cannot reach targets in Central Egypt, the Egyptian government is still concerned about missile strikes on the Aswan dam and willingly tightens security around US anti-missile defense sites and air bases.
Encouraged by the rapid advance of JTF North, the JFLCC asks CINCCENT to reinforce this success with another Airborne-Air Assault Group and the one remaining Light Recon-Strike Group from the Pacific. JTF North's Commander recommends that these elements fly directly into Samarra where the air defenses are destroyed and a local airstrip is still in good shape. The JFLCC asks CINCCENT for the use of the Rangers and the Special Operations Aviation Regiment 
44
The JFLCC knows that when the offensive against Baghdad begins, these airmobile forces will have to fight their way into that part of the City where Sadam Hussein and his command structure are located. For this reason, the JFLCC begins to doubt that he has enough airborne infantry for the job. Ideally, when the US and German airborne-air assault infantry close-in on any political-military strongpoints, the Iraqis will be driven down into cellars or underground bunkers by the volume of fire from AGS and 155mm artillery, but the JFLCC knows from experience how easily the Iraqi defenders can cut down opposing infantry in a city's streets. Detaching the hybrid artillery battalions from the four Heavy Combat Groups to provide additional reinforcing fires for the .Airborne Infantry is one measure that will assist the effort. With more time, he could also mount a significant psychological operations campaign to try and reduce opposition. Unfortunately, there is little time and there is no choice. The roughly 12,000 American and German paratroopers will have to carry the brunt of the battle for the allies Political considerations dictate a rapid termination of the conflict and this requires US and allied forces to enter Baghdad before 26 January.
CINCCENT agrees with the JTF North Commander's proposal and directs the JFACC to move part of his force to Jordan where the major airport outside of Amman is no longer contaminated. From Jordan, a major joint attack to destroy Baghdad's air defenses can be launched that will culminate in the seizure of key military and political C2 centers in the city He asks CJCS to deploy another corps/JTF headquarters-the XXVIIIto assume control of part of these elements for an attack before 25 January to forcibly install the Iraqi government in exile in Baghdad. CJCS refuses the request and directs CINCCENT to attack no later than 25 January with the forces he has. A British Airmobile Brigade arrives in Jordan on 22 January and brightens the picture, but CTNCCENT wonders what else is happening in the world that CJCS is not sharing with him.
On 1 January JTF South's Commander sets in motion the forces that will establish US and allied control of the Straits to capture the islands where Iran has established extensive anti-air and anti-ship defenses. After 10 January, these defenses allow the Iranians to exert complete control in the air and on the sea for 150 miles in every direction from the Straits. For the Marine Expeditionary Force to accomplish its mission, these conditions must change. In pursuit of this objective, the MEF Commander's first challenge is to unite the Marine Expeditionary Brigade from California with its equipment in Diego Garcia as quickly as possible. During DESERT SHIELD this force was flown by commercial air to Al Jubayl where it assumed responsibility for defending the approaches to the Saudi Port.

Knowing that the TBM batteries present almost no threat to his operations, his plan seeks to take advantage of the Marines' best warfighting technology. Predator UAVs begin immediate sweeps throughout the area to provide a realtime picture of Iranian defenses. Fighter pilots from the carriers begin flying their planned missions on "power scene." This allows them to rehearse their missions on high resolution video equipment that utilizes the best satellite photography to digitally recreate the enemy terrain and environment. Most important, the plan calls for an over the horizon assault from the place where it is least expected: the Iranian coast. Instead of striking directly into the Straits or from the Arabian side of the Gulf, the Marines will fly into Iran, seize the islands, and eventually, Bandere Abbas from the Iranian side of the Gulf. Though this is admittedly a risky course of action, it promises the advantage of surprise. Thus, the JFLCC supports the MEF Commander's plan and CINCCENT approves.
With the news of Iran's assault across the Gulf to seize the oil fields on the lower peninsula, carrier-based air begins a series of attacks to destroy Iranian air defenses and to cripple Iranian C3I nodes. Initially, the carrier-based fighters are considered for use against deep targets in the Southern Arabian peninsula and Iraq, but the JFACC is unable to support the Navy's fighters with in-flight refueling assets and still maintain the tempo of land-based air strikes from Egypt and Italy. Unable to reach deep targets, the carrierbased fighters concentrated their attacks against the Iranian air and ground defenses in and around the Straits.

On 22 January at 0400 hours, eight V22s carrying 144 Marines lift off from one Wasp-class LHD and one Tarawa-class LHA to begin the attack to seize the islands in the Straits. They disappear into the night and report no contact with either Iranian air defenses or aircraft. Iranian radars are off and Navy and Marine fighters over the target area report no activity in the projected landing zones. Although nothing has been heard from the SEAL teams that went ashore 12 hours ago, the absence of air defense activity and the reports of no significant enemy movement from JSTARS and the UAVs is reassuring. When the V22s reach the landing zones on the islands of Abu Musa and Tunbs, they are able to disembark their forces without much interference. After a brief battle with Iranian infantry, the Marines gain complete control of the islands! After completing the air insertion, however, Iranian line-of-sight air defense guns destroy two of the V22s as they pause in mid-air to make the transition from vertical to horizontal flight Also Iranian rocket artillery launches several attacks on the islands from positions on the mainland. Still, the MEF Commander is elated and communicates the news of the Marines' success to CINCCENT. CINCCENT urges the MEF Commander to reinforce his success as rapidly as possible. This elation does not last long. On 20 January, the Russians passed a note through their operatives in Tehran to Iranian military intelligence that three US "Carriers" were sited east of the entrance to the Persian Gulf. The Russian information includes course, heading and last known location for the ships. As in Iraq, the redundancy offered by conventional telephone cables, coaxial cable, and fiber optics defeats American air and missile power's attempts to effectively target critical Iranian C3I nodes. Because the Iranian and Iraqi systems are really "nodeless," missiles and bombs on one particular target do not assure the destruction of the C3I system. As a result, this information reaches the Iranian Military Commander in Bandere Abbas in time to be of value While remembering that Iran has a total inventory of only 67 cruise missiles, the Iranian Commander decides that these targets are important enough to justify their use. The prize of sinking a large US Carrier is worth the entire inventory! Just after midnight on 22 January, eleven light trucks carrying 23 missiles depart for a position on the Iranian coast just fifty miles from the Marine amphibious carriers.

Shaken, but undeterred, the MEF Commander decides to position his force 100 miles further south in closer proximity to the CVBG in the Indian Ocean. Of course, this places the main body of Marine Forces nearly 200 miles from their original objectives, but this positiones the Marine Amphibious ships beyond the range of the Iranian surveillance and, hopefully, ground-launched cruise missile threat. It is at this point that the V-22 makes a critical contribution to the operation. Although intended for deep insertions of Marine Forces further inland, the V-22s with superior range and speed now move Marines at night to locations along the Iranian coast where the mobile cruise missile detachments are operating.

Southwest Asia was chosen only because the area is now somewhat more familiar to Americans than North Africa, Eastern Europe, Korea or Southeast Asia However, similar events could have occurred in those places too. It is no exaggeration to suggest that the implications for the US Armed Forces of a scenario like the one outlined here are significant. Technology changes the ways in which conflicts are conducted, won or lost Technology also shapes or influences events by amplifying American strengths and minimizing the effects of mishaps, mistakes or technical failures (friction). 
39
60
This observation reinforces the need to organize both air assault and heavy ground combat forces to deploy rapidly and fight effectively within a joint framework. It also means forward-stationing Army Ground Forces in critical regions like Southwest Asia.
Despite the development of American deep-strike attack weapons, capable of attacking targets hundreds of miles in the enemy rear, the results of the close battle-the area where the combatants are in direct contract-will remain critical to the outcome of the war. If war in the future will be a contest between regional powers that will seek to exploit new information age military technology for limited regional aims, warfare in the future will still involve closing with the enemy and killing him at close range. It will not be possible to destroy all of the enemy's forces before they get to the battlefield, and so it will continue to be necessary to engage and defeat the enemy's forces in battles when the two sides are in sight of one another. The tendency over time in land warfare is to disperse ground forces and concentrate the effects of weapons rather than troops. This makes it very inefficient as well as expensive to allocate one PGM to every enemy ground system. Moreover, merely killing the enemy's fixed sites will not win the war.
When the enemy cannot see its deep targets, the enemy fails to cope with the rapid overland advance of the Army's close combat formations. The faster and deeper .Army air-ground combat teams advance into enemy territory, the less dangerous and effective the enemy's weapons of mass destruction become. "All arms" formations smaller than the current divisions thrust forward behind a screen of manned and unmanned reconnaissance and stand-off weapon systems. Air-land forced entry operations are made possible today by new aviation technology, new sophisticated light armor and recon-attack helicopters It is now possible to launch such an operation from the United States and reach half-way around the world in less than 24 hours.
Once enemy and friendly troops begin the close battle, it is difficult to rely on Air Force fighters for close air support. The difficulties in directing accurate fire from altitudes in excess of 15,000 feet against ground targets that are relatively close to friendly troops that are also camouflaged, scattered, moving and defended by anti-aircraft systems cannot be overstated. Current and future generations of fighters fly simply fly too fast and too high to discriminate between friendly and enemy forces in close combat. The constraints and limitations on the application of air power at night or in adverse weather only make these matters worse. Digitization may succeed in partially solving the combat identification problem, but in the interim there is little prospect of sufficiently removing the fog of war to prevent fratricide from the air. Beyond these points, the Air Tasking Order (ATO) process works well for pre-planned strategic strikes, but its 48-72 hour planning cycle does not lend itself to quick reaction strikes or close air support missions. There is also another reason American and allied Air Forces will be fully engaged in an all-out deep strike effort to suppress, neutralize or destroy the enemy's weapons of mass destruction when future ground offensives are just beginning. In fact, this was the conclusion drawn from the Yom Kippur War by the commander of all the regular Israeli Forces in the Golan region. Rafael Eitan, the former Israeli Defense Force Chief of Staff went so far as to suggest that in the early phase of future offensive operations Israeli Ground Forces would have to become self-reliant in the context of close air support:
The air force must not be involved in support missions for the land forces until it has assured itself reasonable freedom of operation by destroying the enemy's missile networks. This being so, the land forces must be prepared to bear the burden in the war's opening stages, and not pin their hopes on the performance of the aircraft...

64
"Army deep fires" from improved MLRS rocket systems destroy a variety of enemy targets, including air defense sites. TBM sites. C4I installations and reserve troop concentrations-some with a single missile These capabilities augment, supplement and magnify the impact of airpower in the theater of war. 
65
Arpower tends to operate in surges of firepower and does not apply constant pressure against enemy forces. Arpower is also very vulnerable to periodic swings in technology. In the Gulf War, American Arpower operated in an environment where airpower had a relative advantage over Iraqi ground forces. In the years ahead, passive detection and tracking systems, speed of light anti-aircraft systems, tactical ballistic missiles and cruise missiles will change warfare in ways not yet comprehended However, technological surprise poses special perils to airpower where sudden, one-sided supremacy in aerospace defense, lasers and smart weapons could create spectacular shifts in the balance of military power. 
66
designed to cope with this contingency and can assist the air component to overcome the threat Airpower enthusiasts conveniently forget that the Egyptians gained a six day respite from the effects of Israeli air superiority in 1973 In this short time, over one hundred thousand Egyptian troops with a thousand tanks and armored fighting vehicles were able to cross the Suez canal and nearly overrun the state of Israel The Israelis have never forgotten the lesson that overreliance on any one arm of combat or weapon system is ill-advised. Just as new anti-tank capabilities and new air defense technology surprised Israeli Defense Forces in 1973 during the Egyptian offensive to retake the Sinai, modern information age technology in the hands of innovative military leaders can potentially reduce or neutralize the effectiveness of high altitude air strikes. Passive radar systems are evolving to the point where they are sensitive, accurate and persistent enough to locate and identify aircraft at long range. Because passive detection sites do not radiate, it is extremely difficult to identify or locate them. 
67
In this regard, missiles, however revolutionary in character, are still like bullets, once fired, they cannot be retrieved. Just as it is unwise to rely too much on airpower, it is equally unrealistic to expect stand-off missile systems to win wars. When the inventory of expensive missiles is gone, their role is over. Therefore, their use should be reserved for critical periods and for targets especially difficult for other weapons to handle.' As sensor-to-shooter technological enhancements make fires more responsive, it will be necessary to ensure that an expensive Tomahawk missile whose warhead is intended for a hardened target is not allocated for use against softer, more mobile targets For these reasons, Government-sponsored research and development programs in Europe, Japan and China are working to create new, less expensive cruise missile systems of increased range and striking power. As more inexpensive cruise missiles become available, reliance on manned aircraft to conduct deep operations will probably decline. This is true for Army as well as Air Force aircraft. 
69
which, in turn, establishes how far inland naval and amphibious forces can influence the action _ Sea-based forces are ideal targets for weapons of mass destruction when they attempt to execute forced entry operations from the sea." The concentration of several thousand sailors, airmen and marines in an amphibious or Nimitz-class aircraftcarrier risks single point failure in future warfighting. In contrast, dispersed, highly mobile ground forces present poor targets for these weapons and land-based aviation can operate from protected locations beyond the ranges of these weapons Provided that ground forces organize to disperse, historical evidence indicates that casualty rates in land warfare do not necessarily increase when weapons of greater lethality appear. In the last century, it was not unusual for armies to lose between 10% and 20% of their strength in a single day. But despite the increasing destructiveness of weapons during World War II, this loss rate dropped to around 1% to 3% a day Loss rates for Israeli Forces during the 1973 war were estimated to 1.8% per day.

These points further reinforce the enduring requirement for US-sponsored alliance structures and the forward-basing of US Army contingents to overcome these constraints Without Army contingents positioned in areas of vital strategic interest. US Forces are unlikely to gain access from the sea in future crises or conflicts. At the same time, naval forces that must position hundreds of miles away in order to operate beyond the reach of the enemy's weapon systems are unlikely to act as a persuasive deterrent In addition to being extremely high risk combat operations, forced entry operations from the sea are capital intensive,

• The Army's senior leadership must rethink its commitment to preserving all current echelons of command and control. 
78
Reorganizing the Army's forces along the lines suggested in this scenario would seem to be essential in a strategic environment in which the time for mobilizing and massing forces to attack is likely to be quite short. The political fragility of future Americanled coalitions under the weight of regional conflict and the impact of instantaneous communications on public perceptions of military operations will not improve this situation For these reasons, the readiness and ability to deploy quickly will be more important than ever before. The speed and tactical surprise of units from the same divisions in the 1989 invasion of Panama clearly contributed to their success In both cases, the first troops began to be airlifted less than 18 hours after the order was given.

The question of how much force is no more important than the question of how quickly that force can be deployed in a major crisis.

scenario.
The US Army's passion for centralization, the pooling of resources and the running of war by remote control which contributed to the long lead times needed by Army Forces to prepare and launch offensive operations in Vietnam and Southwest Asia cannot shape operational thinking in the future. 
83
• Striving for speed and decisive force on the strategic level goes beyond rapid deployment. This means that the Nation cannot afford to trade forces on land for the promise offerees delivered from the sea over the beach. To do so means risking the certainty of another war in the Gulf. The 1991 war to regain control of Kuwait cost the US-led coalition at least $60 billion. An additional $25 billion was spent in the reconstruction of Kuwait. Compared with the costs of responding repeatedly to future crises as the Armed Forces did in 1994 and 1995, the estimated cost of establishing an Army ground presence of less than 5,000 troops (a Recon-Strike Group or Heavy Combat Group) in Kuwait-roughly 300 to 400 million dollars per year-is modest in comparison. Kuwait and the GCC states would also share some of this burden.
• The assertion that Kuwait is indefensible constitutes an American confession of impotence in a confrontation with reactionary regimes that threaten not only regional stability, but global economic prosperity as well. For reasons that are reminiscent of German insistence on the stationing of US ground forces in Central Europe after World War II, today's Gulf Arab elites understand that US ground forces represent a tangible US commitment to regional stability that neither Iraq nor Iran can afford to ignore. Just what the United States might do to protect a US ground force in Kuwait would figure prominently in any Iraqi or Iranian plan to attack Kuwait and the Arabian peninsula. This is, after all, the essential feature of deterrence

The questions, then, are: (1) How to reorient current Army doctrine and training with its heavy emphasis on detailed planning, lengthy deliberation and maintaining control offerees to a new information age force design which depends for its effectiveness on joint C4I, "war ready" combat forces and operational flexibility to win

According to Stephen Hosmer, the three Republican Guard Divisions in the Kuwait Theater of Operations as of 1 March 1991 left behind in their prewar deployment areas 166 tanks, 103 Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) and 99 artillery pieces. As percentages of prewar deployments these amounted to 21% tanks (n=786), 28% APCs (736) and 32% artillery (308). This offers further' confirmation that at least 70%-80% of the Republican Guard losses were inflicted by advancing ground forces. However, this would not be suggested by any of the current models.

Because the Army's rigid patterns of career progression and professional development are inseparable from the division-centered force, the elimination of the division/brigade echelons in this design also creates time at the Army Lieutenant Colonel and Colonel levels for assignment to Joint Staffs in Washington and the unified commands before consideration and selection for "Group" command. At present, the Army's career management system leaves little time for joint assignments or advanced civil education.

The preceding account of a future conflict in Southwest Asia shows that it is no longer meaningful to speak of individual service doctrine or operations. Ground Forces are part of an integrated joint force that includes sensors, remote targeting capabilities, stand-off weapon platforms and surveillance systems. The second point is that there are no technological single service "silver bullets" in military affairs. Successful strategy is still the effective organization and application of power These observations are important because the persuasion in victory that a ne>v "silver bullet" has been revealed which is largely independent of time and circumstance is a delusion to which many military and political leaders have fallen victim When a British Army annihilated an opposing Sudanese Army in 1899 with the help of several machine guns, military observers of the day expressed the view that the machine gun was the new principal weapon of the age-a new "silver bullet " But the machine gun could not and did not win World War I. New tactics and new countermeasures-the tank-defeated the machine gun. In the 1930s, the manned bomber became the "silver bullet" Britain's Prime Minister, Stanley Baldwin, believed this so strongly he implied that to hold a different opinion was stupid and even dishonest! 1 Of course, the Prime Minister was wrong. Antiaircraft guns, the proximity fuse and above all men in fighter planes downed hundreds of manned bombers. Today's exponents of strategic airpower are no less strident in their claims to have once again found a military "silver bullet" in the form of new stealth aircraft with precision-guided missiles."
Yet, as we have seen, "silver bullets" do not win wars. It is the combinations of weapons, and above all their skilled and practiced use, which result in victory. This suggests that overreliance in war on supposed "silver bullet" weapon systems that can be inexpensively countered once their technical characteristics are understood should be avoided, especially if the acquisition costs are high. This reality has been evident in warfare for many years. Modern aircraft depend heavily on electronic jamming to protect them against radar-guided anti-aircraft systems and infrared-guided missiles. The survivability of large aircraft carriers and amphibious ships depends on antiship missile defenses, which must perform perfectly within a few seconds of a missile alert. In both cases, very expensive platforms can be destroyed by relatively inexpensive weapons when the platforms' automated detection and response systems are neutralized in yet another round of the endless measure-countermeasure cycle. This problem is complicated by several factors. These factors include the rising costs of weapons platforms, long lead times for the development and acquisition of new systems and the accelerated pace of the measurecountermeasure cycle.
In terms of the current changes which are being brought about by the impact of new military technology and political upheaval, policymakers are really much closer to the beginning of the RMA in which they find themselves than they are at its end. The problem for policymakers is compounded by new problems in the international arena. For instance, competition between nations for control of the earth's resources combined with the tendency of human populations in the developing world to increase up to the limits imposed by the food supply will create tensions that could require the US Armed Forces to undertake sustained occupation duties in conflicted regions." Thus, the changing nature of the international system itself requires a continuous assessment of the relationships that actually link new technology's military potential to national strategy and military doctrine. This involves the search for a national military strategy that does not spread American military resources too thinly across the globe, but rejects isolationist calls to withdraw from overseas engagements in favor of sole reliance on airpower from the land or the sea. And a strategy that does not emphasize types of armed forces independently of the criteria by which the warfighting utility of military power is normally judged. In this perspective, overreliance on one category of weapons creates a dangerous dilemma for policymakers who want to build forces capable of fighting decisively in a variety of conflict settings.
In a strategy that emphasizes the selective use of military power to protect American security. American military strength should be organized and deployed differently from the way it is today. Instead of seeking to be strong everywhere, the selective use of military power suggests a readiness to buttress the stability of key states around the world, operating to prevent regional crises and conflicts rather than reacting to them. Apart from avoiding a great-power war that could destroy civilization on a worldwide basis, nothing in US foreign policy could be more important. Americans have also fastened upon a formula for going to war in which American casualties are minimized and protracted armed conflicts are avoided. For this formula to work again as it did in the Gulf War, adoption of a military doctrine that has a decisive foreign policy intent is key to signaling the seriousness of American interests in war and peace.

Landpower plays a critical role. The presence of US Ground Forces in areas of strategic importance to the United States commits allies who augment American military power and guarantees American political, economic and military access to the region. The readiness of American Ground Forces to deploy quickly and fight from both bases in the United States and from allied territory eliminates doubt in the minds of potential opponents concerning whether the United States can or will intervene.

In the waning years of the 20th Century, several factors are converging to create the capability to execute dominating maneuver on a new, unimagined scale. These factors include the increased accuracy and destructiveness of modern ordnance, greatly enhanced surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities, the strategic range of American land-based air-and landpower and American control of the high seas. Adjustments in joint tactics and operational methods will have to be made to cope with these new factors, but a new American operational structure for future conflict is emerging.
The power of modern technology to integrate systems that can facilitate a more efficient exchange of information may be one of the most important factors in the Army's plan to reorganize for future war. Instead of perfecting separate weapon and communication systems, the current RMA emphasizes technologies and command structures that meld computers, weapons, communications and surveillance systems together. Not only does this observation imply that the future conduct of war will be more fluid, opportunistic, dynamic and lethal than ever before, it also shifts warfare's focus away from over-reliance on the physical ability of individual weapon systems to destroy vast numbers of targets. Although this does not diminish the value of precision engagement as a concept for locating and striking enemy targets, it does reject the assumption that as a more refined instrument of attrition warfare, "precision engagement alone" makes positional advantage irrelevant. Victory in war rarely comes solely as the result of the victor's superior technology.
The Southwest Asia scenario suggests that future victory in land warfare will depend on the ability of Army Ground Forces to deploy quickly and advance rapidly in great strength into the depths of the enemy's territory. This action fundamentally neutralizes the enemy's military capability, ensures a rapid collapse of his command system and terminates the conflict. In describing the doctrinal implications of the Army organization for combat proposed in the preceding chapters, an image of a joint, simultaneous attack in depth emerges in which speed of movement and decision are paramount. 
10
In the opening or initial entry phase, missilepower and airpower are critical. Precision guided missiles and air strikes are launched early in the campaign to disrupt and degrade enemy C4I. Every lethal and non-lethal system that can contribute to both the suppression of enemy air defenses and to strikes against militarily and politically significant targets in depth are mobilized in support of this effort. In the Army, these forces include Rocket Artillery Groups, Aviation Strike Groups, Special Operations elements as well as deep strike-capable assets that are organized with the Army's close combat formations. Even Airborne-Air Assault elements or Recon-Strike elements are subordinated to the JFACC for missions to suppress or neutralize air defenses and weapons of mass destruction which cannot be attacked in any other way. However, rather than seeking to strike every potentially important target in a given theater in the hope of achieving total paralysis, the strategic aim of this operational phase is to achieve partial paralysis at key points inside the battlespace. This operation involves simultaneous attacks to dismember and isolate forward-deployed enemy combat forces in preparation for the attack of the Combat Groups into the battlespace Knowing that the shock to the enemy's C4I systems will be greatest in the first hours of the strikes, the Combat Groups are postured to attack much earlier than was the case during DESERT STORM. If this phase is preempted by the enemy, then a similar operational phase will be necessary to regain the initiative.
As the preparatory/initial entry phase (2 to 14 days) draws to a close, the infiltration/penetration phase begins when a mix of highly mobile "all arms" Combat Groups smaller than the current divisions thrust forward behind a screen of manned and unmanned reconnaissance and stand-off weapon systems. For the advancing Combat Groups, the tactical objective in this phase is not to frontally assault or destroy defending enemy combat formations, but to penetrate the enemy's defenses simultaneously at several different points. For example, the Airborne-Air Assault Group evades contact with all of the enemy's forward-deployed elements and seizes lightly defended, but operationally significant objectives in depth or on the flanks. Penetration operations do not entail direct frontal assaults into the teeth of enemy defenses. The Recon-Strike Group leads the attack by guiding follow-on Heavy Combat Groups around or through the enemy's defenses and by neutralizing or disrupting enemy counterattacks to stop the Heavy Combat Groups.
Regular infusions of focused logistical support which are delivered quickly and precisely by ground and aerial means are key to the success of this operation. This suggests that in many instances less support needs to be delivered more precisely and rapidly for greater overall effect.
Aerospace denial continues to be a minimum condition for success during this phase. This means that if attacking American Air Forces cannot achieve air superiority or air supremacy throughout the theater of conflict, 
11
Throughout this operational phase the Combat Groups move like irregular swarms spaced in breadth and echeloned in depth, moving to gaps and weaknesses revealed or created by organic armed air-ground reconnaissance and indirect fires. The zones of attack for individual Combat Groups may be anywhere from 20 to 80 kilometers in width and 50 to 200 kilometers in depth. Rocket Artillery, Aviation Strike Groups and Air Force fighters dispersed throughout the battlespace focus their fires on vulnerable enemy formations to accelerate the forward momentum of the attack. Thanks to an integrated multi-service C4I structure and the proliferation of Army aviation elements in every Army warfighting formation, the Combat Groups are unconcerned with uniform rates of advance, the alignment of their formations and open flanks. Attacking air and ground formations share a common sense of situational awareness and augment oneanother's fighting power.
Manned reconnaissance elements find and target static defensive positions containing enemy armored vehicles or dismounted troops. Surveillance to be useful, needs manned reconnaissance to confirm and refine its data. Thus, the increase in air-ground combat formations equipped and trained for armed reconnaissance within the Groups prevents a paucity of armed reconnaissance from slowing the Groups' advance. Technological advances in microcircuitry, communications and reconnaissance allow these penetration attacks on the tactical level to be translated simultaneously into exploitation operations on the operational level. Because the Groups are self-sustaining, their operational reach is considerably greater than was the case during the Gulf War.
After penetrating the enemy's defenses, the Heavy Combat Groups drive deep into the enemy's rear areas where the enemy's weapons of mass destruction are either quickly destroyed or incapacitated. In this exploitation phase of the attack, the operational theater-wide offensive is transformed from a series of breakthroughs in the air and on the ground where the enemy defense has lost its coherency into large-scale exploitation attacks along multiple air-ground axes to seize operational objectives in the enemy's rear areas. In striking contrast to the way the Army fought in the World Wars, Korea and DESERT STORM, enemy elements are discovered, then neutralized, destroyed or bypassed as the operational situation and the tactical mission warrant. As the exploitation attacks succeed, the conflict termination phase begins with the occupation and administration of key areas. In the past decade, as civilian populations in underdeveloped states have exploded, the size of American and allied armies has declined significantly. Military operations to restore and maintain order and stability place armies squarely at the juncture of these two trends. As practiced in recent decades, such operations are troop-intensive, with the required forces on the ground related closely to the size of the populations in the area of operations.
Thus, future regional conflict is neither a one-act play nor a series of discrete operations. Rather, dominate maneuver begins with the attacks of strategically dispersed forces. These attacks gather strength through a series of consecutive, overlapping phases of offensive action involving all the arms of combat. By exploiting the combination of armed reconnaissance and over-head surveillance, air and ground forces attack without pause to seize and maintain the initiative. This implies never allowing the enemy to recover from the initial shock of the first attack. Because of the ambiguity of the situation that results from simultaneous deep and close attacks, the enemy is unable to react in time and can not regain a coherent picture of the conflict. The four overlapping phases can be summarized as follows:
• Preparatory/Initial Entry Phase: In this phase, Air, Land and Sea forces move from a condition of strategic dispersal to strategic concentration while all forces either conduct or prepare to conduct joint, simultaneous attacks in depth. The minimal precondition for success during this phase is aerospace denial. This means that the arriving or assembling ground forces must be protected from the enemy's weapons of mass destruction through both passive (dispersion/stand-off) and active means (theater missile defense/air superiority over US Forces). Early in this phase, sea-based weapon systems and C4I, intercontinental landbased air and ground forces are critical. Strategic knowledge of the enemy's operational intentions and capabilities is an important element of this comprehensive joint response to regional conflict or crisis. Centralization of strike assets to maximize force protection and damage to the enemy will be an important feature of operations in this phase.
• Infiltration/Penetration Phase: All operations in the infiltration phase will be highly opportunistic in character. That is to say, autonomy and independence at the tactical level will have to be supported by decentralization on the operational level. This will facilitate the use of all arms in the context of discovering, defeating or destroying the enemy. Advanced surveillance and armed reconnaissance, integrated C4I, enhanced mobility, accurate weapon and navigation systems as well as superior human talent and potential, allow for the rapid penetration and infiltration of an enemy's military defenses regardless of his deployment scheme Thus, the principle of centralization of control over strike assets in the first phase has to gradually give way to decentralization of control over strike assets in the follow-on infiltration phase.
• Exploitation Phase: Today, new technology extends the deep attack to the enemy's heartland in a very short period of time over great distances. Existing and future improvements in force protection, lethality, mobility and information collection and dissemination will compress this operation into days or hours depending on the size of the geographic region involved. As this phase begins to end, the national command authorities will begin to examine options for the rotation of fighting forces to reconstitution and the replacement of these forces with fresh elements from the continental United States. Some of these forces will consist of Army National Guard formations.
• Termination: It is probable that the disintegration of the opposing state apparatus during the exploitation phase will result in the termination of hostilities in the areas where exploitation attacks are in progress and before a formal arrangement is made. In many cases, the fact that spreading democracy and human rights is a concomitant strategic aim of any American-led offensive, the potential to supplant enemy opposition with the cooperation of the noncombatant population should not be underestimated. However, this also means that Army Ground Forces must be prepared to administer and control large populated areas of enemy territory until legitimate indigenous administration can be restored
This picture of future warfare suggests the need for change in the way Army Forces are postured for both overseas presence and rapid deployment from the United States. Because of the threat of weapons of mass destruction and the fragility of future alliance structures under crisis conditions, an extended preparation of Army Ground Forces for an offensive in close proximity to the enemy's forces is extremely risky. Army Ground Forces cannot expect to build-up their combat power in the future as they did in the Gulf War without being challenged. Otherwise, US Forces will be presented with a fait accompli as enemies attempt to outpace the American military response. More important, against a more substantial enemy, the national command authorities cannot afford to grant him time to organize his own forces or to disrupt the deployment of American Forces. 
15
The prevailing military response to the operational challenge of sudden and often unanticipated regional crises or conflicts is two-fold. First, an Army presence must exist in those regions of the world where unimpeded American political, economic and military access is vital to American security. This military strategy heightens the importance of forward-positioning Army combat power in pivotal states. Peace requires the enhancing of crisis stability, both by unilateral moves concerning the movement and readiness of the Army's combat forces, and through negotiation with the opponent from a position of military strength. Second, to facilitate the Army's rapid response to future crises and conflicts, Army Forces overseas and in CONUS need an operational link that enhances readiness and deployability. Because operational success in the information age will depend on the Army's readiness and capability to conduct dominating maneuver within a joint framework, the Army will have to make it possible for the regional CINCs to have ground forces at their disposal that can respond quickly and decisively to regional conflicts and crises.
To date, this has been very problematic for the Army. With only ten divisions and two armored cavalry regiments (one of which is really very lightly armed), the Army has been hard pressed to provide the regional warfighting CINCs with the Army Forces they need in times of peace and war. These forces include engineers for peacetime civil engineering projects, airmobile infantry, light armor and attack helicopters for crisis response, and heavy combat troops and rocket artillery to forge a powerful offensive capability in war. Having made the decision to posture the Army for deployment from the continental United States (CONUS), the NCA has unintentionally prevented the CINCs who will command the Army's combat power in war or crisis from exercising much influence over the training and preparation of these forces for deployment to their respective theaters. The consequences of this arrangement for war planners, logisticians and USTRANSCOM is significant. The same four or five divisions are routinely included in multiple war plans with the result that the CINCs are always competing for access to the same units.
No observer of the last four years would deny that the most striking feature of the new strategic environment is the dependence of the national command authorities on the readiness of US Ground Forces to move quickly and decisively. This was certainly true in October 1994 when the 24th Infantry Division had to move troops and equipment in a matter of days to Kuwait in response to what appeared to be a possible short-warning attack by Iraqi Forces. The need to move ground forces quickly was demonstrated again during operations in Haiti and Bosnia. This places emphasis on combat forces-in-being, not understrength units dependent on infusions of soldiers from other Active Component units or reserve formations. Preemption is not an option in a force structure that lacks the manpower to launch combat operations from a standing start. In other words, to obtain the ability to project Combat Groups to areas of American strategic interest requires a cultural change in the basic concepts of training readiness that have dominated Army thinking for decades.
The Group structure adapts the Army's force readiness to the new environment. Combat Groups both in the United States and overseas can be assigned on a rotating basis to the operational command and control of the regional CINCs for a "standing start, come as you are war" environment. In a smoothly functioning military system organized around the "Group" concept, this approach does more than closely link the warfighting forces to the CINC who will employ them. The Information Age Army permanently assigns (1) warfighting Corps headquarters to USEUCOM, USCENTCOM, USFK/CFC and USACOM. These four fully manned Army Corps headquarters would become in conjunction with resources from all of the services the basis for "standing" JTF headquarters in each major geographical region as well as a CONUS-based contingency corps under USACOM in its force provider role. This approach would have been impossible just a few years ago. However, with the creation and modernization of the Army Prepositioning Afloat (APA: Appendix C) set, the prepostioned sets of Army equipment in strategically pivotal regions of the world and air transport modernization and expansion (C-5A/C-17), Army Ground Forces are now global weapons with global reach. This approach could also be extended to the Marine Corps in the context of standing MEF-based JTFs in maritime theaters. In USPACOM and USACOM / USSOUTHCOM, 
16
The proposal to transform Army Corps Headquarters into the basis for permanent Joint Task Force Headquarters supports more than just joint warfighting. It conforms to the long-term aim of supplanting service component operational, administrative and logistical commands in the regional unified commands with multi-service Joint Force Operational and Logistics Commands (JFLC). Scrapping the service-pure component commands allows the Joint Task Force structure to be organized around functional areas of responsibility. (This is effectively what General Schwarzkopf did during DESERT STORM when he appointed MG Pagonis as his JFLC.) This approach imparts greater flexibility to the JTF while allowing the assignment of command and staff responsibilities to the organizations with the preponderance of forces employed. 
17
Moreover, instead of relying on a small portion of the Army's forces to execute critical regional warfighting tasks, the CINCs can expect the Army to provide a predictable mix of Combat, Combat Support and Combat Service Support Groups from the entire ground force to the operational command and control of the CINC on a rotational basis. These Groups would be available for two purposes. First, they would always constitute the forces that would deploy first to combat under control of the regional JTF headquarters in the CINCs' theater. And, second, they would provide troops to conduct joint training and to execute missions in the context of peacetime engagement. Finding time in the course of regular training to preserve Service Core Competencies is always a challenge. But finding time to conduct realistic joint training with the other services is extremely difficult within the contemporary Army training framework.
And, finally, this concept rests on the foundation of a new information age training system that supports the short-notice deployability of these forces.
For example, one third of these Groups can be involved at any given point in time in one of three 180 day operational readiness cycles in peacetime. On a strategic level, this means that one third of the Army's total combat strength in the continental United States could be considered ready for rapid deployment. This is a larger percentage of the force than is currently the case. These cycles would each encompass 180 days and their structure would resemble the following:
Training Cycle: In this phase collective training would be conducted from the lowest levels and build to a combat training center rotation roughly halfway through the cycle. Training deficiencies noted in the rotation would be addressed during the last half of the cycle. In addition, the battalion through corps/JTF staffs levels would prepare for and execute a simulated exercise at the operational (corps/JTF) level at the end of the cycle. The regional CINC to whom the Group is assigned for the Deployment Ready Cycle would presumably shape this training and preparation.
In this cycle the Group is ready for deployment. Its equipment is sustained at its highest readiness status. Its soldiers and small units would hone their individual skills in such areas as gunnery and marksmanship and conduct small scale collective training at local training areas. Early deploying forces planned for response to an initial major regional contingency as well as forces for operational contingency deployments would be identified and drawn from Groups in this cycle.
Reconstitution Cycle: This phase is devoted to individual, equipment, and unit renewal. Activities in this cycle would include: military and civilian individual education; periodic medical and dental treatment; individual leave; periodic equipment servicing and overhauls; equipment upgrades; changes of command; personnel reassignment; and post support functions.
Adherence to this cycle construct would result in a number of benefits for the readiness of the soldiers and their units. The certainty of knowing when he must be ready to deploy is a source of great confidence to both the soldier and his commander. General Reimer, Army Chief of Staff, has noted that to accomplish the Army's missions, large numbers of soldiers have to execute back-to-back deployments and extended separations from their families: On average, American soldiers assigned to a troop unit now spend 138 days a year away from home. Many special units, such as military police, air defense and transportation, have been carrying a heavier load. Operations tempo is high. Thus, leaders must help reduce stress in units. One way to do this is predictability. 
18
Strike Group, an Airborne-Air Assault Group or an Engineer Group could be added to a Marine Expeditionary Force in the Pacific. Had this system been in place during the last 12 months of the Bosnian conflict, part or all of a Rocket Artillery Group could have deployed to Croatia's Adriatic coast from which it could strike targets in the joint suppression of Bosnian Serb air defenses or as artillery support for the Bosnian Federation's forces. This was unnecessary in 1995, but may become critical in a future strategic environment where sophisticated air defense technology is proliferating. Consequently, these assets are consolidated into the CONUS-based Decisive Force Corps for operational training and deployment. This strategic reorganization of the Army to conduct dominating maneuver in a joint context assumes that future crises or conflicts will erupt suddenly and with minimal warning. For instance, in the event that a major regional contingency seemed imminent in Korea, this structure would allow for the rapid deployment of sufficient force to either deter an attack or to halt one. This situation could result in a decision by the National Command Authorities to immediately deploy (3) Heavy Combat Groups, (2) JTF Support Groups and (1) Engineer Mobility Group to Korea where the Groups would draw equipment from the APA and from prepositioned equipment sites. If conditions in Southwest Asia suggested the need to simultaneously strengthen deterrence there, (1) Heavy Combat Group from this pool of ready forces could fly to Southwest Asia where it would fall-in on prepositioned equipment in order to reinforce the Army presence in the region. If necessary, a further reinforcement of the US and allied position in Southwest Asia by air transport of a Light Recon-Strike Group could be executed if it were warranted. If, however, war in Korea seemed unavoidable, a Rocket Artillery Group ((4) MLRS/ATACM Bns), an Aviation Strike Group ((4) AH64 Bns) and additional JTF Support Groups could be flown to Northeast Asia in a matter of days.
The fact that the Combat Groups' battalion/squadron-level structures are uniform in their composition and warfighting orientation also offers the opportunity to keep combat units together for longer periods than is currently the case. This has never been easy. Professional armies like the US Army and the British Army lose about half of their enlistees after three or four years, but it is possible to quickly integrate new enlistees into relatively stable unit organizations. 
20
Rising military marriage rates in the last decade have led the US Army to adopt an expanding program of family support, which is difficult to sustain under the present fiscal strain. In an era of diminished financial resources, there is much to be said for a home-basing system and for encouraging military families to live off-post in civilian communities where they may, as longterm residents, build the networks of social support that modern families require. 
21
Reduction of some of the Army's Europe-based force from 65,000 to roughly 40,000-45,000 would also allow for the addition of 5,000 troops to Southwest Asia. A reduction in Korea of perhaps 5,000 troops may also be possible under this proposal. Although these proposals may initially be viewed with concern by many of our allies who are accustomed to equate American power with numbers of committed combat troops, they will be more enthusiastic when they understand that these changes will actually enhance America's responsiveness to regional conflict while adding to America's overall striking power.
"Win-Hold-Win" (today's defacto strategy) requires that regardless of LRC entanglements, "2nd MRC halt forces" get in quickly to the second theater. The outlined force structure enables this. Historically, the nation's armed forces have treated one theater of war as a "decisive force theater" and a second theater of war as an "economy-of-force" theater. During World War II, the National Command Authorities treated the European Theater as the decisive force theater and the Pacific Theater as the economy-offorce theater.
While it admits the possibility that a JTF may have to defend against an attacking enemy, the doctrinal thinking implicit in an American concept for strategic dominance regards the defense as a temporary condition from which a Joint Task Force goes on to the offensive. Rather than relying on the cumbersome mobilization arrangements of the Cold War Army, the JTF-based Army is positioned on the frontiers of American strategic interest, primed to move with a minimum of notice and preparation.
The search for an overarching doctrinal framework for training Army Ground Forces to deploy and fight in the new strategic environment, however, is no easy task. During the 1980s, when the Soviet threat dominated American military thought, the Army leadership implemented a series of revolutionary training programs that began the demanding process of institutionalizing competence at the soldier, platoon, company and battalion levels by demonstrating in great detail what was required to be trained. Few American soldiers were untouched by the combat training center experience, the battle command training program and a host of other training initiatives. Al of these programs played a major role in shaping the Army that performed brilliantly during DESERT STORM 
22
Army training is in many ways still profoundly influenced by a philosophy of training that emerged in the 1970s and it contains tactical ideas and rests on assumptions about the contemporary Army that discourage improvisation in the face of diverse missions. In many ways, Army training continues to restrict the autonomy of subordinate officers and noncommissioned officers. 
23
On St. Valentine's Day 1943, 30,000 Americans confronted 11,000 Germans in combat for the first time during World War II at a place called Kasserine Pass in Tunisia. American and British Air Forces dominated the skies over North Africa. When the battle ended, the US II Corps had lost 183 tanks, 194 half-tracks, 208 artillery pieces, 512 trucks, and more supplies than existed in the all the depots in Algeria and Morocco and 20% of its strength or 6,300 troops. The British lost nearly a thousand men trying to prevent the collapse of the American front. In contrast, the Germans sustained only 989 casualties. 
24
The US II Corps Commander, Major General Lloyd R. Fredendall, was among the officers named in General George Marshall's letter to Eisenhower who had distinguished themselves as meticulous planners and expert trainers in the interwar period. In fact, MG Fredendall completed the General Staff College at Leavenworth as a "distinguished graduate." He later graduated from the Army War College and was promoted to Brigadier General relatively early by the standards of the day. 
25
26
The battle of Kasserine pass was very different from the fight at Oran. MG Harmon who played a key role in rescuing the III US Corps from total disaster at Kasserine and who later commanded the 1 st Armored Division prepared a report on the battle for General Marshall that addressed several problems. He noted that while American soldiers were well trained on an individual level, they were not trained to operate as cohesive teams. Consequently, German superiority in battle drill and teamwork were partly responsible for the American defeat. Too many American fighting formations were ad hoc organizations with the result that they were easy prey for more experienced and cohesive German units. Harmon also complained about the quality of battlefield leadership. He advised General Marshall that measures were needed to correct the leadership deficiencies that had contributed mightily to the defeat of American Forces:
We must be ruthless in weeding out and changing officers and men around so that the leaders are in positions of leadership and the others, regardless of their personal qualifications, are put elsewhere. Up to the time of battle itself, we are inclined to stress administration, paper work and tactical knowledge above the flare for leadership. In this we are wrong... A well trained and coordinated division and any unit, for that matter, works on the same principle as a championship football team. Each man must know his job, there must be perfect teamwork, and there must be good substitutes to replace injured men without weakening the team. There must be no favoritism, and selection must be ruthless.

As the experience at Kasserine demonstrated, great practical difficulties face the wartime commander who ignores the truth that warfare is really exploratory in nature and who develops a plan that restricts the tactical initiative of his subordinates in battle. The pressure exerted in war by technology pushes the human mind to the limit. Computers, satellites, electronically-collected and transmitted information makes more intelligence available to a commander at any level more than he can possibly digest in the time available. As time goes on, this will only get worse.
Army training within the framework of the Army's many warfighting simulations advocates thorough planning as the best solution to this problem. This involves exploring all of the contingencies, developing decision trees and execution matrices. But no amount of planning will confer on the commander the ability to foresee all of the contingencies, nor will the planning constructs abstracted from the battlefield before the battle begins ever coincide precisely with wartime conditions. Even when the enemy cooperates (and that is rare), the plan will always fall short because of limitations on the accuracy of data and time. Therefore, as much as the Army seeks to train commanders at all levels to plan well, the Army needs to induce leaders at every level to think quickly, adapt to changing circumstances and to junk plans that seldom survive contact with the enemy. Defeat in battle, stems more from the leader's failure to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances than from the failure to deliberately plan every action or the influence of new technology. This observation magnifies the importance of finding leaders who demonstrate in tough, realistic training that they are likely to excel in the chaotic environment of warfighting.
In the current training environment, the US Army spends lavishly for every brigade-size training rotation at the National Training Center. Although it is fair to say that the combat training centers provide rotational units with the most realistic peacetime training available, the "Kasserine-style" defeats sustained by many BLUEFOR (Blue Force) units are not encouraging. What is worse, however, is the "lose and learn" theory that is used to rationalize defeats. This mentality displaces winning as a worthy goal and is based on the assumption that objectively evaluating the performance of leaders in the field environment is neither possible nor desirable To the soldiers who fight the simulated battles, however, a win or a loss in training is described in absolute terms. It is to say, in paraphrase of Vince Lombardi's legendary dictum, that for our soldiers winning at the Training Centers isn't everything, it is the only thing that counts. For obvious reasons, a battalion or brigade commander is at his worst if he tells his soldiers at the end of a training rotation, "We trained safely and we learned a lot," when the soldiers know perfectly well that they were defeated in every encounter with the opposing force (OPFOR). The ordinary American soldier is exceptionally bright and has surprisingly good instincts for what is true and what is not. American soldiers instinctively grasp the fundamental fact of military life that in combat, winning is everything! Having said this, measuring the performance of units at a training center only on the basis of wins and losses against the OPFOR is risky It potentially misinterprets both the underlying purpose of the Army's training centers and the nature of the profession itself. The quality of the performance does count. But legitimizing repetitive losses by emphasizing the process at the expense of results is riskier. Nothing illustrates this better than the comments of Lieutenant General A. E. Percival when he attempted to explain his behavior in the face of Japanese attacks on Malaysia and Singapore after his release from Japanese confinement: "I had learnt on exercises we had held in England not to commit your reserve until you are quite sure you are dealing with the real thing."" Unfortunately for Percival, the Japanese attack was the real thing. Percival was physically brave, physically fit and a first-class staff officer. He was unassuming, considerate and conciliatory, with a good mind. But Percival was not a commander who would take risks, so he could not imagine that a potential enemy commander would do so. After the fall of Singapore to a Japanese force that was smaller than the British Army defending Singapore, the view was expressed by many British officers to Field Marshal Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, that "officers were being promoted to higher command because they were proficient in staff work-which was quite wrong-and urged that fewer mistakes of this nature should be made in the future."''

Tactical training which emphasizes speed of movement, simple rehearsed battle drills in response to predictable situations and rapid improvisation in the face of the unexpected is the first step toward preparing soldiers in peacetime for the conduct of dominating maneuver in wartime. Instead of reading about or being told that in war information is often confusing and conflicting, training must accustom leaders to work in this type of environment. The truth is that the maxims of war and regulations which set forth the rules of war go no deeper than the memory; "and in the excitement of battle the memory is useless; habit and instinct are alone to be relied on.'" 
6
It is also possible to create opportunities in the conduct of battles for the unit commander and his soldiers. If they seize these opportunities and win, the command climate, morale and training of the unit would appear to be in good shape. If, however, the soldiers and their leaders are paralyzed with the fear of failure induced by an oppressive or controlling commander who crushes initiative, then there is a problem/

The centrality of tactics and operational methods to future war has important implications for jointness. It is clearly not the individual weapons possessed by one side or the other that matter as much their effective integration and application in combat. Because technology is changing so rapidly, large-scale multi-service joint maneuvers must be held every three to five years in order to determine whether the forces are adequately trained and prepared to execute wartime missions. There is a tendency today to put too much faith in computer-based simulations that reduce warfare to a mathematically-driven process. Computer simulation is not enough. Human endurance, human intelligence and human skills must be tested to ensure that technology is not developing faster than the human mind can absorb it. Examining the performance of individual battalion-size fighting units is vital, but it will not suffice to prepare the nation's ground forces for warfare beyond the year 2000.
Of all the major powers between the World Wars, the US Army had the least effective approach to training for future conflict. Between World War I and 1941, the Army conducted no multidivisional maneuvers. The only place where American officers could even theoretically train for warfare with large units was in the war games of the one-year course at the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth. Truman Smith who had observed the German Army in the 1920s before attending the US Army Staff College, described Fort Leavenworth training as "archaic." According to Smith, Patton, Wood, Harmon and many subsequently famous wartime commanders, it was a concept of training that viewed future warfare as a series of mathematical formulas. 
41
Joint training exercises cost money. But Congress should not balk at a proposal to deploy 40,000 to 50,000 troops somewhere in the world every three to five years to guarantee that the Information Age Force does not end up like the interwar Army of the 1930s. Joint training involving three or more Combat Groups, Fighter Wings and off-shore Naval Forces must be planned and executed often enough to ensure that US Forces can still outpace prospective enemies to deter or win conflicts. There are other reasons for regular, joint training exercises. A JTF-based information age Army must actively cultivate informed and intelligent leadership at all levels. This is because "jointness" is really about both ends and means Thus, Army training in the context of joint operations should be a process of stressing the importance of strategic ends over the service operational and tactical means of achieving them. Though this observation may seem to be a self-evident truth to the civilian analyst or political appointee without military experience, it is not nearly so obvious to the professional military. Even in war, Service parochialism is seldom discarded. This was so much the case in World War II that Field Marshal Rommel felt compelled to address the issue in the context of German Army officer training:
The greatest efforts must be made in the field of training to counteract the separatist tendencies of the various services and arms of the services. It happens again and again that the air force or the army begins to play its own private political game. This struggling for power is rather like sawing off the branch on which one is sitting. One must be particularly vigilant to ensure that no kind of Corps ambition develops. Anything which may deflect from unity of purpose, from the will to pull together, must be utterly eradicated 
42
Military education in the General Staff Colleges and War Colleges of the armed services is designed to equip officers with the analytical tools to translate strategic goals into achievable military objectives along with the expertise to plan, move and employ forces to achieve these objectives. Thus, education is viewed in professional military circles as an essential feature of preparation for senior leadership. In this connection, one of the greatest advantages of a lean, JTF-based professional Army over a mass mobilization force should be its superior leadership. Anyone who has a modest appreciation what technical knowledge, what analytical insight, what disciplined mental faculties, what numerous military instruments manned by highly trained professional soldiers are necessary for the effective conduct of modern military operations, must admit that these qualities cannot be taken for granted. 
44

47
Making the military educational experience relevant to contemporary and future warfare is not easy either. Before his appointment as Chief of Staff in 1939, General Marshall felt strongly that the Army's educational institutions were dominated by concepts and thinking that were outmoded. Convinced that most decisions in battle must be taken swiftly, on minimal information, Marshall believed that military education ought to emphasize dealing with the unexpected and practicing the art of improvisation. "I found that the technique and practices developed at Benning and Leavenworth would practically halt the development of an open warfare situation, apparently requiring an armistice or some understanding with a complacent enemy." 
48
The situation today is not the same as it was in 1939. Funding for Joint training at the operational level is on the rise and all of the services have developed programs for advanced military studies. But there is room for more change with regard to the way officers are selected and prepared for further education as future senior leaders at the joint level. Today, the officer evaluation report is the only evaluative tool. One way to infuse military education with greater rigor would be to subject officers to written evaluation as a prerequisite for admission to the Army's General Staff College. A written examination would require officers in the grade of captain who have successfully completed company, battery or troop command to study the profession seriously. Under this system, any Captain having successfully completed command could take the examination on an annual basis until the officer met the examination criteria for entrance to the Staff College. Assuming that roughly 1500 or more Captains take the test in any given year, a qualifying test performance rate of 20% would result in the admission of 300+ students a year to the program. However, if after three attempts, the officer cannot meet these criteria, he should not be admitted and he should not be allowed to advance to positions of high command and influence in the profession of arms.
Skill in the operational art of joint warfighting demands that officers, read, study and think about warfare. In order to institutionalize excellence in the profession of arms above the tactical level, systematic operational studies impelled by meaningful evaluation are necessary. It is important that contemporary study at the General Staff College consist of serious and demanding work with an emphasis on understanding the operational situation and the military-political options in a variety of operational settings. Because this approach involves more than regurgitating Army-pure school solutions on multiple choice exams, the types of studies in operational art conducted at the Army's School for Advanced Military Studies may be a model for military educational experience throughout the system. 
49
50
Military educational institutions lost their monopoly as providers of professional military information and knowledge long ago. Had Marshall relied on the generation of officers who had thrived in the interwar environment of military education to win World War II, the war might have dragged on for years without result. 
51
52
53
Because some will still question the utility of higher civilian education as well as the wisdom of abolishing single service war colleges, it may be useful to illustrate these points with an example of what a difference careful selection for the right educational experience can make in the preparation of officers for operational command in war. One of the Second World War's most brilliant field commanders who demonstrated an exceptional appreciation for land warfare was an Air Force officer. He was Field Marshal Albert Kesselring. Kesselring, a German Air Force officer, commanded ground forces in the Italian campaign with far greater success than virtually all of the American and British Army Generals who fought against him. In fact, Kesselring's brilliance as a field commander contributed in no small way to the decision to abandon Churchill's plan for further attempts to strike at Germany through Northern Italy and Austria." For those with an interest in jointness, the question is how was a German Air Force officer able to successfully command all of those German Ground Forces?
In addition to Kesselring's natural ability as a commander and leader, one reason may be that Kesselring had a conceptual grasp of warfare that was widely understood by his contemporaries in the Army.

The Lieutenant Colonel level is the point at which most officers have served long enough to have an image of what they think warfare is really like. Because the Group structure eliminates the Colonel level command requirement from career progression, graduating Lieutenant Colonels can be assigned to joint headquarters while they await selection for further education and promotion to Colonel. Once selected, these same officers can complete further military and graduate education before returning to a Group where they can perform duties as Chiefs of Staff before competing for selection to Group Command. With the time to adequately prepare and educate themselves for command and staff work on the operational level, an exchange program that sends Army officers to the other services for twelve months could also operate successfully within this Group framework.
If the services do not move in this direction, however, then the turmoil surrounding which service gets to do what in every potential contingency will continue. Without the consensual support of the officers who must implement it, a joint warfighting doctrine on the operational level is unlikely to ever have much impact. 
62
To this point, the discussion about the role-of ground forces in the new strategic environment has been limited to warfighting, readiness, training and education. It is important to remember, however, that the entire system of Army Ground Forces-from the type of warfighting equipment procured through the Army's tactics and logistics-must be optimized for the new strategic environment too! In addition to selecting the correct wartime tactics and objectives for American soldiers, technological innovation can also protect soldiers from the effects of future conflict. Clearly, the effort to convert theoretical military capability into actual military power through force modernization is a complex challenge. Fortunately, the Army faces fewer constraints than say, the Navy which cannot quickly or inexpensively recapitalize itself with smaller, faster surface combatants.
In keeping with the principle that people, not things are decisive in war, the thinking behind force modernization must be to "equip the man; not man the equipment. " Frequently, the enthusiasm for new technology that promises a quantum leap in capability or the desire to prolong the life of equipment that is obsolescing quickly can lead to unnecessary expenditures.
Because the Department of Defense typically purchases in low volumes, with production stretched over many years, it cannot tap into cost savings achieved by economies of scale in the private sector.

Information is always an important feature of force protection as well as an important strategic goal in all future military operations. Digitization is in many ways the centerpiece of this effort. The concept involves embedding compatible digital communications to enhance horizontal efforts to acquire, exchange and exploit timely information in war. The MILSTAR satellite terminal will contribute to this effort by equipping ground forces with light weight, transportable, beyond the line of sight secure means of communication. As with many new technologies, its effectiveness will depend on how it is employed. For instance, not every armored fighting vehicle may need digitized communications. Ground and air reconnaissance elements, indirect fire and stand-off weapons need a secure means of digitally bursting vital information to higher headquarters or to adjacent units, but every tank commander clearly does not need to focus his attention on a computerized window displaying digitally transmitted information. The squad leader doesn't need to surf the internet, but he does need to know what is going on in his respective battlespace. Common, relevant battlespace is the key to implementing the Army's program for digitization.
Of the funds for the Department of Defense's top 20 modernization investment programs, the Army receives less than 8%, yet the Army 's inexpensive, broad-based approach to force modernization provides the nation with an enormous range of important future military options. Each of the Navy's top three procurement items-DDG51, FA 18E/F and the new Attack Submarine-equals more than two thirds of the Army's total acquisition budget. The Army's annual procurement budget is less than $5.4 billion a year. By any estimation, American Landpower is a bargain. In contrast to the tendency in the other services to invest heavily in "silver bullet" systems with a potentially fleeting value in the perpetual cycle of measures and counter-measures, America's Ground Forces are being equipped to confront an enemy with a variety of hedging requirements and dilemmas. The enemy's capacity to defeat one of several systems will be negated by his inability to cope with the synergistic effect of multiple threats. As mentioned before, the prinicipal challenge for the Army is reorganization; not expensive recapitalization.
Many of these thoughts are familiar points. The information revolution simply offers opportunities to affect the conduct of war by adopting new operational concepts and new organizational structures. Enabled by new information age organizations and technologies, the US Army can obtain substantial improvements in force effectiveness and adapt to a new strategic environment in which the Army can no longer rely on the "overwhelming force" paradigm. A precept of US military preparation for combat is that the US Armed Forces should train as they intend to fight. Still, the military continues to view future conflicts and contingencies from distinctly service-based, rather than joint, perspectives. 
73
Joint simultaneous attack is already enshrined in the context of joint doctrine. However, the importance of infiltration tactics on the operational level is neither widely discussed nor understood. Since the ground campaign during DESERT STORM was so short, the possibility that reorganization and retraining to fight differently in the future has been omitted from most doctrinal discussions. In this connection, control of the air in contemporary' concepts of future warfare has become synonomous with centralization of control over all land-based and sea-based deep strike assets in the hands of the JFACC. This approach does not admit the possibility that the success of future operations may depend on more than success in the preparatory phase outlined earlier or that aircraft will not "always get through." 
76
77
A joint doctrine for forced entry operations is beyond the compass of this work, but future doctrine in this area of military activity will require innovative thinking, leadership from the CJCS and time to develop. The proliferation of precision-guided missiles and weapons of mass destruction increase the probability that a future enemy will seek to eliminate an invasion force as it concentrates offshore or in a beachhead. Assuming that the Navy's large industrial age platforms survive the attacks of quiet diesel submarines as well as the barrage of cruise missiles that will be launched from land-based enemy ground and air forces, the troops who go ashore will confront strong defending enemy formations. Joint operations, however, that do not depend primarily on sea-based forces have a much greater chance of success.
The RMA trendlines urge the American military establishment to capitalize on the greatly enhanced capability of American Air, Ground and Special Operations Forces to strike in-land at points where the enemy's defenses are weak or very vulnerable. Critical port and airfield facilities can then be isolated, attacked and seized from the land more cheaply, efficiently and at less risk to American lives than from the sea. This will change the role of sea-based forces and necessitate a reexamination of the way sea-based forces are structured, trained and equipped to play their part in future forced entry operations. Ultimately, the realities of the RMA reinforce America's need for regional partners who can provide access without resort to potentially costly forced entry operations. To date, the United States has been both fortunate and wise in this regard America's alliance with pivotal states in regions of strategic interest have always provided America with a beachhead for American military power. The United States Armed Forces have not had to conduct forced entry operations from the sea since Inchon in 1950. As always, while the directions are clear and attractive, at least to some, the road ahead is still a rocky one.
The increased demands on human ability to direct complex military operations will not be met, however, through cybernetics and supercomputers. Simply assigning officers to joint staffs for two years will not produce "jointness." Experience and equipment will help, but these things are not enough. If jointness is equated with effectiveness and efficiency in warfighting, then advancement must be tied more closely to demonstrated proficiency and professional knowledge in the art of war. Leadership in war requires intelligence and character. When war breaks out, the forces with the largest number of these people in their senior ranks usually win. 
78
In his first year as Chief of Staff, the need for sweeping and immediate change compelled General Marshall to forcibly retire 500 General Officers and senior Colonels from the Regular .Army whose thinking and attitudes obstructed the organizational and doctrinal changes that were necessary to prepare the Army to fight in World War II.

And from time to time, a kind of affirmative action program on the Marshall model is needed to create a diversity of talent and ability in the senior ranks of the US Armed Forces. An example of this process is provided by Admiral Hyman Rickover in the US Navy of the 1950s. Rickover was an unusually intelligent man who had succeeded in irritating the Navy's leadership for years with his passion for nuclear power. When it became apparent that Captain Rickover was about to be passed over for promotion to Rear Admiral for the last time and forced into retirement, Congressional pressure was brought to bear on the Navy. Admiral Zumwalt recounts the incident in his memoirs: However, there was much sentiment in Congress that, with the new nuclear program in its infancy, Rickover's career should not end that early-a sentiment that many of us middle-grade officers shared, I must add. Evidently, the Secretary of the Navy, Robert B. Anderson, a very competent man, also shared it. Therefore, he included in his instructions to the 1953 selection board the requirement that it select for Rear Admiral one nuclear-qualifed EDO (engineering duty only) Captain. Since there was only one nuclear-qualified EDO Captain in the Navy at that time, and his name was Hyman Rickover, you can safely say that this requirement left little to the board's imagination.

Congressional leaders know that there are potential savings in the Pentagon's budget. Depending on where and what cuts in defense spending are made, the Congressional leadership is right. For leaders on the Senate and the House Armed Services Committees, then, the key questions are: What kind of defense spending should lawmakers scale back and how do they invest the funds that are left over? To find answers to these questions that will also serve the national interest, short-term political factors such as jobs tied to unneeded weapon systems must retreat before clear-eyed strategic assessments. l Military strategies should be considered first and foremost in terms of their performance and promise in safeguarding the nation's interests from external threats. In this regard, the previous chapter's conclusions raise important questions about the need to reorganize Army Ground Forces. To recognize that air and maritime forces cannot control events on land in areas of pivotal strategic interest without landpower is also to raise questions about means, effectiveness and consequences. These involve contentious issues that will inexorably move defense spending to the center of political debate in 1997.
In view of the material presented to this point, it should be possible to answer some of these questions. In a perfect world, a sober strategic assessment would throw the answers into sharp relief. Sadly, the task is not so easy. As mentioned earlier, elected representatives of both parties have come to equate the widely salted military manufacturing appropriations with local jobs, "from the vast aerospace plants of vote-rich California to the boatworks of Maine." 
2
And the Armed Services have been thoughtful and imaginative in the ways that defense contracts are spread across enough states to ensure political support for defense spending on the hill. For example, the success of the Air Force's new F22 fighter program rests solidly on a foundation that spreads R&D subcontracts to 1,150 companies, employing 15,000 people in 43 states and Puerto Rico. 
4
None of these points makes explaining the value of landpower to Congress any easier for the Army's senior leaders. All Army officers esteem the value of American air superiority in warfare and want to preserve it. There is not a single officer, noncommissioned officer or enlisted soldier in the Army who favors any policy that would degrade or undermine American control of the seas. Army officers are disinclined on the grounds of Army service culture to argue that the current level of defense expenditures on maritime forces or air forces are disproportionate to the nation's strategic needs. The fact that similar hesitance is seldom exhibited by Air Force, Naval, or Marine officers changes nothing in the Army's cultural attitudes toward the defense debate.
Yet, the Army must join this debate if the nation is to have the armed forces it will need in the 21st Century. The sharp increases in the number of operations involving Army Forces and the rapid and simultaneous drawdown of those same Army Forces makes public debate imperative. Defense spending has already fallen 35%, in real dollars, since 1985. The only question is how much further the defense budget will be reduced and what kind of force structure will emerge at the end of the process. For the Army, this means: (I) Illustrating the value of a new, reorganized information age Army in the context of the nation's evolving military strategy and the nation's need for economy; and, (2) Urging a new strategic focus for defense spending.
The central conclusion of this chapter is that reorganizing the Army's ten division force into twenty-six Combat Groups would produce savings exceeding $1 billion a year in operating and maintenance costs alone. Having said this, reorganizing the Army along the lines suggested in this work may not make much difference if the capital intensive search for single service "silver bullets" denudes the Army's capability to fulfill its critical national security role in the turbulent days ahead.
If a long-term military strategy to preserve American strategic dominance is to be realized, it seems prudent to accompany any recommendations for change in the warfighting structure with some recommendation for change in the way the forces are commanded. This is because, in theory, the pursuit of strategic dominance not only guides domestic economic policies as they relate to defense spending, it also shapes the American military force structure.

Goldwater-Nichols was fundamentally about rearranging power on the strategic level among institutions within the Department of Defense-namely, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Services, and the unified commands. 
7
In judging the results of the Goldwater-Nichols system, however, it is important to note the pressures of international and domestic change after 1989 which altered the climate for strategic decision-making. Few periods in American history present such a dramatic series of events or illustrate so well the problems of developing a coherent framework for strategic thinking as the interval between the disintegration of Russian power in Eastern Europe and the American military intervention in Haiti. New emerging missions obliged the national command authorities to reexamine America's military role in international order, to create a balance of military forces to discourage future aggression, and to wrest out of the chaos of international order some organizing principles which would ensure security.
Today, the challenge is no less daunting. In a world where new threats to American national security are emerging, it is more important than ever to rationalize the allocation of scarce economic resources to America's military establishment without putting American national security at serious risk. Because this effort involves the painful process of developing a national military strategy that does not emphasize types of armed forces independently of the criteria by which the potential warfighting utility of military power should be judged, the success of the process depends on extending the process of reform begun in Goldwater-Nichols. This process requires the same type of organizational thinking prevalent in the private sector that was addressed earlier in this work. This also means a return to the frontier of inter-service rivalry on a strategic level.
On the surface, the concept and practice of "Jointness" appears to be irrevocably established. But each service still writes its own budget and promotes its own officers. Fearing possible reductions in its force structure, each service strives to impart its unique perspectives to every joint military endeavor. An example is provided by the additional funding offered for anti-missile defense. Anti-missile defense is widely recognized as the top joint military priority for operational success in any future conflict. But theater missile defense means both financial resources and power to the services. Although the Army has developed and fielded the first anti-missile defense system in the form of the Patriot missile, the Air Force has responsibility for developing a joint system. At the same time, the Navy quickly marketed its Aegis-equipped destroyers and cruisers as a central component part of the anti-missile defense effort. 
10
The interest in anti-missile defense is justified. All of the services have a stake in anti-missile defense and each will play a critical role. But decisions to allocate funds should not become the object of inter-service competition. Attempts on the Joint Staff to dispassionately assess the immediate and long-term military value of weapons and forces in the context of national military strategy is consistently obstructed through a complex system of checks and balances that strongly favor the services. When attempts were made by the Joint Staff in January 1996 to examine the $214 billion in costs over the next decade for recapitalization of tactical aircraft, the Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force were able to stop them.

Founded in 1973 to develop virtually all of the Army's doctrine from the capstone manual, FM 100-5 Operations, to the lowest tactical publication, the US Army's Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) gave the Army a powerful integrating agency that made doctrine the engine that drove the Army. Until recently, doctrinal development in the Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps was more diffuse because doctrine tended to be more of a tangential concern in these services. 
15
16
Why not consolidate these organizations under joint leaders within the broad framework of the Joint Requirements Oversight Council? The United States Army's Training and Doctrine Command is located across the river from Norfolk at Fort Monroe, Virginia. The Naval Doctrine Command is in Norfolk and the Air Force Doctrine Center is nearby at Langley Air Force Base. Not only is it easier and cheaper to electronically link one unified Joint Training and Doctrine Command to the recently established Joint Warfighting Center at Fort Monroe, Virginia, it is also the only way to fundamentally change the shape of America's Ground, Air and Maritime Forces. Tactical doctrine will properly remain firmly in service hands. Service expertise will continue to play a key role in the debate about operational doctrine, but this organizational change will supplant the doctrinal interaction between the Services which frequently resembles a dialogue of the deaf. 
17
The Army Chief of Staff states that further reductions in the size and striking power of the Army would be antithetical to the national security interest and to the viability of the Army force structure. Today's 495,000 man force is smaller than the hollow army with which the United States began the Korean War. 
18
The history and origins of the Army National Guard are too well known to recount here, but the principal raison d'etre for the Guard can be traced to the Guard's Divisions.
These divisions saw extensive service in both wars and the casualties sustained by these units were very high.

As far as the Army National Guard elements not in the Strategic Reserve Corps are concerned, the nation's governors should have much more say concerning how these organizations are equipped and prepared for employment in their respective states. How much of this force should be federally funded is another matter for discussion between the governors and their legislative representatives in Congress. Much of the modernized combat equipment could be reallocated from these ARNG units to prepositioned sets afloat or ashore in the unified commands. In the new strategic environment, however, civil defense, border security and related internal security missions should not be overlooked in the context of missions for future Tier 3 ARNG forces.
The potential in this conceptual approach for the more efficient preparation of Army National Guard elements to closely cooperate and deploy with the Active Army calls to mind related programs in Israel where higher levels of combat readiness and proficiency exist in the reserve ground forces.

Second, all costs include military and civilian personnel. Personnel costs range from 52% of the total for aviation units to 62% fo the cost for armor and mechanized units. The civilian personnel cost is minor compared to the military personnel, but the civilian cost is an actual savings because the civilians go away with the elimination of the division structure. Third, the infrastructure costs and the cost of keeping Major Generals as post commanders except where corps/JTF Commanders are permanently stationed have been held constant. At those installations where division staffs are completely eliminated, those personnel spaces have been utilized elsewhere to fill out the fighting force. Fourth, at peak strength, this structure encompasses 130,000 (+) troops. The current ten division structure which is manned at a level below 100% contains 140,000 (+) troops.
Headquarters Realignment/Reorganization Finally, this is only a macro-level estimate and many details are not addressed. Efficiencies will be gained through on-going modernization. But far greater economies will be gained through the efficiency with which this alternative structure can be strategically deployed to meet contingencies in the new international security environment. For example, this proposed structure can deploy more than the combat capability associated with the Mobility Requirements Study Bottom-Up Review Update (MRS -BURU), 3 division equivalents in fewer than 30 days and a full corps in 75 days with at least 10% less strategic air and sea lift. This capability is achieved by creating more combat power from existing assets at lower levels in a warfighting configuration that supports rapid deployment. The Army's attack aviation community provides opportunities for similar change. In the proposed reorganization, the number of AH64-equipped battalions increases from 18 to 21. With the elimination of all Cobra AH1F airframes from the current inventory a process similar to what was described above in the context of the artillery could also begin within the Army's aviation community. In addition to the introduction of the RAH66, this analysis does not address the procurement of additional communications equipment, UAVs and Crusader (formerly the advanced field artillery system). In this connection, the proposal to compress the current corps support command from 22,000 troops to 15,000 troops is a function of reorganizing tactical logistics to confer greater independence on the Combat Group structure.
In sum, warfare evolves, technologies improve and exactly as was the case with the post-Napoleonic armies and the prewar German Army of World War II, steps can be taken to overcome human and technical limitations in order to adapt organizations for combat to the forces of change in military affairs. 
3j
The proposed structure also provides at least the same level of combat platforms as the existing divisional structure. The suggested mix of Combat Groups outlined in this work is only one option. Other mixes including more Recon-Strike and fewer Heavy Combat Groups are also possible. This is a matter that needs to be hammered out within the broader framework of the national military strategy before reorganization begins. In the current environment, the addition of another Airborne-Air Assault Group and the reduction of the Heavy Combat Groups in the United States from 12 to 11 would seem to be a viable alternative. However, defense planners should expect even greater combat power and capability to accrue within this new structure due to the enhanced integration of information technology, direct and indirect fire systems, and more robust and flexible C2. Because of its smaller size and modular character, the structure will probably also be easier and less expensive to modernize and modify in the years ahead as new technological capabilities enter the force. Although experience in the private sector suggests that organizational change produces monetary savings, the fact that organizational change in the Army will also save money is really a bonus.
American Airpower is the nation's most responsive and flexible military capability/

Air warfare is also that form of warfare most dependent on technology and the extraordinary costs of future high-tech systems place a tremendous fiscal burden on the Department of Defense. Procurement spending for new Air Force and Navy aircraft in the President's proposed 1997 budget accounts for more than 40% of the total budget for the top 20 Defense modernization programs budgeted from 1997 to 2001. The Air Force proposes to spend a total of $58.9 billion on aircraft modernization in the 97-01 Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP). 
36
In no area of defense spending is the cost explosion more evident than in the Air Force's plan to spend $86 billion (in constant FY 96 dollars) between 1996 and 2013 to buy 982 F-22 and Joint Aircraft Strike Technology (JAST) fighter aircraft. On average, the new fighters will cost $88 million per copy or 280% more than the $23 million per copy averaged between 1973 and 1990. As a result, total expenditures for new tactical fighters (F-22, Joint Strike Fighter, F/A 18-E/F) over the next 18 years will equal $169 billion, or only $9 billion less (in constant $) than the $160 billion spent between 1973-1990! Total "buy out" of all planned tactical aircraft will exceed $200 billion. 
38
39
The F22 was designed in the last years of the Cold War to achieve air superiority against a robust Soviet fighter threat. Today, most analysts discount the possibility that future adversaries will seek to match American Airpower in the context of air-to-air combat. Michael O'Hanlon, a Brookings analyst suggests that although the Eurofighter, Rafale, and advanced Russian programs could put improved aircraft into the hands of certain potential adversaries in the future, they are unlikely to exceed the capabilities of the US Air Force F15. For that matter, the platform is now much less important, while the quality of what it carries-sensors, munitions, and electronics of all kinds-has become critical. "A modernized 30 year-old aircraft armed with the latest long-range air-to-air missile, cued by an airborne warning plane, can defeat a craft a third its age but not so equipped or guided."
On the other hand, as illustrated in the 2003 scenario, widely exported Russian air defense systems are already being upgraded with West European microcircuitry and communications. Thus, all future aircraft-long-range bombers and fighters-will have to cope with much more serious air defense measures than was the case during the Gulf War. According to this line of thinking, the real balance of importance seems likely to be US attack aircraft capability versus the air defenses of potential regional adversaries,

The suppression or neutralization of enemy air defenses will require more effort from all of the services in the future. The experience with air defense suppression in the Gulf demonstrated that above 15,000 feet, every aircraft can become stealthy when the enemy's sophisticated anti-aircraft systems are put out of action. Because the electronic warfare tactics that worked so well against an rather unimaginative Iraqi enemy may not work as well in the future against more capable air defense technologies and more resourceful and intelligent enemies, the Army has a stake in these operations and can play a critical role. Army Ground Forces can strike enemy air defense targets with great certainty and precision with ATACMs. More important, the cost of purchasing ATACMs is relatively modest compared with the costs of most precision guided munitions. This is because the level of certainty associated with reaching and destroying the target with ATACMs is also much higher.

Hedging against future threats requires the United States to maintain selected, critical elements of combat power.

Almost all naval battles, throughout the history of war at sea, have been fought in close proximity to land. Even in the vastness of the Pacific in the Second World War, most encounters between fleets, or between fleets and maritime aircraft, took place close to the mainland, to large islands or to archipelagoes. The deep oceanic encounters-the battles of Midway and the Phillipine Sea-stand alone in terms of their distance from any considerable landmass at which they were fought.

54
Having watched plenty of World War II films and read some military history, most Americans understand that sea-based air forces were vital to America's offensive to gain control of the sea when the radius of attack for a fighter plane was a couple of hundred miles and the range of bombers was perhaps one or two thousand. These were the conditions in the Pacific during World War II when carriers operated as mobile airstrips. Today, conditions are different. Land-based air forces can now dominate large bodies of water. Coastal mines, cruise missiles, land-based fighters and quiet diesel submarines can severely limit the ability of American Naval Forces to operate close to shore. During Britain's war with Argentina in the Falkland Islands, the vulnerability of surface combatants in littoral waters to these new technologies was demonstrated when three Exocet missiles sank two British Warships and damaged a third. 
56
For reasons that have nothing to do with the superb fighting qualities of the forces involved, the results of forced entry operations from the sea with Marine amphibious forces in the straits of Hormuz, in the straits of Taiwan, or on the Korean coastline, could be disastrous. Other than the Royal Navy's experience with the exocet missile during the Falklands war, there are few historical analogies for the possible impact of cruise missile technology on future attempts at forced entry from the sea. However, the Navy's experience with Japanese Kamikaze assaults provides a glimpse of what could happen. In nine separate Japanese attacks (3,000 suicidal sorties) on US Marine Amphibious Forces and US Navy aircraft carriers between April 12 and April 13, 1945, Japanese manned "cruise missiles" netted a total of 21 US Ships sunk, 43 additional ships permanently out of action and 23 more ships out of action for a month or more. 
57
58
The current problem with mines in coastal waters is no less daunting. Forty-five years ago, during the Korean conflict, a planned amphibious landing at Wonson was stalled when it was discovered that the port had been heavily mined by North Korean fishing boats. The Navy's fleet admiral observed later: "We lost control of the seas to an enemy without a navy using World War I weapons employed from vessels that were built before the time of Christ." As the Navy found out in 1990 when an amphibious assault ship and a guided missile cruiser struck sea mines and retired with serious damage, not a heck of a lot had changed. Discussing the vulnerability of amphibious forces to mines, Marine Major General James L. Jones stated: "All it takes to panic a battlegroup is seeing somebody dropping a couple of 50 gallon drums into the water." 
59
The performance of sea-based air craft during DESERT STORM suggests that naval aviation is far less efficient than land-based aviation and that carriers have much lower sortie rates. 
61
62
63

The premise that sea-based operations are conducted independently is also misleading. During the Gulf War, the CVBG in the Red Sea depended heavily on the port cities of Jedda, Alexandria, Haifa and Augusta Bay for fuel, ordnance and supplies. In the Indian Ocean, US Naval Forces depended on ports and air fields in Diego Garcia, Manama and Dhahran. Without in-flight refueling from Air Force tankers, the CVBGs would have been unable to launch air strikes against any deep targets. In a more recent example, the USS Normandy (Aegis Cruiser-Ticonderoga Class) had to reposition from the Adriatic to Western Italy in order to reload missiles after launching strikes against targets in Bosnia. As a result, the ship was out of action for several days because a commercial port facility was required to reload missiles in the ship's vertical launch system tubes. All of these points suggest that if offensive air and strike operations can be carried out more cheaply and effectively by land-based airpower than sea-based airpower, reductions in spending for modernized sea-based aircraft should be considered before cutting funds for land-based airpower and tactical missile systems.
Finally, the most dramatic evidence for the unpromising military character of littoral warfare is found in the Navy's current argument for the construction of arsenal ships. Recognizing that surface combatants are unlikely to survive against the array of threats to Navy and Marine forces in littoral waters, the Navy proposes that the nation should fund the construction of "arsenal ships." In a proposal that contradicts some of the basic tenets of littoral warfare, the Navy insists that 25,000 ton arsenal ships should be built that can carry as many as a 1,000 precision guided missiles. This, the Navy argues, would allow arsenal ships to operate 500 to a 1,000 miles from shore. 
65
66
But maritime superiority in the new strategic environment does not have to mean that American sea-based forces must be omni-present on every ocean or always within reach of the enemy's land-based or littoral weapons. In the early phases of military operations on land near the open sea, Naval Forces in regions of pivotal strategic interest will continue to represent a critical mass of firepower and C4I. From the vantage point of defense planners, then, the key implications of the new strategic environment and new emerging technological capabilities within that environment suggest the following points:
• First, American control of the seas, though not currently challenged, must be maintained. Without control of the sea, no serious military operation to assist or support allies on the Eurasian landmass in areas of pivotal strategic interest is possible. Thus, funding for the maintenance of American sea control is not an option; it is a necessity.
• Second, the expense of insulating current and future US Naval Forces from future enemy reconnaissance and strike capabilities as well as insuring surface combatant survivability in the face of expanding shallow water threats-sea mines, cruise missiles and diesel attack submarines-is cost effective only if the commensurate advantage in sea-based offensive capability against land forces is attained. In other words, do not spend on sea-based platforms, if land-based aviation and ground forces can accomplish the same purspose more cheaply and efficiently. In fact, mission and burden allocation based on the idea of comparative advantage suggests a better solution to the problem of Air-Land-Sea cooperation than that currently offered in From the Sea.
On the one hand, the Navy should capitalize on its ability to launch cruise missiles like the Tomahawk against deep enemy targets that pose a serious threat to the security and survivability of air and ground forces ashore in a lodgment area. Conversely, deep enemy targets whose control may be critical to the overall war effort, but that do not threaten early entry forces in a lodgment area close to the sea should be left to land-based aviation and strike systems. 
69
On the other hand, the Congress should halt further investment in large-deck carriers or sophisticated sea-based aviation. By 1998, the United States Navy and Marine Corps will operate 23 world-class carriers. These will consist of 12 large deck (larger than 60,000 tons displacement) and 11 mid-size carriers (30,000-60,000 tons displacement). Each large deck carrier will be able to carry between 80 and 90 aircraft. There are currently nine Marine Corps mid-size carriers capable of fixed wing operations. Four Wasp class carriers will be comissioned by the end of FY98. Five Tarawa class carriers can carry approximately 6 AV-8Bs or 21 amphibious assault helicopters. There are four foreign mid-size carriers, one operated by Russia and three by France. This would suggest that no other state in the world sees the investment in carrier-based aviation as an essential feature of power projection capability.
Operating large deck carriers without an air wing or accompanying battlegroup to protect the carrier costs roughly 330 million dollars per year. Furthermore, periodic refueling of nuclear carriers represents a $3 billion deferred operations and maintenance bill. Over the future years defense program (FYDP), the bill for operating a single large deck carrier approaches 2 billion dollars! When the host of ships and aircraft that are designed to protect the carrier are added to the cost, the sum rises geometrically

This chapter began with two questions: (1) Where can Congressional leaders cut the defense budget; and, (2) What should Congress do with the funds that remain? When the principle of economy is applied to the development and use of military power for the future, the answer to the first question is a new mix of air-, land-and seapower. This mix is primarily an air-land structure with fewer sea-based air and sea-based landpower assets. The appropriate strategy, then, is neither purely continental nor purely maritime, but rather one of integrated air-, land-and seapower directed toward preserving sufficient landpower at home and in regions of pivotal strategic importance to exert influence and to deter or win regional conflicts quickly.
The answer to the second question is part of the larger question concerning whether a $60 billion procurement account will buy the forces necessary to recapitalize the Bottom-Up Review Force of 10 active Army Divisions, 11 active CVBGs and 13 active Air Force Wings?

82
< Assuming that the present trend towards regional strategies for the employment of conventional American military power within a joint framework continues, streamlining defense to cope with the alteration of traditional service missions and new technology seems unavoidable. The total savings from adopting the approach outlined here is nearly $150 billion. In a fiscally constrained environment, Congress will have to contemplate a much more efficient military capability with more emphasis placed on land-based air and ground forces. Judging from the US Navy's unchallenged position on the world's oceans, this reallocation of economic resources can also be achieved without jeopardizing American control of the seas. The nation does not need and cannot afford to maintain two more air forces as well as an amphibious army at sea. Salami slicing must end in favor of reform, reorganization and jointness.
Just as economic growth can be attempted in many different ways, armed conflict can be conducted in different ways. A US defense strategy in which land-based aircraft and other non-carrier-based resources are efficiently utilized would allow the Navy to secure the sea-lanes with as few as nine or seven carriers. Carrier-based fleets and large amphibious forces are no bargain in a strategic environment where their orientation is anachronistic.

Savings from the cancellation of programs to recapitalize old structures and privatization programs can also be applied to more pressing and strategically critical programs like theater ballistic missile defense.

Stephen T. Hosmer, Effects of the Coalition Ar Campaign Against Iraqi Ground Forces in the Gulf War. MR-305-AF, Rand, 1994, p. 58. The Gulf War Ar Power Study noted that of 163 Iraqi tanks examined by battlefield analysis groups, between 10% and 20% had been struck by air-delivered munitions. According to Stephen T. Hosmer, the three Republican Guard Division in the Kuwait Theater of Operations as of 1 March 1991 left behind in their prewar deployment areas 166 tanks, 203 Armored Personnel Carriers (APCs) and 99 artillery pieces. As percentages of prewar deployment totals, these amounted to losses of 21% tanks (n=786), 28% APCs (736), and 32% artillery (308). that: "In any but the most minor conflict, 30-40 attack airplanes per carrier, using the simple ballistic weapons that currently constitute the bulk of our air-delivered weapon inventory, can do little damage to the opposing target complex unless they revisit it many times, with cumulative attrition that could be fatal in the case of adequate enemy defenses. In present circumstances, the carrier is therefore at risk for periods that are too long, the attack aircraft are likely to be lost to target area defenses before their mission is completed, and the political consequences of long war and collateral non-tactical damage are likely to be severe."

For the American people, the future challenge in foreign policy will be to create an international order in which change can be brought about through a sense of obligation and justice, instead of an assertion of power.

Comprehending the role of landpower in future American military strategy demands an understanding of what airpower and seapower cannot achieve on their own. In the turbulent years that lie ahead, the United States cannot afford to repeat Britain's historic mistake of always fielding an army too late to deter war, but just in time to avoid defeat.

Combat is still the coin of war. It is, as Clausewitz observed "what cash payment is to commerce " 6 It may be rare in day-to-day transaction, but confidence in its resort is the foundation of all calculations. Demonstrable combat capability, like bank cash reserves, gives confidence to others that should the resort to "coin" be required, America will redeem its pledge. For this reason, deterrence will continue to be in the eye of the beholder. Forward-stationed US Army Ground Forces will have to provide both the link to America's strategic offensive military power and the foundation for American-led alliances. The good news is that fewer forces will be needed to deter armed aggression provided that an adequate mix of prepositioned equipment ashore and afloat is on hand in areas of strategic importance. However, only combat forces-in-being on hand at the beginning of a crisis are likely to have much deterrent effect upon future adversaries. In fact, when US Army Ground Forces are already positioned in a region, it may not be necessary to fight at all because signaling the intention to fight is frequently enough to so weaken the opponent's resolve that he may never strike.

Exploiting the value of landpower on the Roman model in contemporary American military strategy involves understanding change in military affairs. Recognizing the degree to which the conquest of time and space by revolutionary technology has already changed the way the United States Army must organize, train and prepare to fight is part of this understanding. This is what is meant by "breaking the phalanx." Trained and organized for a style of war that has changed very little since World War II, current Army organizational structures will limit the control and exploitation of superior military technology and human potential in future operations. Attempts to graft large-scale technological change onto old thinking and old structures can only be a temporary expedient; new capabilities demand their own organizations and operational culture. Along the way, new organizations-not just technology-will revolutionize warfighting.
After a reign of almost two centuries, the age of mass mobilization armies manned by short-service consripts or part-time volunteers is truly at an end. 
9
These views are based on the assumption that future combat operations involving American Ground Forces will, of necessity, be rapid and intense, that they will take place over extended frontages and depths, and that ground combat formations smaller than the contemporary Army division will have to operate independently for long periods. Under these conditions, the potential advantages of revolutionary change in warfare must be exploited at lower levels of command than was the case in either World War II or in the years since 1945. Rapid deployability and reduced demand for elaborate logistic support combined with the need to link multi-service capabilities to Army Ground Forces positions Joint command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance at the heart of this organizational effort. In this connection, the real promise of information age warfare is not that it will enable the centralization of decisionmaking and the exercise of increased control, but rather that it will liberate the initiative of junior officers and noncommissioned officers to perform independently and synergystically within the operational and strategic commanders' intents.
History is filled with military victories not of resources, but of strategic doctrine based on the ability to "break the framework which had come to be taken for granted and to make victory all the more complete by confronting the antagonist with contingencies which he had never even considered."

Other Army critics of the changes proposed in this work will argue for the continued retention of branch-pure combat units-tank battalions, artillery brigades, aviation brigades, signal brigades-on the grounds that these organizations can be taskorganized, broken up or combined with each other as necessary before deploying to combat. But this approach ignores the need to reduce unneeded headquarters as well as to create higher levels of battlegroup cohesion and training readiness in future Joint warfighting. The strategic value of American Landpower rests on tactical proficiency at the "point of the spear " Soldiers and organizations will do in war what they do in peacetime. Tactical organizations that have not lived and trained together before they deploy, cannot be transformed overnight on the basis of a single exercise into a fighting force that will stand up to future adversaries that are potentially much more capable than the Iraqis. 
23
The proposals set forth in this work to posture the Army to execute dominating maneuver in the 21st Century may require the modest reallocation of funds within the defense budget. This will not be an easy task given the propensity to allocate funds on the basis of historical precedent instead of holistically validated requirements. Power, it is said, is a zero sum game and as this statement relates to defense spending nobody in the Penatagon wants to lose anything. Paul Nitze's 1979 observation still applies: "Ship types which have, by virtue of long existence, a substantial constituency behind them continue to appear in budgets, even when their continued utility is openly doubted both outside and within the service. New threats which promise to render cherished practices or systems unviable are ignored."

Like some of their predecessors, today's policymakers still embrace grand objectives in the world, but overlook the need for landpower to achieve them. Expanding the NATO alliance to include Poland is a case in point. The real question is not whether Poland should be admitted to NA TO, but how NA TO will defend Poland? Unless large US and allied ground forces can be committed quickly to Poland's Eastern frontier in a future regional crisis, any NATO security guarantee to Poland based on US and allied airpower means little more than that the United States and NATO will have to fight to restore Poland's independence after the Russian Army overruns it! Yet, has the US Congress seriously examined the requirement to increase the striking power of the US Army in Europe to cope with this possibility? 
27
28
29
With fewer troops and more missions than ever, today's US Army is compelled to demand more of its smaller forces with the result that soldiers and their equipment are being worn out. Because landpower is the glue that holds alliances together, Army Forces are engaged in peace support operations as well as enlargement and engagement activities at a much higher rate than the USAF, USN and USMC Forces. At this writing, 40% of the Army's combat troops are forward deployed. At the same time, less than 12% of the contemporary defense funds allocated to research and development are for Army programs. While operations and maintenance accounts are robbed to pay for contingency operations in peripheral areas, modernization is slowing/ 0 A decline in the retention of the nation's most skilled and capable soldiers resulting in higher workloads for the soldiers who remain is accompanying the declining defense budget.
In spite of these points, Americans remain convinced with considerable justification that their armed forces are the best in the world. Victory in the fight with Iraq continues to provide more than adequate justification for preserving the American military status quo which, with its few faults, still performs brilliantly even under the adverse conditions of Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia. But this static and uncritical view of militaryaffairs is deceptive and potentially dangerous. Constrained defense budgets, technological change and new emerging centers of power cannot be ignored in the context of either national military strategy or force development. When they are, the results are tragic.
In his book, The Franco-Prussian War. Michael Howard explores the reasons for the disastrous defeat of the French Army, widely considered the best in the world in 1870, in France's war with Prussia. By the standards of its past campaigns, the French Army was ready for war in 1870. By 1860, the French military establishment had been victorious in battle against two of its chief European adversaries, Russia and Austria. Inadequate as French military logistics, administration, leadership, training and organization may have been, that of the Russians and the Austrians was demonstrably worse. Consequently, the French Army of 1870 was ready to fight successfully, but only against armies constituted and trained like itself or against ill-equipped, second rate military opponents like the Mexicans or the Berbers. It was the tragedy of the French Army and of the French people that they did not realize in time that military affairs had entered into a new age. "The lines of French military organization had to be drawn within the narrow limits of what was politically possible for a people which grudged every penny spent on the Army, distrusted its own rulers and was deeply divided in itself."

Still, defense spending competes with other national priorities. An American Congress that is trying to balance reductions in deficit spending against the American public's insatiable appetite for government services must not fall victim to the delusion that a pattern of military success was revealed in the Gulf War which, if only faithfully pursued, will assure even a distant future. 
34
Clearly, the US and its military approaches this task with a certain disadvantage Typically, the vanguard elements of RMAs have been armed forces unfettered by the legacy of recent victory. Defeated armies find their way into the future more easily because for them the past holds no allure. Recent victors are always hostage to their successes, revering and holding tenaciously to what they know. These thoughts were probably on the mind of LTG James Gavin (WW II 82nd Airborne Commander) when he wrote the following words about the US Army's Korean War experience: "If we had had the vision to see, and the courage to venture in our research and development programs, we could have had a tactical mobility in Korea that would have enabled us to run circles around our opponents Neither our imagination nor vision in the years since World War II had given us a combat capability that would provide the technical margin of advantage that we needed in land warfare to win decisively and quickly."

Dr. John J. Midgley, Jr., Deadly Illusions: Army Policy for the Nuclear Battlefield, p. 69. The author writes: "Within a month after approving the Pentomic division structure as an organizational concept, General Taylor directed Continental Army Command to prepare advance plans for the reorganization of the infantry and armored divisions. The designs of the revised divisions and the tactical doctrine they were to apply, reflected compromises among the Pentomic Concept and the desires of the service schools. As the new divisions took shape it was clear that the overriding consideration in their design was austerity, rather than nuclear operations."

Binford Peay, III, "The Five Pillars of Peace in the Central Region," Joint Force Quarterly. Autumn 1995, pp. 31-33. General Peay discusses his activities in connection with C4I upgrades and reorganizations that have improved the JFACC's C2 of sea-based and land-based aviation platforms in war. Many of these initiatives are worthy of closer examination in the context of JTF C4I.
The warfighting CINC could do this by appointing the Army's deployable JFLCC as his deputy. This would preserve the C4I advantage of maintaining the Army's JFLCC.

What forces remain in the United States and are not already assigned in the course of the readiness cycles to USEUCOM, USPACOM-USFK/CFC, USCENTCOM or USSOUTHCOM consist of what are effectively "swing assets." * This simply means that these elements can be swung to any theater of conflict as part of an existing JTF or as part of a second corps-based JTF if that becomes necessary. These are the combat power multipliers-rocket artillery, attack helicopter and anti-missile defense forces that can be plugged into any JTF.

COMBAT GROUP UNITS (Ground) 
The transition costs associated with disestablishing division structures are also not included in this analysis. However, based on recent experience, division deactivation costs generally do not exceed the annual operating cost for an existing division. Thus, the Army should be able to disestablish two or three divisions a year without jeopardizing the overall readiness of the total force. This does not mean ending the association of the Combat Groups with the Army's historic division organizations. For instance, two Heavy Combat Groups stationed at Fort Riley would continue to wear the Big Red One Patch and could even be designated Combat Command A and Combat Command B, 1st Infantry Division, (Mechanized). However, when these Combat Groups deploy in peace or war, they deploy and operate under the command and control of standing JTF Headquarters in one of the Unified Commands as outlined in Chapter VI.
Other Group structures at echelons above the Combat Groups referred to in Chapter IV were not considered in this economic analysis. It seems reasonable to assume, however, that the process of reorganization and consolidation applied to the ten divisions could be applied at the corps and theater/field army levels with similar results. Experience with consolidation and reorganization in the private sector would lend support to this view." The Army has begun to add more MLRS to its inventory and plans to place one battalion of MLRS in each division. Under the proposed redesign, the Army's indirect fire capability expands to (55) MLRS batteries. Currently, the Army maintains the equivalent of (
