The pro-Russian blog Stalkerzone.org is also "not directly funded by the Kremlin," but is "run by Oleg Tsarov, a pro-Russian separatist in eastern Ukraine" (Bret Schafer, View from the Digital Trenches-Lessons from Year One of Hamilton 68, Washington, D.C.: The German Marshall Fund of the United States, November 19, 2018, p. 9).
