First, we learn that allies require substantial care and feeding, particularly in the years before their aid is actually needed.
As Geoffrey Wawro reminds us in his essay: By July 1870, the French were well aware that they were on the verge of a major war with Prussia, yet the French foreign ministry under the Duc de Gramont made no effort to pursue alliance strategies that might have given France an overpowering hand.
Gramont merely assumed that the Austrians would intervene in any Franco-Prussian conflict "to erase the memories of 1866."
He also assumed that the Italians would join the war to show their gratitude for French assistance in the war of 1859 (and he assumed that the Austrians would permit an Italian army to cross their territory to join the war against Prussia.)
Further, he was convinced that the Danes would join the war to take back Schleswig, seized by the Prussians in 1864.
