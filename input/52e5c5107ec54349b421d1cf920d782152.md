Over the next 30 years, a number of novel weapon technologies could proliferate across future battlefields.
In addition to technologies that are currently under development, such as nonlethal weapons and directed energy systems, a number of nations are investing in anti-access area denial (A2AD) technologies that could significantly impact the United States Army's ability to maneuver freely through future operating environments.
Emerging A2AD technologies include anti-ship ballistic missiles; precision guided antivehicle and anti-personnel munitions; counter rocket, artillery, and mortar (CRAM) systems, anti-satellite weapons; and electromagnetic pulse (EMP) systems.
Some of these technologies, such as precision-guided munitions, will reflect innovation based on existing technologies.
For example, China is developing advanced anti-ship ballistic missiles that have the potential to destroy aircraft carriers.
Other technologies will reflect entirely new concepts, such as the self-guided bullet demonstrated by DARPA in 2015 as part of its Extreme Accuracy Tasked Ordnance (EXACTO) program.
As China, Russia, and other nations make larger investments in military modernization the U.S. is likely to face adversaries with capabilities that approach, and in certain cases possibly exceed, our own.
