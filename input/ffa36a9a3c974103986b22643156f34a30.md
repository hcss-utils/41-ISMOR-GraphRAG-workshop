In addition to enhanced security at home and resurging influence abroad, Russia uses information warfare to back short-term political objectives, like the swift annexation of Crimea and the destabilization of Ukraine.
In these actions, Russia secured permanent and unfettered access to the Black Sea Fleet at Sevastopol and temporarily derailed Ukraine's deepening economic and political ties with the European Union.
Information warfare presented the conflict environment in a way that increased ambiguity and hid evidence of direct Russian involvement.
