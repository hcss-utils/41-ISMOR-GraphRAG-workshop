By the time of its 2014 incursion into Crimea, Ukraine, Russia had regained a significant portion of the military power it lost after the fall of the Soviet Union, reemerging as a perceived threat to democracy.
It soon became clear that Russia had broader interests than Europe-and perhaps a capacity to realize wider-ranging military objectives.
Since the mid-2000s, Russia has been quietly accelerating its global engagements and has, more recently, increased its interests in Venezuela, various African states, and Asia.
These developments have spurred renewed interest in Russian capabilities in the analytic community.
