NSGC specializes in qualitative policy games because, for this level of analysis, where problems are often ill defined, choices unclear, information incomplete, but decisions still urgent, these games yield educational and analytical benefits.
For the lineup of topics we'll tackle this year-Darfur, Afghanistan-Pakistan, energy security, and Russia-these games are an excellent way to frame problems, accessible to audiences ranging from Members of Congress to senior military officers and civil servants.
