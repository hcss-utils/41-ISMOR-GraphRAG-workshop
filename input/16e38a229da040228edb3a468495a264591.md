The vitriol of Moscow's propaganda efforts to portray the Kiev government as a Nazi junta and Kiev's designation of all separatists as "terrorists" will make Ukrainian reassertion of governance over the rebel held region problematic.
Reuniting with the entirety of Donbas is already a political issue in Kiev that will affect voter sentiment and drive politics, while taking priority away from other issues like properly addressing corruption and diversifying the national energy resources.
These vulnerabilities will leave space for Russia to continue to exert coercive influence.
Future regional and national elections will also undoubtedly be contested as so many of the Donbas region's residents are displaced.
Ukraine has to take control over its border with Russia if it is to reassume a semblance of sovereignty, which Russia has demonstrably proven it is determined to undermine.
Russia will continue to interfere with Kiev's ability to govern in the east, only now, Russia's means include a heavily armed population that has been forced to pick a side in an manufactured conflict, an unknown number of displaced Russo-Ukrainians in Russia with claims to property and political participation in Ukraine, and a border between the two entities that Russia will not relinquish to Kiev.
