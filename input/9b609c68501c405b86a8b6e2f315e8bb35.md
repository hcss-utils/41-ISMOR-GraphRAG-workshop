It is assumed that the warfighting systems and supporting capabilities in this section remain relatively constant over ten years.
Further, those capabilities can exert their influence over multiple extended battlefields, the assessment of which then moves from the purely tactical to that of the operational.
Since current and future pacing capabilities are discussed, the classified nature of the material inhibits a full understanding.
Any system or capability details that China and Russia release to the public should be consumed with partial skepticism, considering many of the same capabilities are also available for export.
Using China and Russia as pacing guides, this section attempts to objectively understand threat effects into the 25-kilometer lethal area by discovering their general warfighting methods and the current/future capabilities which support it.
