The rotational nature of national contingent deployments under enhanced air policing missions (since 2014) and EFP (since 2017) present some challenges for data analysis, but we found that, of 21 non-U.S. troop-contributing nations providing some 2,000-5,000 foreign-deployed troops, 11 qualified as major contributors based on troop size deployments (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom); six relatively smaller contributors barely missed the major contributor size threshold (Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia); and four other token partners have provided fewer than 100 troops at any given time (Albania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, and Slovenia).
Although we simultaneously consider the 20,000-to 30,000-strong forward-deployed U.S. footprint deployed under bilateral basing agreements in Europe as part of the coalition effort to deter Russia, we note that the narrower U.S. contribution to EFP and air policing has been one of relative parity, especially compared with most U.S. coalition experiences (Figure
