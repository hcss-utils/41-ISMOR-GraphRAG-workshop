Russia's use of hybrid warfare exhibited during its 2014 invasion of Ukraine is an evolution of Russian warfare that can be traced back to the establishment of the Soviet Union.
In particular, Russia's use of information operations to gain a strategic advantage over its adversaries has become the cornerstone of its hybrid military operations.
James Sherr finds that "today's Russian state has inherited a culture of influence deriving from the Soviet and Tsarist past . . .
it bears the imprint of doctrines, disciplines and habits acquired over a considerable period of time in relations with subjects, clients and independent states."
