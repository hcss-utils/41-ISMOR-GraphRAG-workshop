Training of Russian artillery soldiers focuses on the ZAPAD exercise in 1999 and how it has translated into new best practices and TTPs.
Furthermore, an analysis of what training followed due to lessons learned through Russia's conflicts in Chechnya, Georgia, and Ukraine demonstrate where Russia found gaps in their soldier's abilities to use artillery to overwhelm their enemy.
