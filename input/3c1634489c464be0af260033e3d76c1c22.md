Established powers like China and Russia are turning more and more to legal, cyber, and political warfare and the use of proxy forces to avoid direct attribution and military confrontation with the US.
Meanwhile, non-state actors take advantage of cheap, lethal technologies to empower resistant and insurgent movements, and exploit regions with relative instability.
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton observed that for this type of environment, "we need Special Operations Forces who are as comfortable drinking tea with tribal leaders as raiding a terrorist compound.
We also need diplomats and development experts who understand modern warfare and are up to the job of being your partners."
