Traditionally the American people have considered the Army as the military force that fights and wins the nation's big, conventional, land wars. This view has persevered despite a long Army history of involvement in "small wars," peacekeeping operations and nation-building missions. In fact, throughout the history of the United States, the Army has spent far less time fighting declared wars involving major combat operations between states than it has conducting irregular wars or supporting other nonwarfighting operations. Though there is some disagreement between military historians and commentators as to which American conflicts to refer to as "war," there is near unanimous agreement that the United States has spent exponentially more time conducting operations other than war than it has fighting in sustained combat, against conventional, state sponsored, military forces.

Field Manual (FM) 3.0: Operations, for example, explicitly denotes fighting and winning the nations wars as the Army's primary task; "fighting and winning the nation's wars is the foundation of Army service-the Army's non-negotiable contract with the American people and its enduring obligation to the nation." 4 "At the direction of the President, U.S. forces will be capable of decisively defeating an adversary in one of the two theaters in which U.S. forces are conducting major combat operations by imposing America's will and removing any future threat it could pose. This capability will include the ability to occupy territory or set the conditions for a regime change if so directed."
Similarly, language in the 2001 Quadrennial Defense Review further defines the Army's responsibilities with respect to winning the nation's wars by stating, Department of Defense Directive 3000.05 marked a significant change in course for the United States Army with which it is still struggling to come to grips. In effect, the Army was told to adjust its institutional bias of focusing almost exclusively on major combat operations, and to begin giving at least equal footing to stability operations. Since that time, and in light of ongoing stability operations in Iraq and Afghanistan that continue to consume the majority of the Army's intellectual, financial and temporal resources, the Army has struggled to balance these tasks. Some, including current and former Army brigade and division commanders, argue that because of the current emphasis on stability operations there is a growing degradation of core warfighting skills that threaten to leave the Army and nation at risk in future conflicts. These pundits argue for a quick return to a more traditional focus on major combat operation skills.
The conundrum of balancing MCO and SO tasks is recognized at the most senior levels of the U.S. Army. The Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Casey, recently stated, "You have no doubt observed that over the past several years we have been embroiled in a rather awkward argument about whether our Army should be optimized for irregular threats or for major combat." 
7
He made these comments in prepared remarks when addressing senior leaders of the United Kingdom's Ministry of Defense in the summer of 2010. In this statement, General Casey acknowledged and articulated the precise issue this monograph will address-whether the Army should be optimized to fight irregular threats or for major combat. The relevance and importance of this debate is given further emphasis by a myriad of Army senior leaders who are having to set priorities and develop future capabilities to posture the Army for success. 8 7 General George Casey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, "The Failure of Imagination" (lecture,  Kermit Roosevelt Lecture Series, England, 2010).

The paper is broadly organized into three sections; the environment, the problem and the solution. As part of the problem frame, two case studies will be presented in order to provide context and relevance to the problem.
Section one, the environment, will examine and define doctrinal terms in order to set a common baseline for further discussion. It will also include a review of likely future threats and environments/conditions in which the Army will have to fight. Finally, the environmental section will conclude by providing evidence of weakening major combat operation skills that used to represent the core competencies of the Army's general-purpose forces. Other factors, such as future budgetary constraints and reductions in troop levels are outside the purview of this paper, but will be referenced to provide context. The fact that allied nations have already begun to slash defense budgets, and that future cuts to U.S. defense spending and troop levels have been announced, adds a sense of urgency to the debate on prioritizing the military missions.

Finally, the chapters of the solution frame will provide conclusions and recommendations supporting the thesis that preparing for major combat operations is more of a priority to the Army's general-purpose forces than preparing for stability operations given the likely future operating environment.
Before properly understanding the problem, it is important to understand the environment in which the Army is now operating and will most likely operate in the future. For the purposes of this paper, the factors that comprise that environment are the current and future enemy threats and likely battlefield conditions that affect how the Army fights now and in the future. Fortunately there is more agreement than disagreement on the type of threats facing the Army as well as general agreement on the operating environment. These factors are discussed in detail in the Army capstone doctrinal manuals FM 1-0 and 3-0, as well as in the various national security documents and contemporary books, studies and articles. The nature of the future threat and operating environment is reviewed in chapter one below.
There is also growing agreement that the Army's combat skills have atrophied as a result of nine years focusing on counterinsurgency and counterterrorism tasks in Iraq and Afghanistan. This view has been voiced publicly in writing by former brigade commanders, is generally regarded as fact by Army senior leaders, and is detailed in Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) commissioned studies on trends at the Army's Combat Training Centers. These atrophied skills are outlined in chapter four.
The area least agreed upon or understood relative to the thesis presented in this monograph is the language and terms used to discuss the problem. The terms "major combat operations" and "stability operations" for example are widely mis-associated and difficult to compare directly without clarification.
Major combat operations is doctrinally one of the Army's operational themes. Stability operations is one of the four elements of full spectrum operations (FSO) alongside offense, defense and civil support operations. Because these two terms are central to the thesis of this paper, meaningful debate requires a comprehensive review and definitive delineation of terms. Another example of confused use of terms is the use of the acronym "COIN," referring to Counter Insurgency Operations. COIN is often used synonymously with or as a subset of stability operations. Army leaders frequently make statements such Statements such as these are misleading because counterinsurgency operations by definition are full spectrum operations. "All full spectrum operations executed overseas-including COIN operations-include offensive, defensive, and stability operations that commanders combine to achieve the desired end state." 
12
In the 2001 version of the Army's operations manual, FM 3-0, the Army officially institutionalized the term full spectrum operations as the operational construct to describe how it would succeed across a spectrum of conflict that included everything from peacekeeping operations to general war. The introduction to the 2008 version of FM 3-0 described the change this way: "The Army established full spectrum operations in FM 3-0 (2001), shifting sharply from an 'either-or' view of combat and other operations to an inclusive doctrine that emphasized the essentiality of nonlethal actions with combat actions." 
13
Offensive, defensive, stability and/or support operations were conducted as needed to achieve success. However, while the Army recognized the need to operate across the spectrum of conflict, its priorities remained preparing for and winning ground combat as reflected throughout the manual with statements like:
. . . Commanders focus their METL, training time, and resources on combat tasks unless directed otherwise. 
14
During the Cold War, Army forces prepared to fight and win against a near-peer competitor. The army's training focus was on offensive and defensive operations in major combat operations. As recently as 2001, the Army believed that forces trained to conduct the offense and defense in major combat operations could conduct stability and civil support operations effectively. 
15
16
17
Army doctrine now equally weights tasks dealing with the population-stability or civil support-with those related to offensive and defensive operations. . . .this parity is critical. . . . . . .operational experience demonstrates that forces trained exclusively for offensive and defensive tasks are not as proficient at stability tasks as those trained specifically for stability. For maximum effectiveness, stability and civil support tasks require dedicated training, similar to training for offensive and defensive tasks. 
18
Winning battles and engagements is important but alone may not be decisive.
Shaping civil conditions (in concert with civilian organizations, civil authorities, and multinati0nal forces) is just as important to campaign success. In many joint operations, stability or civil support are often more important than the offense and defense. 
19

25
war is included as a co-equal subset of that spectrum as opposed to the dominant one. To help the Army communicate how these operations inter-relate, FM 3-0 describes operational themes and corresponding operations and then super-imposes them over the spectrum of conflict. The charts from FM 3-0 below illustrate the construct. The first chart denotes the operational themes and the second outlines where the operational themes fit within the spectrum of conflict. 
26
27
The expanded definition of MCO reads; 27 Ibid., 2-13. and the terrain objectives seized or secured. Major combat operations are the operational theme for which doctrine, including the principles of war, was originally developed. 
28
Major combat operations often include combat between the uniformed armed forces of nationstates. Even then, these operations tend to blur with other operational themes. For example, in Vietnam both the United States and North Vietnam deployed their national armed forces and, although major battles occurred, the United States characterized much of the war as counterinsurgency. 
29
Full spectrum operations is the Army's operational concept and is defined in FM 3-0 as; "Army forces combine offensive, defensive, and stability or civil support operations simultaneously as part of an interdependent joint force to seize, retain, and exploit the initiative, accepting prudent risk to create opportunities to achieve decisive results." It further states that "the mission determines the weight of the elements."

31
Stability operations encompass various military missions, tasks, and activities conducted outside the United States in coordination with other instruments of national power to maintain or reestablish a safe and secure environment, provide essential governmental services, emergency infrastructure reconstruction, and humanitarian relief (JP 3-0). 
32
35
Curiously, the Army includes defeating external threats as one of its primary missions within the civil security task. This is where the definition of stability operations and its relation to the operational themes, particularly major combat operations, becomes confusing.
Defeating external threats implies conducting offensive and defensive operations (i.e. major combat operations). If that is the case, then major combat operations becomes a subset of the civil security task within stability operations. More confusing is the statement in paragraph 3-74, on the same page of FM 3-0 as the definition of civil security, which states "stability operations require the absence of major threats 32 Ibid., 3-12 33 Ibid., 3-12. 
34
35
Army, FM 3-0 (2008), 3-13. 36 Ibid., 3-13.
37
Again, this is contradictory with other parts of the manual which calls for the conduct of simultaneous offense, defense and stability operations.
Division and higher echelon operations normally combine three elements simultaneously. Brigade combat teams may focus exclusively on a single element when attacking or defending, shifting priority to another element as the plan or situation requires. Battalion and smaller units often execute the elements sequentially, based on their capabilities and the situation. However, simultaneous execution of offensive, defensive, and stability tasks at lower echelons is common in irregular warfare and peace operations. 
38
39
38 Ibid., 3-21. 
39
Therefore, eliminating a threat requires offensive and defensive operations a priori to successful stability operations.
Further complicating this doctrinal quagmire is the repeated sprinkling of traditional, warfighting language throughout FM 3-0 and other doctrinal manuals that confuse the message by returning traditional combat tasks to preeminence.
Modern conflict occurs in many domains; however, landpower normally solidifies the outcome, even when it is not the decisive instrument. Landpower is the ability--by threat, force, or occupation--to gain, sustain and exploit control over land, resources, and people.. ...the capability to prevail in close combat is indispensable and unique to land operations. It underlies most Army efforts in peace and war. Close combat is warfare carried out on land in a direct-fire fight, supported by direct, indirect, and air-delivered fires. 
41
While specific recommendations to improve doctrinal conflation will appear in the final section of the monograph, for the purposes of further discussion major combat operations is defined as a combination of offensive and defensive operations, as currently found in FM 3-0. Stability operations are 
41
In contrast to the doctrinal construct, there is general understanding and agreement on the general nature of likely threats and future operational environment. While history is replete with examples of nations and armies that prepared for the last war against the last enemy, the ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan have grounded the current force in the realities of the common operating environment and institutionalized the need for agile and adaptive leaders and organizations to meet emerging threats.
While there is agreement about the general nature of future threats, it is also commonly understood that the Army cannot predict what the specific threat of the future will look like or where it will be asked to fight. Thomas Donnelly and Fred Kagan write in their book, Ground Truth, that "beyond the war on terror, there is no agreement at all about the nature and scale of the threats America faces." 42 Colin Gray, another author hypothesizing on the future of the U.S. military writes, "The core problem for those who are charged with the strategic function of conducting defense planning for national security is the need to prepare prudently for a future about which almost everything in general is known, but nothing is known in reliable detail. There are question marks everywhere as to why war, with whom, when, where, how and with what?"
43
The lack of a specific threat is in part is what led to the emergence of the current doctrinal construct of full spectrum operations. In theory, it provides an army prepared to engage across the spectrum of conflict; the priorities of which are the subject of this monograph.
While the specifics of the future threats are unknown, there is broad general agreement about future threats and operational environments that are surprisingly consistent. Common threads include the continued proliferation and use of technology, the emergence of non-state actors and demographic and social trends portending future conflicts will take place in and among the people. The combination of these factors combined together to create the term "hybrid threat." Hybrid threat is generally defined by military analysts and U.S. Army doctrine writers as a combination of irregular and conventional warfare fought among the people using the latest available technology and information operations to counter advantages in military hardware. It describes not only the future threat but the future environment U.S. forces will most likely encounter.
Many defense analysts suggest that future conflict will be multimodal, combining various methods of warfare to increase both their frequency and potential lethality. This threat is frequently described as hybrid warfare where adversaries can employ unique combinations of all forms of warfare specifically targeted to U.S. vulnerabilities. 
44
45
What does not appear debatable . . . is that in terms of how wars are fought, the era of guided munitions is quite different--qualitatively different--from that of unguided munitions and aimed fires. The most telling example, once again, is the outcome of open combat between Iraqi and American forces in March-April 2003. . . Against US guided munitions and battle networks, the industrial-age heavy forces of the Iraqi Army were virtually reduced to an array of targets and aim-points waiting to be serviced. 
46
U.S. planner should also recognize that a resident insurgency force enjoys significant advantages over even a technically superior foreign aggressor." 
48
Threats are nation-states, organizations, people, groups, conditions, or natural phenomena able to damage or destroy life, vital resources, or institutions. . . . Threats may be described through a range of four major categories or challenges: traditional, irregular, catastrophic and disruptive. . . adversaries may use any and all of these challenges in combination to achieve the desired effect against the United States. 
49
Existing military powers with advanced technical capabilities; regular military forces equipped with advanced conventional weapons and in some cases WMD. Terrorist groups, insurgents, militias, drug cartels, and less advanced militaries-will use irregular warfare, terrorism, and information campaigns; low cost asymmetric weapons such as IEDs.
Emerging military powers and advanced non-state actors will seek limited advanced military capabilities-air defense, anti ship weapons and resort to irregular warfare. 
50
48
This issue has surfaced in the U.S. Army because of ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in the form of atrophied combat related skills associated with major combat operations. The evidence of these atrophied skills is now largely accepted as fact within the Army and will be detailed in the chapter below. The challenge for the CTCs is that, just as the operational Army's MCO skills have atrophied, so have the OC and OPFOR MCO skills and knowledge; their ability to replicate this environment will also need to be polished off. The CTCs may require 2 to 6 months to posture themselves for a full MCO rotation. We have to figure out what a "good enough" solution is to support this MCO training environment. 
52
54
55
58
While the lessons learned from the 2006 Lebanon War will be detailed in later chapters, the fact the IDF experienced degradation of MCO skills because of its focus on stability operations lends legitimacy to the idea that U.S. skills have also degraded.
The problem under consideration is whether the Army has correctly prioritized between major combat operations and stability operations given the likely future operating environment and stated national requirements. To be clear, the Army's self proclaimed priority is to prepare across the full spectrum of operations, without prioritizing between them. The Army position is defined repeatedly in FM 3-0 which states quite succinctly, "The Army's operational concept is full spectrum operations."
59
It also explains that the Army as a whole needs to be capable of conducting FSO: "Units must be agile enough to adapt quickly and be able to shift with little effort from a focus on one portion of the spectrum of conflict to focus on another." 60 To the Army then, it seems the debate is over. There is no prioritization of Army missions. The Army needs to operate equally across the spectrum of conflict and among all operational themes. The doctrine writers captured the essence of the new Army philosophy in the introduction to the 2008 version of FM 3-0 when they wrote, "within the context of current operations worldwide, stability operations are often as important as-or more important than-offensive and defensive operations." 
61
Simply put, if the Army is big enough and has enough resources, then training for all contingencies may This statement demonstrates unequivocally that stability operations are at least equal to and sometimes more important of a skill set for Army soldiers and leaders than major combat operations skills. 
60
1-20. 61
Whether preparing for FSO applies fully to the army and corps levels but less to the division, brigade and battalion will effect whether the Army is meeting its requirements and correctly preparing across the areas of DOTMLPF.
The oft referred to Title X of the Congressional Code, specifically chapter 307-The Army, details specific requirements and obligations of the U.S. Army. It states, It is the intent of Congress to provide an Army that is capable, in conjunction with the other armed forces, of; 1) preserving the peace and security, and providing for the defense, of the Untied States; 2) Supporting the national policies; 3) Implementing the national objectives; and 4) Overcoming any nations responsible for aggressive acts that imperil the peace and security of the United States. 
62
63
64
To 63 Ibid., paragraph 3062b. paraphrase then, the Army's priority, its default position, from a national perspective is to prosecute "war," and the Congress views war as necessitating "prompt and sustained combat" on land. The type of language found in the Congressional Code, as understood in its historic context, clearly relates more to major combat operations skills than stability operations, implying that MCO preparedness is more of a priority for the Army. How do presidential directives and policy documents codify these priorities into actionable efforts and programs? A review of the National Security Strategy (NSS), Presidential Directives and other policy documents will provide that answer.
The National Security Strategy is largely silent on Army priorities in general and combat/warfare specifically. Basically, it says the military will prevail in today's wars and be ready for all other missions, by stating:
We are strengthening our military to ensure that it can prevail in today's wars; to prevent and deter threats against the United States, its interests, and our allies and partners; and prepare to defend the United States in a wide range of contingencies against state and nonstate actors. We will continue to rebalance our military capabilities to excel at counterterrorism, counterinsurgency, stability operations, and meeting increasingly sophisticated security threats, while ensuring our force is ready to address the full range of military operations.

subordinate policy documents like the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and Quadrennial Roles and Mission Review.
Language in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review embraces the Army role of defeating enemy land forces in combat, but does so in the context that this is one mission among many. The introduction categorizes the requirements as, "In the mid-to long term, U.S. military forces must plan and prepare to prevail in a broad range of operations that may occur in multiple theaters in overlapping time frames. This includes maintaining the ability to prevail against two capable nation-state aggressors, but we must take seriously the need to plan for the broadest possible range of operation." 
67
Further on in the introduction, it states three broad DoD initiatives; increasing availability of rotary wing aircraft, increasing UAV capabilities and increasing special operations forces. While these initiatives clearly impact generalpurpose forces and the ability to conduct MCO, they are a far cry from previous QDRs that stressed building new combat platforms like the Future Combat System to counter more conventional threats.
Certainly, the language in the QDR emphasizes the importance of non-MCO tasks across the Department of Defense with statements like, 68 Specific to the Army and Marines it states, "U.S. ground forces will remain capable of full-spectrum operations, with continued focus on capabilities to conduct effective and sustained counterinsurgency, stability, and counterterrorist operations alone and in concert with partners." Nowhere in the QDR does it discuss a need to improve or sustain MCO skills. Contrarily, it states a requirement to "increase counterinsurgency, stability operations, and counterterrorism competency and capacity in general-purpose 
67
68
Historically, the Department has focused its efforts on the ability to defeat a state adversary's conventional military forces. However, the 2006 QDR assessed that while conventional threats will remain and U.S. Armed Forces must maintain the capacity to defeat them, current and future adversaries are more likely to pose irregular and asymmetric threats. The Department therefore developed a force planning construct (Figure

73
In other words, with 22,000 fewer soldiers and a static budget the Army is committed to providing fewer forces than are currently deployed in support of OIF/OEF, trained to proficiency at a greater range of FSO tasks while at the same time supporting Combatant Commanders with increasing requirements for overseas engagements. The projection for an increase in Army requirements for forces is not limited to the FORSCOM Campaign Plan. The 2009 Army Posture Statement describes a future that 
73
74
includes an "increased potential for conflict" against "adept and ruthless adversaries who exploit technological, informational and cultural differences to call the disaffected to their cause. Future operations in this dynamic environment will likely span the spectrum of conflict from peacekeeping operations to counterinsurgency to major combat." 
75
76
Because specifics about future threats are so difficult to predict, and in light of the ongoing counterinsurgency fights and two decades of involvement at the lower end of the spectrum of conflict, Donnelly and Kagan embrace the idea of an Army prepared to conduct all types of operations and categorically reject the notion of returning to an Army focused almost exclusively on major combat. They blame this type of single mindedness for some of the early follies in Iraq and Afghanistan explaining that the military and Army in particular 78

78
They even offer the armed forces a mission statement: "The United States maintains and uses its armed forces for the purpose of defending, supporting, and advancing its interests around the world," justifying such abstract language by explaining "that is the basic reason all states maintain militaries." 
79
In effect, Donnelly and Kagan embrace the Army doctrine of full spectrum operations. They agree with and promote the notion that the Army must prepare to accomplish any mission across the spectrum of conflict.

The Russian Army deployed to Chechnya in December 1994 to defeat a band of Chechen separatists who were looking to carve an independent Muslim state from Southern Russia. The separatists wanted autonomy for Chechnya in much the same way the populations of Bosnia and Croatia wanted autonomy from the Former Republic of Yugoslavia. In his report to the U.S. Marine Corps titled "David Slays Goliath: A Chechen Perspective on the War in Chechnya," Lieutenant Colonel Timothy Jackson relates that the Russians entered Chechnya "with the intent of removing Chechen separatist leader, Jokhar Dudayev, and replacing his government with one more favorable to Moscow. Two years later, the last units of the Russian force withdrew from Chechnya" without fulfilling their objectives. 
91
92
93
Descriptions of the threat environment found in Chechnya bear a strong resemblance to current and future threats depicted in Army doctrine. Key elements of the threat environment included characterizing the Chechen rebels as a "high end counterinsurgency" where improvised explosive devices, stacked mines, snipers and "thermobalic" weapons were common; where the enemy fought in small semi-autonomous groups of six to ten; and where intermingling with the population by friendly troops was a necessity for success but the cost to Soldiers in terms of psychological stress was high. The need for proficiency in urban operations, night operations and the use of armored vehicles was also highlighted. 
94
On 11 December 1994, Russian forces attacked into Chechnya on three axes, all aimed at the Chechen capital Grozny. By late December all three columns had reached the outskirts of the Grozny in the West, North and East, and mechanized and armored units were poised to initiate the assault on the city. Approximately 6,ooo Russian assault troops were in position to attack against not more than 1,000 Chechen regulars and irregulars defending in the city. On December 31st, after a ten day aerial and artillery bombardment the assault into Grozny commenced. The 131st BDE and 81st MRR conducted mounted attacks along separate avenues of approach. After seizing initial objectives the units were ordered further into the city to complete the destruction of the rebel forces. The units were ambushed by "skilled swarms of Chechen infantry, armed with automatic weapons and rocket propelled grenades." Over the next three days the 131st would be totally destroyed with only a handful of 1,000 troops surviving and the 81st suffered 50% casualties. 
95
95
96
98
Another critique cited the failure of the Russian Army to conduct any division or regimental level exercises since 1992 as a key reason for the failure of the Russian Army in Chechnya. Unfortunately for the Russians, they learned the wrong lessons from their first experience in Chechnya which led to a repetition of some of the same mistakes when they reentered Chechnya in 1999. The RAND study concluded, 99
The takeaway from the Russian experience in Chechnya is that the Russian Army failed in its combat tasks. It was unprepared for major combat operations, including small unit combat in an urban environment, fighting at night, integrating and coordinating between units, integrating fires and conducting intelligence preparation of the battlefield. Nowhere are shortfalls in traditional stability operations tasks/skills like negotiations, cultural awareness, security force assistance or support to local governments identified as reasons for the Russian Army's defeat. While these skills would certainly have 
97
98
99
been useful and necessary in follow-on operations, the fact that the Russians never dominated in major combat operations left the Chechen insurgents believing they could win. Ultimately, the Russian's return to Chechnya in 1999 resulted in somewhat better success, but the Russian still find themselves fighting an insurgency there to this day. This fight has resulted in over 10,000 Russian soldiers dead according to official Russian government counts (2003), with as many as 20,000 dead reported by unofficial sources.

Chapter Six-The Israeli Defense Forces in Lebanon, 2006   On July 6, 2006, the Lebanese-Muslim militia group Hezbollah conducted a raid along the northern Israeli border killing three Israeli soldiers and capturing two others. This was the latest in a string of attacks by Hezbollah against Israel, which included the firing of rockets from southern Lebanon against Israeli civilian targets and represented an unacceptable escalation of Hezbollah capabilities and intent.
The response from Israel "was quick and violent, surprising Hizballah's [sic] leadership and triggering a month long conflict that has become known as the Second Lebanon War."
101
The stated goals of the Israeli government during this conflict included recovering its two captured soldiers and defeating http://www.cdi.org/russia/ 245-14.cfm, February 2003 (accessed January 17, 2011). No reliable casualty figures since 2003 were found.

103
The IDF was not ready for this war. Among the many reasons for this we can mention a few: Some of the political and military elites in Israel have reached the conclusion that Israel is beyond the era of wars. It had enough military might and superiority to deter others from declaring war against her; these would also be sufficient to send a painful reminder to anyone who seemed to be undeterred; since Israel did not intend to initiate a war, the conclusion was that the main challenge facing the land forces would be low intensity asymmetrical conflicts. 
104
The intifada operations that had dominated IDF concerns in the years before the war were allowed to take precedence over training for other types of missions, one effect of which was a loss of combined arms and joint proficiency, with crippling effects of the battlefields of southern Lebanon.

The thesis presented in this monograph postulates that maintaining proficiency in major combat operations is more important to the U.S. Army's general-purpose forces than sustaining proficiency in stability operations. The preceding chapters provided context and relevance to this thesis by framing the environment-defining doctrinal terms, describing the future threat and operational environment and documenting the existing deficiency in combat related skills within the Army's general-purpose forcesand framing the problem-examining the gap between legal/policy requirements and capabilities given planned force structure under ARFORGEN. The last two chapters examined the consequences experienced by other modern Armies that failed to maintain proficiency in major combat operations. A brief review of these chapters will provide an opportunity to recommend solutions and formulate a definitive conclusion about the merits of the thesis.
The environmental section began with a review of current and emerging Army doctrine. Existing Army doctrine is exhaustive and comprehensive at its best, but is also misunderstood, complicated and at times contradictory. The fact that leaders throughout the Army confuse and conflate terms and acronyms like COIN, stability operations, full spectrum operations and major combat operations is a symptom of the problem. Even the definition of "war" appears to be without consensus. Lack of consensus and understanding of these key terms makes it difficult to determine adequate solutions. As it was also shown, there remain deep-seated beliefs, cultural legacies and doctrinal remnants within the Army that argue for prioritization of major combat operations (offense and defense) over stability operations. It was not until after 2001 that Army doctrine recognized that a "shift" had occurred away from prioritizing combat operations "to an inclusive doctrine that emphasized the essentiality of nonlethal actions along with combat actions."

The second chapter of the environmental section presents the threat and operating environment.
There seems to be little disagreement on either front. The term used most frequently to describe the future threat and environment is a hybrid one where enemies and adversaries "employ unique combinations of all forms of warfare specifically targeted to U.S. vulnerabilities." Hybrid warfare is loosely defined as a blend of the lethality of state military power with the irregular protracted conflict. Accordingly, potential adversaries such as states, state-sponsored groups, and self-funded actors will exploit advanced capabilities, including encrypted command systems, man-portable air-to-surface missiles, and other lethal systems. They will employ insurgent tactics such as ambushes, improvised explosives, and assassinations, and also combine high-tech capabilities such as antisatellite weapons with terrorism and cyberwarfare directed against financial targets. 121
The relevant part of the threat discussion is how it relates to prioritization of training for MCO or SO. At least one author believes "it is time to stop talking about the relative priority of conventional forces, asymmetric capabilities, long-range strike, special forces, and other structural characteristics of the armed forces and time to start talking about enemies, threats, challenges, and requirements." 122 This is an argument that moves the Army away from a capabilities-based force which focuses on preparing across a range of capabilities, to a force organized and trained to defeat specific threats, with Iran as the "most immediate and potent threat" and China a "distant second." 123 An argument could be made in the wake of the 2010 attacks by North Korea against South Korea that conflict with North Korea is also increasingly probable. 
124
There are those, however, who disagree with this conclusion and assessment of threat. Strategic analyst Nathan Freier captures the essence of the disagreement when he writes, "The strategic and operational-level frustrations associated with irregular conflicts . . . might convert some of the concern regarding readiness into a reversal back to a primary focus on a "big war" status quo, a move that is totally inappropriate for any reasoned assessment of strategic circumstances." In a statement with direct bearing on the thesis of this monograph, he writes that if "MCO (is) established as the sole contingency the US cannot afford to lose-this is an important but grossly inadequate view of risk" which is "rooted more in military culture and tradition than strategic priorities." He goes on to argue that containing the hazards associated with the collapse of a nuclear state, restoring responsible control over its arsenal, reestablishing essential stability; halting and reversing widespread civil violence in a state (or region) whose stable functioning is essential to US security; or underwriting American civil authorities crippled by a resource-intensive, multistate domestic catastrophe. Today all of these hazards are a compelling and equally, if not more likely to be, a point of defense failure than traditional warfighting.

Army's unequalled proficiency in combat skills that provide the foundation for its success in the contemporary environment against a hybrid threat. Colonel Craig Collier writes in an article for Military Review that, our nonlethal effects were far less important than is usually credited. This is especially true of the billions of dollars we spent on projects and services . . . economic incentives were useful to reinforce success, but not before taking down the insurgents. Our experience in Iraq verified that lethal operations remain the decisive element of combat power.

127
The prioritization of MCO tasks takes on added urgency when considered in light of the acknowledged degradation of MCO skills within the Army. The Army is attempting to correct this degradation by increasing dwell time of units as part of its ARFORGEN process, giving units more time to train, and changing the conditions at the Combat Training Centers to include more major combat operation tasks and scenarios. The degradation of MCO skills means Army units are less likely to be able to conduct intelligence preparation of the battlefield against a conventional threat, to integrate indirect fires and aviation in maneuver and less likely to be proficient at collective combat skills like tank gunnery and deliberate breach.  2011). This publication is significant for two reasons. First it was published after the Arm was already engaged in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Second, it justified changes in Army organizations intended to last for several decades. The Preface of the document reads, "This publication describes why and how the Army is changing its fighting concepts, organizations, training and operations." "'There's a belief that the president of the United States can pick up the red phone and order forcible entry operations' like the 2003 invasion of Iraq, 'but that takes practice and we don't get a lot of practice. 
'" 129
The requirements laid out in Congressional Code, policy directives and doctrine are clear. USC Title X requires the Army to prepare "land forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war except as otherwise assigned and . . . it will be organized, trained and equipped primarily for prompt and sustained combat incident to operations on land."

Israeli Defense Forces is prescient because their move away from combat operations proficiency involved a choice to focus more on nonlethal, stability operations type tasks. The U.S. Army clearly recognizes this trap of preparing for the most likely tasks (stability) versus the most dangerous (combat), and has devised a doctrine (full spectrum operations) and force generating plan (ARFORGEN) to counter it. Though the doctrine is often misused and misunderstood, the inconsistencies are not overly specious; even though the misunderstanding of terms has contributed to the wrong conclusions being made about the priority of SO over MCO tasks.
The ARFORGEN model, however, presents a more difficult challenge. It assumes a reduction in Army commitments and was formulated before the reduction of 51,000 additional Army soldiers was announced. It also assumes that a two-year dwell time is enough for a soldier/unit to train to proficiency across the full spectrum of operations. While two years may be enough time in theory, it is not intrinsically clear how this is so and no unit has yet tested the theory. In fact, the first (and only) combat training center rotation to feature major combat operations for a heavy combat brigade is not scheduled until the summer of 2011.

As has been shown, however, despite the utility of these recommendations, the Army will decrease in size rather than increase over the next several years. A gap between requirements and resources appears unavoidable. 
138
The 9 th Infantry Division served as a "`test bed' or field laboratory for equipment organization, and operations," which ended in the design of a motorized division that could be "airlifted anywhere in the world;" 139 portion of its force to a mission or set of conditions different than the rest of the general-purpose forces in anticipation of a future need. Likewise, the Army should now earmark a portion of its force to become expert in a different mission, under different conditions (major combat operations) than it currently faces in Iraq and Afghanistan, in anticipation of future requirements and likely threats.
The Army cannot fix the gap between its requirements and resources without additional money, troops and time, none of which will be available in any view of the future. The Army will not grow under any conceivable current plan, is actually on a path to shrink, and will likely continue to decline in size and capability as the reality of the ongoing fiscal tightening takes hold. While doctrinal changes should improve understanding and allow for a more informed prioritization of tasks, ultimately, changing doctrine is not decisive and will not fix the underlying problem.
What remains to the Army is a choice of which threats for which to prepare. The thesis of this monograph argues that major combat operations is the correct choice for preeminence in Army preparedness because high-end hybrid threats-like Iran, North Korea, Hezbollah and the Chechen rebels-present more of an existential threat to the U.S. and its interests and allies than those posed by terrorist groups, nuclear proliferation or failing states. And, even when the U.S. ground forces are required to engage the latter, it is their expertise in major combat operations skills which provide initial access and credibility. Currently there are few, if any, military forces in the world with the combat credibility of the U.S. Army. It is this skill and credibility that led to the success in Afghanistan in 2001,   Iraq in 2003, and Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, among other areas, in the 1990s. Juxtapose those American successes with the perceived U.S. Army failure during combat operations in Somalia as an example of the consequences of failing in MCO tasks; the consequences of not maintaining that preparedness are readily apparent and amplified by the experience of the Russians in Chechnya and the Israelis in Lebanon.
A recommendation to return to a combat operations focus for the Army's general-purpose forces does not imply avoiding all stability operations tasks. The Army must train at all times to win the fight it is in. However, the information in this monograph has shown that prioritization and preparedness for major combat operations, ahead of stability operations, is the best way to ensure future success and mitigate the risks associated with the existing and evolving threats. Prioritization of major combat operations is also the best way to mitigate the growing gap between requirements and resources. It is time to rededicate at least a portion of the force to maintaining major combat operation expertise as it primary, sustained competence.

Army's solution to this problem is the introduction of the ARFORGEN process. ARFORGEN is a supply-based model that attempts to increase the amount of time units have at home station. The theory being that longer time at home means more opportunity to train across the full spectrum of operations. By the Army's own models, however, the appropriate deployed-to-dwell time does not materialize for the first active component unit 2014, and that assumes a troop dividend realized with the conclusion of US troops deployed to Iraq without the introduction of additional requirements.
