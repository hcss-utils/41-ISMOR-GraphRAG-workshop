-Vilnius Group Motto I believe Putin is a man of Russia's past, haunted by lost empire, lost glory, and lost power.
Putin potentially can serve as president until 2024.
As long as he remains in that office, I believe Russia's internal problems will not be addressed.
Russia's neighbors will continue to be subject to bullying from Moscow, and while the tensions and threats of the Cold War period will not return, opportunities for Russian cooperation with the United States and Europe will be limited.
