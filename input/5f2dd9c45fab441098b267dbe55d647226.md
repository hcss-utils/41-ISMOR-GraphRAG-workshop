Before the fall of communism, the Soviet Union served as the primary threat facing the United States and Europe.
This singular threat led to the creation of a force trained and equipped to wage a traditional war in Central Europe.
This OE enabled the US Army to establish the doctrine and force structure its conventional forces required in order to focus on traditional warfare against a similarly equipped and trained adversary.
The US Army's emphasis on traditional war changed to irregular warfare after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, however recent developments are spurring a shift back toward traditional war.
As the United States continues to view the Russian Federation and China's conventional militaries with rising concern, traditional warfighting has again become a pillar of defense strategy.
