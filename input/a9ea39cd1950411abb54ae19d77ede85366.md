In addition, Russian weapons face some technological limitations.
In 2009, Russia was a generation behind developed countries, such as the United States, in critical military technologies and would need to "skip" a generation entirely.
The critical gap areas were reconnaissance, communications, hypersonic weapons, and "combat platforms."
218 Some Russian military watchers have suggested that Russian precision strike weapons, particularly ASCMs, are limited not by their range but by ISR factors, thus limiting their reach.
For example, some of Russia's long-range ASCMs, such as the Tsirkon, are designed to engage remote maritime targets in the "far sea zone" and could end up outrunning the ISR that guides them.
This would potentially degrade the functional distances of these weapons to 500 km or less because of ISR limitations from maritime patrol aircraft (that could be intercepted and shot down), limitations from terrestrial over-the-horizon radars, or lack of support from space-based targeting.
