The adversary has the advantage of deciding the time for the commitment of the attack phase, therefore it has the initiative.
Most likely the aggressor will determine the time of its preference, when shaping operations in the preparation phase will weaken Hungary`s power enough, and the attack phase can realize the maximum result.
In the Ukrainian case, Russia decided the intervention, because the new government intended to align itself with NATO, thus relieving its connection with Russia.
In order to prevent this intent, hence losing prestige and power, Russia took advantage of its long preparation activities in Ukraine, as well as its domestic political crisis, to complete the preparation and launch the attack phase.
If Ukraine continued a friendly diplomatic approach towards Russia, the annexation of Crimea would not have happened, however Russia would maintain its foreign policy to shape the security environment and wait for another opportunity.
In other words, external circumstances also can affect timing, beyond the intent of the aggressor.
The lesson learned from the Hungarian perspective is that a collaborative, even friendly power, can become hostile in a short period and depending on its status of preparation can commit the attack phase.
