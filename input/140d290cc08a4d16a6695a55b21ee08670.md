Militarily, Russia continues to consider the increasing US and NATO presence on its borders as the primary threat to its security.
Additionally, Russia believes that the US is creating strategic instability by withdrawing from key Cold War arms limitation and reduction treaties and through the pursuit of military multi-domain operations.
Non-militarily, Russia's focus in the information sphere outlines its belief that the US and its allies seek to execute diversionary and sabotage actions to affect and destabilize the domestic security of Russia and its allies.4 6F
