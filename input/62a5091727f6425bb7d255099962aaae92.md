The ability to secure lines of communication is highly sensitive to the given mission and the locations and capabilities of opposing forces.
Small-scale, locally focused combat, such as the ongoing mission in Syria, requires almost no specialized security for lines of communication, while a regional or global war against the United States and its allies might place all Russian deployed forces at considerable risk if robust security measures are not in place.
Sustainment can also vary by mission type, but it can be estimated under combat and noncombat conditions.
For example, it is possible to estimate the burn rate of munitions, fuel, and other classes of supply on a per-day basis in a notional high-intensity combat situation.
