Chapter Two looks at the Russo-Georgian War of 2008.
The history of the conflict dates back centuries and continues to be an extremely sensitive and hostile area to this day.
The Russian military and diplomatic efforts in the South Ossetia and Abkhazia regions utilized deceptive tactics for the first time in decades and resulted in Russia ultimately seizing control of the two regions.
These regions are geographically strategic due to the main economic routes that run north and south through the Caucasus.
