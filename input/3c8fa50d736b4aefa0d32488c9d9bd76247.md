We must assume, in making our plans, that there will be a direct attack on the United States mainland in any major war in which the United States will become engaged on and after January 1, 1953.
It may be that the war will not open with this direct assault.
It may be that the fighting will start at some point in the world where our forces will come in contact with those of other nations.
It may be that the fighting will be localized at that point, on the model of the practice war between Germany and Russia in the Spanish Civil War.
But this is not likely; and certainly we must not count on it.
We must assume, in making our plans, that if the enemy can do it he will make a direct air assault on the United States mainland regardless how or where the first shooting starts.
