The operation was strategically risky for Russia.
It was unclear how the West, specifically NATO, would respond-that said, because the West did nothing to intervene militarily in Georgia in 2008 Russia had reason to believe that again the West would not intervene.
Still, Russia's Crimea operation was a calculated risk; however, Russia's non-linear warfare mitigated threat to Russia in numerous ways.
By initially deploying plain-clothed Spetsnaz forces into Crimea, the Russian military was able to effectively coordinate with pro-Russian elements within the region to identify local military and law enforcement composition, disposition, and strength.
