Russia, like the United States, has experienced its struggles with counterinsurgency warfare. In Afghanistan, the Russian General Staff chose to approach the operation with a violently offensive mindset. This mindset prevented them from achieving their desired outcomes because they initially alienated the populace they needed to succeed. Then, when they realized their approach was not achieving the desired outcomes, they made only minor adjustments to their approach because they did not view this as a significant challenge to their military model. Then, when presented a similar situation in Chechnya, instead of approaching the operation using the lessons learned from Afghanistan, the General Staff chose to use the same violent tactics employed during the invasion of Afghanistan. This monograph seeks to understand this phenomenon. This monograph is applicable to the United States in that it demonstrates that a nation must not become wedded to a specific approach in order to succeed in future war. During the post-Vietnam era, the United States chose to put aside the lessons learned from counterinsurgency warfare and focus on a comfortable and conventional form of warfare. It seems America is doing the same thing again with respect to the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, by focusing on evading such wars altogether.
The United States is nearing completion of more than a decade of conflict in the Middle East. This period of warfare has strained both the American public and the military in terms of time, resources, and intellectual energy. The reason for the long duration and enormous resources invested in this war stems largely from two factors: a failure to envision an insurgency developing following an invasion and a general misunderstanding of the level of commitment required by both the military and the civilian population inherent in fighting a counterinsurgency war. While it is important to recognize that the United States' understanding of unconventional war is limited because it chose to ignore the lessons learned from previous experiences (Vietnam, Panama, Somalia, Bosnia, Kosovo), it is not the only superpower nation to have struggled with such a problem.
Russian experiences in unconventional warfare after World War Two -specifically in Afghanistan and Chechnya -highlight the difficulties in developing and employing a successful operational framework for unconventional operations.
