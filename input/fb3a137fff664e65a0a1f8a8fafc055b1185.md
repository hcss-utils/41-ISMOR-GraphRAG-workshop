France also had a role to play in perceptions of British decline: Fleury sought indeed to wean his state from its British ties, starting with clever mediation between Britain and Spain at the Congress of Soissons (1728-29): his foot-dragging in the peace negotiation, and impassiveness as Britain and Prussia had a war scare in 1730, signaled a new direction in French foreign policy.
Walpole's withdrawal from the dying alliance-the 1731 Treaty of Vienna-appeared for a moment to isolate France, but in fact it laid grounds for the First Family Compact in 1733.
This was to be the first of three Franco-Spanish treaties through the rest of the eighteenth century, largely securing the union of interests between the two Bourbon crowns.
The Anglo-Austrian alliance was not nearly so perfect, and it soon took second place behind an Austro-Russo-Prussian union in 1732, targeting the Polish crown.
In effect, Fleury left the British tie for a Spanish one.
While he sacrificed the ambition of Louis XV's father-in-law, Stanislaus Leszczynski, to regain the crown of Poland, his clever diplomacy and Bourbon arms gained the Crown of Naples for Spain and reversionary rights for Lorraine to France, all while keeping Britain in near-helpless isolation.
