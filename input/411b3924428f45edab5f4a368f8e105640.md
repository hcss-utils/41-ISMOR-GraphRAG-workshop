One such group was the Prussian Reform Movement led by Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein, Gerhard Johann David von Scharnhorst, August Wilhelm Neithardt von Gneisenau, Hermann von Boyen, Carl von Clausewitz, and Karl Wilhelm von Grolman.
These men and many Prussian officers such as General Hans David Ludwig von Yorck who, while not reformers, nevertheless shared their immediate goal of victory over Napoleon, were anxious to see Prussia's army find its way out of the Frederickian past into the dawn of a new era of warfare and to create an army able to stand up to the revolutionary army of France and the aftermath of the "transformation of war"" that that army had wrought.
