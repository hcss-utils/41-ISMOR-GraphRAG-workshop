# Fulltext:
The era of US global hegemony is drawing to a close.
Within the next quarter century, revolutionary technological developments and new military capabilities will fracture the geopolitical strategic landscape, propelling today's near peer states into a parity position with the US.
While a flattening world promises to bring new capabilities to all nations and even individuals, nation states that are able to support long term, focused, and well funded research and development programs are uniquely poised to capitalize on emerging technologies for military gain.
Through a deliberate focus on information and space control technologies, China and Russia are positioned to gain strategic military parity with the United States, resulting in the emergence of a new tri-polar world.
