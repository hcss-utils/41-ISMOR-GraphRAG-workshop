Despite these improvements, important caveats exist.
Even prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, people of conscription age (1) were significantly less likely to consider military service a necessity when compared with people in other age groups, (2) preferred to see a fully professional volunteer force, and (3) were less patriotic.
The conflict in Ukraine has further exposed the extent to which Russian military culture continues to be rigid and, often, brutal, in addition to the potential hazards associated with combat duty.
During peacetime, military pay still lags behind the benefits from better-paying civilian jobs.
The health of Russian youth, both physical and psychological, continues to be rather poor, which is an important barrier in the context of demographic pressures.
Although Russia's efforts to facilitate recruitment were notable, the challenges it has faced continue to be formidable.
