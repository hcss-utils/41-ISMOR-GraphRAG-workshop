Cole conjures a terrifying and plausible future where the United States finds itself in a global war against a peer superpower.
China, assisted by Russia, gain dominance in the western Pacific by leveraging a massive cyber-attack via malware in Chinese-made microchips that infects the Defense Intelligence Agency, subsequently rendering all US military command, control, communications, computers, and intelligence networks obsolete allowing for a bloody attack on Pearl Harbor and occupation of the Hawaiian Islands.
In the twenty-first century version of the Cold War, US veterans organize into an insurgency called the North Shore Mujahedeen, teenage computer hackers battle in digital playgrounds, Silicon Valley billionaires mobilize for cyberwarfare in space to neutralize Chinese satellite warfare, and old warships from the navy reserve fleet forms a "Ghost Fleet" to fight the Chinese at sea.
