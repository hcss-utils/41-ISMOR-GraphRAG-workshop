Benchmarking is not the "be all or end all" answer.
The QAF leader, certain of his or her objectives, discriminates between "fog and friction" and the true facts.
For example, General Mike Loh, Air Combat Command Commander, relates how the army commanders of France, England, and Austria went to Prussia to find out what made Frederick the Great's army so successful (benchmarking).45 They were, as Napoleon noted, "so infatuated with the manoeuvre of the otklique order, which was fit for nothing but to gain a few adjutant-majors a reputation."

The key to Frederick's success was his understanding of the second category, cycle time.
