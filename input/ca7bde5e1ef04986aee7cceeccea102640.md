Despite U.S. advantages in traditional warfighting, and despite a necessary and successful detour in the direction of COIN, many within DoD and the defense strategy elite want to refocus defense strategy (including that associated with land forces) fully on emerging traditional military competition with resurgent great powers-e.g., "leap ahead" to defeat a rising China or a resurgent Russia in speculative future conflicts.
They hold this view regardless of how remote and manageable the prospect of large-scale traditional warfighting is in reality.
In a recent book, Thomas Donnelly and Frederick Kagan concluded similarly: "There are hints of a desire to return to the 1990's focus on wars against larger and more conventional enemies in the wake of the painful experiences of Iraq and Afghanistan."
