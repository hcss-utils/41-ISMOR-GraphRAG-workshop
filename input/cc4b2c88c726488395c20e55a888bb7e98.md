The 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS) identifies Russia as a rising threat to the values and interests of the United States.
In addition, the policy document calls into focus Russia's increasing investments in its conventional weapon systems along with its hostile posturing along the borders of former Soviet bloc countries.
Interestingly, the NSS provides little attention to Russia's subversive political activities other than a brief discussion about "Promoting American Resilience," finding only that "actors such as Russia are using information tools in an attempt to undermine the legitimacy of democracies."
