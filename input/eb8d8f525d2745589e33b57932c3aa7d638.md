A common refrain of nuclear hawks is that other countries do not endorse Obama's vision of nuclear disarmament.
This is simply not true.
The Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty (NPT)-which the five NWSs (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States) ratified in 1970-mandates these countries to work toward eliminating nuclear weapons.
Article VI states, "Each of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good faith on effective measures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and on a Treaty on general and complete disarmament under strict and effective international control."
