This thesis investigates the role the Romanian Special Operations Forces (ROU SOF) should play in operationalizing the Asymmetric Defense Component (ADC) by establishing an organized and controlled resistance capability to deter or repel possible Russian aggression.
The thesis examines the most recent case studies in which Russia engaged in hybrid warfare to explain why, in the 2008 Georgian-Russian and 2014 Russo-Ukrainian wars, the defenders' lack of a strong resistance force favored the Russian invading forces.
By contrast, it also seeks to explain why the capable Chechen resistance force repelled the Russian forces during the First Russian-Chechen War and how Ukraine's asymmetric strategic approach prevented Moscow from achieving a quick victory in the ongoing 2022 conflict.
