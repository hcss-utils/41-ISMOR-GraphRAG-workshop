As noted in the preceding chapter, while conscripts remained a large share of military personnel, Russia continued its modernization efforts toward increasing the percentage of professional or contract (kontraktniki) service members in the years leading up to the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
Most combat units in the Ground Forces, for example, included professional soldiers as of 2020, 344 and in 2020, the MoD claimed that there were almost twice as many contract personnel as conscripts, 345 a claim that has been reiterated by other sources.
Working from a total of 295,000 contract troops at the end of 2014, Moscow's prior goal was to have 500,000 service members on contract by 2021, 346 but that goal was later dropped.
By March 2020, the last date that numbers were updated publicly, the MoD announced that it had reached 405,000 contract service personnel and updated its goal to reach 475,000 by 2027.
