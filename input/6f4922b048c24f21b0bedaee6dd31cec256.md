As a consequence, Russia threatened to withdraw from the treaty when NATO expanded.^^ To address this issue, the thirty signatories signed an adaptation agreement in Istanbul on 18 November 1999.
This agreement limits the positioning of ground forces by setting national and territorial ceilings, rather than group limits, on conventional forces from the Atlantic to the Urals.^^ The agreement, however, has yet to come into force due to Russia's violations of the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty Flank Agreement of 1996, which set limits on forces in territory belonging to Russia, Norway, Iceland, Ukraine, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Turkey, Greece, Romania, and Bulgaria.
Russia's positioning of forces in what it terms "the near abroad" and its continuing war in Chechnya will most likely prevent it from complying with its treaty obligations in the near future.
For its part, NATO has been unwilling to pressure the Russians into compliance, most likely to maintain Russia's connection to the treaty and thus its military forces at least under ostensible constraints.
