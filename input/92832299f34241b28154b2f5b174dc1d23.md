The changing character of warfare has become especially apparent over the past 13 years of conflict.
The National Intelligence Council has projected that irregular and hybrid warfareincluding terrorism, subversion, sabotage, insurgency, and criminal activities-will remain prominent features of the future threat environment.
Distinctions between regular and irregular forms of warfare could fade as some state-based militaries adopt irregular tactics, as Russia has already done in Ukraine.
Intrastate conflict could also become increasingly irregular, and the incidence of hybrid warfare could rise due to the diffusion of lethal weaponry and other factors.
This changing character of warfare suggests the need for a theory of success that places greater emphasis on innovative ways to prevent conflicts, shape environments, and preemptively win without major combat operations.
Such a theory would recognize the continuum of politics and war and the desirability of achieving sustainable, if not maximalist, outcomes.
The following recommendations aim to improve national strategy and adapt the "American way of war" to prevail against future threats.
