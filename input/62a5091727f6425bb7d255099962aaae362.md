Russian special operations forces (primarily Spetsnaz) and airborne forces (VDV) are generally highly capable and ready to deploy on short notice.
Spetsnaz are the go-to units for Russian political and military leaders, and, at the time of this research, they were engaged in Syria, possibly eastern Ukraine, and other combat zones.
Russia has a long history of developing capable airborne forces.
This development process, which began during the Soviet period, has culminated in the present-day VDV.
