In response to the claims of Hindenburg and Ludendorff that the Reich needed to follow an Eastern Strategy, Falkenhayn focused German military strategy in the west.
He completed a major strategic assessment of Germany's position immediately before New Year's Day, 1916.
It represented a mixture of acute observations with bizarre conclusions.
He argued that the war had exhausted both France and Russia, but that the "enormous hold which England still has on her allies" was the only thing keeping them in the conflict.
