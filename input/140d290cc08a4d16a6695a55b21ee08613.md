In addition, Russia interpreted the 2008 NATO membership intention statements for Georgia and Ukraine as attempts by the US and NATO to further erode its influence within the former Soviet republics and threaten its national security.
The actions galvanized Russian views regarding its security partnership with the US and NATO, leading to the Russian 2008 conflict in Georgia, executed under the guise of protecting human rights.
Russia sought to reassert its great power status, influence, and authority within its sphere of influence.
The conflict emphasized Russia's declaration that it could emulate the US policy of unilateralism and intervention, in the affairs of sovereign states, for the purpose of human rights.
The 2011-2013 Arab Spring and Russian antiregime protests intensified Russian concerns regarding internal state sovereignty.
As a result, Russia initiated the 2014 conflict in Ukraine, annexing Crimea and invading Eastern Ukraine under the pretense of quelling the extremism of the Euromaidan uprising and protecting human rights.
Russia further underscored its security emphasis with its subsequent 2015 intervention in Syria where it portrayed itself as a status quo power that sought to protect the sovereignty of states.1 1F
