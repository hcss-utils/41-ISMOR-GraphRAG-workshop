In the middle of the spectrum of operations are state-sponsored hybrid opponents.
This is the type of adversary Israel faced in Hezbollah during the Second Lebanon War, that the Soviet Union eventually encountered in the later years of its war in Afghanistan, and that Russia faced in Chechnya in the early 1990s.
These adversaries pose a qualitatively different challenge than irregular opponents-a challenge that is similar to that posed by opponents in major combat operations, although it occurs on a smaller scale.
The similarities between state-sponsored hybrid adversaries and opponents in major combat operations are due to the former's training, discipline, cohesion, organization, [command and control] capabilities, and weapons (e.g., ATGMs, MANPADS, intermediate-or long-range surface-to-surface rockets), which give them standoff fire capabilities.
Irregular Palestinian forces operating during the Second al-Aqsa Intifada were generally engaged immediately in close combat at ranges of 500 meters or less.
However, standoff weapons gave Hezbollah the capability to engage the IDF [Israeli Defense Forces] with mortars and ATGMs at extended ranges (as much as 5 km, in the case of AT-14 Kornet-E ATGMs).
To successfully counter the Hezbollah threat, the IDF would have had to have used combined-arms fires to suppress the opponent's standoff weapons and thereby enable IDF infantry to maneuver into close combat ranges.
