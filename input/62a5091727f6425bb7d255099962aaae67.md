Our analysis provides only one part of the answer to a question of great complexity, one that is perhaps of existential interest to some allies of the United States: What is Russia's current capacity to project ground combat power?
We show how many forces Russia can physically move over a given distance and a given period of time.
Power projection includes deployment, but also the ability to fight at the far end of the deployment arc.
