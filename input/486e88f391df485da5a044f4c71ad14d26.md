Moscow continues to place primary importance on conventional military force, with the direct intention of growing capability in order to challenge U.S. power.
While the United States and other Western militaries are considering their future form after two decades of focus on counterinsurgency, for Russia the picture is different; strong emphasis on the enduring and central role of numerous conventional land forces remains unchallenged.
This paper should assist U.S. and Western planners and decisionmakers by providing direct insight into resurgent Russia's military thinking.
