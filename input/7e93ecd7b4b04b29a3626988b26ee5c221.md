The research for this study was conducted prior to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine, which unfolded as this report was being written and prepared for publication.
As a result, this report does not examine the role of the General Staff in decisionmaking, planning, or execution related to this ongoing campaign.
But we would be remiss in discussing the progress of the Russian Armed Forces as an institution without also acknowledging the initial observations of the press and analytical community regarding the stumbles Russia's military had in its first weeks of its incursion into Ukraine.
Thus far, the Russian military has encountered numerous challenges-stemming from logistical, morale, C2, training, and capability issues-in its operation in Ukraine.
