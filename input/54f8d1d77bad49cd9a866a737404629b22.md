There is little western understanding of the gray zone as a US created type of war that is total in nature including all elements of national power.
This is the reason that all of the previous definitions of the gray zone accurately define individual instances of conflict, but fail in a holistic sense.
It is only through an understanding of the totality of the conflicts plaguing the gray zone that war is realized.
The context of adversary and U.S. actions as highlighted by the media, members of government, and political leaders alike concede this fact.
Such terms as economic warfare are used in relation to China, political warfare when referring to Russia, proxy warfare for Iran, and cyber warfare for all.
