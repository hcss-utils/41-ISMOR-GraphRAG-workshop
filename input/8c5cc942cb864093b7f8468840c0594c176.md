Polybius describes military operations in sufficient detail to permit later historians to reconstruct the battles intelligently, and sometimes with a practical purpose.
Although we do not know exactly where Hannibal's elephants crossed the Alps, enough is known of his dispositions at Cannae to have inspired a German general a little over seventy years ago.
At the strategical level, Count Alfred von Schlieffen devised a plan for enveloping the French army employing the same principles that Hannibal evidently followed in enveloping Varro's legions.
Convinced that Ger many must win a quick victory over France before the Russians had time to concentrate overwhelming numbers for an invasion of East Prussia, Schlieffen found his inspiration in the first volume of Hans Delbriick's History of the Art of War (1900).
Delbriuck's account of Cannae suggested to Schlieffen's fertile imagination the idea of a battle of annihilation through envelopment.
Later he developed his own doctrine in a series of articles, many of which were later translated and published in a work entitled Cannae (1913).
The Schlieffen plan was the ultimate result, and if it would be naive and misleading to claim any sort of cause and effect relationship, we may at least point to Schlieffen as an example of a strategist who discovered that the classics remain instructive even in modern times.
