The only constraint on the student's choice is that one of the courses must have a regional concentration to support the Field Studies component of the Core.
Field Studies is an in-depth pursuit of understanding of a region or, in several cases, the U.S. national security relationship with one nation.
Students choose between roughly 24 Field Studies opportunities, two of which are generally thematic and the remainder are overwhelmingly regional designations.
The Field Study involves an elective designated to emphasize the importance of the country or region, along with more than a dozen academic preparation sessions to highlight specific concerns relative to that particular Study, such as experts coming in to discuss the economic interrelationship between China and the United States, the military deterioration of Russia, the role of Islamic law in states of the Middle East, or the role of ethnic and religious differences in central Africa, which round out the topics that the Field Studies students need to pursue in each study.
