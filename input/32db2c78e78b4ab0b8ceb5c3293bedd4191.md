Cyber-enabled reflexive control methods, used more aggressively in the future, could stay within international law and international humanitarian law while still achieving their objectives of influencing adversary decision-making.
Continued utilization of cyberenabled espionage and cyber-enabled gray-zone tactics such as disinformation, election interference attributed to criminal organizations or hacktivists, utilization of proxy forces and botnets for denials of service, all complicate the attribution of a State for the violation of sovereignty for their opponent, exploiting customary international law, as well as established practices from International Court of Justice rulings.
Furthermore, Russia will be able to continue to exploit a loophole that exists regarding international humanitarian law only applying during armed conflict.
If they can successfully deny that the conflict is armed, through denial of communications or media sources, they will be able to enact OCO on the general population with impunity, as evidenced by hostilities in 2008 and 2015.
Finally, considering the speed of opponent decision-making at the operational and tactical levels, Russia may exploit the requirements of Article 2(3) of the Charter of the United Nations, requiring States to seek nonviolent remedies under Article 33, such as "negotiation, enquiry, mediation, conciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement" and more to support reflexive control methods, due to the incredible amount of time required to address such a conflict, since "the invocation of the responsibility of a State for an internationally wrongful act involves complex technical, legal and political considerations."
