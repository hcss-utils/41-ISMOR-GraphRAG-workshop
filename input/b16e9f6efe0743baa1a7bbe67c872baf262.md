Russia's military forces will generally meet its security goals within its available resources.
Russia will likely face higher costs for military recruitment due to declining military-age males through 2024 but should be able to find and recruit sufficient personnel to maintain the current size of its military forces.
Russia will continue to focus on achieving regional dominance in its near abroad, with an emphasis on readiness and professionalization of a small component of the force.
Some expansion and incremental improvements will occur in longrange strike, rapidly deployable forces, C4ISR, and air defense, while relative stagnation will occur in the maneuver ground forces and indirect fires.
Russia will pursue continued collaboration with the West in activities such as counterterrorism in the Middle East while attempting to pivot east toward closer relations with India and China.
