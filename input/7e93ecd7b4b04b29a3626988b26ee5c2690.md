Relatedly, reliance on proxies and other shadowy figures that fell outside the formal chain of command and military institutions-as was the case in the Donbas-introduced a unique element of unpredictability that sharply contrasts with the General Staff model of centralized C2 and the practice of closely monitoring and overseeing decisions made at lower echelons.
A similar trade-off between the advantages of using proxies and the desire for operational oversight is seen in the Syria conflict, as is discussed in the next chapter.
The reliance arguably led to a crucial turning point in the conflict-the downing of MH17-which united support within Western governments for more-robust sanctions against Russia.
Although not explicitly part of this analysis, it is worth noting that, as of this writing in early 2022, Russia appears to have chosen to use secrecy again in service of its recent invasion of Ukraine, which, at this early stage of the conflict, appears to have been a stumbling block in the military's initial performance.
Notably, the initial evidence emanating from the evolving conflict indicates that personnel in the Russian armed services, including mid-grade officers, were not apprised of Russia's plans to invade Ukraine in advance.
