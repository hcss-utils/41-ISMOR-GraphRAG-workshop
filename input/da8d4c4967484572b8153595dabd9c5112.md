It is no surprise then that the advances in artificial intelligence, including the promising attribute of autonomy, are of significant interest to states and their militaries around the world.
The United States has identified leveraging artificial intelligence and the capability of autonomy as key elements of a new national military strategy: the "Third Offset."
The U.S. views its ability to effectively leverage this technology as critical to the success of this offset in order to keep a military edge over potential adversaries and provide an effective deterrent to major conflict.
But this success is not guaranteed-the U.S. faces considerable challenges in meeting this goal.
For example, a U.S. military advantage in this area will be contested by other States, illustrated in Russian President Vladimir Putin's recent remark that "the one who becomes the leader in this sphere [artificial intelligence] will be the ruler of the world."
