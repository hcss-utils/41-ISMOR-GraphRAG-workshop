First, Russia exacerbated political and social unrest by leveraging diplomatic, informational, and economic instruments of power in an undeclared conflict with Ukraine.
Then Russia shaped the operational and information environments domestically by garnering the support and will of the Russian people; regionally, by demonstrating power and perception of legitimacy--at least to ethnic Russian audiences outside Russia; internationally, by doggedly pursuing a perception of legitimacy and demonstrating the capacity to be an influential power globally.
Finally, Russia executed overt military operations beginning with the seizure and annexation of Crimea in 2014 followed by the invasion into eastern Ukraine by taking control of the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts.
The information strategy supporting these operations included employment of multiple IRCs including psychological operations, deception, electronic warfare, cyberspace operations, public affairs, and intelligence.
