In the second phase, beginning with an initial cessation of hostilities negotiated between a group of world powers (including the United States and Russia) in February 2016, the VKS significantly de-escalated its counteropposition air operations.
This gesture reflected a genuine desire by Russian leaders to reach a favorable political settlement with the West.
When the VKS maintained a steady-state theater force presence and continued to provide air support to the SAA's assault of Aleppo, despite intimations to the contrary, it became clear that Russia's veneer of good faith was designed to maximize military leverage for subsequent negotiations with the West.
Following the collapse of bilateral negotiations between the United States and Russia in September 2016, however, the SAA completed its brutal recapture of Aleppo with significant Russian air support.
This crippling blow to the opposition highlighted the broad success of Russia's initial strategic objectives-preventing the collapse of the Assad regime, countering U.S. influence in the Syrian conflict, and establishing a successful expeditionary warfare capability-and signaled the onset of a new phase in Russia's campaign.
