Estonia is among the most vulnerable NATO members.
It is a former Soviet republic, bordering Russia, with a sizeable ethnic Russian minority, and a small military.1 81F 182 Russia conducted a denial of service cyberattack on Estonia in 2007, promotes a false narrative of oppression of ethnic Russians and of NATO as an occupation force, and holds large exercises near the shared border.1 82F 183 As members of its former sphere of influence increasingly turn to the West, Russia has resorted to force against non-NATO neighbors Georgia (2008) and Ukraine (2014), despite international condemnation.
If Russia invaded Estonia, NATO would be obliged to join the war or face dissolution of the alliance.1 83F 184 Although Estonia is the targeted country in this scenario, Russia has the military capacity to extend its attack to any, or all, of the Baltic states.
