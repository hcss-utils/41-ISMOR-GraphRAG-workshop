The absence of an external stimulus, either political or situational, makes change within a military organization less likely.
For example, Geoffrey L. Herrera and Thomas G. Mahnken show that after the Napoleonic Wars, the British Army did not transform as the continental armies did in Prussia, Austria, and Russia because they saw no need to alter their composition and because they "had not suffered a traumatic defeat at the hands of the French."
132 Therefore, Britain was Napoleon's only adversary that did not depart from its long-established method of ground combat after the Napoleonic Wars.
This found the British infantry "ill-trained, ill-equipped, and ill-prepared" for deployment on the continent prior to WWII.
