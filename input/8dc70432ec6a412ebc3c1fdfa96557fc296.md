Russia was supporting irregular warfare with paramilitaries (some led by Igor Girkin from Crimea), local recruits, and a unit of mercenaries, along with defectors from Ukraine's security services.
At the end of May, when irregular warfare had run into too much resistance from Ukraine's volunteer Bns and armed forces, Russia was forced to escalate again in an attempt to secure Donetsk Airport.
Russia introduced high-end conventional capabilities and intermixed Russian units and individual Russian soldiers among the separatist force.
By 24 August, the hybrid approach had demonstrably failed.
