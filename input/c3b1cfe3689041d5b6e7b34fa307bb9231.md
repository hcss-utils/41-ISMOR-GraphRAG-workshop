Key U.S. adversaries, including Russia, China, and Iran, are becoming more active and more aggressive in deploying military forces beyond their borders.
In the future, these adversary military interventions may become more common as great-power competition increases: Ongoing interventions might expand, and fresh ones might emerge in new areas, threatening U.S. interests and strategic goals.
Yet relatively little prior analysis has been conducted to systematically and comprehensively compare why, when, where, and how America's key geopolitical rivals have historically intervened militarily.
Understanding the historical factors that are most likely to drive leaders in these foreign capitals to deploy forces abroad can provide signposts for U.S. policymakers and military planners to anticipate future intervention behavior.
This report, which is part of a series on several current U.S. adversaries, seeks to fill this gap through quantitative and qualitative analyses and provide U.S. Army strategic planning with recommendations to enhance anticipation of and posture readiness for future Iranian interventions.
