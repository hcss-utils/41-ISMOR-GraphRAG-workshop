The preceding case studies have shown that each actor-be it the United States, Russia, Iran, or ISIL-employs its own unique form of warfare below the threshold of conventional war.
This is by no means an exhaustive list.
At least two states not covered in this study deserve special mention-Great Britain and China-since the former was at the forefront of political warfare during the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century; and the latter, as noted in this chapter's distillation of current practices, is actively engaged in political warfare today.
While each of these actors has its idiosyncrasies, some broad commonalities exist in the practice of political warfare today.
This chapter draws on the lessons from the preceding ones to discuss eight attributes that help define the modern practice of political warfare.
