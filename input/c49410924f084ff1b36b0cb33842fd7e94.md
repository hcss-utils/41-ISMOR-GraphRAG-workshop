The Russian Campaign in Crimea was an impressive demonstration of strategic communication employment, sharing many similarities with their intervention in South Ossetia and Abkhazia in 2008, while at the same time being essentially different, reflecting the operationalization of the new military guidelines to be fully implemented by 2020.
This successful non-linear campaign or "New Generation Warfare" was executed without a shot fired and by the destruction of the morale of the Ukrainian military leading to all of their 190 bases surrendered.
