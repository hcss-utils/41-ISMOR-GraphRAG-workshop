Our claim is that Russia can exert influence over Romania and Greece using the energy sector as a means toward its security goals.
Based on past examples of Russia's use of oil and gas blockades (see Ukraine and Baltic states examples in the preceding Literature Review section), we define influence as the ability of Russian companies, within the energy sector, to cut off other countries' capacity to provide the required energy sources for maintaining their independence and sovereignty in decision making.
Our main assumption is that the greater a Russian company's influence is on an energy sector, the greater the potential it will have to coerce Romania and/or Greece.
To measure the extent of potential for influence, we conducted extensive open-source research.
