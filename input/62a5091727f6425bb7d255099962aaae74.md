In the immediate aftermath of Russia's 2014 incursion into Crimea, Ukraine, the national security community sharply accelerated its analysis of Russian military capabilities.
Russian President Vladimir Putin's bold gambit snapped Western analysts and policymakers out of their post-Cold War quiescence: By 2014, Russia had regained a significant portion of the military power it had lost after the fall of the Soviet Union, and it had reemerged as a perceived threat to democracy-at least in Eastern Europe.
Russia's 2015 deployment to Syria to bolster the regime of President Bashar al-Assad prompted renewed fears of Russian military might.
Although the Syria deployment was troubling to observers, Europe was the more immediate concern.
Many Western policy and military analyses centered on Russia in Ukraine and on the Russian threat to the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania.
During this same period, a range of experts on Russia and the military threat in Europe wrote extensively on Russia's military capacity in Eastern Europe.
