Russian disinformation targeted three populations.
First and on the broadest level, Russia aimed to discredit the new Ukrainian government internationally, justify Russian actions in Crimea, and frustrate an international response to the unfolding conflict.
These efforts ranged from material that painted the fall of Yanukovych as an illegal coup (or a "fascist junta"), Poroshenko as corrupt and illegitimate, and Ukraine as failed state to more-extreme material that linked Ukraine to the Islamic State.
