Georgian forces initially met with success, however Georgian forces never secured or blocked the Roki tunnel thus allowing Russian forces to move freely across the border.
This lack of focus toward the tunnel and Russia's reaction stemmed from Georgia's focus toward the South Ossetian separatist forces.
However, "in the actual fighting in August 2008, the separatist forces that the Georgians had seen as their main adversary played only a supporting role as a vanguard to the Russians, to engage and draw the Georgians into combat."
