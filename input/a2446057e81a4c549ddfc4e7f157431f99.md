It is clear that cyberspace is a new domain where individuals, groups, nation and non-nation states have engaged in some type of cyberspace warfare.
As nations begin to adapt and develop new approaches to achieve their national security interests, cyberspace warfare is a likely candidate to meet the challenge.
The threat is real, and there are national consequences if the United States fails to adapt to this evolution in warfare.
The art of the possible has been demonstrated by such operations as the Russians using cyberspace warfare in their invasion of Georgia and unknown actors delaying the nuclear enrichment program of Iran.
This leads to the next chapter in which the nature of war and the evolution of warfare are analyzed as they apply to cyberspace warfare.
