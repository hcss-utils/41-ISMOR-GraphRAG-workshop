We are in the midst of a shift in strategic eras from the traditional American way of war through mass and dominance to an ambiguous state of constant conflict over information.
In this new era, the effectiveness of today's conventional global strike will be reduced to the point where it is of limited deterrence value.
Due to their significant infrastructure, matched with a doctrinal emphasis on aggressive use of space, cyberspace, and nuclear weapons, the threat of conflict over control of information with China and Russia should not be taken lightly.
The US must recognize that it will not be able to control the new domains of cyber and space as it has enjoyed the control of the sea and air, and must appropriately prepare for this new reality.
