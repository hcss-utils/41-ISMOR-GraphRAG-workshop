Both China and Russia largely stayed out of the war on terror, yet "were able to sit back, watch, and innovate in a more conscious manner" as the U.S. found itself in long protracted conflicts in central Asia and the Middle East.
51 Specifically, insurgent and terrorist organizations exploited a significant vulnerability of the U.S. military, its lack of preparation to fight nonuniformed guerrillas who possessed inferior firepower and technology.
The most powerful conventional military in the world could not achieve its desired decisive victory.
Although the U.S. military later adapted and found some success in the arena of irregular warfare, it still became a blueprint for the U.S. adversaries.
Moreover, the U.S.'s great power adversaries understand that a direct conventional approach to the U.S. military would be unwise; therefore, "neither China nor Russia is pursuing a purely conventional or a solely nonconventional path; rather, each is following both simultaneously."
