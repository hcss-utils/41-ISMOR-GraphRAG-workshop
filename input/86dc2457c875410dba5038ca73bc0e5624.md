The proxy wars of the Cold War also continue today.
The conflict in Syria is the best recent example, as Russia (and Iran) propped up the Assad Regime and fought against USbacked militia groups.
The Kremlin uses Russian military contractors in this conflict to achieve its objectives.
Putin himself in 2012 praised PMSCs as a potential "instrument for realizing national interests without the direct participation of the government."
18 Today's Russian private military and security companies (PMSCs) grew from companies that provided security for private citizens in Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union.
They have since evolved into organizations that train foreign militias and national militaries, run paramilitary and pro-Russian ideological camps in eastern Europe and Commonwealth of Independent States countries, and even actively participate in military conflicts.
