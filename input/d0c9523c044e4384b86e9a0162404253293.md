This chapter examines Russia's understanding, practice, and potential for using political warfare in the future.
Russia has repeatedly used proxies, propaganda, and covert action, among other tactics, to undermine European security, most recently in Ukraine.
There is good reason to expect that Russia will continue to use these tactics in the future in ways that will threaten core U.S. interests in Europe and around the world.
