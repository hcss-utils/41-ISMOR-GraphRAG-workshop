The existence of a national style of warfare, an American Way of War, has been used to characterize the fundamental elements of American military strategy. The traditional American military style uses the vast economic and technology base of the U.S. to grind down opponents with firepower and mass. Our style is built around our robust economic production capacity, technological capabili -,v Rhundance of resources. The American Way of War has become a convenient and uwe, description to characterize our unique approach to warfare, an approach that reflects the collective history, attitudes, and political culture of the American experience. In 1991, the rebuilt armed forces of the United States demonstrated which nation was the world's foremost military power in a most convincing mann.
To those who had advocated an American Way of War, as the WNtuWl and unchageable exposition of our strateic culture, Operato Deset Storm stood as vindication.
lessons about the utility of force drawn from four different conflicts were examined. The four conflicts include Vietnam; the U.S. intervention in Lebanon 1982-1984; the invasion of Panama in 1989; and; the Persian Gulf Conflict, 1991.
The examination of each conflict was made using a four-stage assessment regarding military perceptions, attitudes, or lessons learned. The four elements of the assessment il include; the objectives of each case; how force was used or limited; the relationships between policy makers and military leaders during the planning and conduct of the conflict; and finally, the degree of popular support for each intervention.
The following questions have been used to frame the project:
-What is the principle of Decisive Force? -What historical experiences lie under the principle? -Is it consistent with our strategic culture? -What are the advantages and disadvantages of Decisive Force in both strategic and operational terms?
The project has three theses. The first concerns the existence of a New American Way of War, which reflects subtle changes from the traditional description made famous by Professor Russell Weigley in his seminal The American Way of War. The second thesis concerns how the military came to the conclusions that shifted the operating code that functioned from the Civil War through World War H. The lessons learned from these conflicts are at best oveimplified. 'At worst they are erroneous. The third thesis involves the present status of civil-military relations in this country. The thesis, simply stated, is that the relatonship is in a state of subliminal crisis in the United States.
Based on the study effort, the following conclusions have been drawn:
1. Decisive Force is derived from the military's perceived lessons learned from the past two decades, pariculady Vietnam, Lebanon, and Desert Storm. While the lessons are not altogeder accurate, they have served to focus attention on the principal considerations to be evaluated before employing violent force.
2. Decisive Force is consistent with our strategic culture and the American Way of War. While it appears well matched to the military's operational preference, it also reflects the limits of our political culture. In particular, it reflects the need to maintain popular support and preclude casualties endemic to the American political culture.
3. Decisive Force is a very useful declaratory policy and enhances the use of military force as an instrument of diplomacy. Decisive Force as a national strategic concept supports deterrence, defense, decisive influence and diplomacy. The military does not like limited warfare or the use of military force as a bargaining tool, or a substitute for diplomacy, unless the ramifications have been thought out thoroughly. 4. Decisive Force, while stated as an overarching strategic concept, is not universally applicable across the conflict spectrum. It is applicable to almost all uses of force for violent means. Some situations, such as counterinsurgency, may require greater restraint and persistence, and less violence.
5. Decisive Force does not represent a direct challenge to effective civil-military relations. It does represent the considered judgment of the military about how combat forces should be employed, which must be noted.
The decision to use force is a critical matter for any state. Military leaders make a major contribution to these decisions. Their professional advice is a crucial element of the policy decision making process. This expert input is founded on a number of their own attitudes and lessons from earlier conflicts. The lessons of these experiences, often subjectively drawn, are now buried into the institutional sub-conscious of the Armed Forces, for better or worse. These attitudes and lessons should be understood by those involved in making polcy decisions. How these attitudes mesh with our strategic culture and the demands placed on the U.S. in the post-Cold War environment is crucial if effective civilmilitary relations are to be maintained in the years ahead. Such relationships produce effective strategies that best correspond to the desired ends of policy. Poorly balanced relations seriously impair the alloy of military and policy perspectives that produce effective -ategi decisions.
For the past twenty years, ever since the last helicopter ignominiously left the rooftop of the American Embassy in Saigon, our country has debated how to use military force to serve the Nation's best interests. This issue remains unanswered today. Despite a rich legacy of examples to draw from, our reluctance to conduct critical strategic studies limits our grasp of the problem and a deeper understanding of our own history.
In the immediate aftermath of Vietnam, there was a deeply emotional debate about the political, social, and moral aspects of the war. Many serving military officers participated in this debate, but the military as an institution pushed the memories of the Central Highlands and the Mekong Delta out of its con ns. Instead the Armed Forces focused therapeutically on the threat the Soviet Union posed in Europe. Over time, the "lessons' of Vietnam passed implicitly into the military culhure; into its doctrine, training and education, and thought process. The collective conclusion can be reduced to the simplistic cry of 'No More Vietnams."
Most observers agree that Vietnam was lost at the political and strategic level of war.
The existence of a national style of warfare, an American Way of War, was raised as a fundamental and immutable element of American strategy. The American Way of War is built around a strategy that employs the vast economic and technology base of the U.S. to grind down opponents with firepower and mass. Our style is built around around economic production capacity and resources. Because of its costs, this style is predicated upon national mobilization and national commitment. This national style reflects both our comparative advantages and the limits of a democratic government.
The American Way of War has become a convenient and useful description to characterize our unique approach to warfare, an approach that reflects the collective vi history, attitudes, geography, and political culture of the American experience. It is admittedly somewhat of an overgeneralizab-on, but it is a useful one. National styles do exist, and their study serves a valid analytical and practical purpose.
Regrettably, Vietnam was a scenario that did not match our national style. Yet many would argue that the American Way of War reflects the strategic culture of the United States, and that policy aims and strategies must be crafted consistent with this distinctive fundamental style or face the calamity of another Vietnam.
In the early 1980's this debate was renewed as the Reagan Administration sought to cast off the malaise of the 1970's and the reticence of the *Vietnam Syndrome." This condition supposedly restrained America from asserting itself as a global power. The Reagan Administration sought to *draw a line' against the Soviet Union somewhere, anywhere. Eventually, U.S. military forces were introduced into Latin America and in the Middle East. The tragedy of the Marine barracks bombing in October 1983 resurfaced the great debate of when, why, and how U.S. military might should be applied. Ultimately, a formula was generated by the Defense Department, and advocated aggressively by then-Secretary of Defense Weinberger in 1984.
This formula was phrased in a series of criteria that restricted the use of military forces to those situations where vital interests were at stake, where all other means had failed, where public support from Congress and the American people was assured, and with the wholehearted intent of winning. This set of guidelines, which eventually became known as the Weinberge Doctrine, was widely accepted in the military. It was castigated by some observers, including then-Secretary of State George Shultz, as utterly unreasonable and inconsistent with the country's standing as a world power.
In 1991, the rebuilt armed forces of the United States demonstrated which nation reigned supreme as the world's foremost military power in a most convincing manner.
The stunning victory over Saddam Hussein seemed to finally bury the haunting memories and painful lessons of Vietnam. To those who had advocated an American Way of War, as the natural and u a a exposition of our national and strategic culture, Operation Desert Storm stood as vindication. 
The purpose of this project is to trace the development and evaluate the merits of a "New American Way of War-embodied in the Decisive Force concept. Military attitudes and lessons about the utility of force drawn from four different conflicts will be examined.
The four examples include:
-V*ieam; -Ts. U.S. intervention in Ltbanon 1982-1984; -The invamion of Panama in 1989; and -The Persian Gulf Conflict, 1991.
The examination of each conflict will include a four-stage assessment regarding military perceptions, attitudes, or lessons learned. The four elements of the assessment include; the objectives of each case; how force was used or limited; the relationships Vii between policy makers and military leader during the planning and conduct of the conflict; and finally, the degree of popular support for each intevention.
The focus of this effort is not to dcern the correct "leson* of each conflict from a policy or strategic perspective. The focus is on what the U.S. military absorbed from each conflict, and the pattern of these lessons over the course of two decades. The research effort will highlight both the existence and limitations of a body of thought within the military about the use of force.
The following questions have been used to frame the project:
-What is the principle of Decisive Force?
-What historical experiences lie under the principle?
-Is it consistent with our strategic culture?
-What are the advantages and disadvantages of Decisive Force in both strategic and operational terms?
Ultimately, this research paper will explore the existence and limitations of a New American Way of War. A chief concern in this endeavor is to establish and examine attitudes extant in the U.S. military about the conditions necessary for the successful employment of violent means in the service of the State. Over the last generation, the country has moved towards a better underanding of exactly what it means to use military force. TIhis has been a long journey. In many respects we are at an historic intersection about the ue of military as an instrument of national power today. Tragic incidents in Somalia during the course of this project, and the debate about potential American intervention in Bosnia, bely any positive conclusions at this point.
ix Tbemse This project has three theses. Te first conces the existence of a New A n Way of War, which reflects subtle changes from the traditional description made famous by Professor Russell Weigley in his seminal The American Way of War. Implicit to the definition of a national style of warfare is the delineation of cultural attributes and attitudes that constitute the preferred operational codes and methods of any given culture.
The American military culture has been predisposed towards large and offensive methods of warfare, and has evidenced a lack of political dexterity in the conduct of military operations. A national style also implies a prescriptive manner to warfare. In this century, other countries have had serious problems resulting from fixed offensive doctrines ostensibly tied to strategic or operational paradigms. Fixed doctrines or prescriptive styles are not a useful guide to policy makers because inflexible approaches seldom satisfy thy myriad complex situations faced in foreign affairs.
The second thesis concerns how the military came to the conclusions that shifted the operating code that functioned from the Civil War through WW II. Vietnam initiated the change, and subsequent conflicts in L.banon, Panama, and Kuwait have locked in changes in the manner in which the American military views the employment of the military instrument to serve policy goals. The lessons learned from these conflicts are at best oversimpified. At worst they are erroneous.
The third thesis involves the present status of civil-military relations in this country.
My thesis, simply stated, is that the relationship is in a state of subliminal crisis in the United States. Civil-military relations have not had the degree of study and care that they x should get. The necessary involvement of military leaders in the political aspects of decision making has drawbacks, and the increasingly narrow perspective about the utility of force in the U.S. military exacerbates a precarious problem.
The decision to use force is a critical matter for any state. Military leader make a major contribution to these decisions. Their professional advice is a crucial element of the policy decision making pr =ss. This expert input is founded on a number of their own attitudes and lessons from earlier conflicts. The lessons of these experiences are now buried into the institutional sub-conscious of the Armed Forces, for better or worse.
These attitudes and lessons should be understood by those involved in making policy decisions. How these attitudes mesh with our strategic culture and the demands placed on the U.S. in the post-Cold War environment is crucial if effective civil-military relations are to be maintained in the years ahead. Such relationships produce effective strategies that best correapond to the desired ends of policy.
What Ernest May once called the "ultimate decision," the decision to use force to resolve conflict, is an act that defines a nation. No other decision raises so many factors and questions, or puts so much treasure and blood at risk. There is no greater measure of national leadership, on the part of politicians and military leaders, than the issue of war.
Ultimately, this project seeks to contribute to ensuring that this decision is made wisely and well.
The "American Way of War' used in this project is somewhat different and more narrowly constructed than the phrase made popular by the eminent American historian Russell
Weigley.1 Recent scholarship underscores the conclusion that culture is the prime determinant in how societies approach the nature of warfare.

The U.S. military shows a marked predisposition for strategic offensives supported by full national mobilization, employing the economic and technological assets of the nation, to bring to bear a preponderance of power in the most direct and decisive manner possible.
Strategic culture does not necessarily move institutions in the same direction. A frequent assumption is the U.S. military's culture is directly derived from or responsive to the society it represents. However, a brief review of history shows there are elements of contrast between the two. 
4
A corollary of this definition is that cultures are not necessarily perfect or correct. They are neither accurate or incorrect, they exist as the learned, however imperfectly, distillation of experience. They are shaped by geopolitics, history, and myths. The most significant influences in the military culture are lessons drawn from the cauldron of war.
Culture also generates normative values and operational codes passed on to new members through socialization and education. Military cultures have effective socialization processes such as professional schools and doctrine. The value systems inherent to cultures organize and filter information and may lead to preformatted or preconditioned responses. They also lead to predispositions about what is acceptable or not acceptable. Strategic culture can be "an indispensable but subjective guide" to the interpraMion of facts, and the organization of choices, but it can be "the product of ambiguous sources, potentially a source of prejudice and self-deception."* During periods of great pressures and tensions, such as those experienced by democratic governments in crisis situations, cultural differences between the political and military cultures come into play. The interchange is usually tense, and sometimes disruptive. What one element of the culture views as acceptable or desirable is not necessarily acceptable to the other. Successfully integrating the different perspectives, or resolving the "dichotomy between the demands of policy and the dictates of the battlefield' is an inescapable problem of armed conflict.' Strategic cultures that contain wildly divergent attitudes between policy makers and strategists contain fault lines that can be fatal.
While conflict is inherent, there are rules and bounds accepted by both sides for the proper exchange of views in a democratic society. In our society these rules are structurally institutionalized in our form of government, and in the laws legislating the organization and functions of the Armed Services. However, as in all social organizations, substantial interaction occurs in the form of internal and bureaucratic politics. 
7
The interaction known as civil-military relations is the testing ground of "strategic a aility for the selection of policy aims and the use of military force. As Clausewitz forewarned, "purely military' viewpoints are not useful in this discourse, for politics is the controlling factor and the source of logic. Military actions are rarely executed without considering 'the distraction of politics" and ensuring that strategic options pass muster with the political culture. Viewed in this manner, strategic culture is the domestic "equivalent of battlefield friction that erodes the cold rationality of the strategic process." Some strategic cultures contain more friction than others.
In sum, stmategic culture is the resulting confluence of political, social and military viewpoints. The exchange can cause sparks of friction, as well as sparks of inspiration.
Cultures reflect deeply rooted beliefs that drive institutional preferences and perspectives.
Such preferences and perspectives have great impact during the flux of emotions and options present during major policy decisions. There may be no more important policy decision than the decision to wage war.
We need to be aware of the influence culture plays when studying history and analyzing the actions taken by policy makers. Likewie, future decision makers and military professionals must be aware of the influence of strategic culture in national security problems.
Our political and military cultures donor bring the same interests or influences to the table.
Their interests and influences are not homogenous, but the final product must integrate conflicting values inherent in the strategic culture to produce a successful strategy. Thus, in the word, of one group of strategists Americans must...always be conscious of those distinct aspects of their strategic culture that both provide the undergirding sength of their policies and strategies and bias their perspectives of what is and of what is possible. Wise statecraft requires not only that external policies be shaped in terms of fundamental national chara"er but that national predispositions be so understood as to allow compention for the defects inhent in that character.' Accordingly, a primary purpose of this study is to explore the experiences and hidden assmpions behind changes in American military strategy over the past two decades, to assess the validity of the perspectives and conclusions drawn by the military, and to come closer to fuMly understanding both the defects and strengths of our strategic culture.
Our political culture is essentially bounded by the unique form of democracy perfected by the Founding Fathers two centuries ago. Ours is a liberal and pluralistic social order.
It represents a sharing and distribution of competitive power centers, with an abhorrence of a centralized or overly strong source of power. This has generated a slight tinge of suspicion to large military institutions or military influence in politics.
Ours is an idealistic society, in many ways naive at best, or poorly informed at the other extreme, about the ways of the world. In many ways we are self-centered and chauvinistic about our values and political institutions. We are prone towards 'mirror imaging" and overlooldng key differences from the enemy's point of view.W We like to export our values and social systems, as well as economic mechanisms, for emulation throughout the world.
When challenged we prefer lofty goals and moral crusades to galvanize our collective efforts towards a common objective. " We sometimes let idealism run to moralism in our external affairs.
Our political culture is heavily influenced by several social attitudes endemic to America.
One major attitude is the American problem solving orientation which is both pragmatic and relatively focused on short term fixes. We are an impatient people used to ready access to drive-through windows and guaranteed 30-minute pizas. Our impatience to get things done is supported by our wealthy economic position and our capacity for innovation and technology.
Our naivete and problem solving habits combine to create a "can do' attitude about challenges. This is reinforced by an activist orientation and our emphasis on rationalism.
We do not accept intractability-all problems have solutions. Our sense of activism is balanced by our disinterest in foreign entanglements, and suspicions about international affairs that do not directly affect us.
Another element about American culture is the manner in which our society looks at war.
War is viewed as an aberration, and not as a normal or frequent occurrence in international relations. This is a product of our ahistoricism and our collective inability to wee things the way other cultures and Societies see them.

Tocqueville was critical about democracies in terms of their external relations, and believed they tended to follow their feelings instead of rational calculations. He also knew the strengths of a popular government based on the power in the people when he acknowledged that "democracy does not provide a people with the most skillful of governments,* but properly aroused it can generate 8a restless activity, superabundant force, and energy never found elsewhere.'" Popular support is normally considered a constraining factor in our political culture. One of the greatest paradoxes for democracies is that the cold rational, and often secretive, nature of diplomacy and foreign relations is not consistent with generating the necessary amount of public support for a given policy. Hans Morgenthau has noted that a democratic government has two tasks: pursue policy objectives effectively and secure approval for the policies.
Howevr, the conditions for generating public support are not necessarily identical or conducive to achieving a given policy objective."5 Yet, eventually all efforts will fail without the consent of the governed to any activity conducted in their name that the majority comes to believe is not conducive to their interests. This paradox is most acute during protracted conflicts that require sacrifice or heavy costs.
The challenge for democratic leaders in our strategic culture is to create and sustain public support for policies that are in the long term national interest, especially when such policy aims are not apparent on their face value. In Edmund Burke's harsh terms, leaders exist to maintain and serve the interests of the people and must *be a pilar of the state, and not a weathercock."' This is a demanding obstacle in a diverse cultum, with many competing interest groups. This challenge is one that several of our leaders have met successfully while others have failed to "prepare the battlefield" on the domestic front.
The culture of the American military maintains deeply held convictions and "myths.'* 7
In some ways the military culture is not completely representative of society. As noted earlier, its reflection is not a perfect representation. This distinction has become more clear now that we have implemented an all volunteer force in place of conscription. The military's social and power structure is not egalitarian or pluralistic, but hierarchial and heavily biased towards a conservative realism.' As a social order, the military stresses the group over individualism. Elements of commonality within the strategic culture include a bias for action, an emphasis on technology, and a pragmatic approach to getting results.
LAk the ret of the country, the American military is an impatient culture. Furthermore, our country has provided the resources and technology to apply decisive force for quick results. We prefer to overwhelm our opponents with mass and firepower. Our society has had a comparative advantage in resources to give us the wherewithal to do so. We are frustrated when political constraints or a lack of trust from civilians results in limitations on the use of force best suited to our technological and economic strengths.
Limited wars, while not preferred, are a frequent occurrence. We have had a long legacy of experience in such conflicts going back to the American Revolution, the Indian Wars, and various incursions in Mexico, the Philippines, and Central and Latin America."9 But our cultural orientation is towards large scale, production line, conventional warfare. Some find this bias reduces the utility of the U.S. military in lesser contingencies where force or the threat of force could be used as a preventive option or low cost problem solver.Y
The U.S. military sees fore more as a tool of last resort, rather than an aberration. The military recognizes the inherent risks and costs associated with its application. When politics and diplomacy fail, other nstruments such as economic sanctions should be tested and found wanting before 'the dogs of war" are unleashed. The military has internalized the basic truth that military power is a blunt instrument, whose utilization cannot be entirely predicted or controlled with any degree of precision. Opening Pandora's box-creates risks and a dynamic all its own.
There are three major elements within the American military culture that are relevant to the intended focus of this study. The second aspect of professionalism involves the corporate nature of military life, particularly the officer corps. Like other professions, the military generates a degree of organzWationl and professional commitment which results in a strong identification with the profession. This is reinforced by the nature of military life, its work routines, social life, and deployments. It is further reinforced by professional military associations and other forms of socialization.
The third element of professionalism deals with the social responsibility assigned to the military. Like other professions, the military provides a social service and evokes an ethic of social respomsibility over personal gain. The military serves the State, and its status is afforded certain rewards and c Insaderatio in pursuit of this function.
All three aspects of pofessionalism have drawbacks when taken to extremes. With respect to expertise, an orientation n the purely technical side of the profession limits the deft use of power. By focusing solely on the military arts and sciences to the exclusion of the social, political, and economic nature of the culture it represents, any military can reduce its effectiveness, or challenge the State's civilian policy makers. Ignorance of the political objectives or conditions when employed in conflicts abroad can result in strategic defeats like Vietnam, or Pyrrhic victories. The military must understand both its own political environment, and the political context in which it is employed.
The concept of social responsibility can also be taken to an extreme and lead to the idea that loyalty and obligations are only owed to the State as opposed to elected civil authority.
General of the Army Douglas MacArthur reflects this droneous sense of duty. In Congressional testimony, General MacArthur found curious the understanding that the military "owe primary allegiance to those who temporarily exercise the authority of the executive branch,* and implied he had a higher duty to the country and its Constitution.Y MacArthur believed the idea that allegiance was owed to the State as a whole and that anything else was a dangerous proposition. Under our strategic culture, he was constitutionally and legally bound to obey the orders of those appointed over him. The Constitution clearly defines civilian control over the military. MacArthur represents a far more dangerous concept whereby the military interprets the Constitution, and pursues policy aims independent of civilian control. While the "Man on Horseback" crossing the Rubicon (or the Potomac in our case) is not likely to occur in the U.S., the subversion of the principle of civilian authority can occur in less overt ways.
The overarching element of professionalism is the concept of professional autonomy.
Professions are normally seen as self-functioning and self-regulating. Autonomy is a classic characterisic of professions, but one that must be limited in the military to constrain its power in a pluralistic government and ensure its application in accordance with the principle of civil supremacy. The military naturally prefers to conduct military operations without strict oversight or interference from civilians. Ihis aspect of the American military culture has been noted by one of the most respected military theorists in the area of civil military relations. Sir John Hackett acknowledges that in American circles "those who have accepted that they serve the state have not necessarily bought into the complementary idea that the statesmen is the master..2
In a final assessment, several analysts believe that professionalism can be carried too far, resulting in a force unresponsive to society, rationalizing its actions as servants of the state and cloaked in the barrier of military expertise-that is most dangerous to professional ideals and to professional compatibility with democratic society.'" The conflicting pressures of professionalism, autonomy, and the need for extensive interaction in the American political pr bear close watching.
Another trend in American military culure is the relation of politics to the military institution. Apart from the interaction expected of the military in a pluralistic government, the armed forces are in theory an apolitical institution. As a firm rule it eschews any association with partisan politics, and historically has even avoided understanding the interaction of political factors with military implications in war and peacetime. At the individual level, it is operationalized in a completely neutral stance for military officers in political matters, to include not even exercising the right to vote.Y This tradition has lessened considerably in the last few decades.
At the institutional level though is the false separation of political matters from war.
Concomitant with the rise of professionalism was the distinct separation and isolation of the U. S. military from politics. This reinforces the separation of political matters from military operations in the American military culture. The origins of apoliticism can be traced back to General William T. Sherman and his lieutenant Brevet Major General Emory Upton.
Upton conducted a tour of European military establishments during the 1880's and came back with a series of recommendations to professionalize the U.S. military.
Upton's recommendations were largely lifted from the Prussian military establishment and focused on entry qualifications, promotion policies, professional education, and the establishment of the equivalent of a German general staff. Mostly unknown are several policy eommemndations to separate the military from politics, that reflected Sherman's distaste for partisan politics and Von Moltke the Elder's influence in Prussia." Russell
Weigley assesses Upton's overall influence on U.S. military policy:
Emnry Upton did lasting harm in setting the main current of American military thought n0to the task of shaping military institutions that would serve both miiay and national purposes, but to the futile task of demanding that the natona institutions be adjusted to purely military expdiency.
Although struck down by his own hand, Emory Upton was a significant contributor to early U.S. military strategy and his ghost lives on. Emory Upton's place in American military history is well recognized by historians, and there are indications that his influence is alive and well."Â°U pton's influence was seen during the Second World War, where contrary to popular beliefs, FDR and his military chiefs had distinctly different approaches to war. Genral Marshall, despite holding several positions that required extensive exposure to political issues, believed that the military should stay away from political issues, in order to maintain its "sacred trust from the American people. 
31
Even General Eisenhower, a politically astute general, could succumb to a false separaion of political aims and military efforts. Pressured by Churchill to press forward rapidly to seize Berlin before the Russians could get there, Eisenhower replied, "personally and aside from all logistical, tactical or strategical implications I would be loath to hazard Amedra lives for purely poIldal purposes. u (emphasis added)
Because of a preference for total war, our military leaders often forget that policy aims serve as guidelines for directing war and for rational calculations involving both the magnitude and duration of conflict. Clausewitz rightfully warned against subordinating policy to military expediency. "Wars cannot be divorced from political life; and whenever this occurs...,he warned, -the many links that connect the two elements are destroyed and we are left with something pointless and devoid of sense."3
The stes generated by the view that war should be fought strictly according to military logic resulted in the famous Truman-MacArthur controversy during the Korean War. General
MacArthur was a product of a culture that artificially separated policy aims from military means. He attempted to conduct the Korean war as a sphere apart from the basic policy aim of the U.S. government, and actually attempted to subvert the policy by his involvement in both domestic and international politics. After his relief, MacArthur sounded like Upton or Moltke. A theater commander, MacArthur claimed:
Commands the whole area, politically, economically and militarily. At that stage of the game when politics falls and the mIltary takes over, you must trust the military...I do unquestionably state...there should be no artifice under the name of politics which should handicap your own men."1
Moltke, Upton and MacArthur would have preferred leaving those decisions to the military, despite COausewitz's warning. The many dictums of Clausewitz, extensively employed in the halls of erudition and higher learning, are often 'shallowly comprehended and constantly forgotten" in the U.S. military." While MacArthur represents a single case in U.S. military history, the desire to exclude politics from military operations is extant today. From one recent assessment of U.S. strategic culture:
... the American military tends to view war and peace as sharply delineated activities rather than as a continuum. The use of force tends to be seen as a last resort, a response to the failure of politics or diplomacy rather than as an instrument of politics or diplomacy."
The most distinguishing characteristic of the American Way of War is the military's penchant for total warfare. We prefer quick and decisive results as opposed to limited warfare, and see decisive military victories over the enemy's main force as the quickest road to that end. "There is no substitute for victory' is one of MacArthur's most often quoted expressions and an apt summarization of the American style.
This orientation towards total warfare in the U.S. military is well recorded. Professor Russell F. Weigley, the distinguished American historian, first documented our style of war.
In his seminal The American Way of War, Weigley established a concise taxonomy of two basic approaches to warfare. He contrasted our preference for the strategy of annihilation, based on the destruction of the enemy's military capability, over the strategy of attrition.
This preference was traced back to the early examples of Generals Grant and Sherman during the great internal cataclysm of the American Civil War.Y Our preference is for 'winning victory by the means sanctioned by the most deeply rooted historical American conceptions of strategy, the destruction of the enemy's armed forces and his ability to wage war. "3 Our institutional preference, reinforced by both our national character and resources, is for total warfare fought for unlimited ends by the complete destruction of the enemy's capacity to resist including both the enemy's military forces and war-making capability. America's vast economic base and advanced technological state have matched our preferred military strategy very well.
The preference for strategies of annihilation is not unique to the American military culture. Military organizations have historically preferred offensive strategies. Some research supports a finding that military organizations prefer offensive doctrines, regardless of political or technological circumstances, because it maximizes professional autonomy and minimizes civilian interference." The institutional motivation for offensive warfare "to disarm the adversary quickly and decisively by offensive means' should be examined carefully in each context. Under conditions of weak civilian control, as occurred prior to World War I, the military's "purity in its devotion to victory, has not always served politicians or democratic states wellAÂ°T he two major approaches to warfare are also represented in two major groupings of military officers. Morris Janowitz, the prominent sociologist and author, made a distinction between "absolWums and "pmgmadsts in categorizing professional soldiers in the U.S.
military.4' The former are military officers who believe in the traditional type of total military victory rather than the measured application of military force and its relative consequence to a specific situation. Pragmatists are more inclined to understand the utility of employing partial means for specified purposes when those ends are limited in nature.
Clearly, coming out of the Second World War, the absolutist tradition was firmly entrenched in the American Way of War. During the 1950's, some military officers and academics, particularly Army Chief of Staff Maxwell Taylor, developed a theory of "Flexible
Response" to describe the need for a more flexible range of options than Armageddon and the over-reliance on nuclear retaliation contained in Eisenhower's low budget New Look strategy. 5 Taylor's strategy was eventually adopted by the new Kennedy administration and was an underlying element in the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and America's entry into Vietnam.
The scars of Vietnam reinforced the position and attitudes of absolhists, or Warrior Generals, who descend from a long lineage of great names in Amrican military history including Grant, Sherman, Pershing, MacArthur, Lemay, and perhaps now Schwarzlapf.
This represents a long and proud pantheon in the American military culture. Pragmatists have their own luminaries including Generals George Marshall, Matthew Ridgway, and Max
Taylor, but they out significantly outnumbered.
Absolutist attitudes have come into conflict with policy when America has pursued war for limited objectives with limi*ed means. The first instance was during the Korean war, and resulted in the relief of General MacArthur. MacArthur never accepted the basic concept of limitations on means. War, he said, meant that all other means were exhausted, and "there is no alternative than to apply every available means to bring it to a swift end. War's very objective is victory-not prolonged indecision.*0 MacArthur remains the most obvious reprentation of the American style, although admittedly at the extreme end. His public statements during the hearing following his relief reflect both the artificial separation of political and military considerations and absolutism.
To MacArthur anything less than a total approach introduced the 'concept of appeasement, the concept that when you use force you can limit that force." He expressly disagreed with a limitless extension of bloodshed without creating the potential for the decisive battle to destroy the enemy in the minimum amount of time and loss.
This does not suggest that the military is heavy handed or prone to military interventions.
Quite the contrary, the U.S. military has been historically reluctant to recommend military action. This resistance to resort to force is largely based on the U.S. military's understanding of the dynamic and costly nature of war, in political, social, and military terms.4 However, while reluctant to resort to arms, the military does not support limitations or restraints on the nature of force once the decision to employ military means has been made.
Over the past 20 years, American military experience has retained and even reinforced the absolutist tradition in the American military culture." Our experience in the jungles of Vietâ¢n, and limited excursions throughout the 1980's where U.S. forces were employed in ambiguous situations for limited purposes, was not accepted as consistent with the American Way of War. Restraints on the effective employment of the full panoply of American armed might was gravely frustrating.
The problem, however, is that prescriptions like absoltism do not match the contingent nature of warfare. The bias for short, intense, conventional, and total warfare creates conflict when the political situation does not permit the unlimited application of American force. A dire result of our preference for strategies of annihilation with maximum means for unlimited ends, is a distaste and poor capacity for unconventional warfare or for messy protrated conflicts with extensive constraints or political oversight.
Our preferences and professional ethos has resulted in a poor track record in *small wars" which by their very definition are limited and often protracted in time. "Resistance to a central role for special operations forces or recognition of the importance of the low intensity challenge continue to be deeply rooted" in our culture and the senior leadership.Y The central issue remains one of reconciling our need for effective intervention in situations not conducive to the organizational paradigms of our military culture, with the our status as a global power with global interests. It could be argued that either our national or political culture place us at a disadvantage in such situations. It could be further advanced that our strategic culture precludes effective intervention in such conflicts, and thus, we should avoid them. Others, however, have concluded that our poor track record is more the function of the military's cultural distaste for less than clear cut situations that are more conducive to their preferred operating style, concluding that:
The most substantial constraints on America's ability to conduct small wars result from the resistance of the American defense establishment to the very notion of engaging in such conflicts, and from the unsuitability of that establishment for fighting such wars."
However, past history continues to reveal situations where civilian authority deemed intervention necessary. Can our strategic culture, particularly the military institution, be adapted to the peculiar requirments of limited war?

The Modern Professional Officer and the State Civil-military relations constitute the arena where political considerations and military viewpoints merge. It is also the area of national security policy where political and functional perspectives clash. Within the American Way of War, civil-military relations is where the tectonic plates between our political culture and the military culture grind into one another.
The sole lubricant that reduces friction is the principle of civilian control of the military which is embodied in both law and our professional ethic. This area of study is frequently overlooked in national security studies, although well recognized as one of the timeless dimensions of conflict."
Within the literature on civil-military relations, there are two schools of thought about the maintenance of civilian control. The first school of thought emphasizes separation of military perpectives and the military from the political process entirely. This line of thought eiphaszes that the military has little time to be involved in, nor is competent at, the intrinsically complicated maers of internaional and domestic politics. This school, most ably represented by Samuel Huntington, prefer a form of objective control over the military by keeping them in a neutral and isolated position from politics.-This form of control is consistent with the traditional and the absolutist approaches to military force. Civilian control is essentially maintained by excluding the military from inputs on anything other than an advisory role on technical matters.
The other school in civil-military relations theory holds that political factors must be integrated with military advice and military considerations to produce effective policy decisions. Thus, the subjective control form of civilian control argues for maintaining civilian control over the military by integrating the military as a representative into policy making decisions. The military's interests and advice become *fused* into the political and decision making process under this line of thinking. The 'modern" general in this scenario reflects the Soldier/Statesman mold, vice the traditional, purely functional Warrior. The distinction to be emphasized in this alternative is that the military remains nonpartisan in domestic politics in this role. This view of the military's role is closer to Janowitz's praguatatt categorization.

Such a corrupted sense of professionalism would seriously undermine civilian control, and the effecNiven of civil-military redations, during a crisis. 'The principle of civilian control requires not only that the military not be policy maken," notes one recent examination of the isme by a team of political scientists, "but also that they not be seen (nor see themselves) as a aqnmt t whom intests are to be considered in policy debates."3 This requires a delicate equilibrium, and a refined sense of professionalism.
However, the altemative, objective control, is an even greater sin. Politicization of the military must be avoided, but since the nature of war, and democracy, mixes political factors and military nsiderions, the military is and must be politically conscious. "TO presume that military iprfessionals should remain unconcerned about the political and social conditions of potential aggressors, and the that the military should not be involved until the first shot is fired' is to neglect the lessons of modern war." To extend Clemenceau's maxim-war is too serious to be left solely to Generals or Statesmen.
During the past two decades the rine of the modern Soldier/Statesman has been clearly ascendent in the United States. This is consistent with the operative mode of civil-military relations but conflicts with the conclusion that absolutsm remains the predominant view of force in the military culture. In the past generation, numearus military officers, many with advanced education and experience outside a t-aditional military caree pattern have emerged.
Most of these officr have served in the White Houe in crisis management situations, involving extensive military and political decision making. The foregoing review supports the conclusion that the American Way of War now includes extensive representation of the military in policy making circles, and the suporting cotention that subjective control is the operative form of maintaining civilian control over the military today.
The difficulties of subjective control, particularly given the military's pervasive integratn in the national security bureauacy, needs to be underscored. Furthermore, the military's professional culture, absolutist prefrences, and political presence could make for difficult times. We have taken the issue of civil-military relations for granted. In a period when the Cold War military establishment is being dismantled, and when extensive societal influences are being imposed by fiat over the advice of the professional military leadership, harmonious relations are at risk. While a crisis is not inevitable, the potential exists and anyone who denies that "today's military shows symptoms of evident distemper ignores grave risks s'
The potential for conflict between elements of our strategic culture are greatest during deliberations over the employment of military force to achieve policy objectives.
Governments face nothing more serious than a decision to use violent means to resolve conflict. As stated very early in this chapter wise statecraft requires that we understand the p s of our national culture, including the military element, to account for the defects and diffences inherent in their character. Wise statesman will pay careful attention to "strategic culture" and the state of civil-military relations in these decisions. Professor
Huntington has warned: a pret advantage in the march for security. They increm their likelihood of zuching right answer& to operating isues of military policy. Naons which fad to develop a balanced p of civil-military relations squander their resources and run uncalculaed risks.
The American Way of War has changed in subtle ways over the past two decades.
The nt four chapters will trace thee changes and assess implicatio on our search for security and a property balanced pattern of civil-military relations. Westmoewdand and many other senior Army officers. By establishing a major Corps-level blockfi forces across the DMZ and into the Lotian panhanAle, the argument goes, we would have sruck at the source of the war, the North's aggression and support to the Viet Cong. Insmd, writes Summers, we turned to symptoms-the "simulated insurgency* in the South-rather than causes.31
The cardinal principle of war, according to Summers, is that offensive action is needed to achieve decisive results. This permits our forces to gain the initiative and facilitates the imposion of our will upon the opponent. Milhtary forces was employed defensively in South Vietnam, according to this line of reasoning, and military forces were aldlyein many security opeations, secuft assistance programs, and pacfication effort that should have been addressed by anotheragecy. Summers adamantly holds this position, despite the many -search and destroy' operations mounted in the 1967-1969 timefrme.
Summers also argues that we essentially misemployed our military by concentrating on "the other war" the pacification effort He underscores the need to understand the nature of the armed forces. "They are designed, equipped and trained for a specific task:' he wrote, "to fight, and win on the battlefield." They are a "battle ax,' a crude instrument of national policy with only a singular purpose, 'not a force for providing for nation-building activities.

A new a of lesson learned, or more accurately a new set of critics to the legacies of "pkying to win" emerged in the mid-1980's. Two specific efforts are of note because of "their superb scholarship and the author's standing as military officers vice political scientists or journalists. These two efforts are The Army and Vietnam by then Major Andrew F. Krepinevich, Jr., U. S. Army, and T limits of Air Powe by Major Mark Clodfelter, U.S.
Air Forcex Krepinevich's book stands in stark contrast with those sympathetic to Colonel Summer's interpretation about the application of overwhelming force in Vietnam.
Krepinevich's argument is succinct. Instead of adapting its institutional mindset and capabilities to the war at hand, a largely unconventional conflict, the U.S. Army doggedly insisted on fighting the war consistent with th American Way of War as it understood it-the application of conventional forces and massive amounts of firepower to decisively engage and destroy the main battle force of the opponnt.
Dr. Krepevich accuses the Army of remaining fixated with its own institutional paradigms and of "refighting the last war" despite the dramatically different circumstances it found itself in Vietnam. When the Army came to Vietnam, it was neither trained or equipped to fight effectively in an insurgency conflict, and stuck to what Krepinevich calls the Army Concept-a style of warfare consistent with the American Way of War deeply embedded in the service's psyche or memory. The Concept reflects the army's precept on how war's ought to be fought-short wars with decisive military battles relying on technology and fire power.
This says little for the institutional agility of the U.S. Army in particular and the American military as a whole. Moreover, Dr. Krepinevich, who has recently retired from active duty, but who is still deeply engaged in the study and assessment of U.S. national security thinks that the Army still lacks the ability to adjust its organization, tactics and doctrine to properly counter its opponent in an unconventional conflict comments:
For the Army, the Vietamn War still represents a series of unanswered questions, the foremost of which is; How could the army of the most powerful nation on earth, materially supported on a scale unprecedented in history, equipped with the most sophistica technology in an age when technology has assumed the role of a god of war, fail to emerge victorious against a numerically inferior foe of lightly armed kmgUlars7 Contrary to the positions of the participants or the institutional defenders, the revisionists and a number of Service unconventional warfare experts feel that the U.S. Army persistently ignored counterinsurgency warfare. According to Summers, the internal guerrilla threat was ignored because it would *wither on the vineo if external logistics support and infiltration from North Vietnam was eliminated. The People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) and the support of the North were seen as the center of gravity. This permitted us to focus on the war which we were best prepared for, both in material and doctrinal terms. The revisionists feel that we under-resourced the internal threat defense and the pacification program, a point supported by several government officials who served in Vietnam during this time.' Thus, Krepinevich's argument runs directly counter to Summer's assessment that we lost the war by our distraction with civilian strategists and guerilla warfare. The revisionist argument is that we lost the war because the military ignored the revolutionary and political aspects of the war. Our only lens of looking at the war made it seem a conventional military problem. Thus, *with its perspective on counterinsurgency distorted by its Concept, writes Krepinevich, "the Army convinced itself that airmobile forces provided the ability to conduct counterinsurgency operations using traditional operational doctrine." Thus, to the new school, the war was lost not by the fact that we were not permitted to win, but that the American military remained true to its own operational concepts about conventional war, based the firepower, technological and logistical dimensions of strategy while ignoring the political and social dimension that formed the foundation of an unconventional war. Taking the argument to its conclusion, Krepinevich feels the army failed because "It expended human resources at a relatively high rate and material resources in a profligate manner as part of a strategy of attrition.' The goal was to win a quick victory.
Yet the U.S. achieved neither a quick victory nor the maintenance of support on the home front for a continued U.S. presence."
The disproportionate emphasis on the external threat made the war more manageable in terms of the American Way of War. Yet, it turned out to be the wrong strategy according to the unconventional war chool. "The tragedy is," writes Krepinevich, *that the nature of the war required that emphasis be placed, first and foremost, on the internal threat to the stability and legitimacy of the South Vietnamese government.-2 9 This is again, in direct opposition to Colonel Summer's views that the war was lost because we dissipated our attention on 'the other war* and failed to see the conventional threat presented by the PAVN in the North.
Like the Army, the U.S. Air Force was anxious to put Vietnam behind it and thus failed to learn anything from it.3Â° What ever it did gain dealt with strategic bombing, tactics, or technology. Strategic lessons or errors were quickly phased out by a selective sorting of history. Like the Army, the Air Force did not teach anything about Vietnam in its professional schools, and it was not mentioned in their doctrinal manualsh.
Air power was a significant element in the war against North Vietnam. A total of 8,000,000 tons of bombs were delivered, with over 6 million tons by the Air Force alone.
The Air Force lost 617 fixed wing planes, and the United States lost a total of 8,588 fixed and rotary wing aircraft.' Air power enthusiasts almost universally concluded it was the limits on air power not the inherent limitations of air power that failed to bring the war to a conclusive ending in short order."
Like the Army, the Air Force's 'unhealthy myths" resulted in what air power historian Dr. Earl Thford calls a subtle 'stab in the backs thesis.'
The myths resulted in an institutional form of self-delusion about the efficacy of air power in Vietnam. The most pervasive of these myths is that airpower, specifically the UInebacker U campaign, won the war in 1972 by forcing the North Vietnamese to agree to our terms in Paris. The contention is that if air power had been employed unfettered earlier, in 1965, the war cpruld be teminated quickly and more favorably. In Admiral Thomas Moorer's words, 'Gradualism forced airpower into an expanded and inconclusive war of attrition."3
To subsequent air power scholars the Air Force developed a series of "unhealthy myths' that prevent it from learning anything from the war and from looking at it uncitically."
The military's professional advice was for a decisive and massive air campaign was rejected, Mietam who rejects the *we had our hands tied" theory. Clodfelter's major argument is the Air Force misapplied their European war doctrine to the Vietnamese conflict without any thought. In effect, the Air Force followed their preferred Concept just like the Army.
Clodfelter's thesis is that the failure of U.S. airpower in Vietnam cannot be blamed entirely on a lack of resolve by civilian politicians, micromanagement, constraints, or a myopic media. The problems experienced by the Air Force were caused as much by poor strategy, lack of targets, undeveloped technology, and poor coordination between Services, as by civilian oversight. 
41
The legacy of Vietnam remains mixed when it comes to how force should be applied.
The veterans of Vietnam claim the war supports the absolutist position about using force quickly and decisively. The argument still goes on today:
No More Vietnams means to me that when we do launch military forces in that noble ause of freedom we must do so with an absolute desire to win. When we go to war, we must go to win-that or stay at home.'
The revisionists counter that military had no effective strategies for winning and ignored the contingent aspects of the war. Dr. Ronald Spector, a historian who served in Vietnam in 1968 as a Marine, feels the root cause of the military's failure was its fixation on its traditional style of warfare which proved pointless and ineffective. Based on a position developed two decades after the war, Spector insists the failure to adapt to the situation contributed to the stalemate and indecision that was the war's primary characteristic. 
The area of civil-military relations remains one of the least conclusive legacies from
Vietnam. Much of the literature from the military perspective resents the impression that the military's performance was less than adequate, and the general opinion exists that the military was cast as the scapegoat." The participants hoped that history would eventually become more favorable to military than to the politicians and policy makers who called the shots.
As one author has noted, Vietnam "was a painful reminder for the military that they, not the transient occupants of high office, generally bear the heaviest burden during armed conflict.
T7h Vietnam experience reinforced the military perception that it was they who would bear the burden of blame in the policy port mortems. As one Army general quipped, "Those who ordered the meal were not there when the waiter brought the check. *
Regrettably, one of the lessons learned and institutionalized by many of the senior level participants is that civil-military relations were largely satisfactory. In his very last paragraph of his memoirs, General Westmoreland proudly observes, "the American people can be particularly proud that their military leaders scrupulously adhered to a basic tenet of our Constitution prescribing civilian control of the military'' General Westmoreland may be proud, but the American people should not be. The Vietnam War was fought employing a narrow interpretation of the proper interplay between policy makers and military men, and the end result speaks for itself. We can be satisfied that the principle of civilian control was maintained, but it is pretty clear that effective interaction between the Statesman and the Generals was far from satisfactory.
One Army general, in an understatement, wrote after the war that 'civil-military relations in the United States, especially at the highest levels where political and strategic issues become entwined, have not always been close and harmonious."-" General Palmer disagrees with premise that the military had their hands tied, and can pass off all blame. The military must share the onus of failure as well, he insists. He is especially critical of the senior military leaden in Washington for being unable to articulate their misgivings and communicate effectively to the policy makers. The central point is that U.S military leaders failed to get across the point that our strategy was not working,* and that it would achieve U.S. policy objectives within a reasonable cost.

The poor interaction between civilian policy makers and the Joint Chiefs of Staff began with Kennedy's assessment of the decision making process and inputs that led to the Bay of Pigs debacle. The general conclusion drawn by President Kennedy and his advisors was that the military viewpoint's was excessively narrow and the military lacked the ability to integrate social, political, and economic factors into their assessments and advice.
This conclusion was immediately reinforced by the events surrounding the Cuban missile crisis. Both Kennedy's took away several negative lessons about the flexibility and depth of recommendations from the Joint Chiefs. Eventually he felt compelled to issue a national security action memorandum to the Joint Chiefs charging them to include political and economic factors into their recommendations.5 Then Vice President Lyndon Johnson apparently picked up the same perspective on the quality and clarity of advice given by the Pentagon during these same crises. This fostered a degree of mutual distrust manifested when LBJ decided to control target selection and rules of engagement from the Oval Office itself.
Likewise, the Secretary of Defense, in a often cited example, had a clash with then Chief of Naval Operations over operational details during the Cuban missile crisis which did not increase his confidence that the U.S. military would remain, in the midst of super-heated confrontations with other nuclear powers,, a responsive instrument of national policy."
During the war, LB was particularly harsh on his military advisors. He dressed down the Army Chief of Staff for 'not giving me any...solutions to this damn little piss-ant country.. .I don't need ten generals to come in here.. .and tell me to bomb. I want some solutions.. .some answers.s'

For their part, the military leaders were critical of the intensive micromanagement they the military never offered useful strategic recommendations when Nixon came in and was eager for fresh military advice." Clausewitz warned that policy cannot be a tyrant and cannot get involved in tactical and operational details. Policy, he said, does not deal with the posting of guards and the sending of patrols. Yet during Vietnam, policy makers did post guards and send patrols. But the military never forcefully put its foot down and insisted on the proper division of labor between policy makers and military professionals.
The lesson learned was that politicians would hold the military responsible for policy failures even when politicians imposed limitations, failed to heed professional advice, or ignored the costs and risks inherent in using force. The senior military closed ranks after Vietnam and become even further reluctant to recommend the use of force.
Another popular conclusion about Vietnam among the military is the belief that the war was lost at home because we violated Clausewitz's dictum 'the people provide the passion and the motivation for war."` Explicit among various commentators is the belief that the civilian leadership made several key strategic errors during the course of the war to maintain public support. Within this line of reasoning are complaints about our:
-Failure to formally declare war -Failure to mobilize the reserves -Failure to ensure the draft was equitable -Failure to rally public support"
The lesson learned by the American military in Vietnam involves the third leg of the Clausewitz's *rer rkable trinity*-the people. The consensus, particularly acute among Army officers, seems to suggest that the American people has a duty and a role in the authorization of military force, beyond that delegated to their elected representatives in the Congress and the President. This conviction can be summed up by the statement that war is a shared respnmsibility between the people, the government, and the military.' 0 Such a conclusion from Vietnam also reflects a popular assessment of the capacity of democracies to effectively wage war that dates back to Thucydides and runs to de Tocqueville. In the American military experience, this has been captured by General
Marshall's oft quoted comment that *democracies cannot fight a Seven Year's War."" To many military officers, the Vieam war only reinforced this conclusion. The social unrest and tumdl generated by opposition to the war, the fragging of officers, resistance to cnspon, and widspred drug ab throughout our society reflected the disintegation of a social system cracked by pressures beyond its capacity to withstand. This is traced back to a failure to unite the American people behind a war effort requiring social and personal sacrifices. To several prominent analysts, the solution is the promulgation of a declaration of war to validate the support of the people and the employment of the people's Army. As
Colonel Summers has noted:
If Vietnam proved nothing else, it proved that the equivalent of a declaration of war-that is, the fixing of public will and the sharing of the -esponsibility for the Looking back on the discussion of the purported necessity of public support, it appears that such conclusions are warranted when the United States intends to fight major conflicts to which significant amounts of forcm and resoâ¢rces are being applied. This is of course axiomatic of the Anerican Way of War as seen by the U.S. military. But the lesson to draw is not that democracin cannot fi&t long wn, but that popular support is difficult to maintain during staeuates or practed struggles with little apparent progress.
Former CIA Director, and a forme pacification program participant, William Colby who argues The real lesson is not that Americans cannot fight a long war or that we should eschew revolutionary conflicts because we found ourselves at a cultural disadvantage..7
The real lesson from the war is more accuately reflected in a general proposition that protad and inconclusive ground warfare will not command public support indefinitely. 
7
Above all, Americans remain pragmatic. To be continue providing support, Americans must sense that the results are commenmate with the involvement. They must perceive some sense of reasonable benefit, derived from a general cost-benefit analysis. The general population seems to be willing to sustain major involvements over a short term, or a minor involvement over a longer term, if convinced that the results are worth the effort. What pragmatic Americans cannot support is a major involvement over a long term without results.
If a minor conflict is going to be extended in terms of time, the military strategy and political leadership will have to provide the American people '"incremental dividends* that indicate some progress towards a reasonably clear goal-7
Long wars or unconventional conflicts are not an inherent weakness of democracy itself.
The Soviet Union's experience in Afghanistan showed that neither totalitarian regimes democracies can long emdue 'a long, unfocused, inconclusive, and bloody war far from home, for unidentified or ill-defined national objectives."7 Additionally, both the Israelis and the British have had long experiences with low-intensity conflicts.
The American military in the decade after Vietnam fervently believed that the war was The lack of clarity between military objectives or political objectives is also a criticism of the military's leaders. It does not speak well of the military if over 100 generals admit to having sent 500,000 men to combat in a sense of confusion. Nor does it say much for the leaderhi to have fought a conflict that claimed 58,000 lives, without any clear sense of purpose.
No one has satisfactorily proven that their alternative strategies would produce a decisive victory. Colonel Summer's thesis that a massive defensive barrier in Laos and Cambodia is predicated on an assumption that such a force would elmininate support from the North for the Viet Cong. How such a defensive and passive effort, not to mention costly and protracted program, would achieve U.S. aims is problematic. No one has yet offered a plan for "playing to win' aside from full scale invasion options which dearly exceed the policy limits of the Administration and the international political context of the Cold War.
Civil-military relations were marginal because the military submitted passively to the decisions made by the President and the Secretary of Defense. More effective relations would have resulted in a better integration of political and military perspectives and helped the President understand the costs and risks of the decisions he made in 1965. The military properly learned that it would have to be more vocal, and that their voice would have to intrate military and political considerations.
The military feels that public support is crucial to the war. The failures of the civilian leadership to generate and sustain this support via mobiiation generated a subtle "stab in the back" syndrome. American policy makers should get the primary credit for losing the war, but not on the basis of poor maintenance of the home front. Krepinevich finds that the U.S.
military is "perpetuating the fiction that its Concept of war remains valid in all conflict environrents" and that future problems can be solved by staying the course with national consensus from the President, Congress, and the American people and by acceding execution of the war entirely to the military. This is the most significant lesson learned, and the most erroneous, since the U.S. military never had an effective strategy for "playing to win" in Vietnam. What might be a more appropriate lesson is the conclusion that public support is a product of success, not a pre-condition.
Thus, the military moved into the 1980's convinced that a vocal insistence for clear objectives (spelled out in military terms), sufficient troops and resources to accomplish the mission, with few constraints or interference, and an assurance of public support was a reasonable and justifiable set of conditions to be met for the military to accept another U.S. 
Blesed are he Peacemakeâ¢, for thy hL be cded the children of God.
Matthew 5:9
The introduction of U.S. forces to Lebanon in 1982 was the next event in the development of institutionalized attitudes about the proper use of force. It was not a pleasant experience. In many ways it was "De ja vu, all over again,* to borrow an aphorism from Yogi Berra. Ambiguous missions, political interference, constraints, and interaction in a messy political situation were all associated with Vietnam and were seen again in Lebanon.
It was not a situation conducive to the American Way of War, military victory was not sought nor defined in terms the U.S. military could understand. Vietnam's bitter lessons were reinforced and hardened by the loss of 241 warriors. Post-conflict analyses, in the form of commissions and hearings, sought convenient answers, clouding the adoption of useful lessons out of the experience. The lessons that did evolve sought to reduce the reliance on military force as an instrument of U.S. foreign policy. These lessons established guidelines for when and how the harsh cutting edge of military force could be best employed. These guidelines mirrored the military culture's operational code.
Yet the record has been subjected to erroneous revisionism and distortion. It is difficult to determine if the military has learned lessons at all. In the words of one major participant, writing to help set the "distorted-record straight, "the Marines will surely have died in vain if we do not learn the right lessons.* 1
The U.S. military did not escape the fallout from the policy failure. Nor did it sit still in the aftermath and stoically accept blame. In many ways, Beirut reinforced the lessons of Vietnam about politicians, and the irresponsible actions of a Congress more concerned with partisan advantage and eluding responsibility than fulfilling a meaningful role in foreign policy. Like Vietnam, the military failed to accept any of its own shortfalls, either iJ the policy-making arena, or on the ground in Lebanon. In the words of one observer of the Joint Chiefs and military influence in policy circles:
The U.S. intervention in Lebanon was the most crucial of the 1980's. Both phases of U.S. participation were opposed by professional military leaders, and when the venture ended grimly it thoroughly reinforced the lessons of Vietnam to them.

Weinberger was silent, but according to Shultz resisted implementing actions during subsequent meetings between State and OSD. 
1
An officer familiar with the background on this momentous decision and the continued resistance from Weinberger and the Pentagon noted that they 'had not been able to avoid a deployment into Lebmon, but they did ensure that any deployment would be kept small, militarily noncommittal, and ready to be withdrawn as soon as politically possible.2
"Cribbing" off the NSDD that directed the deployment, the crucial mission statement for the MAU was largely written by EUCOM itself, and was closely reviewed by senior officers including General Rogers.n The mission statement was closely coordinated with the Joint Staff, the Secretary of Defense, and EUCOM. The mission was detailed as follows:
To establish an environment which will permit the LAP to carry out their responsibilities in the Beirut Area. When directed, USCINCEUR will introduce U.S. Forces as part of a multinational force presence in the Beirut area to occupy and secure positions along a designated section of the line from south of the BIA to a position in the vicinity of the Presidential Palace; be prepared to protect U.S. Forces; and on order, conduct retrograde operations as required."
The Marines landed in Beirut on September 29, 1982. They were assigned positions in and around the Beirut International irport (BIA), which was specifically selected by the Defense Department because it presented the least exposed of the military sectors being allotted to the MNF. The French took up positions in downtown Beirut and its labyrinth of streets and alleys. The French had a different perception of their mission, they "kicked ass' when they arrived and maintained a firm posture that brooked no nonsense in their sector.
As Eric Hammel wrote later, "they were never loved nor even admired, but they were respected.'" The Italians got the worst of the lot and were assigned the slums and three major refugee camps.
The Marine position at the BIA was hardly a resort. It was an area visited by extensive fightin during the past severa years. Buildings around the airport had been used by fighting forces from both sides duing the combat operations of the previous year. Many destroyed vehicles and numerous minefield: would have to be cleared to make the arm usable.
During the month of October, the Marines stayed busy with their internal guard Beirut into a set of criteria to guide future uses of America's combat force. This criteria eventually became widely known as the Weinberger doctrine after its originator and most vigorous defender.
Mr. Weinberger's criteria on when force should be used were reduced to six relatively simple steps. Force should be used only:
-In support of vital U.S. interests.
-With the full and wholehearted intent of *winning."
-With clearly defined political and military objectives.
-When circumstances change, reassessments must determine if force is still required. If fighting and winning are not required, then forces should be withdrawn.
-With "reasonable assurance' of public and Congressicnal support.
-Only as a last resort, when all other means have failed.  The original proposal, developed by the NSC, was to have a large force composed of several divisions to physically separate all warring parties. Mr. Weinberger resisted this attempt, which he found consistent with "the passionate desire to use our military" on the part of the NSC staff. 
4 2
Weinberg war actually resisting sending AU forces. What Mr. Weinberger memoirs do not describe is any contributions he made to refining the mission statement to ensure the Pentagon understood what was required of them. Nor does he describe his own efforts to offer alternatives or cost/risk assmesents to assist the NSC in properly constituting a mission, or the proper size and guidelines for the intervention.
Mr. Reagan and the NSC were aware of Pentagon resistance to the deployment, and saw both OSD and the Joint Staff as obstructionists saddled with the infamous Vietnam Syndrome.
Thus, their voice in policy making circles was ignored because of the perception that they were not part of any solution. The objective remained clear to Mr. Reagan, the NSC, and the State Department, yet no one knew how to get there. The Pentagon's resistance did not ameliormt this problem.
After the decision was made to deploy the force, Mr. Weinberger continued efforts to define the mission in the narrowest of terms, limiting the size and the capability of the force.
What was the mission? The Reagan administration, contrary to critics, had defined a political objective and end state in Lebanon. A sovereign and peaceful Lebanon, secure within its own borders, without either civil war or foreign forces, was the objective." The NSC failed to translate that objective into a strategy comprised of ways and means that would contribute to the desired end state. No one matched the political objective to the various efforts being executed in the Nation's name.
The Marines on the ground in Lebanon perceived their mission as one of presence. However, "presnce" is not assigned as the mission or the intent. The action verb and overall intent is to *establish an environment" in which the government of Lebanon could reconstitute itself and assert rule and order over Beirut and eventually the rest of the country.
A key element of the mission statement called for reestablishing the LAF. This implies a function of 'nation building" and security assistance which the military disdained since Vietnam.
For many reasons, the Marines defined their role in both neutral and passive terms as one of 'presence.* In his testimony after the bombing, General Kelley stated 'Our basic mission is presence, and the logical question is -how do you define presence .... It is not a classic military mission.' This term was interpreted by the Marines to mean that they had to be visible to provide *a backdrop which would be conducive to the stability of Lebanon, we had to be seen by the people."I To be seen, the Marines had established patrols and regular contacts with various factions. They developed links to the communities through minor civic action projects and a medical assistance program.
The Marines imply that the "presence" mission precluded massive fortifications to defend themselves. The argument is that sealing off the airport from traffic, and isolating the Marines from the populace was inconsistent with their assigned mission. In his testimony, General Kelley claimed it was impossible to establish a hard point defense consistent with the mission statement as perceived, and the position of the BLT building poised as it was in the midst of a busy international airport, a facility "literally crawling with civilians."'
In retrI ecayt the excuse that fortifications were inconsistent with the mission, and the view that the Marines were expected to 'tough it out" while exposed to mortar, rocket, and points out that naval gunfire had already been employed on 16 September, and that it would be impossible for the many Moselm positions to have been able to distinguish between gunfire intended for self-defense and that intended to support the LAF. "Ther were those who claimed that these actions cost us the protection of our neutral status,' noted Lehman, but the Marines were seen by all factions as combatants and therefore "fair game" long before September. 'As for the policy of neutrality," Lehman adds, "it was difficult to understand what our mission could be, if it was not to support the legal Lebanese government, however hopeless."'
In sum, it was not that the purpose of the deployment was not clear. The military resisted being integrated with the other instruments of national power, in a subordinate position, in an operational environment inconsistent with its preferred paradigm. The Pentagon did not agree with the policy, at best just misinterpreted it, and at worst provided half-hearted support.
The U.S. military was not permitted to carry out its mission in Lebanon in accordance with its historical and deeply rooted preference for "carrying the war to the enemy," and seeking *the destruction of the enemy's armed forces and his ability to wage war.""
Offensive operations against an opposing force, playing by the sort of rules the Pentagon's military culture understands, was not appropriate in Lebanon. This should not have ruled out an effective role for the Marines in support of the diplomatic mission and the MNF.
However, many within the U.S. military did not walk away with that as a lesson. The lesson heard from many is that the Marines should never have been sent. This is true, in the sense that the policy and strategy should have been developed prior to the deployment. In the military's eyes, they once again found themselves hamstrung by politicians and meddlers who failed to understand the inherent nature of war or military force. As detailed in the Weinberger doctrine, if you cannot enter into a situation with sufficient force, and with the clear intention of "winning,' then the military should not be sent. The last thing the military wanted was another quagmire where they became shooting ducks while diplomats dallied.
The military did not want to find itself in another swamp, incrementally adding firepower, to achieve some nbdmlo political objective.
Anothe aipc very reminiscent of Vimnamn is the myth that the Marines had their 'hands tied behind their backsO with restrictive rules of engagement OBecause of ROE restrictions, the sentries weapons were not loaded," noted one military writer basing his assessment from the published Long Commission. 
5
The ROE did not a preclude sufficient defensive measures, obstacles, or an alert guard force.
The Long Commission faulted the local commanders for adjusting their own security steps, despite the great tensions that existed in Beirut since August.n
Colonel Geraghty was asked by both the Long Commission and by Congressional investigators whether or not his rules of engagement were derived from his own perceptions of the mission; or forced down by an indifferent outside source such as the State Department.
The MAU commander admitted 'No sir, in all honesty, it was my own perception."'3
However, many other writers continue to insist that the Marines were not permitted to defend themselves. One Marine veteran recalls that 'When asked to improve the position, the answer was: "Denied. We requested to build tank ditches around the building, we were told no. Offiials didn't want to send the impression that we were hunkering down.'"s Such comments do not square with Colonel Geraghty's testimony and have not been proven by anything in the historical record.
The term civil-military relations in this research effort goes beyond the more traditional view of the proper relationship between civilian policy makers and military leaders who execute policy. While civilian control of the military is a given under our system, effective policy making and implementation goes past just a simple dominance of policy over the military. A proper civil-military working relationship makes policy implementation feasible.
An honest and candid exchange of viewpoints is needed before the Statesman and the General make that first supreme judgment.
It is during the course of the interaction between policy and military considerations that the ground is set for success. Good decisions are neither the result of a purely political or purely military viewpoint Bad policy dooms the conduct of military operations. In fact, a brilliant military strategy will rarely salvage a poorly defined objective or an inappropriate policy.
Within the context of this project, civil-military relations addresses the broader scope of the management of the inherent tensions between political considerations and the military instrument. It includes the provision for an adequate voice for military considerations during the development of policy. Additionally, it also addresses the proper interaction of political and military considerations since *policy cannot be a tyrant" and may have to be radically changed in light of military factors."
Civil-military relations in this country have been tenuous during our major conflicts.
Lebanon was not a major conflict, but the seeds of discontent and mistrust planted during Vietnam were in full bloom. The degree of mistrust threatened effective civilian control and the proper integration of military viewpoints during the development of policy aims and the corresponding strategy.
The concept of civilian control of the military is taken for granted in the U.S., and it is not ever defined in the American military literature. In fact, some naively believe "the absence of a definition has served us well. 
'
Lessons learned about Lebanon and the tragedy of the Marine unit have turned into a "round robin of recrimination."' The only clear record seems to be that once again the wrong lessons if any have been learned from the debacle. The intervention in Lebanon did have many similar factors between it and the dismal experience of Vietnam. 
7
The false lesson about the clarity of purpose and the vagueness of the "presence mission" masks the real lesson that there was a lack of congruence between what we were trying to accomplish in terms of a political end state, and the role and tasks assigned to the military.
The clarity of purpose issue also hides the failure of the policy making apparatus to evaluate, and direct adjustments to if necessary, the proposed military actions taken by the Defense Department.
With respect to the establishment of clear objectives, both political and military, the Pentagon bears a great burden. Both the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs resisted the deployment of the Marines as part of the MNF. The President overruled the military advice rendered by the Pentagon, without really ever getting a full hearing for their position.
Rather than providing full support after the President's decision had been rendered, the JCS resisted the task further. The Pentagon defined a narrow mission for the Marines, ensured they were deployed in inappropriate size or capability, and limited their freedom of action in support of the policy objectives sought by the Administration.
Had the military been able to throw off the Vietnam syndrome and taken energetic steps to deploy a force properly sized and equipped to the mission dictated by the political situation, the ultimate tragedy of 
October, 1983
Ultimately, the failure in Lebanon belongs in Washington, and should be shared by the full membership of the NSC. The military prefers to define the problem as simply a matter of a fuzzy objectives or an improper use of military force to support diplomacy. Actually, as shown earlier, the political objective is clear. The problem lies in developing a military strategy that could buy sufficient time to generate a viable Lebanese government, with the necessary supporting institutions (which includes a vastly improved LAF) to govern the greater Beirut area. Such a task should not have been perceived as requiring a neutral stance.
In fact an activist stance to establish a satisfactory environment for both the Lebanese In sum, there is little credence to be given to the charge that the mission was poorly defined or an inevitable failure. A solution was feasible, if the proper means were placed at the disposal of the commander on the scene. What had happened though was something in between. One Representative hit tho. ., oi : head. "If we are there to keep peace, we are far too few,* noted one Congressmar, 1T Ne are there to die, then we are far too many."` Since the local tactical commander accuYately sensed that he had insufficient forces to accomplish anything reasonably approaching a !olution to the political environment he found himself in, he was reduced to limiting his vulnerabilities. T-'illusion of neutrality" was his answer, and the loss of 241 souls the result.
The Pentagon's lessons are found in Mr. Weinberger's six criteria. Force is only to be used as a last resort, for vital interests, for clear political and military objectives, when the conditions permit the military to be deployed with the wholehearted intent of winning, and with some expectation of support from Congress and the American people. Beirut met none of these. The U.S. military collectively agreed with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Thomas Vietnam, pure and simple. We've been in that stuff before. " What the military wanted was feasible and attainable objectives set in clear terms with no hesitation to use military force in the manner in which the senior leadership felt it could be optimally used.
In the conduct of his research, the same reporter found that the military officers he spoke to, in case after case, referred to Weinberger's criteria. They all also insisted that "deploying combat troops to Panama met none of those criteria."' Yet, all added that if ordered to execute a feasible plan with clearly defined military missions, they would execute the orders of their superiors.
Operation Just Cause, designed by several Vietnam veterans, reflected everything they knew about war. The planning reflected the military's paradigm in every manner. There was no gradualism, passive "presence," signalling, or obtuse academic bargaining strategies. The aircraft in motion at one time in a small air zone. A total of 27 separate targets, many of which were struck simultaneously, were planned and rehearsed in detail. More than 12,000 troops were to be airlifted into Panama to reinforce the 13,000 or more already there. The plan also called for massive applications of troops and firepower to overwhelm any resistance, and shock the PDF from further resistance.
The operation was conducted by a series of task forces coded by color that were assigned the major tasks and missions that comprised the operations order. The last major assault of the operation was the airborne assault on Rio Hato, home of the 6th and 7th PDF companies. The defenders at this field were stunned by two 2,000-lb pounds delivered by the F-I 17's. The assault troops quickly followed in behind the air strike, parachuting in from only 500 feet up instead of the normal 800 feet, to reduce their exposure to enemy ground fire. This has been described as one of the sites of the hardest fighting during Just Cause.3
The last major element in the operation was Task Force Pacific. This task force was comprised of the Airborne troops who landed at Torrijos, and was assigned three separate au assault missions. The first was to assault Cerro Tinajitas, home to the 1st Company, PDF.
Fort Cimarron, to the northeast of the airfield, was the second objective. Fort Cimarron was the base for the vaunted Battalion 2000. Last, the airborne troopers were to secure Panama Viejo, on the coastline. It was the barracks for the UESAT, a specially trained antiterrorist unit, roughly 250 strong, considered to be fiercely loyal to Noriega. These objectives were swiftly taken, despite some stiff but spotty resistance."
Security operations continued throughout the next day, including the defense of the American embassy. Forces were dispatched to secure the rescue of American civilians and other foreign nationals at the Marriott Hotel. During this phase, an intramural firefight between American forces resulted in the deaths of two foreign photographers.Is Forces moved to secondary objectives such as securing almost all government buildings, setting up roadblocks, and trying to find Noriega. There was little interference from either the general population or the Dignity Battalions. Several Special Forces officers were successful in convincing Panamanian units in outlying areas to surrender over the phone.
Organized resistance was gone, but the hunt for Noriega continued unabated without success.
Four days later, Noriega slipped into the Papal Nuncio's residence and requested asylum.
After a lengthy and public standoff, he surrendered to U.S. military authorities and was arrested and whisked away to Florida by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
In the aftermath of the conflict however, serious deficiencies in the planning and coordination of the operation became apparent. As the fighting wound down, the disorder of a small Third World nation without a government or without any services was apparent. "
Equally apparent was SOUTHCOM lack of preparedness to stabilize the rioting, looting, and public disorder occurring in the aftermath of the invasion. "In moving from combat operations to stability operations," writes a team ofjournalists, "the Army went from strength to weakness."a 7
In the aftermath of the operation, attention initially focused on the brighter side of the equation. The military was justifiably proud of the scope and speed of the intervention.
From the President's approval on the 17th of December, to the initiation of combat early on the 20th, the rsosiveness of the armed forces was a remarkable feat. Brilliantly conceived, from a purely military perspective, the plan was executed despite the friction of war and accomplished its major objectives with crushing firepower and shock action. General
Powell called it the most complex and best executed operation he was involved in.I task force commander responsible for executing the plan, Lieutenant General Carl Stiner called it so good there were no lessons to learn from it.I Others have recognized that such an assertion is an overstretch and that there must be lessons learned from every conflict. Some reflect areas of improvement, while others just reinforce lessons learned earlier.
According to military sources, the Pentagon and SOUTHCOM received clear political objectives from the President in approving its final plans for Just Cause. The president also used the same political objectives in explaining to the American public and their Congressional leaders, why the U.S. was compelled to intervene in Panama. The express reasons offered were to:
-Protect American lives, -Restore the democratic process, -Protect the integrity of the Canal treaties, and -Apprehend Noriega?
Translating the political objectives into military tasks was theoretically accomplished by General Powell and General Thurman during their planning sessions. Protecting American lives drove the planners to seek an overwhelming strike force to overcome any and all resistance quickly. Cpturimg Noriega was assigned as a specific task, and crushing the PDF was deemed necessary to ensure that a permanent solution could be sought. The military did not want to simply use a surgical strike to grab Noriega. As one participant put it, that would have just made a "promotion opportunity for another thug."' 
2
Restoring the democratic process was also an assigned political objective. How the proposed operation plan was to achieve this was not clear. "Bringing about democracy' is not the sort of mission that readily lends itself to a military objective. President Bush's National Security Advisor, former Air Force lieutenant General Brent Scowcroft specifically asked how the plan served to achieve this explicit objective. He was informed that the plan was to secrety swear in President-elect Endara just before the invasion.? This apparently was the extent of the military's interpretation of what was necessary to restore the democratic process in Panama.
A Reserve officer on SOUTHCOM staff, a specialist in civil-military operations, was a participant in the development of the early combat and restoration plans called Blue Spoon and BUnd Lagi*, had a different view. In a series of assessments after the campaign, this officer concluded that the strategic success of Just Cause was hampered by a planning process that never had a clear political objective.n While acknowledging that the President did annunciate a series of objectives, none of these were provided during the extensive planning process that drove SOUTHCOM's operational planning. They came after the plan.
While taking down Noriega was always planned, what was supposed to replace him and the PDF was only thought of internally by a handful of staff officers and never was reduced to a formal, coordinated plan.
In Panama the military was finally allowed to plan and execute a military intervention consistent with every tenet of the American Way of War. The invasion was not a contest.
It was a practice session on the application of overwhelming force-a scrimmage against an NCAA Division M opponent.
The senior officers were all Vietnam veterans-leery of piecemeal, tit-for-tat applications of force. 2 ' Instead of incremental applications of force and firepower, Noriega and his hapless PDI got the full dose. According to an officer who was involved in the planning, "time and again during the planning process, the idea of applying overwhelming combat power was espoused." 
25
The lesson was not lost on Congress either, including those scarred by their experience during Vietnam. Representative David McCurdy (D-Ok), a veteran of that conflict noted:
The one lesson from Vietnam is clear and absolute, and that is the issue of decisive force. It may be a sledgehammer, but if we are going to be in conflict and going in on the heavy side saves American lives, then we ought to lean that way. I think that's the most significant lesson from Vietnam, in the Gulf and Panama we played to win. 
'
Because of this initial advantage, SOUTHCOM massed more than 25,000 troops against as little as 4,000 combat effectives and several thousand Dignity Battalion members. The results were preordained. The force struck with both surprise and an awesome display of air and ground firepower to shock the PDF. In comparison to Beirut, the rules of engagement were simple. According to one Battalion operations officer 'if you see anybody with a weapon, they are dead,"' In execution, however, the young and untested Soldiers and Marines an the ground were much more disciplined and responsible than that sounds."
A NATO ally captured the 'playing to win' aspect of Just Cause better than anyone else.
The lesson Panama will teach the American military is that if you're going to go in somewhere, go in with everything possible. This officer added After Grenada people started thing about rapid and selective low profile operations--all that low-intensity stuff. But the truth is that nobody in the brass was keen on it. And the success of Panama will reinforce their prejudice: go in big. 
2
The inputs into the campaign planning, and the concept of operations, for Just Cause were almost exclusively from the Pentagon and military leaders. Accordingly, the military was satisfied with the plan, and feels that the relationship between civilians and military was satisfactory during the build-up to the invasion of Panama. It was far different than Vietnam
or Beirut, with little interaction and almost no political interference. Tre military developed a plan, pitched it to their superiors in general terms, and were authorized to execute it as designed. In the words of a retired military officer, Just Cause "showed what professional soldiers can accomplish when allowed to do their jobs without micro-management and secondguessing from on high.*- Vietnam, where the civilian leadership hadn't been willing to commit the force necessary to accomplish the military objectives."- 
3
Out of this experience, some generals concluded that the lack of involvement by civilian leadership in the detailed planning was instrumental to its success."' "We planned it, rehearsed it, and briefed the leadership-no one fiddled with it," in the words of Lieutenant General Carl Stiner, commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps. 
3
Had there been a willingness to bring in OSD policy experts or the State Department, and better civil-military relations, Mr. Cheney could have confirmed that assessment. Better relations would have allowed a more open exchange and analysis of the military's proposed plan, and offered constructive recommendations to ensure that force was being used in such a manner to guarantee that the political goals were being served. This could have prevented the disorder and looting problems, and would have at least precluded the clumsy Endara installation.
In contrast to the Lebanon crisis, the War Powers Act (WPA) was not relevant in Panama since it was such a short and apparently successful operation. Congress was in recess for the Christmas holiday, and several members were already on record for more forceful actions.
Despite his own inclinations towards a strong Executive in foreign policy matters, Mr. Bush did write letters to Congressional leaders, as required under the law, notifying them of his actions, but like all Presidents he did not request approval or invoke the WPA time clock."
However, the issue of popular support did rear itself in this intervention. It was manifested by the military's conscious efforts to deny the media ready and uncontrolled access to the battlefield. The fallout from the resulting criticism proved that the relationship between the military as an institution and the media was a "troubled embrace" at best.' It revealed the lingering antipathy between the media and the military, and the military's preferred solution to handling a meddlesome press. It also the adversarial relationship stemming from Vietnam was still very much alive and that "the clash of cultures between the press and the military is a constant." 
4 1
Operation Just Cause is difficult to evaluate. The conflict was short, clear cut, and decisive in military terms. There is no doubt that the military felt that it had accomplished everything it was asked to do. Clearly, the miliary was permitted to execute the operation consistent with the paradigm it preferred, and the model developing during the 1980's. Just as clearly, the military walked away feeling vindicated that this paradigm was the proper way to conduct ourselves in future situations. The circumstances surrounding the contingency however, make the conflict a model only for that specific location, and may not be applicable in another enaido where force or the threat of force is required. So the military planned on the basis of 'playing to win,' which was fine from the purely military perspective, but could have been disastrous from a broader strategic level. The military should not have excluded political and civilian agencies from outside of the military.
The strategic end state was of a very political nature, but the military planning focused solely on military aspects of the problem. The execution and follow up threatened public confidence in the government installed by U.S. forces, thus, seriously threatening the overall objective of restoring democracy. Dol) officials and SOUITCOM failed to prepare the battlefield by bifurcating the planning process into political and military cells that were never integrated."
The major complaint was that the military operation reflected a politically unsophisticated view of the strategic objective of restoring a democracy quickly and effectively. The operation did not eliminate TV and radio stations that could have rallied support to Noriega.
Planners failed to protect the Embassy soon enough. An attack there could have had major ramifications. In addition, the task force did little to protect another potential hostage site at the Marriott Hotel.
Other critics believed the operation used an inappiropriat amount of firepower, which contributed to civilian casualties (more than 300 civilians died) and collateral damage. Others were critical of the lack of interaction with the State Department and pointed to the clumsy handling of the swearing in of Noriega's successor. SOUTHCOM did not think through the delicate aspects of installing the Endara government without too much overt Yankee baggage.
More importantly, the planners failed to realize the economic costs of the disorder and looting would undercut the newly constituted government."
With respect to public support, once again the paradox of public support appears. The military wants public support for its actions but it brooks no interference and wants support to be unconditional at least while the operation is ongoing. The military's preoccupation with operational security is completely understandable. However, the actions of both the Pentagon and the local SOUTHCOM bureaucracy went well past security issues. Even after the battle was over the military controlled access to soldiers back in CONUS for several days," refused to answer questions regarding civilian casualties, and refused access to military combat camera footage taken during the war.
This post-battle abuse reduces the credibility of the excuses offered during the midst of the crisis. They lend additional credence to criticisms of the antipathy between the media and the military and the dangers to democracy if it is not checked. As General Trainor, now director of the National Security Program at the J.F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, notes, "the antimedia attitude that has been fostered in young officers must be exorcised if both the military and media are to serve well the republic for which they stard.*61
The military must learn to balance its concerns for security with the needs of the media.
An adversarial relationship could be very damaging for the U.S. military over the long run.
For its part, the press makes too much of trying to get information quickly and without detailed analysis or objectivity. Two competitive cultures will eventually have to settle on some sort of medium to balance the needs of military security with those of a pluralistic society that must reluctantly rely upon a free press to balance the temptations of ambition.
In summary, the Pentagon's preferred paradigm was tested in Panama and found satisfactory by the military. Despite the unique circumstances surrounding this operation, the U.S. military walked away feeling good about its planning and execution of this battle laboratory. On the whole, the operation was a huge tactical success, and achieved its major operational objectives. Yet, the professed claims to clear objectives, use of overwhelming force, and oversimplified civilian-military policy making reflect the limitations of relying upon force to achieve lasting political outcomes. They specifically highlight the shortcomings of the American military, and the need for continued interaction between policy makers and the military's leadership in crisis situations.
Panama reinforced the predisposition towards short and decisive operations using all the firepower and technology available to the American military. Quick and violent engagements results in minimal friendly casualties, wards off an inquisitive press, and precludes any seeds of doubt back at home. Short and conclusive military operations preclude opportunities for political oversight or civilian interference from either the White House on Capitol Hill.
"Convinced that civilian micro-management ruined us in Vietnam, and that a willingness to give wide discretion to the military in Panama made that operation a success,...the officer corps fears that sound military logic will go by the board if politicians begin to take too close an interest in the conduct of operations.-" Many of the same decision makers from Just Cause are still in place during the next major U.S. military intervention.
n 1 yonden?
While General Powell is frequently characterized as the "reluctant warrior" during the buildup, 'in truth, they had all been reluctant warriors, badly scarred from Vietnam and wary of a fickle public that could cheer the armed forces off to war but turn venomous if things went badly."

It is understandable, but perhaps ironic, that the Vietnam analogy was raised so often by the military, the media, and the Congress during the prelude to the Gulf war. In many ways the entire strategic, operational, and tactical situations between Vietnam and Desert Storm are starkly dissimilar. In fact, just a cursory review reveals far more dissimilarities than common elements.6
Arguably both crises occurred a great distance from the shores of America, and were situated in a locale that the common American was hard pressed to find on a map. Just like Vietnam, the local governments were involved in a long standing feud. Likewise, the issues that generated the conflict were not entirely clear cut. Our own interests were not crystal clear, given the nature of the regimes we sought to defend. Our national interests in both conflicts were geopolitical in nature, and hard to define to the average American in concrete terms.
The similarities end at this point. What was different? Just about everything that counts in military term he nature of the terrain was a sharp contrast from the Central Highlands or IMeng Delfa of Southeast Asia. This war would be fought in open featureless terrain.
Ths war would have fronts, and clearly defined rear areas. The "bad guys' wore uniforms and occupied military positions instead of hiding in villages. This was a playing field far more conducive to the American Way of War. It had goal posts and sidelines. The equipment that we brought to the arena could be used to maximum effect. The contest would be fought with jet aircraft, armor units up to Corps size, long-range reconnaissance and sensor systems, laser-designated weapons, sea-launched cruise missiles, and precision guided munitions. This war would have targets. The full panolopy of American technology and resource base could be, and would be, brought to bear. In distinct contrast to the trauma of Vietnam, this war would be fought with our playbook and our rules.
At the strategic and operational levels, there are just as many dissimilarities. The major factor being that the nature of the war, the opponent, and the terrain combined to fit the American style of combat. The end of the Cold War is often overlooked as a major distinction. World opinion was far more united with the end of the superpower confrontation.
The Soviet Union could not materially interfere, and the United Nations could actually serve its purpose for once. Iraq, again in a clear cut departure from Hanoi, found itself cut off from external support, isolated from the international community, and burdened with economic sanctions.
In the final analysis, despite the contrasts in analogy, the American military went to Southwest Asia with every intention of purging the Vietnam experience from its memory.
Ironically, Hussein operated on every level as if the United States had learned nothing. He sw the same *paper tiger* and gave too much credence to the "straw giant" criticisms of a few Wormers.' Hussein was incapable of understanding that the U.S. would field a different team, coached by the Battalion commanders and company-grade officers of the last big war.
He could not imagine that American public opinion could be massed on such a united front against him, or that it could be sustained in the face of the projected casualties of a ground war. Hussein never understood he had purchased a ticket to the Super Bowl, and would face the 1960 Green Bay Packers.
Consistent with the identification of Vietnam as the antithesis of the manner in war was to be conducted, the American military sought to establish or receive clear guidance from their political masters. 'If the Vietnam war had taught one ineluctable lesson,summarizes the staff of U.S. News and World RCeort, 'it was that when the political objectives become muddy and politicians become generals, the cause is lost." Not only must the objectives have clarity, but they must also be achievable. It is not enough to be able to see the prize, it must be within reach with the forces and capabilities assigned to the task.
For the American military the overarching lesson from Vietnam and Korea was the need for clear, immutable combat objectives. The Joint Chiefs-through Powell's oracular voice-insisted on a mission that both finite and within the means of the forces at hand.'
The Administration did establish four major political goals relatively early in August, and stuck to them rather doggedly. The Bush policy circle seemed conscious of the need for consistency in political objectives. However, in trying to establish and maintain public support, the Administration struggled to find a sufficient rationale for the U.S. intervention, and hopped from rationale to rationale for five months.'* With the same problem that LBJ 123 had, Mr. Bush and his advisors employed a wide number of reasons, for a wide number of audiences. The definition of our vital interests changed from one press conference to the next, and the reasons for dispatching forces ranged from stopping aggression, enforcing inteational law, preparing for a "new world order," ensuring our economic stability, preventing Hussein from strangling or manipulating the world oil supply, and in more crw terms, the Secretary of State stated we were in the Gulf for "jobs."
The military does not seem to have noticed the lack of initial consistency. The Pentagon's own after action report on the Gulf War emphasized the establishment of clear political goals to drive the composition, purpose, and actions of the U.S. military. The Defense Department even trotted out the questionable Kinnard results to support its report.
A post-Vietnam survey of key military leaders who commanded relatively large formes during that conflict revealed many were, at times, unsure of the war's objectives. Those who commanded...during the Gulf crisis did not suffer the same misgivings. Little contusion existed within Coalition military establishments as to what military force was expected to accomplish. Clear statements of goals helped instill confidence and eased the formulation of military objectives."
The Bush policy team laid out four major policy objectives eventually, and they stuck to them pretty consistently. They were -Unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait -Restoration of Kuwait's legitimate government -Securing the safety and protection of American citizens abroad.
-Enhancing the security and stability of Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf 2
The clarity of the last objective is not as pure as the others. As we will see later during the war termination phase of the conflict, this becomes a critical point. In his address to a ]oint Session of Congress early in Desert Shield, the President stated that our goal was "assuring" regional stability in the Gulf." Early on, "enhancing" security in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf region was the objective. In its Title V post-conflict report to Congress, the Pentagon stated that our national policy objective was simply the security and stability of the region. Stability was not defined any further.
Following the establishment of clear national political objectives, the military could turn to defining a strategy and the means of achieving its military objectives. The detailing of clear military objectives is almost as important as finalizing the war's policy aim. The U.S. military believes that this was accomplished. "Clearly defined and articulated political objectives ensured development of equally clear military objectives and decisively contributed to success," according to DoD's report."5
The final assessment as to whether the U.S. achieved its policy or military objectives is not a crucial determination in this study. However, it is relevant to the validity of the lessons learned about clarity of purpose. It is also relevant when looking at exactly what the theater commander defined as his objectives. The liberation of Kuwait is clearly defined, as well as numerous steps leading to that objective. The nebulous political objective of enhancing or securing regional stability was also translated into specific military objectives. "Securing regional stability" was eventually defined as destroying the Republican Guard, and eliminating Iraq's capacity for production or delivery of weapons of mass destruction.6 The theater commander's goals resist the larger prize of toppling S:,ddam. While it may have been hoped
for, changing the government in Baghdad was never a formal war aim."' This becomes a critical element later in the assessment as to whether clear goals were really established, and as to whether a decisive victory was achieved or merely a "Pyrrhic Triumph." CENTCOM's objectives were:
1. Attack Iraqi political-military leadership 2. Gain and maintain air superiority The military is satisfied that they received explicit and clear policy aims, and that they were matched with equally clear military objectives.
In defining both the force size and manner of employment, the U.S. military desired to repeat the performance level established in Operation Just Cause. Panama was the dress rehearsal for overwhelming force, and Desert Storm was the real show. The ghosts of Vietnam would be entirely exorcised in one gigantic clash. The military would present a requirement for an overwhelming force that was to be carefully built and resourced. Political constraints on the use of the force and its firepower were to be minimized, rules of engagement were to be kept sparse and crystal clear. The President reiterated repeatedly that it would not be *another Vietnam. This time the troops would have what they needed, "they will not be asked to fight with one hand tied behind their back."20
To accomplish its mission, the Joint Staff asked for and received nearly 500,000
American troops, in addition to the forces provided by 30 separate coalition partners. The force list authorized by the President exceeded the CINC's request considerably. This force signalled U.S. resolve and commitment, but did not induce Iraq's leadership to withdraw.
The military saw the President's rapid approval of its force request as a sign of decisive leadership and a commitment that the military would have the full support of the nation to carry out its assigned tasksz. 
1
In its own report, DoD noted that the President's approval of the "enhanced option," in late October 1990, provided "an overwhelming offensive capability" to ensure that U.S.
would possess a "decisive force" capable of seizing the initiative and "avoid getting bogged down in a long, inconclusive war.`" Desert Storm was n going to be another Vietnam.
Given the necessary tools and forces to accomplish its assigned objectives, the military turned to planning its war strategy. Vietnam remained the antithesis, firepower and mass would not be applied in a piecemeal fashion. "In order to achieve assigned goals quickly and with minimum coalition casualties," the DOD report notes, "U.S. defense planners applied the principle of decisive force. This contrasted with the incremental, attrition warfare which had c haracteizI U.S. operations in Vietnam." 
3
The ground force buildup was a direct counterpoint to the lack of mass and decisive force established in Vietnam. The commander's intent reinforced it. Firepower and attrition were employed to set up the battlefield not to signal or coerce but for a decisive blow. Mass, speed, and firepower were to be applied simultaneously. Gradual applications and incrementalism were eschewed, centers of gravity were to be targeted relentlessly until the enemy force was brokle. There would be no pauses. The formal intent of CINCCENT can be found in his Commander's Intent steient:
Maximize friendly strength against Iraqi weakness and terminate offensive operations with the Republican Guard Force Command destroyed and major U.S.
forces controlling critical lines of communication in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations.
General Schwarzkopf was fond of referring at the Battle of Cannae as the classic battle of annihilation. It was his favorite analogy before the war. He continued to emphasize that the Republican Guard was a center of gravity to Hussein, and thus must be targeted for decisive force and destruction. This is reflected in his campaign objective of *destroying"
the Republican Guard and his commander's intent. The battle against the Guard was the main effort in the ground phase of the campaign. The CINC's intent was to initiate and complete a climatic battle of die Schlacht-the slaughter.'s The CINC was "playing to win" in the finest tradition of the American Way of War.
The Chairman also reinforced the concept of overwhelming force and decisive results.
In a much publicized (and apparently deliberately rehearsed) line, General Powell said "Our strategy for going after this army is very simple. First we are going to cut it off. And then we are going to kill it. "2 This may have been purposeful posturing for Iraq to show that the U.S. had the will to engage in a ground offensive, at a time and manner of its own choosing; but it also set up certain expectations.
The Air Force leadership, like its brethren on the ground, harbored great angst over limitations and constraints reminiscent of the air war over North Vietnam. Aerospace doctrine was built aroutd technology, firepower, and overwhelming application just like the ground forces. The haunting memory of Vietnam was omnipresent. In a statement that could, and probably should be seen, as anti-Clausewitzian, the Air Force Component C ander in Southwest Asia, Lieutenant General Homer observed:
Many of us here who are in this position now were in Vietnam, and that war left a profound impact on our feelings about how our nation ought to conduct its business. We will carry out any particular policy but as individuals we think that war is a very serious business and it should not be dragged out In an effort to achieve some political objective." (emphasis added)
As a Vietnam veteran, General Homer was speaking for a generation of aviators who remembered the frustrations of Rolling Thunder and the Linebacker campaigns. They also remember the loss of over 3,000 aircraft without any decisive results. As then Air Force Chief of Staff General Dugan stated before his relief, 'Most Air Force officers believe to this day that if they had been allowed to bomb North Vietnam without limits the U.S. would have won the war."2
In direct contrast to the incrementalism of Vietnam, the chief air power strategists designed a strategic aerial bombardment program called Instant Thunder. The title impugns the many indignities dumped on air power proponents since the failures of Rolling Thunder.
Roiling Thunder was "a prolonged, gradualistic approach.* DOD's report notes that instead of "piecemeal attacks designed to send signals to enemy leaders, Instant Thunder was designed to destroy 84 strategic targets in Iraq in a single week. "'
The CINC provided general guidance and direction but avoided micro-managing the air portion of the war. Some have accused him of providing insufficient direction, particularly with the targeting priorities. After the war, General Schwarzkopf noted that the Air Force was vry sensitive to guidance and any controls that smacked of "straightjacket restrictions impose during Vietnam."30 He eventually placed his Deputy in charge of resolving the prioitizion of targems.
Air power proponents hold few inhibitions about the contributions the air phase made to the success of Desert Storm. The Air Force Chief of Staff, General Merrill A. McPeak briefed journalists that it was his personal conviction that the Gulf air war "was the first time in history that a field army has been defeated by air power.* Air Force doctrinal experts and historians quickly added Desert Storm clearly proved that "air power now dominates land warfare and that *simply (if boldly) stated, air power won the Gulf War."'
In sum, the American military was successful in promoting the principle of decisive or overwhelming force in both its ground and air phases. More importantly, it was successful in advising its principal client. President Bush observed, "this will not be another Vietnam.
This will not be a protracted, drawn out war... If one American soldier has to go into battle, that soldier will have enough force behind him to win and then get out."" The principle of decisive force was established, tested, and validated in Desert Storm. "Playing to win" had become national military policy.
The U.S. military derived a sense of closure from Vietnam to the Gulf War. Many vetmers from Vietnam enjoyed the victory parades and accolades given to those returning from the Gulf War. General Powell told these veterans their honor and valor were never questioned, and that they too could claim a share of the credit. It was as if a generation had come full circle. As one special operations officer from Vietnam and the Gulf war noted, "the lessons of Vietnam were good ones,...I didn't break faith with those lost...they did not die in vain."s
As in the other categodes, the U.S. military has come to see in both Opeation Deert SIMe and Desert Storm, the epitome of proper civil-military relations. Simply stated, the civilians provided the policy aims, the commitment to the requisite resources, and then stayed out of the way. "iutually to a man," notes one journalistic team that conducted extensive post-war interviews, *every American commander in the Gulf conflict expressed gratitude and satisfaction over the fact that their President and Commander-in-Chief had allowed them to fight the war as they saw fit. "
Queried about his role in the initial formulation of U.S. policy objectives and the resulting decision to dispatch U.S. military forces, General Powell noted that the President and Secretary Chewy deliberately *...alloved the military to participate in the decision making process from the very beginning, and allowed me as chairman to be a part of the inner sanctum."0 He has since stressed that his input in the front end, not afterwards, was the key to properly integrating political issues and military considerations throughout the war.
It is clear from the record that the President was very hesitant to interfere with operational details. In addition, while there are situations during the crisis where it appears the President overrled General Powell's recommendations, there is little evidence the NCA did not seek out military perspectives at each and every turn. This is obviously an improvement over the Johnson and McNamara days. There were no Tuesday targeting lunches. Civilians from DoD, CIA, and State were involved in the policy development stage and the planning process. Battle plans were made by those who would execute them. The military as a whole had a seat at the table and a voice in all discussions. While General
Powell's ips wa not aoccted on a few key policy decisions, it is apparent that at so time did the NCA dinppove military advice on military matters.
The esblishment and maintenance of public support for U.S. policy objectives was critical to the overall success of Desert Storm. All three aspects of popular support; media policy, Reserve mobilization, and Congressional at i, played a part in building and holding together an often tnse equilibrium of Clausewitz's *remarkable trinity.
The media presented a major challenge in this specific theater of operations. The host nation was a cosed society, with extreme sensitivity to Western cultural norms. The theater was far from the Continental United States, and the vast desert environment mandated Splannin for t tation and logistics for public affairs teams. The horde of media pemonnel from around the world e rbated the situation further. A total of 1,600 media representatives flooded Sandi Arabia and nearby military facidties. Their demands for access and support overran the capability of CENTCOM Joint Information Bureau (JIB).
Because of these anticipated problems, DOD planned to employ the pool system employed in Pamana and Grenada, and secured approval from the Saudis. The National Media Pool was notified on 10 August, and a pool flew to Riyadh that week.
After the war, the media was extremely dissatisfied with the guidelines and restrictions unposed by the military. Pool coverage was considered poor, media escorts frequently interrupted or intimidated interviewers, security reviews were capricious and time consuming, and finally inadequate trnp ton assets and support to get completed reports and imagery t thoir editors. Probably the worst accusation was that several reporters were getting avorable ueatment because they provided positive stories, while reporters who filed stories that the CINC found negative, would loe intervims and other privileges.
In their defense, DOD was really not obligated to provide the transportation, food, and logistics it did provide. CENTCOM made senior officers available for numerous public and private briefings. Division commanders took time out of pressing schedules to talk to the press, and their troops provided interviews for a multitude of human interest stories. Daily befings were broadcast over the world. In many ways, in terms of quantity or volume, the war was extensively covered. Both the Secretary of Defense and his spokespers Assistant Secretary of Defense Pete Williams, would later defend DOD and describe the Gulf War as the best covered conflict of its kind.*
The military did not completely exorate themselves, the DOD report on the war oledges that command support for the media effort was uneven. This would seem to admit that some generals, particularly senior Army officers who had served in Vietnam, did not resist the opportunity to repay reporters for the perceived "stab in the back" in Vietnam. 4 The Pentagon also admitted that several incidents of intimidation and inadvertent censorship had occurred through a lack of training and supervision. The Pentagon defended the security review process, but did admit transmission time must be greatly increased.
The ijor problem in the Gulf was retaining operational security in an age where technology permitted journalists to communicate live on a world-wide basis. Desert Storm was unique because it was the first modern war where news media personnel could broadcast instantaneously to the world, to include Baghdad. This was considered cnrcial in the sychalogicl war being waged against Hussein, described by General Powell as *a CNN junkie.0
Security did no turn out to be a major problem. Only 5 of 1,300 pool stories were restricted for security matters, and upon appeal, only one story was ever censored. The CINC was concerned about one or two tories that apparently had correctly speculated about VII Corps pending sweep around the left flank."' Apparently, Hussein got so much information and deliberate disinformation he never was able to discern just what CENTCOM would do.
The media was quite upset after the war, and the major issue among many news organizations was what to do about it. To many, the media was used to plant disinformation or doubt, and to shape U.S. domestic support for the war. The pools, censorship, and "superficial and numbingly statistical" daily briefings came under extensive criticism.'

The third issue involved in generating popular support involves the Congressional authorization. The Congress was not adequately involved in major policy decisions during the early stages of the conflict. Ths sensitized key Congressional leaders early, and the Bush without question these institutional conclusions. As Dr. Eliot Cohen has observed, "the greatest test of our strategic maturity will be our willingness to view critically our performance in this rout." Victory can excuse a multitude of sins."
It is difficult to challenge the conclusion that President Bush established four clear objectives during the crisis. To make this conclusion though it is necessary to accept the fourth objective-the establishment of regional stability in the Middle East-in narrow terms.
Victory was not to be complete, or unlimited in scale or time. It is clear that the removal of Saddam Hussein, an unlimited and ambitious goal, was never formally established.
However, in his rhetoric the President escalated expectations beyond narrow constructions.
Few observers could expect a limited war with limited objectives given both the President's Hitler analogy for Hussein, and the constant comparisons to Munich and appeasement.
Thus, Mr. Bush established a macro-level incongruity. Having identified Saddam as a Hitler, and massed an international army against him, victory was defined to a limited purpose. Having raised expectations that the military would not "fight with one hand tied behind its back,* and after generating a level of international and domestic consensus not seen since the 1940's, Mr. Bush generated an implicit assumption that regional stability meant geting rid of the current leadership in Baghdad. As one Congressional defense expert writes "this disparity between more limited formal objectives and ambitious, undeclared aims continues to hamper efforts at judging the war's ultimate success or failure."" This in turn has clouded efforts at evaluating whether or not the proper political objectives were established, and how clear they really were articulated.
In addition to clear objectives, strategic success mandates clear and consistent strategic guidance to the military in general and the theater commander in particular. Here the record is a little more murky, and less positive. CENTCOM was not satisfied it knew what was going on in Washington, and what planning efforts the Command should focus on. In October 1990, the CINC told the U.S. Ambassador to Saudi Arabia he was working "in the dark,* and was assuming that a requirement for offensive operations would eventually be needed, but he no idea if it was limited to freeing Kuwait or otherwise.Y
In his memoirs after the war, the CINC included a draft message that he had prepared for the Joint Staff complaining of the "total vacuum of guidance" he sensed in theater." 
5
The third element in assessing clarity of purpose involves the clarity of the military objectives. The CINC promulgated an overall intent, and six specific military objectives.'
These military objectives reinforce the narrow interpretation of the policy aims established by the White House. Ejecting the Iraqi forces from Kuwait and restoring its legitimate govenment was the primary objective. Assuring regional stability was to be achieved through the destuction of the Republican Guard and the elimination of Hussein's offensive capabilities, particularly his NBC production and delivery potential.-" The military objectves appear consistent with the political objectives, although once again, the establishment of regional stability is defined narrowly. Whether or not these were achieved is a matter for the next phase of the assessment.
General Schwarzkopf sought to achieve a decisive victory through the classic American Way of War. In this regard, he turned back to the most familiar icons of American military history for guidance. Perhaps indicative of the depth of mythology in ihe psyche of the American military, the CINC kept in his office a framed copy of Sherman's adage 'War is the remedy our enemies have chose. And I say let us give them all they want.""
The coalition gave Hussein all he could handle and more. Was a decisive victory achieved? Most observers readily accept that an overwhelming force was concentrated in the theater, and that it was employed with few restraints. The American military was *allowed* to win this war, unlike its interpretation from Vietnam or Beirut. But did it achieve a decisive victory, and was the force employed decisively? The ultimate criteria for this determination must be based on the achievement of the staed political and military objectives.
As discssed earlier, the elimination of Saddam Hussein was not explicitly directed. It remained a political objective beyond the scope of the coalition's framework, and the degree of risk that both the political and military wanted to assume. We could live with Saddam without an Army, or the Iraqi Army without Saddam. We chose the former, and in the CINC's words "the option of going all the way to Baghdad was never considered."00 Thus, the war plan called for the use of a massive overwhelming force in a measured manner to achieve a straight forward, albeit limited, victory over the invading army. The campaign plan was not designed for the overthrow of the Iraqi government, consistent with the stated policy aims given to CENTCOM. While the means appeared unlimited, the goals were prescribed to more limited ends. While a battle of annihilation like Cannae was feasible, a strategy of annihilation culminating in unconditional surrender was not sought.
This was not to be a war of annihilation cultaiating in surrender ceremonies on the teak decks of the USS Missouri. Thus, in several critical factors, the traditional American Way of War was not sought nor achieved in the Gulf.
This has created numerous criticisms of the Gulf War. Several major assessments have decried the war as a hollow victory. One major book called it a 'triumph without victory," which presumes that we achieved only a tactical victory, meaningless in its relation to either strategic goals or the opportunities available. According to this view:
For a military operation .... prosecuted with such skill and vision, it was a tragic conclusion, one that no amount of post-war celebration could disguise. There could be no doubt America and its allies had triumphed over Iraq's army on the battlefield. But inasmuch as victory suggests the decisive defeat of an opponent, there was none. This triumph without victory was perhaps the most striking irony of the entire conflict."I This brings up the cognitive incongruity raised by the military in the aftermath of the conflict. President Bush raised expectations with references to appeasement and Hitler, the U.S..military raised expectations with references to Cannae, and with pithy sound bites about "cutting off and killing" the Iraqi Army. Given the provision of the clear objectives, the overwhelming force, the lack of constraints on the application of power, under such ideal c~rumsancsmuch mnore, was expected. Like most conflicts, whether or not a truly decisive victory has been achieved cannot be determined immediately. The military's insistence that a decisive victory was achieved is uale.
It does not denigrate the valor of the military to question whether or not their victory achieved the political objectives set forth. However, given the 'tactical victory, strategic defe8 school of thought that emanated from Vietnam, the acceptance of a merely overwhelming tactical victory is surprising. Instead of acting defensively, the military should accept the fact that decisive victories are the product of numerous political and military conditions, some beyond the control of the theater commander.
The sharp detivene points to the need to closely scrutinize the war termination I apects of this conflic In fact, General Powell's advice at both the beginning and the end of the war bears far more analysis than given to date. His primary job was to ensure the match between assigned political aims and military objectives. He appeared reluctant to recommend offensive combat to achieve those aims, and then was very fast to stop the ground war, and remove American troops. According to some reports, General Powell was a "brakeman* to the propesity for higher goals sought by civilian advisers around the President. Other reports have General Powell looking to end ground combat early as 0 + 1, the day after the ground war began.6 
5
After the war, Saddam Hussein's continued truculence, and the brutal crushing of internal dissension leads many to think that the knockout victory of 1991 may being only temporary.
The phoenix will be hard to crush, since the extremely favorable political conditions that existed in 1991 may not exist again. Thus, many believe a truly decisive victory had slipped away. Others go so far as to count the Gulf war as a major American political defeat given the enormity of the political and military effort marshalled against Saddam during and after the Gulf War."
Such assessments presume far too much about what could have been achieved politically in Iraq, and what the risks and costs of continued combat would have been. There is no credible evidence that killing 5,000 Iraqis or destroying 500 more tanks would have contributed to a better state of peace.
But the premature decision to halt the ground offensive bears detailed review for future conflicts. Why did General Powell recommend halting the war? In post-conflict interviews, visual imagery from the 'Highway of Death' was cited as a problem and that we were creating the impression that American pilots were engaging in wanton killing. However, several analyses have shown that no such images were presented on American networks or CNN.' Even if such reports were seen, the recommendation for a unilateral cease fire does not foL i. Air attacks on retreating convoys in the kill zones could have been stopped, and the enveloping force could have blocked and captured the rabble as it proceeded towards VII Corps.
In retrospect it seems apparent the Administration was concerned about a *crisp and clean ending.' Reportedly, planning conferences at the National Security Council deputy level made numerous references to long term stalemates like Korea. The U.S. military wanted no part of any "ragged ending,' nor did it desire a long term presence and quagmire.*' It was not only the military that was willing to accept a sharp, short, decisive win. President Bush stated owe ae not going to permit this to drag on in terms of a significant U.S. presen a la Kwuo. The President's team did not want "victory fever' to take hold and escalate the stated policy aims lik Truman's crssing the 3Mth parallel after Inchon.
To summarize, the campaign was decisive in military terms only. The results, from both the air and ground phases, were dramatically decisive at the tactical and operational levels of warfare. Raised expectations due to the exggerated rhetoric of the President, the Chairman, and the CINC were not met. Furthermore, all military objectives were not satisfied. Substantial amounts of Iraqi armor escaped. The Republican Guard was not degraded during the air or ground phases to the degree specified before the war."
Additionally, after the war it was determined that Iraq's NBC capabilities were not degraded as much as desired.
The conclusion that the relationship between civilian policy makers and military experts the Gulf War presents a model for future crisis management decisions should not be accepted at fact value. Given the military's memory of LBJ on his hands and knes on the floor in the Oval Office picking bombing targets, President Bush was a major improvement. It is true that Mr. Bush religiousy adhered to a strict chain of command running from Cheney to
Powell to Schwatzkopf. Likewise, Mr. Bush was disinclined to disagree with the military, accepted ft Pentagon's proposals and approved their requests, and made no major decisions that contradicted the military advice of his commanders. In the CINC's words 'his confidence in the military's ability to do its job was so unlike what we'd seen in Vietnam.'â¢' However, even though the Oval Office refused to get down into operational minutia and never forced the military *to fight with one hand tied behind its back,' it is an oversImplficaon to suggest that the war was a model for the future.
Both the manne in which the war began and was concluded really raise grave doubts about the level of tust that existed between the President and his major policy advisers.
While the military was afforded access to policy councils, for some reason Genral Powell felt constrained in putting forth his position regarding economic strangulation over a military solution. The suggestion that the principal advisor to the President on military matters felts any hesitancy about giving his best advice reveals problems.1n
Mw Commaners also reveals the absence of direct communications between the political leader and principal military advisor at a major juncture in the decision making process.
According to this report, General Powell was surprised when the President made the decision and public announcement that Iraq'i aggression would not stand, and that it would be reversed. This was a major policy decision, and the failure to discuss and evaluate the costs of such a policy with one's principal military advisor is troubling. 
7
One should not make too much of the sort of conflicts that appeared during the Gulf War.
Such temsion are one of the timeless dimensions of warfare, inherent to the integration of political considerations and military perspectives during times of stress. However, this should not whitwash the problem, particularly since the situation favored the military's desired paradigm. Such problems could have been serious if several factors, such as the need for an early ground offensive, were changed.
Implicit in this declaration, however, is the presumption that Desert Storm was a decisive victory. Such a conclusion remains debatable. However, the military has largely accepted it, despite the fact that indecisive wars are the rule rather than the exception. As Professor Weigley has shown, the history of warfare leans towards the conclusion of "recalcitrant indecisiveness' when assessing the utility of force as an instrument of statecraft.1
A *new" version of the American Way of War emerges in the aftermath of Desert Storm. Strategies of annihilation that seek the complete overthrow of an opponent and his government are now accepted as anomalies. The preference is now for the swift and massed application of overwhelming force for limited ends. The new preferred style acknowledges policy aims as the preceptor of strategy, but insists force is best employed for objectives that can be readily defined in military terms. Additionally, force should be used in those situations where it can be swift and decisive, where its use justifies the risks and resulting costs, and where the forces can be quickly withdrawn. Popular support is maintained by keeping conflict short, attainable, and by controlling the media message to the American taxpayer.
The New American Way of War retains the old preferences for absolutism and autonomy during the conduct of military operations. What is sharply different is that such instances are now employed for more limited ends, in situations where military means can be optimally employed, and when both the objectives and the means will be supported by general popular support vice national mobilization.
The specter of letnam has been bied forever in the desert sands of de Ambian peninsula The new military strategy outlined several principles that build on traditional U.S. military strengths. The purpose of detailing the principles was to capture the key lessons from Desert Storm and exploit weaks3s of those who might threaten U.S. interests.' Thes strategic principles are recognizable as standard U.S. approaches including forward presence, collective security, and technological superiority. The only unique element was the concept of Decisive Force, defined as follows:
Once a decision for military action has been made, half-measures and confused objectives exact a severe price in the form of a protracted conflict which can cause needless waste of human lives and material resources, a divided nation at home, and defeat. Therefore one of the essential mts of our national military Strategy is the ability to rapidly assemble the foces needed to win-the concept of applying decisive force to overwhelm our adversaries and thereby terminate conflicts swiftly with minimum loss of life.'
According to one of the principal drafters of the NMS, the concept is directly derived from Desert Storm, but it also seems to reflect the lessons of Vietnam and Beirut. In the definition the haunting specter of Vietnam lingers in the references to "protracted conflict' and the "divided nation at home." The military's lessons learned from Vietnam and Beirut are just as clearly omnonstrated in the phrase "half-measures and confused objectives." Like the Weinberger Doctrine, an implicit foundation of the concept was a belief that force should only be used with the commitment of the Nation. Also included is the Weinberger criteria of "winning." Last, force should only be applied in such a manner as to ensure success quickly and decisively. 
10
The New American Way of War though does not assume that mass will be used to grind down an opponent through exhaustion. That takes too much time, protracts conflicts, and could lead to media-induced perceptions that sap public support. The limits of time, sensitivity to casualties, and popular support that influence our strategic culture no longer permit the olde traditional approach. The emphasis has switche from slow and ponderous applications of resources in the tradition of U. S. Grant to a more focused and qualitatively improved style. As reflected in Decisive Force, the modern U.S.
military seeks to use overwhelming force to rapidly overcome any opponent in as short a time period as possible, and with the least cost to us in terms of lives.
The doctrine has been criticized in general for its insistence for the massive and unequivocal application of combat power. Critics of this approach include Mr. Les
Aspin, then Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, who sensed an *all or nothing" approach solidifying in the Nation's military leadership. 
11
In a speech made in late 1992, he evaluated this "new* school of military thought. He was critical of what he saw as a checklist approach, and its inapplicability to the challenges of maintaining peace in the post-Cold War world.
Mr. Aspin found the emergence of this consensus among the Officer corps disturbing.
He summarized his perception of this consensus in four propositions on when force is appropriate.
1. Only as a last resort. Diplomatic and economic sanctions should be tried first.
2. Only when there is a clear cut military objective. Forces should not be sent to achieve vague political goals.
3. Only when we can measure that the military objective can been achieved. We need to know when to bring the forces home.
4. Only in an overwhelming fashion. We should get it done quickly and with little loss of life, by the use of overwhelming force.' 
2
Aspin's view of the post-Cold War world reflected a Hobbesian world of fervent nationalism, terrorism, and ethnic conflict. An "all or nothing" absolutist school would be inconsistent with meeting challenges in this chaotic international security environment.
In direct contrast to the absolutist position, Mr. Aspin placed himself among a "limited objectives" school that finds the threat of military action, and limited military operations as useful tools for preserving peace in an unstable world. Mr. Aspin concluded that the pragmatic application of force, and the coercive threat of force, served U.S. policy goals best in the post-Cold War world. His position was predicated on two basic assumptions. The first was that the demise of Soviet Union permitted us to closely control the throttle and gear shift of any conflict without fear of escalation into a superpower Armageddon. Secondly, the American military technical revolution offered new tools in the form of precision munitions and advanced aerospace technology for compellence against rogue aggressors and challenges to the international community.
In Mr. spin's estimation, the end of the Cold War freed the United States from selfimposed limitatios and from the fear of Third World conflicts escalating beyond control.
Freed from the dangers of escalation, Mr. Aspi argued that we could opt for limnted interventions without fear of sliding into quagmires and use force surgically with little risk to ourselves. Mr. Aspin was not alone. Others were equally critical of the generation of a "Beirut syndrome" as a substitute for the Vietnam syndrome. This Lebanese version made the Pentagon uneasy about handling less than ideal situations and made it resist involvement in sticky situations that did not fit its preferred paradigm and doctrine of overwhelming force. 1 4 The end result of this syndrome, the critics charged, was the failure to address serious challenges in Europe as the former Yugoslavia dintegrated.
The early criticisms of Decisive Force should be understood in the context of the domestic debate in the United States over intervention into Bosnia-Herzegovnia in 1992.
In addition, the long suffering population of Somalia was ravaged by famine and its government had completely collapsed into anarchy. Many critics wanted to mobilize the Pentagon to resolve these crises, but found the military reluctant. The strategic backdrop to the entire debate was the role of America in the post-Cold War world. The options ranged from reverting to isolationism or mindless interventionism in the pursuit of idealistic humanitarian agendas. Decisive means and results are always to be preferred, even if they are not always possible. We should always be skeptical when so-called experts suggest that all a particular crisis calls for is a little surgical bombing or a limited attack. History has not been kind to this approach to war-maIkng. He specifically rejqted the insinuation that he or any other element of the Pentagon was advocating an absolutist approach or an insistence on "winning" in military terms.
"This is not to argue that the use of force is constrained to only those occurrences where the victory of American arms will resounding, swift and overwhelming," he wrote. But it does mean, he added, that force should be restricted to those situations where it can do some good, where the benefits outweigh the costs and risks that will accrue. 
2
Powell Doctrine began to sound very much like the Weinberger Doctrine. 
The evaluation of the utility of decisive force as a declaratory policy or strategic principle hinges on how well its serves the use of power as an instrument of policy.
Ultimately, the concept must be measured against what do we want military power to do.
The National Military Sâ¢rategy is designed to address the "ways and means" that military force will contribute to desired ends. Decisive Force is a "way" of operating towards these ends or objectives. For analysis purposes, the Decisive Force concept will be matched and evaluated against four purposes served by military power. These are to deter, to defend, to decisively iJfluence other states if deterrence fails, and to provide diplomatic sup, " These four functions are detailed below in Table 
II
3
While both peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations fall under the umbrella of operations other than war, they do involve circumstances where the use of deadly force may be warranted. Under both types of missions, a large and actively engaged presence consistent with the principle of Decisive Force is useful. Intimidation of the local antagonists is an effective deterrent and a by product of Decisive Force. This serves the overall mission by deterring factions from violating the peace, or by quickly establishing a peace where none existed. There is an historical tradition of employing lightly armed troops as peacekeepers, and limiting their role to passive observers. Experience in recent operations suggests that the traditional approach is breaking down. Peacekeeping forces must remain neutral to execute their role, but neutral does not have to mean neutered.
However, there are other situations under diplomatic support (security assistance, Foreign Internal Defense, or nation building) where an extensive U.S. presence or where the unrestrained employment of American maneuver forces, firepower, or technology is inappropriate. It is possible that Decisive Force is not always overwhelming force in a strictly conventional military sense. This would include many situations under the umbrella of "operations other than war' such as counter-insurgency where long term social, political, and economic problems in areas of interest to the U.S. may require interventions of a politico-military nature, for a protracted period of time. In such scenarios, (e.g., El Salvador), the introduction of Decisive Force to *overwhelm" the adversary may have little meaning, or may be counterproductive. In such scenarios, the meaning of decisive needs to be clarified and refined.
To summarize this section, the concept of Decisive Force supports the four purposes of military power. There is a need to differentiate between Decisive Force as it applies to warfghting or "violent means," and the sort of protracteid and persistent involvement required in some low-intensity situations where tightly integrated politico-military operations are needed. The 1992 National Military Strategy does not adequately address this distinction.
In assessing the utility and viability of the principle of Decisive Force, a number of potential problems have been raised. The U.S. military has conducted a thorough lessons learned effort from the Gulf War.
Most of these assessments have consistently underscored the unique aspects of the conflict, including political considerations, that contributed to the success of the coalition.' The professional literature is replete with indications that the military is aware of the potential for overlearning the lessons of Desert Storm, and the need to prepare for a wide range of threats and missions in the near term."
As might be expected, the cultural orientation remains focused on the upper end of the conflict spectrum, and the ability to rapidly project overwhelming combat power from the United States for a regional conflict. The fundamental aspects of the Pentagon's warfighting strategy, although reoriented from a global strategy to a regional level, remain fixed on the application of firepower and technology against a conventional opponent in a major regional contingency. This should be seen in a broader context. The primary purpose of the Nation's armed forces remains deterring or winning wars. Regional scenarios as defined iw the National Military Strategy and the Pentagon's follow up reviews represent an appropriate planning focus for the Pentagon.
The U.S. military is mindful of the criticism about refighting the last war. Fully aware that potential antagonists will conduct their own 'lessons learned' effort from the Gulf War, the Pentagon recognizes that future opponents and future wars will be different.' The rest of the world now realizes that 'pulling Uncle Sam's beard' can be hazardous to one's health.Y Third World countries, particularly potential aggressor states, have concluded they cannot compete with American military capabilities in the conventional sense, and that weapons of mass destruction offer a means of avoiding American intervention. To some regional powers, the conclusion from the Gulf War is summed up by the Indian Defense Chief of Staff, who when asked what was the most important lesson of the Gulf War, replied 'Never fight the U.S. without nuclear weapons.'st
The alternative approach could be a return to the employment of asymmetrical approaches to obviate areas of operational and technological superiority of the United
States." This would result in the adoption of more ambiguous situations and the use of terrorism, insurgency and forms of low-intensity conflict. This is also supported by assessments indicating that ethnic conflict and cultural wars represent a growing trends in international conflicts.'Â° In The Transformation of , noted Israeli historian Martin van Creveld, points out that the trend in conflicts around the world leans not toward Desert Storm conflicts but towards non-conventional or paramilitary affairs, including terrorism, drug cartels, or insurgencies. Such a trend would suggest that future situations will not be clear cut opportunities for the American Way of War.
The pattern of conflict, and the international lessons of Desert Storm, have combined to ensure that a strong probability exists that the U.S. military will be faced with future conflicts far more murky and frustrating.6" The nature of the U.S. military's style of warfare, reinforced by Decisive Force, will place us at a disadvantage since we "historically had difficulty with prosecuting less conventional types of conflicts"62
Yet this may be a premature as well as a pessimistic conclusion. Critics tend to focus on the past historical record of the U.S. military and its cultural predispositions, and ignore the recent efforts by all the Services, and by the Department as a whole, to enhance the Pentagon's approach to low intensity conflict situations-or as they are now called, "operations other than war."' Many still believe the Pentagon is institutionally unprepared or predisposed against effective involvement in LIC situations. As an example of a recent assessment by one pair of instructors:
The current preference of the U.S. military is captured in the Powell corollary to the Weinberger doctrine: the fast, overwhelming and decisive application of maximum force in the minimum time. Such an approach may produce effective, short-term results. It is irrelevant, probably even counterproductive, when matched against t'le very difficult internal problems that form the underlying problems in target countries."
However, accepting this point of view requires one to ignore a large body of evidence The wide range of potential missions for the Armed Services can also be seen in the Defense Department's latest strategic assessment, the Bottom Up Review (BUR). The BUR addresses regional dangers, including proliferation of means of mass destruction, and opportunities where the use of military force can constructively contribute to reducing instability in situations short of armed combat. The options range from forward presence to deter conflicts, providing regional stability through visits and exercises, and conducting smaller scale intervention operations, such as peace-enforcement, peackeeping, humanitarian assistance, and disaster relief to further U.S. interests and objectives.6
The new strategy acknowledges that deterring regional aggression remains the most demanding scenario of the strategy, but that *our emphasis on engagement, pevention, and partnership, means that, in this new era, U.S. military forces are more likely to be involved in operations short of declared or intense warfare.'
If the military is adopting an 'all or nothing" attitude, it is not apparent in doctrine published since Desert Storm. The Joint Staff, the U.S. Army, and the Air Force have all recently published major new doctrinal publications. None of these documents can be accused of advocating an 'all or nothing* school. Quite to the contrary, each doctrinal document being developed includes a new chapter covering "operations other than war."
These describe such missions as key operational environments requiring special skills and approaches that the U.S. military must be prepared for.' In the past, the issue of small or unconventional conflicts was relegated to separate and secondary publications.
While it has not published any major doctrinal publications, the Navy and Marine There is one potential problem with Decisive Force and the pattern of conflict. The U.S. military acknowledges that the use of force must be tailored to its intaxded purpose, and can be limited by the nature of the conflict or the desired policy aim. There are situations where the literal application of Decisive Force is inapplicable or counterproductive. The military's existing low-intensity conflict doctrine includes several supporting principles including wrestraint" and "persistence." 
7
Thus, all the Services seem prepared strategically and doctrinally for a wider and more variegated range of problems. Publishing policy and doctrine though is not the same as being able to execute. Changes in personnel policy, training and education, and equipment will have to follow if the U.S. military is serious. The decline in budget resources will result in competing interests for fewer resources. There have been debates
about the costs of nontraditional and peacekeeping missions in the professional literature, and the degradation of capabilities and readiness of if too much emphasis is placed on such tasks." Given the uncertainty of the DOD budget and the sharp decline in available forces as the U.S. military downsizes, such concerns are very legitimate.
What remains to be seen is how the Service's execute their respective doctrines and if "overwhelming" or Decisive Force supersedes the contingent assessment that each scenario warrants. "Playing to win" in such conflicts will require a more sophisticated understanding of political conditions on the part of the U.S. Armed Forces than it has historically shown.
Sir Michael Howard was once very pessimistic about the institutional ability of the military to draw upon history between periods of conflict to adapt its strategy, doctrine, and force structure to meet the next threat effectively. The U.S. military is in such a period today, and could fail to properly adapt itself appropriately for the twenty-first century. Still, he said, ... it is the task of military science to prevent the doctrines from being too badly wrong. All scientific thought is a sustained attempt to separate out the constants in any situation from the variable, to explain what is of continuing validity and to discard what is ephemeral, to establish certain abiding principles and to reduce them to their briefest most elegant formulation. 
75
Sir Michael had good reason to be pessimistic about military organization and their ability to adapt. The lessons learned by the four conflicts reviewed in this project would reinforce a pessimistic assessment. Strategic concepts cannot be accepted or evaluated at face value. They are the product of historical development, institutional interpretation, and bias. Subject to competing pressures in the 1990's, the U.S. military will be hard pressed to analyze conflicts and their political context with professional detachment.
Failure to do so and render appropriate advice would return civil-military relations in the United States t the early 1960's and early 1980's, when inflexibility or absolutism excluded a proper voice to military considerations in policy councils.
It has been written that an army's doctrine is inseparable from its past, and therefore, rigorous study of the past is crucial to evaluating any given doctrine.' Likewise, strategies are the product of the accretion of experience and the interpretations of that experience.
Understanding a given strategy requires an equally rigorous study of its strategic culture and the history within it. "To understand a strategy," one scholar has observed, "it is not sufficient simply to understand the facts on which it ostensibly is based.. .One must also understand the origins of the guiding principles and opinions that rendered the strategy..." 
2
The strategic concept of Decisive Force is consistent with the past experiences of the U.S.
military and the American Way of War. It also consistent with the subjective lessons that institution has taken from recent conflicts. An appreciation of its antecedents helps to assess its potential utility and its liabilities. An inescapable concern from this review is the More alarming is the dangerous oversimplification of the complexity of war to a group of shibboleths. Calls to "set clear political objectives" and "don't tie the military hands behind their back" make both the decision to go to war and the conduct of war appear far easier than it really is. Similarly, other reductionisms abound. "Get out of the military's way," "protracted wars lose public support," and now use "overwhelming force" are similar examples.
Such attitudes represent the inherent tensions of our strategic culture and the American Way of War. Our strategic culture does not fully accept the cold Clausewitzian rationalization of war as an instrument of policy. Yet the primacy of civilian control, and the subordination of the military to policy remains a part of our political culture.
While a credible strategy and doctrine must meet the tests of "strategic acceptability" within the strategic culture, it must also ultimately serve the interests of that culture by being prepared to adequately counter expected threats. A pattern of smaller scale operations in future conflicts is fairly certain. The U.S. military must be prepared for engagements in situations of uncertainty and ambiguity for such are the conditions of small wars. 
3
The U.S. military must guard against prescriptive approaches to the use of force. Our sense of professionalism must continue to include the proper integration of politics and military viewpoints. We cannot return to the faults of Vietnam, where a "disproportionate fascination with means at the expense of ends" produced a strategy at odds with the desired consequences." Our inputs at the highest level of decision making must always focus on producing a strategy designed to produce a very precise correspondence between means and ends.
I am not arguing that force should be subject to the notion of "calibration." The history behind this concept is not very heartening." We are the world's sole superpower and our use of military power should reflect this fact. We should pick our spots carefully, and then act decisively. We are a large, industrially advanced, technologically sophisticated, and often violent society. "Our military strategy," wrote Samuel Huntington, "should be, and indeed, must be built upon these facts. The way we fight necessarily will reflect the way we live. "
Still, this does not preclude ensuring that the means serve the desired end. The meaning of "decisive" and "victory" contain some degree of variation or imprecision. Defining success purely in terms of military victory will not always insure the desired outcome.
"Playing to win" will require greater elasticity in concept and execution. The alternative is "the emergence of war not as the servant but as the master of politics.' The danger of military expediency evident in "overwhelming force" cannot be underscored enough.
In establishing a proper equilibrium in the relationship with civilian policy makers who are ultimately responsible for the decision to employ force to pursue political goals, the U.S.
military must remain faithful to the "sacred trust" with the American people that General
Marshall so jealously protected. There is no demand for a political military or one that substantially influences political decisions beyond its own expert advice.
That does not mean that the military must avoid any role in the political process or that the relationship is totally amicable. That would be an erroneous conclusion. The military has a legitimate role in providing advice and representing the military to both the Executive and Legislative branches of government, as well as to the American public. The primary role, however, is to provide clear and unequivocal estimates and recommendations to civilian policy makers when the use of force is considered. There will always be differences and dichotomies between the requirements of policy and the brutal realities of the battlefield.
There is no way around this tension. General Matthew Ridgway once defined the ideal form of effective relations between civilian leaders and military professionals.
The statesman says to the soldier, "This is our national policy. What military means are required to support it?" The soldier studies the problem and replies with the means and costs.. .If the civilian authority finds the cost to be greater than the country can bear, then either the objectives themselves should be modified, or the responsibility for the risks involved should be forthrightly accepted. Under no circumstances,.. .should the professional military man yield, or compromise his judgement. To do otherwise would be to destroy his usefulness.'
This should remain the ideal form, although it may be rarely attained.
reflects the limits of our political culture. In particular, it reflects the need to maintain popular support and preclude casualties endemic to the American political culture.
force as an ijagnumnt qf dlplomacy. Decisive Force as a national strategic concept supports deterrence, defense, decisive influence and diplomacy. The military does not support Schellingesque negotiating tactics or coercive diplomacy unless the ramifications have been thought through.
4. Decise Force, while stated as an overarchlng Outegic conc$t, is not unlversally applicable acrossthe cojict spectrum. It is applicable to almost all uses of force for violent means. Some situations, such as counterinsurgency, may require greater restraint and persistence, and less violent means. The pattern of conflict for the next decade or two will seriously challenge our capacity to handle ambiguous and hybrid forms of political warfare.
relations. It does represent the considered judgment of the military about how combat forces should be employed, which must be noted. Ultimately, the judgment of when and how military forces are employed remains the purview of constituted civilian authority.
Political leaders need to be aware of the nature of military affairs, and the military as a subset of the American strategic culture.
In the foregoing project, the development, advantages and limitations of a strategic concept have been documented. Ultimately, the existence, benefits, and potential military is the obligation to the principle of civilian control. The opportunity to influence policy by the provision of sound prc~essional military assessments is consistent with that obligation. Using opportunities when military intervention is urdeir consideration to &ecute cultural predispstion is not. To compromise on the military advice they give would destroy their usefulness as General Ridgway warned. To compromise on professional obligations would be even more destructive.
Civilian officials have obligations too. The attitudes and culture of the military must be fully understood by those elected to make policy decisions. Without such an understanding it is very doubtful that the *ultimate decision," the decision to send America's sons and daughters into armed conflict, will be wisely made.
The sword is drawn for a specific political objective which controls the aim, magnitude, and duration of the effort. Political leaders are ultimately responsible for meshing the military and political considerations and controlling this effort. They define the aim and approve the means sought to procure it. This requires listening to the professional advice of those who understand the limitations and blunt capabilities of military power. Clausewitz warned that Statesmen need a grasp of military affairs so that the sword is not be used in a manner foreign to its nature. A grasp of military affairs should include a feel for the military culture, and its relationship to our strategic culture as well. Those who forge the sword need to have a far kmener appreciation for both the temper and edge of that instrument before drawing it.

2 ' niceties." Somewhat ironically, General Powell eventually responded to these critics with a detailed description of what Decisive Force meant in terms of a process or guidelines for the determination of how military combat forces should be employed. He had no qualms with the military being employed for nontraditional missions, and noted that Decisive Force was misinterpreted. Making a major distinction, he distinguished between humanitarian operations and combat, or what he called *violent means," which was when he acknowledged that views began to differ about the use of force."
The credibility factor is a function of both a country's assessed capabiliies and perceived will. For the past several decades, other nations recognized that the U.S. had an enormous capacity in terms of raw military power, but our willingness to employ it decisively to advance stated policy aims was questioned.

disproving the overly simplistic notion of *endism. I unconstrained airpower would have resulted in Hanoi's capitulation. Hopefully this would be recognized by senior civilian and military leaders as an erroneous conclusion drawn from faulty logic.

"Desert Storm lessons do not automatically apply to Vietnam" should be a major conclusion to the cases Such a pejorative interpretation cannot be taken by the doctrine when seen in the context of the National Military Strategy in its entirety, or upon review of General Powell's amplifying remarks. Admittedly, the professional ethic of the first 85 years of this century earned the U.S. military a reputation for apoliticism and technocracy.

how military force should be used to support national policy objectives.
In October 1989, the Bush Administration had yet to define itself. Its new national security team remained untested but problems in Panama were ready to boil over. Congress was irate when neither the White House or Pentagon took any risks during an attempted coup against Manuel Noriega in September 1989.' Noriega had resisted intense pressure to stand aside and let democracy have a chance. Economic sanctions had been applied for over year, and were having a telling effect on the Panamanian economy. The U.S. had waged a war of nerves with Noriega since he had appointed himself President Matters escalated in 1989 to the point where Noriega claimed that a "state of war" existed between Panama and the United States.
The Administration vowed to be better prepared the next time an opportunity rose to deal with Noriega. The Pentagon, particularly the new JCS Chairman, General Colin Powell, took deliberate steps to ensure that U.S. interests in the region were protected.' This included replacing the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM) commander, General Frederick Woerner, a Latin American area expert, with the more activist General Maxwell Thurman. General Thurman reinvigorated contingency planning and the alert status in the region with a series of plans and exercises that prepared his troops for the eventual showdown with Noriega and his entrenched cronies in the Panama Defense Force (PDF).3 Noriega eventually taxed the President's patience and U.S. credibility. On December 16,   1989, a Marine Officer, Lieutenant Robert Paz, was shot and killed at a Panamanian roadblock. The same night a Navy Officer and his widF were detained and assaulted. The put up limited opposition but refused to surrender until taken under fire by 90mm recoilless rifle and machine gun fire. The direct use of firepower against Panamanians defenders was only used when the PDF refused to surrender immediately. This demonstrated the very effective but controlled employment of fire power as a psychological weapon to subdue the Panamanians.
Task Force Atlantic was assigned to deal with a PDF unit at Colon, and some military units at Coco Solo. They rapidly overran the 8th PDF company located at Colon. "Light fighters" from the 7th Infantry Division and 82nd Airborne moved out against the Naval Infantry at Coco Solo where they met some stiff resistance, losing a SOF helicopter to ground fire. 
12
Their mission was to attack and seize the Tocumen military airport, and the adjacent Omar Torrijos International Airport by a night airborne assault. The facilities were defended by roughly 350 Panamanians, including the 2d Infantry Company of the PDF. Two AC-130's softened up Tocumen and destroyed the PDF barracks with 105mm fire just prior to the jump by 700 Rangers from the 1st Ranger Battalion who landed on schedule at 0103. Airport watch towers were sprayed with fire from AH-6s to eliminate PDF communications.
The Rangers met little resistance. The Spectres had done their job and stunned any real opposition. The Rangers needed to quickly secure the facilities for the follow on jump of nearly 2,000 troops from the 82nd Airborne. A secure field for the airborne troops was required, and the Rangers had to be prepared to defend the field in the event "Battalion security for the lives of our young Servicemen. DOD did not fulfill the compromise during Just Cause, notifying the news agencies just hours before departure time for the pool aircraft.
From the media's perspective the pool was a "Keystone Kops operation" from the starLt. Several members of the pool found themselves literally locked up and isolated from the action for their own safety. The only real action and civil disorder they saw was when their driver got lost.
Fred Francis who conducted an assessment of media matters after Just Cause found, "The pool was repeatedly denied or ignored when it asked for access to frontline troops, wounded soldiers-simple interviews,' he wrote later, 'the pool was a failure.'â¢ The Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, Peter Williams, called it a mistake and blamed it on 'incompetence" of his office and the staff at SOUTHCOM." In essence, he confirmed allegations that the Pentagon had wanted pool coverage, the local commanders-Generals Th'urman and LtGen Stiner did not.
Fred Hoffman, former deputy press secretary at the Pentagon, and a defense correspondent for the Associated Press, wrote a report for Williams that blamed Cheney for excessive concerns with security and the late activation of the pool. The report was also critical of Williams' naivety in not supervising the public affairs plan and for failing to ensure the media pool was supported upon arrival. ' Regrettably, few of the serious analyses produced since the war have focused on the major strategic issues of why, where, when, and how U.S. military force should be applied.
Intenal to the military though is a distinct and incontrovertible conclusion that the Gulf War repudiated the revisionists of Vietnam and validated the internal efforts of the military to revive itself as an institution.
The Vietnam experience was the touchstone for the senior military officers in the Gulf.
Their decisions and conclusions about the Gulf War cannot be grasped without a feel for the deeply rooted and emotive conclusions that they drew from Southeast Asia. As Colonel While his staff strongly recommended he not seek such support, the President overrode their recommendations to gain a last chance degree of support to force Hussein's withdrawal.
He requested Congressional authorization. The Administration also intervened to ensure the language of the resolution passed by the Hill would meet its requirements. Eventually, after several days of frequently eloquent and emotional debate, both Houses narrowly passed a resolution supporting "any means necessary" to liberate Kuwait."
In the end, Congress could claim that it had not abdicated its Constitutional responsibilities. Second, George Bush could now claim he had asked Congress for their suppor and received i Military observers would note that Congress had put their own Vietnam Syndrome behind them now."
The lesson of Vietnam were heeded, and building a solid home front was a key objective for the President and the military. National support was developed and maintained, but not through Reserve mobilization or the Congress. Public support was more a product of the President's and the military's ability to deal with populace through modern media, and the ability to talk over the heads of the pundits. They played to win that game too.
The preceding discussion has described the lessons perceived by the American military.
The Defense Department is satisfied that it received clear political objectives and accomplished them very satisfactorily. Mission accomplishment was largely the result of the application of an overwhelming amount of force, applied decisively. Clear lines of authority existed from the President, through the Secretary of Defes to the Chairman, and then to the warfighting theater commander. These clear lines and relationships clarified authority and represented the proper division of labor between civilian superiors responsible for political direction, and a military singularly qualified to manage the military end of the conflict.
Civilian authorities did not overrule military advice, and thus civil-military relations were smooth. Lastly, public support was maintained effectively, not through mobilization or Congressional support, but mainly through the military's ability to control the message put out through the mass media.
How do these lessons stack up? Are they valid, and can they serve as a useful template for future scenarios? Will we overlook the unique aspects of the contingency, and accept The belief that the media must be controlled is counterproductive for both the military and the country as a whole. The media is now prepared to resist any restrictions, and will go off on its own in the next war. Unreasonable constraints raise deep suspicions that the military has something to hide. A backlash could occur during the next war that will seriouly undercut popular support. An adverse situation could arise, like the Amariyah bomb shelter bombing in Baghdad that inadvertently killed 400 Iraqi civilians.Â° Without any degree of mutual tru and credibility, the next incident could become a propaganda victory for our opponents. Competent military officers have nothing to hide from the press, and attempts to handcuff the media as in Saudi Arabia will be futile and counterproductive.
After the war, Mr. Bush effusively declared "By God, we've licked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all."' Like the military, Mr. Bush exorcised his own ghosts and fulilled his promises. He pledged the war would not be *another Vietnam," that it would not be a halfway effort, with a murky ending.
Even when the military was tasked to provide forces for Somalia in late 1992, the so- Defend. Likewise, military power is also used to defend ourselves, and our allies.
The U.S. has numerous treaty obligations and collective defense arrangements. The credibility of these pacts is enhanced by the presumption that the U.S. government intends to and is fully capable of defending itself and its close friends. The defense literature normally includes the options of preventive war, or preemptive military operations, as legitimate means of maintaining a nation's defense. Such options are not consistent with the strategic culture or defense requirements of the U.S.
Decisive Force remains supportive of the defensive employment of combat forces.
The principle, as defined, minimizes any potential presumptions that the U.S. will fail to fully defend alliance members or U.S. possessions with anything less than a full response.
This will contribute to situations such as North Korea which threaten a U.S. ally.
Decisive Infln. The third purpose of military power is to achieve stated policy aims by decisively influencing another actor's policies and/or behaviors. This is accomplished by coercion or compellence. Coereion involves the active threat of force, as opposed to the more passive form of persuasion found in deterrence. Coercive diplomacy offers the possibility of achieving objectives economically, with little bloodshed, and fewer political costs and risk. 
35
Decisive Force provides real credibility to coercive diplomacy. A successful coercing power must create an image of urgency and unacceptable damage, and Decisive Force generates sufficient urgency and sense of risk in the opposing government's decision making process (assuming they are rational).
Coercive diplomacy is usually associated with crisis management and "brinkmanship."
A fundamental component of coercive diplomacy is the perception that military force is a real and viable alternative. Diplomats can weaken this credibility by employing a "try and see" negotiating tactic or by bluffing.' An antagonist can call a bluff. This forces a subsequent decision or reaction on the part of the coercing power. If the coercing power finds it lacks the necessary will or means to carry out its threat, its credibility is reduced.
A state may decide, for the purpose of credibility or prestige, that it needs to follow through on its threat, even if the original objective was not worth the costs and risks of combat. Techniques such as "try and see" can result in policy disasters and reduced credibility. Equally disastrous are situations when either diplomats or military figures make public statements that weaken the perception that military "sticks" are under active consideration, and that the targeted power is not under the real risk of unacceptable damage. Thus, effective coercion requires the close coordination of diplomatic and military considerations before the fact.
The other form of decisive influence involves the active form of compelence.
Compelling another government or group to change its goals or actions is normally accomplished by physically destroying its military capability or means to resist. This can also be done by the effective threat of force, when the target government changes its policy aims prior to the initiation of combat. Obviously, this purpose is consistent with the primary purpose for which military forces are trained and maintained. Decisive Force is completely consistent with the requirements of effective compellence.
i Matic S _M. The fourth and final purpose of military power is to provide necessary services, advice, and leverage to our diplomatic efforts. Military forces can provide a wide host of capabilities that enhance diplomacy or support international missions. International support in the form of security assistance, nation building, and peacekeeping are included in this category. Both the National Military Strategy and General Powell take support for such missions "as a given."" The historical record of the past several years in the Philippines, Iraq, Russia, Los Angeles, Florida, Bangladesh, Somalia, strongly support the conclusion that the military is both capable and willing to execute these missions.
Decisive Force does not seem applicable here but it is actually quite relevant.
Diplomatic support includes *military operations short of war," which by definition could involve peacekeeping and peace-enforcement tasks. 
1
Peace-enforcement operations are fundamentally different. They lack the formal agreement by the parties regarding the introduction of the interpositionary force, and lack any mutual consensus on terminating hostile activities. Thus, the peace-enforcement -_ protracted involvement. The strategy was limited by Congressional constraints which probably elongated our commitment, but forced us to draw on a cadre of core expertise left over from Vietnam. To Latin American specialists, the U.S. intervention is an unqualified success, although our experience could be "forgotten before its significance can be fully absorbed. "4
The issue of how the principle of Decisive Force relates to situations requiring the delicate integration of various instruments of national power needs to be addressed. At this point it is merely noted that a potential conflict exists if the strategic concept evolves into a basic warfighting doctrine applied universally across the entire contfict spectrum as implied in the 1992 National Military Strategy. It may not be applicable in situations short of war. Decisive Force seems most relevant in those situations where the introduction of forces for combat is contemplated.
Policy/StrateIy Inveson. The impetus behind some critics of Decisive Force has been a perceion the doctrine constitutes a restraint on the effective use of military power as an instrument of policy. The same criticisms were thrown against the Weinberger Doctrine, because its criteria were seen by some as restrictive and only satisfied by a Soviet thrust through the Fulda Gap or another Pearl Harbor. 
4
Several critics have claimed that the purpose of the Decisive Force doctrine is to invert the mbcwdiaton of military strategy to policy aims, by advocating a single and narrow straftic doctrine. These critics have read into the doctrine all the post World War H historical perspectives of American military culture-autonomy, apoliticism and absolutism. Under this interpretation, the doctrine limits the use of military means to Popular Support

The foregoing project has rigorously tested the principle of Decisive Force. The historical roots, development and refinement of the concept over the past two decades have been documented. The concept has been tested against the requirements for military force, to include expected scenarios where military force might be employed in the decade ahead.
Based on the study effort, the following conclusions have been drawn:
