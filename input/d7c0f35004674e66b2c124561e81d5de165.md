In the Caucasus region, especially Georgia and its Abkhazian and South Ossetian provinces, Russia has provided direct support to separatists.
In other cases, such as the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan or in the Trans-Dnestrian region of Moldova, Russia provides indirect support to keep these conflicts simmering.
These conflicts further impoverish areas in dire need of investment and productive economic activity.
They lay astride new and vulnerable routes to access the oil of the Caspian Basin and beyond.
They encourage corruption, organized crime, and disregard legal order and national sovereignty in a critical part of the world.
In the future, they could exacerbate the establishment of frameworks for regional order and create a new "frontier of instability" around Russia.
