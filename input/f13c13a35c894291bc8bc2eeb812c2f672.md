Colonel Warden makes a misleading generalization when he states that "force must be applied to all if the object is to be moved."
During the Austro-Prussian war, Austria's dilemma was political isolation, multiple enemy fronts (Prussia and Italy) and a militarily capable Prussian opponent.
Its decision to concede to Prussia's demands was due to the dynamic influence the single victory at Koniggratz had on all of its centers of gravity.
The Habsburg government was fragile and its people so diverse that within a year, the empire was split into a separate Austria and Hungary.
Prussia's effort to influence the Austrian military and alliance structure had an unexpected synergistic effect.
In this case force applied to two centers of gravity ended the conflict.
