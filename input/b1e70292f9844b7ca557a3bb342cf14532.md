In the evolution of U.S. Army doctrine and understanding of current military tactics, American officers did travel to Russia and Japan and observed the Russo-Japanese War in 1904 to 1905, which Japan defeated the Russians over control of Korea.
This was a different type of war than the American officers were used to but gave them the opportunity to observe a European and Asian power.
There were many casualties on both sides of this conflict.
Observers realized that eventually a tactical stalemate between two powers under modern warfare was likely.
The way the Europeans were going to overcome this stalemate was by ensuring a quick offensive operation that resulted in a quick defeat of the enemy.
