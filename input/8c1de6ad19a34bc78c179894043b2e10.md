The motivations of the individual participants ranged from noble to base. Some of the former German officers saw cooperating with the Americans as a way to bolster Germany's defense from the its historic and now growing menace to the east. Halder wrote as much to his American sponsor soon after accepting his task, -I have undertaken this task because I am of the opinion, that…we will be in a position to make an intellectual contribution to the defensive potential of the West.‖ 3 Other officers sought to solidify the myth of the apolitical Wehrmacht or to draw a distinction between themselves and the crimes of the regime they served. In addition to deliberate bias, there are, no doubt, inadvertent gaps in the telling. On topics large and small, and as is the case with all memoirs, the participants in Project 1946 suffer to some degree from -selective memory syndrome.‖ 4 Despite these limitations, the value of this and related efforts should be judged on its ability to fill gaps in an otherwise limited collection of primary sources material on the Iran-Iraq War. With the conclusion of decades of mistrust and more than a dozen years of conflict between the US and the Ba'ath regime in Iraq, a rare opportunity exists to develop a deeper understanding of recent military history from the point of view of former adversaries. If continued interest can be taken as a metric of value then this and related research efforts-such as the US Joint Forces Command's Iraqi Perspectives Project (IPP) and the Department of Defense's Conflict Records Research Center (CRRC)-indicate healthy and continuing institutional desire to learn from history.
The following is the second volume in the Project 1946 series. The project title refers to the efforts of a team of US Army historians and intelligence officers who, in the wake of World War II sought to understand what had occurred on the -other side of the hill.‖ Their partners in this effort were a select group of former German generals. Through the use of personal, organizational, and campaign histories, as well as the review of captured German records, these researchers forever changed the world's understanding of the war. In over a decade of work, the German program produced more than 500 monographs, covering an array of strategic, operational, and tactical issues. In 1961, a key participant in the program, former Colonel-General Franz Halder, was presented an award in the name of President Kennedy for -lasting contributions to the tactical and strategic thinking of the United States Armed Forces.‖ 2 The program's diverse utility and lasting impact is evident in such projects as the acclaimed official histories of World War II (the Green Books), the development of early Cold-War doctrines, and the regional studies that informed US operations in the Balkans late into the 1990s.
Despite the generally positive legacy of the German example, the program affords some important cautions that are applicable to Project 1946.   1   Franz Halder, former chief of the General Staff of the German Army led a series of research programs with his former colleagues in support of various US Army military history projects and foreign military studies programs in the decade following World War II.

The focus of the interviews in this Project 1946 monograph, as with the first, is the Iran-Iraq War (1980-88). This conflict is relevant more than 20 years after its conclusion for numerous reasons, but four are prominent.
First, given the totalitarian nature of both participants, available data on one of the bloodiest conventional wars of the twentieth century remains limited and heavily biased. While primary sources from within Iran remain almost non-existent, the opportunity to fully develop the Iraqi point-of-view will go a long way to illuminating this blind spot.
Second, many of the factors that precipitated the war in 1980-long standing border disputes, regional ambitions, local religious and ethnic strife, and geo-political tensions-remain in various forms. Anyone remotely familiar with the history of the Middle East can hope, but not be assured, that tensions between neighboring states will not spark a future war. The political and military history of past wars, to paraphrase Mark Twain, may not repeat, but sometimes, they do rhyme.
Third, the Iran-Iraq War saw the development and extensive use of weapons of mass destruction in a regional war. Iraq's experience as a regional power that developed and deployed chemical weapons, improved delivery methods, and strove to develop a nuclear weapons program, may provide a richer source of insights into proliferation than the Cold War experience of the West.
Finally, the context and character of warfare in this region have always been something of an enigma to outsiders. The debates in the West over changes in modern war, questions of whether there is such a thing as an Arab -way-of-war,‖ understanding the modalities of warfare in this politically and physically challenging region will all benefit from an in-depth study of the Iraqi perspective.
With the assistance of General Ra'ad Hamdani (the subject of the first Project 1946 monograph), the project's researchers interviewed Iraqi veterans of that long and bloody campaign. Those interviewed offered perspectives ranging from general strategy, the Republican Guard, air force, navy, and intelligence, to operations and combat developments. In each case, the interviewees worked with the research team by providing background information on their particular experiences and, in several cases, detailed personal histories. Each officer brought his own perspective to the questions and issues raised by the research team. Some were more comfortable discussing controversial topics than others, but each added significantly to our general understanding and opened the door to new lines of inquiry. * * * * * This monograph is composed of two parts. First is an overview essay that summarizes the major insights derived from the totality of discussion contained in the second part. The second part contains five interviews conducted during a seven-day period in three countries. The interviews were conducted in both Arabic and English. The transcribed and translated recordings of the interviews, augmented by notes taken at the time and other correspondence with the interviewees, constitute the basis of this manuscript. In editing the text for clarity, the authors endeavored to retain the original meaning. The editing process necessarily took into account the difference between the spoken and written word, differences in technical military language, and issues of transliteration. Any errors introduced during this process are the responsibility of the authors and not of the participants in this project.
This monograph represents a continuation of a series of research efforts designed to extend the knowledge of the contemporary Middle East, military history, and Iraqi military effectiveness during the course of three major wars: the Iran-Iraq War, the First Gulf War, and Operation Iraqi Freedom.

 the growth of Iraqi intelligence capabilities during the war's course,  the growth of Saddam's perceptions on the nature of war and his broadening understanding of the naval and air wars,
 the development of Iraqi military doctrine,
 the lack of a clear strategic or operational vision among Iraq's leaders, military as well as civilian, at the beginning of the war, and
 the difficulties the Iraqis confronted in incorporating technology and modern conceptions of war into military organizations that did not possess a high level of education.
During a ten-day period, the team from the Institute for Defense Analyses interviewed five senior Iraqi generals in three different locations: Amman, Dubai, and Cairo. All five subjects cooperated enthusiastically. They possessed detailed knowledge of military operations in different areas and of the changing nature of the battlefield as both sides adapted during the course of eight years of bloody war. To varying degrees, the generals possessed secular outlooks, reflecting their educational backgrounds. Perhaps most importantly, they were serious military professionals. They were also hostile to the Persians to varying degrees and regarded the Shi'a politicians currently in power in Baghdad as mere tools in Iranian hands. 
8
For the most part, the interviews did not contradict currently held views on the course of the Iran-Iraq War. But they did considerably extend knowledge in a number of areas and provided new insights into the conduct and support of operations by the Iraqi high command.
This was particularly true of the intelligence area, where research has thus far examined only scattered Iraqi estimates and perceptions of the Persian enemy. We also believe that the view of Saddam Hussein's personality-as well as of his leadership style and ability to adapt to the war's strategic, operational, and tactical conditions-will be more nuanced and realistic as a result of these interviews.
Throughout our discussions the generals agreed that Saddam had been a disaster for Iraq and its people. But at the same time, they painted a picture of a complex individual who often showed considerable insight into where the war was going and, at times, what needed to be done. Moreover, they agreed that there was a deep conflict within Saddam's psychological makeup between on one hand, his love for -Bedouin‖ commanders whose only qualifications
were their courage, and on the other for technologically and tactically capable professional officers who understood the demands of modern war. As the war unfolded, Saddam increasingly 8 One of the generals who was critical of Saddam and Ba'athist rule-particularly of its impact on the professionalism of the officer corps-nevertheless ascribed the March 1991 uprising against the regime as the result of Iranian agents subverting Iraq's Shi'a masses and not the result of a spontaneous rebellion against the regime's incompetence for having invaded Kuwait. 9
General Tarfa, who is still closely following events in Iran, admitted that the present regime in Tehran is in serious trouble and could collapse. Nevertheless, he still insisted that without external intervention, the clerics in Iran would still control Iraq in the future.
came to rely on the latter for advice and responsibility for major operations, but he never entirely gave up on the former in terms of major military appointments.
In addition to the interviews, the Iraqi generals each provided short personal monographs, which, due to limited resources, are not included in this paper. These documents obviously contain information and, more importantly, insights into the nature of the Iraqi military and the conduct of military operations that can deepen knowledge and understanding of the conflict. Not surprisingly, the generals were not eager to talk about the use of chemical weapons by Iraq's military. General Abousi, for example, stated that he had no knowledge of the air force's use of such weapons. Due to the compartmentalization of such information within the military, it is possible, though unlikely, that some senior individuals did not know about the use of chemical weapons in other parts of Iraq. However, the Project 1946 research team has learned from captured Iraqi military records that the mass use of chemical weapons by Iraqi air units was ordered in response to the successful Iranian attack on the Fao Peninsula in February 1987. From other discussions with former members of the Ba'ath regime during the past six years, members of the Project 1946 team believe the lack of recall is likely more related to fear of legal or other jeopardy than to fading memories or a determination to hide details of established events. Outside of the issue of chemical weapons, those interviewed were generally willing to talk about their experiences in an open and engaged fashion. Perhaps what was most surprising was the virulence of their anti-Persian and anti-Shi'a feelings-one of the generals going so far as to suggest that he would rather have diplomatic relations with Israel than with the Persians. 
10
Work done thus far by the Project 1946 research team suggests that Iraq wandered into the conflict with no clear set of strategic or operational objectives and with seriously flawed assumptions. This view rests on captured documents of the Iraqi military and government and transcripts of recorded conversations between Saddam and Iraq's military and civilian leaders in summer 1980.
In general, the interviews confirmed the supposition that Iranian actions, overt as well as covert, played a considerable role in goading Saddam into his decision to launch Iraq's military forces into Iran on 22 September 1980. Khomenini's covert campaign in April 1980 to undermine the Ba'athist regime in Iraq-to include the attempted assassination of Tariq Aziz, then-vice president, as well as other senior Iraqi officials-provided the foundation for Saddam's and his advisors' increasing anger. By summer 1980, relations between Baghdad and Tehran had disintegrated to the breaking point.
However, the generals indicated that what triggered the decision to go to war was the escalation of a series of border incidents. Specifically, the Iraqis regarded a major artillery bombardment on 4 September 1980 as the start of the war. What remains a puzzle is the rationale behind Iranian actions. Ironically, Khomeini's regime, during the year-and-a-half it was in power, had conducted a massive purge of the shah's military and thus was hardly in a position to provoke a major conflict.
There are a number of possible explanations for Iran's activities. Iran's misinterpretation of the correlation of military forces was a distinct possibility considering the ignorance of all things military among the ayatollahs. The belief that God would stand on the side of the true believers in a war against the godless Ba'athists is a second possibility. An assumption akin to that made by the Soviets before they invaded Finland in November 1939 (that the workers would immediately rally to their side) is a third possibility. Those around Khomeini believed the Shi'a of Iraq would rally to Shi'a Persia in any conflict. Finally, Khomeini and his followers could have believed, as was the case for leaders of the French Revolution in 1792, that an external conflict was the easiest road to solving their political difficulties at home. The Project team's best estimate is that all of these factors may have played a role.
What the interviewees did confirm was the general sloppiness of Iraq's preparations for war in the months immediately before hostilities began. In July 1980, senior Iraqi army leaders (corps and division commanders) met to discuss a potential war with Iran. Saddam did not attend, and there appears to have been no representation from the navy). 
11
The extent to which the decision for war surprised the Iraqi military is suggested by the fact that the navy's senior officers were not informed of the decision to invade until 20 September, two days before the invasion. As a result, two major naval units-floating batteries comprised of modified landing craft equipped with artillery-remained in Basra where they were refitting and undergoing overhaul and maintenance. Thus, the outbreak of war trapped them above the Shatt al-Arab and they had to be transported over land to Umm Qasr. With regard to the air force, the plans for the air attack on 22 September, which were supposed to replay the devastating Israeli attack on the Egyptian Air Force in June 1967, were not delivered to the attack squadrons until 20 September, so there was no time for rehearsals. Even then, the plans described the upcoming operation as a training exercise. Most of the crews did not know they were embarking on active operations until a few hours before takeoff.
The failure to examine the strategic and operational implications of war with Iran was disastrous for Iraq's opening moves. This was true for all the services: the navy simply assumed a defensive posture, the air force launched uncoordinated and ineffective attacks, and the army advanced on a number of different axes, none of which were mutually supporting, with the apparent goal of simply taking possession of Iranian territory. 
12
Perhaps the most serious weakness in the Iraqi invasion, however, was the fact that no strategic conception lay behind the campaign. The interviewees confirmed that Saddam held a number of differing, and in some cases conflicting, views throughout the immediate pre-war period as to what he hoped to achieve with the invasion. In the Project team's view, Saddam and his advisors believed that military operations might achieve a number of strategic goals.
They might persuade the Iranians to stop supporting Shi'a revolutionaries in Iraq who were attempting to overthrow the Ba'athist regime and arrest their harassment of the border areas.
They might allow Iraq to seize the oil-rich province of Arabistan with the support of local Arab tribes. 
13
14
Nevertheless, Saddam passed along no clear or consistent strategic vision, goals, or aims to his military leaders. 
15
The lack of a strategic purpose translated into a lack of clarity for the upcoming campaign.
There was an underlying assumption that the Iraqis, like the Israelis in 1967, would win a Blitzkrieg victory. But how military force was going to accomplish such a victory without clear operational or tactical goals was a mystery that Saddam and those surrounding him were incapable of examining. Instead, the Iraqi Army trundled into Iran with the hope that something might turn up. What turned up was completely unexpected: an extended war of attrition in which the existence of the Ba'athist regime was at stake. Adding to the difficulties that were to plague the Iraqis in their advance was the fact that they possessed no up-to-date maps and, in some cases, no maps at all of the territory through which their forces would advance.
Thus, 11 Iraqi divisions, as General Makki put it, drove down the 11 separate roads across the Iran-Iraq border. Without maps or information about the terrain through which they would advance, a number of formations got lost while others failed to reach their goals because of the difficulties they confronted crossing swampy areas.

stopped because they ran into Iranian resistance, as was the case at Khorramshahr. There, the attacking armored units, which possessed no infantry support for fighting in urban terrain, ran into fanatical Iranian militia. Eventually the infantry support arrived, but by then the Iranians had reinforced the city with substantial numbers of Pasdaran militia. 
17
18
For example, although it provided some support by firing Katyusha rockets into the cities from landing craft, the navy participated little in the fighting around Khorramshahr and Abadan. Had there been coordination, the Iraqi navy might have helped bottle up Iranian torpedo boats and cut off Iranian resupply efforts for the besieged Iranian garrison at Abadan. Not surprisingly, close air support for ground forces was non-existent, while, as General Kabi, former commander of naval forces, suggested, there was a complete wall between the navy and the air force until 1982. Conversations with the generals involved in air and naval operations suggest there was no significant improvement in cooperation between the two services through the end of the war.

1981 and 1982. 22
Furthermore, the 11 attacking divisions were spread across the front in positions from which they were scarcely able to defend themselves, much less support other units, while there was no central reserve. Thus, the defensive positions the Iraqi defenders assumed made no sense either operationally or tactically. 
23
However, by early 1982, that situation had changed as the Iranians got their act together. At that point in the war, Iraqi incompetence almost led to the destruction of their army and the fall of the Ba'athist state. 
22
23
At the heart of Iraq's difficulties lay the incompetence of its senior military leaders. In particular, General Shanshal, the army chief of staff from 1969 through the first defeats in 1981, proved incapable of making decisions. 
24
Saddam was an intelligent individual, but as the interviewees suggested, he was deeply conflicted, a man whose education was almost entirely due to his own efforts. 
25
Hamdani and Makki noted, Saddam remained a Bedouin in his heart. He also possessed a magnetic personality that dominated any group or meeting. But the generals interviewed also underlined the fear that all felt in his presence, especially given his capacity to make spur-ofthe-moment decisions that could end an officer's career or his life. According to Hamdani:
When he looked at you, he paid close attention. He looked you straight in the eye, as if to control you... Saddam had a number of personality traits. Sometimes he was intelligent, other times he could be as naïve as an illiterate farmer. One moment he would be extremely affectionate, the next moment he would be extremely hostile and cruel. Even Satan was better than Saddam at those times. One minute he could be overly generous, the next he could be extremely stingy. He had a great ability to listen, but then he would not allow you to say anything or he would refuse to listen to what you said. He was extremely courageous. He could take ideas from everyone and create a new idea. At a political level, he was an excellent tactical player; however, at the strategic level, 99 percent of his concepts were wrong.
Saddam was particularly unpredictable when he was angry. General Makki suggested that -Saddam would listen if you discussed an issue with him in a logical fashion. You just had to be careful [how you phrased the answer to his question].‖ 
24
25
Saddam judged his military subordinates by two criteria. The first lay in his belief that Bedouin tribal courage and loyalty were the most important attributes of successful military leadership. That certainly was reflected in the nature and capability of the military leaders he had promoted to major field commanders before the war in 1979 and 1980. But Saddam was no fool. According to General Makki, he understood careful analytic arguments as long as they did not challenge his fundamental beliefs. The true military professionals were never Saddam's favorites, even when they were most important. Increasingly throughout the war, he understood that he needed them, and more often than not, he heeded their advice. To paraphrase George Patton, Saddam never understood the aphorism that the business of war is to not to die for your country, but to make the enemy die for his.
At the war's outset, Saddam was heavily influenced by Ba'ath ideology. Thus, he believed that any Ba'ath leader could, at the same time, be a competent military commander. Thus, his selection of senior commanders was influenced not only by their personas, but also by their positions within the party hierarchy. As the war continued, however, and the operational situation bordered on desperate, Saddam came more and more to rely on professionals. Nevertheless, the process was a lengthy one and moved in stages to the considerable cost of soldiers' lives.
Far earlier than his military advisors, Saddam understood that things were going badly in summer 1981. However, as General Makki emphasized, at that time, the dictator simply could not get intelligent or realistic analyses from his immediate subordinates, and it was almost impossible for subordinate commanders to voice their thoughts. Of course, this was the result of the nature of the regime Saddam had created, a regime that rested on fear and intimidation. 
26
General Kabi, the navy's commander from 1984 through the war's end, attended somewhere between 50 and 60 meetings with Saddam, only two of which were one-on-one consultations. Some of these meetings were marathon sessions, lasting up to 12 hours. The general felt that by the middle of the war, Saddam was making a serious effort to inform himself about military matters in order to understand what was happening. However, Saddam was the only decision maker, with even his closest associates only executing his decisions.
The military disasters of 1981 and early 1982 forced Saddam to change his approach. After initially having a number of senior officers, including a corps commander, several division commanders, and numerous more junior officers executed, Saddam had to rely on more professional officers left after the purges. Nevertheless, this was a slow process and through the end of the war, Saddam at times relied on generals who were either sycophants or militarily inept. In this regard, by 1987, Saddam willingly tolerated the opinions and actions of his son-in-law Hussein Kamel, whom one of the generals interviewed described as a semi-literate. 
27
Interestingly, Saddam was more willing to tolerate professionals and their opinions in the navy and the air force. However, the interviewees agreed that when discussing military matters, everyone had to be careful not to overstep boundaries delineated by truths held by Saddam or to criticize Saddam's actions. At the end of the interview, General Makki indicated that Saddam was a mystery to him: not all evil, not all good, but in his character the bad had outweighed the good. More often than not, he followed his instincts more than his intellect. Saddam's character was fundamentally flawed in terms of a ruthless desire to dominate. In the end, his personality created disaster not only for him but for the Iraqi people. The general also noted that all Iraqis are tribal by their nature, meaning that their loyalties are first to family, then tribe.
The adaptation of Iraqi military forces to the combat conditions they faced was considerable in almost every way during the course of the war. The most difficult problem they confronted was that in the midst of conflict, they had to expand their military forces by an order of magnitude. This involved not only the sheer challenge of expanding and handling far larger forces on the battlefield, but also the difficulty of incorporating new technologies and complex intelligence into tactical moves. The human material with which the Iraqis were working, in terms of educational background and technological sophistication, represented a considerable challenge as well. Perhaps the greatest challenge of all, however, had to do with educating Sad-  wanted to return to finish the job.‖ After the war, he was assigned as the secretary of the general command, a job for the ineffectual and a position analogous to that held by Hitler's toady, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, head of the Wehrmacht high command in Nazi Germany.
For the most part, Saddam paid serious attention to the professionals when rebuilding Iraqi ground and air forces in the last half of 1982. The effectiveness, or rather the lack of it, within modern Arab militaries has been the subject of some debate. Several scholars have noted that, in general, Arab militaries are ineffective for reasons including a lack of unit cohesion, poor generalship and tactical leadership, poor information management, limited technical skills, inconsistent or even non-existent logistics and maintenance, low morale, misguided or inadequate training, and even cowardice. 
28
The generals interviewed distinguished between two kinds of officers: professional and political. The former are defined as, like most definitions of a professional, those for whom the work is a full-time occupation that has a unique body of knowledge associated with it, requires dedicated schools, and has objective standards of ethics and performance. In contrast, the latter exist merely within the military system without making waves, are often political appointments, and are promoted on the basis of loyalty and relationship rather than merit. The generals asserted that, although there were numerous good and professional officers within the Iraqi military, they functioned in a system dominated by political officers and stymied by political considerations. Despite the efforts of the professionals, as Hamdani and Makki emphasized, they were unable to change the system or limit the impact of the political generals. that no officer could be selected to brigade command who had not attended the staff college.
The crucial change came in 1987, shortly before Iraq's successful defense of Basra. Here, Saddam played a part in pushing the ideas that were emerging from the Combat Development Directorate. According to General Makki, the main changes included:
[A] return to the correct principles of war…namely, how to hold defensive positions. Second, we pulled a brigade out of the front line from each armored and mechanized division and half of the infantry divisions for training on defensive operations, while the rest of the forces held the front line. The Republican Guard provided a competent strategic reserve.
By 1987, the re-professionalization of the senior leadership had reached the point where troops could successfully defend Basra against a massive assault by the Iranians. Then, the fol-lowing year, the army launched a series of devastating attacks that broke the back of Iranian resistance. Nevertheless, as Generals Hamdani and Makki stressed, the army still remained a third-world military organization, lacking the tactical, educational, and technological capabilities to stand up to the challenges Coalition forces would issue in 1991. Iraq succeeded in the Iran-Iraq War largely because Iran proved so unwilling to learn from the battlefield. That Saddam was incapable of seeing that reality would lead to the disasters of 1991 and 2003.
Interestingly, the Iraqi Navy and Air Force displayed the greatest ability to adapt during the conflict. In the former, Saddam's desire to widen the conflict in 1982 by attacking Iran's economic infrastructure allowed the navy to conduct an imaginative and effective war against the movement of freighters to Bandar-e Khomeini and the tanker traffic attempting to use Kharg Island. That effort involved using long-range radars operating from the tip of the Fao Peninsula, signals intelligence that provided the movement schedules for convoys, and, at times, aerial reconnaissance. During this campaign, the Iraqis managed to lose only two of the nine missile boats they possessed at the beginning of the war. 29 While these efforts were not able to shut down Iranian tanker traffic, they did put considerable economic pressure on Iran.
Of the three services, the Iraqi Air Force was the least prepared for war. During the first several months of the conflict, it suffered heavy losses to Iranian F-14s and anti-aircraft defenses. Secondary sources on the war claim the Iraqis were forced to deploy their aircraft to neighboring countries; General Abousi said that was not true. He said that in early 1981, Saddam ordered them to stop flying for two months because their losses had been so heavy. In the summer of 1981, the Iraqis began acquiring their first Mirage fighters from France and Mig-25s from the Soviet Union. Aircraft upgrades during the next two years allowed them to gradually dominate the air. Despite help both from both Western governments and from blackmarket entities in smuggling replacement parts for its Western military equipment, Iran steadily lost the ability to maintain its irreplaceable US-built aircraft and crews trained in the United States.
By the last years of the war, Iraq's adaptation meant it could mount sophisticated air operations far out into the Gulf against tanker traffic bearing Iranian oil. In one case, the air force launched 14 Mirage fighters to attack tankers in the Strait of Hormuz. Two provided electronic-counter-measures cover during the first leg of the journey, six refueled the six that continued on the second leg, and three of those refueled the three that would finally fire Ex-29 Iraq managed to smuggle two new missile boats it purchased from the French through the Straits of Hormuz and up to Umm Qasr. ocet missiles at Iranian tankers. In another case, they apparently used a Chinese Badger bomber to carry a Silkworm missile to attack a tanker in that same area.
On the whole, Iraq displayed considerable adaptability during the conflict at the tactical and even operational levels of war. There were, admittedly, constraints on its abilities, the most important being the educational level of its soldiers. Given the nature of the regime, the most important adaptations had to take place in Saddam's mind; a process that was both slow and tortuous. On the other hand, like the British generals in 1914-17, the Iranians failed to adapt. Because of their penchant for making enemies, they were incapable of acquiring the heavy arms need to conduct the fire power-and maneuver-intensive warfare required for success in the flatlands of the Mesopotamian River Valley. An enormous distrust of the shah's military led the ayatollahs to refuse to make use of whatever expertise remained in the aftermath of the purges they conducted before the war. Thus, while the Pasdaran with its fanaticism was able to break into Iraqi positions, its units could never exploit these successes. The illogical response of the ayatollahs, then, was to call for more fanaticism and more volunteers for martyrdom that would break the Iraqis. This was hardly a serious adaptation. Eventually, the butcher's bill broke the religious mania Khomeini had created, and in 1988, Iran's leadership accepted the UN cease-fire resolution, effectively ending the war where it had begun.
Technological adaptation occurred largely in response to the pressures of a conflict with no end in sight. At the start of the war, Iran possessed considerable superiority in air-to-air combat, but its inability to replace its losses, combined with Iraq's increasing sophistication, wore away Iran's advantages. The French Mirage fighters that appeared in 1981 soon gave the Iraqis a significant advantage; they represented a considerable upgrade in technological complexity. While Iraqi pilots found them significantly easier to fly than their Soviet equipment, they also found the Mirage's electronics and navigational systems far more complex and difficult to master. In the ground fighting, the Iraqis felt their T-62s and T-72s were far superior to the M-60s and Chieftains the Iranians possessed. The weak training levels that were a mark of Iranian military forces early in the conflict only enhanced the Iraqi advantage on the ground. On the whole, it was not that the Iraqis enjoyed a technological advantage, but rather that they possessed the superior firepower along with maneuverability that allowed them to dominate their Iranian opponents on most battlefields.
When the war began, Iraq had virtually no military intelligence capabilities regarding Iran. In fact, the country immediately to east of Iraq was a tabula rasa, not only as far as Iraqi high command and Saddam were concerned, but to Iraq's General Military Intelligence Directorate as well. According to General Tarfa, in 1980 shortly before the outbreak of the war, those responsible for gathering and analyzing intelligence on Iran numbered three individuals-only one of whom had studied Farsi. (In contrast, the Israeli branch of Iraqi intelligence consisted of three separate staff sections and well over 20 analysts.) The Iraqis possessed few human intelligence sources inside of Iran, even in the border areas. Khomeini's rise to power only exacerbated the dearth of useful human intelligence during the early years of the war.

Iranian strategic and tactical messages that had been sent in the clear (as had the Russian messages at the battle of Tannenburg in 1914). This contributed to several Iraqi successes in early battles of 1980, but when it was publically revealed by Saddam's press secretary, the Iranians immediately began to encrypt their messages. The Iranians utilized manual codes through 1982, but the Iraqis were already one step ahead, having obtained a C-52 enciphering machine from Iranian officers who had deserted from the 64th Division in northern Iraq.

In 1983, the Iranians started using T450 electronic enciphering machines obtained from the Swiss.

Iranian message traffic from 1984 on was due to Iranian carelessness and lack of discipline when enciphering and transmitting its messages.

extensively when planning naval operations but was forbidden to discuss with his subordinates. On the other hand, General Abousi, who held senior positions in the air force during the last years of the war, indicated no knowledge of Iraqi code-breaking activities.
Iraqi code breaking played a major part in deception operations in 1988. The Iraqis monitored Iranian reactions to their military preparations and deception operations. With this knowledge Baghdad was able to fine tune its plans and effectively convince the Iranians that Iraqi forces were moving to defend Basra when, in fact, they were preparing to retake Fao. At the same time, the Iranians were running a deception designed to convince the Iraqis they were going to launch an attack on Basra, in order to protect operations to the north. 
To a considerable extent, the answers to the Project team's questions jibe with the documents and transcripts of Saddam's discussions we have examined so far.

Again, the generals were deeply suspicious of the Iranians. General Makki best expressed the commonly held view:
The Iranians are good fighters; they are very stubborn, high achievers; not afraid of death; loyal to their leaders. [Nevertheless], they are human and have limits. Religion is not enough. [Military organizations] must [also] have good [technological capabilities] and logistics. By 1988 it was too late. They lost their nerve, their will to fight. Iranians are good at deceiving you, masterful at gaining time.
At times it took perceptive questioning to push the Iraqis to provide crucial information. It was not necessarily that they were holding back, but rather that both interviewers and interviewees were reconciling perceptions of past events through the questions and answer process. The story about Iraqi code breaking is instructive in this regard. It emerged only in discussions about other issues. Indeed, it was only when the Project team expressed surprise about the major increases in the number of those working in military intelligence by 1985 that General Tarfa volunteered that the expansion was largely due to the Iraqi decryption efforts.
Similarly, it was only when we asked General Kabi about the nature of the specific intelligence in the northern Gulf that indicated when the Iranians were running convoys into Bandar-e Khomeini and Kharg Island that the general indicated that he (and he alone in the navy) had access to what the British called -very special‖ intelligence during World War II.
The interviews contained in this document are not intended to provide a complete picture of the events of the Iran-Iraq War. They represent nothing more than the recollections of a group of veterans of that conflict recalling events, impressions, and lessons of battles almost 30 years later. However, the manuscripts in the Project 1946 effort and related publications bring a heretofore unheard perspective of one of the largest wars of the last century. Given the indeterminate nature of the war, the totalitarian character of the states that fought it, and the pace of strategic events in the Middle East after the war, it is not surprising that primary source materials or access to senior participants has been limited. The collapse of the Ba'ath regime in Baghdad, the capture of a significant number of Iraqi records from this period, and the willingness of such veterans to discuss their perspectives is providing a new and important opportunity to examine a war whose implications echo in the events of today.
The oral histories included in this monograph generally cover the period between 1980 and 1988. Given the limitations of time and the scale of the war under discussion, the number of major topics not discussed far exceeds those that are. This would only be a problem if this were an attempt to write a history of the Iran-Iraq War. As stated in the introduction, our purpose here is limited to examining a narrower set of topics through the perspectives of a group of senior Iraqi participants. A detailed knowledge of the major diplomatic and military events of that war is not necessary to appreciate the perspectives presented. The following summary and timeline of the war is provided as a general reference and is not drawn from our Iraqi subjects.

The dramatic events of the Iranian Revolution in 1979 brought long-simmering issues back to full boil. Emboldened by the seemingly divine power of the political upheaval in Tehran, and with the explicit and implicit support of Iranian leadership, a revolutionary wind blew through Iraq's majority Shi'a population. Despite the Algiers Agreement (1975), Iran continued to assist Iraqi Kurds. On top of this, after the Revolution, the Ayatollah Khomeini began encouraging Shi'a discontent in Iraq in the hopes of spreading the revolution there. Fi-41 For a more detailed treatment of the Iran-Iraq War see Efraim Karsh, The Iran-Iraq War, 1980-1988  (1977-79), and at the Iraqi tactical school (1980). During the Iran-Iraq War, he commanded and served as a staff officer in various armored and reconnaissance units. General Hamdani became a member of the Republican Guard in 1982, and served as a senior training officer in the organization between 1987 and 1989. After the Iran-Iraq War, he commanded the 17th Armored Brigade, 6th Armored Division (Regular Army), and Medina Munawara Division (Republican Guard) and was commander of the II Corps, Republican Guard, when the United States invaded Iraq in 2003.
Section 1: Senior Leadership  Foreign Assistance  Officer Corps  Saddam's Personality  First Gulf War Hamdani: I was involved in two wars against the United States. Before the wars I had a great respect for your nation; even after the wars, I maintain that respect. That was problematic for me because, as a soldier, I had respect for another country that was the enemy. Thus, I did not possess a spirit of hostility towards Americans. At the same time I had a moral commitment to my country. This is a hard subject to discuss; few understand it except those who have experienced it.
1 Referred to during the interview transcripts as Hamdani.
Murray: General, when we met in Aqaba in 2007, we discussed Khuzestan and the Ba'athist commanders who carried out atrocities and executions, who by their actions removed any feeling of attraction for Iraq among the Arab tribes in the area. Could you explain, in terms of incidents or individuals, if this was a systemic problem during the war?
Hamdani: There were a number of incidents regarding this subject. In general, you, as historians, understand human nature and the nature of a third-world country. The problems started when Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979. He believed that the competence level, courage, and loyalty of the people were proportionate to their commitment to the Ba'ath Party. Since Saddam was not a military person, he did not believe in specialization. He believed as long as someone was a Ba'athist, he could be a military commander.
Thus, he promoted a number of officers several ranks above the rank they deserved. He assigned them as division commanders to the 3rd, 6th, and 10th Armored Divisions; the 9th Division was not formed yet. Tala al-Duri would eventually form the 9th Division.
In the Iraqi Army, which had the same structure as the British Army, a person cannot become a division commander unless he has been a brigadier general; one has to work one's way up and have the requisite staff experience. Al-Duri had no military experience, but he was promoted from lieutenant colonel to brigadier general and became a division commander immediately. He had been a first lieutenant, but was pensioned off for political reasons in the early 1960s. When the Ba'ath Party came to power in 1968, its leaders recalled several political figures, including al-Duri. He was not educated. He had no good qualities except courage. But Saddam loved violence. He encouraged and created the environment for violent personalities to rise into the senior ranks of the army.
The Iraqi Army has been modeled after the concept of knights, having morals and courage to sacrifice for others. It had a principle that commanders should protect the people under their command. However, al-Duri was a violent personality, who over-compensated for the military qualities he lacked. Thus, a new school of violence emerged within the army in the period before the Iran-Iraq War.
Murray: This is interesting, because the 9th Division was the division that did so badly in the fighting around Khorramshahr in the spring of 1981. Not only was al-Duri a violent person, but he knew everything and accepted no advice. Thus, he refused to listen to our warnings. He thought the enemy would never attack a hill that was 1,172 meters high. I have detailed descriptions of this battle in my book.

During the battle, his troops captured 56 people from Arabistan. All were wielding weapons against us because they were Iranians defending Iran. In al-Duri's backward mind, only traitor Iraqis from Arabistan would carry weapons against other Iraqis. He considered this treason. So he executed them and was proud of his actions.
Murray: If you want to win people over, you don't start by executing large numbers of them.
Please continue with the al-Duri story.
Hamdani: When he killed these people, he was proud of what he had done. He forgot the fact these people belonged to tribes, not just a region. There were preliminary indications that most of the people in the region were happy to be liberated from Iranian rule. However, with the tribes, when you kill one member, the entire tribe turns against you. Despite his knowledge of tribal behavior, he killed the 56 individuals. They were not Iraqi soldiers to be viewed as traitors. Moreover, he treated the tribes in the region badly. The entire region turned against him and, as a consequence, against Iraq. The strange part is that Saddam did not hold al-Duri liable for his actions. Instead, Saddam considered this an act of courage. Saddam's psychological makeup guided this action and cost us greatly.
Moreover, we had many other violent commanders whom Saddam loved, but whom the Iraqi Army hated. They carried out executions of their own soldiers. When they suffered a defeat, they executed their own soldiers as punishment. Saddam considered this an act of courage. Al-Duri was among the most murderous of these commanders. Other commanders of a similar ilk who emerged during the war included Colonel Hisham al-Fakhri; General Nizar al-Khazraji, who later became the chief of staff of the Iraqi Army and fled the country in the 1990s to join the opposition (he currently lives in United Arab Emirates); and Colonel Taha Shakarji. Men such as this received Saddam's acceptance, but were despised by the army.
Arabistan is a term applied to the Khuzestan province in Iran dating back to 639 CE when the area was conquered by Arabs. Although the increasingly Arabic population has enjoyed a semi-autonomous status throughout its history, it was brought firmly under central-Iranian control in the 1930s.
Hamdani: He was never held accountable for his actions. After commanding the 9th and then the 12th Divisions he was moved to the 3rd Armored Division. Saddam wanted to keep him in a command position because he was courageous, and he loved these kinds of commanders. In 1982, the 3rd Armored Division had just lost a major battle and the commander, a Kurd named Juwad Shitnah, was executed. Al-Duri was given command of the division right after the division lost the battle.
Tell us about Shitnah, and the 3rd Armored Division.
Hamdani: I worked with Shitnah on the Syrian front in 1973 and in the rebellion of 
Barzani and his Kurds in 1974-75. 5
Shitnah was courageous and experienced in counter-guerilla tactics. Because he was Kurdish and lived in a mountainous region, he understood the nature of the region and the Kurdish people. He knew how to give as well as follow advice. After the Muhamarra
[Khorramshahr] battle at the Karun River, Shitnah was executed in 1982, along with Salah al-Qadhi, Commander of III Corps. 
6
These were strong and well fortified. Even if the enemy were to cross, these positions would hold. What is more, when the enemy advanced, they were channeled between these fortified positions. Shitnah thought he could run a mobile battle, but that required a number of armored units, air support, and artillery support.
The 3rd Division was a good division; it was the ‗mother' division for us. Shitnah thought the enemy was going to cross the river, but he did not think that the number of forces (ar-5
These are references to the October 1973 Arab-Israeli War and the Kurdish Rebellion (1974-75) led, in part, by Mullah Mustafa Barzani.
my, Pasdaran, 7 and Basij 8 ) would be ten times greater than his force. 
9
That was the disagreement between the General Field Marshals Gerd von Rundstedt and Erwin Rommel in 1944 at Normandy. 10 Shitnah ignored the precedent. He wanted to pull the enemy onto the battlefield and then destroy it. That was his plan. Due to the large number of attacking Iranian troops, the fortified points were too weak to stop them. Shitnah tried to concentrate against the main brigades, but it was not possible to slow the enemy, so these units started defending themselves instead of counterattacking. As a result of this mistake and poor planning, the Iranians destroyed the 3rd Division. It was not just the commander's mistake, but that of the corps command that had supported his idea.
Murray: At this point in the war the Iranians had begun using human wave assaults. . Had the
Iraqis not yet adapted to the extent to which Iranians were willing to sacrifice themselves?
Hamdani: Yes, the human wave attacks had begun. They were not military. Everything has a context, a procedure, but since these Iranian's were non-traditional troops, they kept advancing to the point that 15 or 20 of them would keep moving. Each phase of a military operation is supposed to happen at a certain time (for fire support, etc.), but these Iranian's had neither phases nor organization. They did not care if they had fire support or anything; they had no concept of command and control, timing, etc. They just kept moving-they swarmed through our artillery zones, which wrecked our plans and calculations. As a result, Shitnah was held liable for not doing his duty and was executed along with the 12th Division Commander, Colonel Masa abd-al-Jalil, and the III Corps Commander, General Salah al-Qadhi.

The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), also known as the Pasdaran, is one of Iran's two major irregular light infantry forces. Its structure parallels that of the regular armed forces and comprises ground, naval, and aviation forces. It was originally created to counter support for the shah at the time of the Revolution.
8
The Nirou-ye Moqavemat-e Basij-Mobilization Resistance Force-is Iran's other major irregular light infantry force comprising an all-volunteer paramilitary militia. Murray: It appears that the Iranians could not exploit what was clearly the collapse and defeat of the 3rd Division due to a lack of command and control. Once the Iranians overwhelmed the Iraqi front line, it appears there was no direction to the advance-it was just a mass of humanity. Is that why the Iranians could not exploit their initial successes?
Hamdani: This was typical of Iranian forces: they could succeed, but they did not know how to exploit that success. They lacked a command and control system, as well as a combat logistics system. Each soldier carried his own water, bread, and ammunition, but no weight otherwise. They were civilians. They used North Korean doctrine and had North Korean experts throughout the war. It was the same thing when it came to crossing a bridge or a mine field. They simply charged ahead without regard for losses.
Woods: Did the Iraqi Army ever capture any North Koreans?
No. We learned about the Koreans from interrogating prisoners.
Woods: You described how the defeated Iraqi commanders were executed after this battle.
Can you tell us more about how this happened? Was there a trial? Did members of the regime intelligence service come down and take them away? This was a serious issue and it had a great impact on the army. From this point on, commanders chose to avoid responsibility. For example, sending out reconnaissance patrols is a commander's responsibility. Only a commander could send a patrol at the battalion level. Because of this fear of responsibility, corps commanders would wait for approval before sending units on reconnaissance missions. This killed the creative spirit within the army's structure. I confronted this problem in my own unit when I was a commander. I wanted to assume responsibility. I discussed this issued twice with Saddam, several times with Qusay Hussein, and with the minister of defense and the army chief of staff; I argued that it was important to provide a commander a margin of error in case mistakes should happen. This particularly affected us in the last war of 2003. Commanders would wait for an order from higher up before executing any decision.
Murray: General, in times past, such trials were known as -drum head courts marshals.‖ In light of our discussion it appears that there were two threads to Saddam's treatment of the officer corps. In 1982, Saddam began looking for more competent individuals to run things, while at the same time he was looking for more violent or courageous individuals.
Hamdani: This reflected his philosophy. He believed in violence.
Murray: Doesn't this seem a bit schizophrenic? On the one hand he liked the violent thuggish individuals. On the other hand there was a level of competence that he recognized in people. Was there a tension here?

to military academy standards, but education has two sides. You are heading towards the more dangerous side. At the technical level, I consider you the best commander in our army, but at the moral level and political level you are dangerous.' Saddam was torn between two views of the world, two conflicts. He wanted complete loyalty to himself, which required violent, ignorant personalities. On the other hand, he needed competent leaders because of the size of his army and his goals. In the end, he admitted that holding a high rank within the Ba'ath Party did not necessarily make one a competent commander. Nevertheless, he only trusted his relatives, so he sent them to work with me. In a 2002 meeting, Saddam told me he was confused and surprised with regards to three of his relatives who worked with me. He said, ‗I enrolled them in the academy then I sent them to learn from you. How come they have not reached the same level of competence you have?' I explained that the staff college could not turn a bad officer into a good one. The good officer exploits what you offer him to improve his education and knowledge. If the officer is good to start with, he will get better. I argued that spirit and morale are characteristics of military service. I also argued that military experience has three aspects: the material side, the intellectual side, and the spiritual side.
When Saddam asked what I meant, I said, ‗It is about ideology, spirit, and behavior. The military is different from other sciences which start from the general and become more specialized through experience.' For example, a doctor will study general medicine, and then specialize later. In the military, it is the other way around. You start off with a specialty, and then end up becoming more and more general. That is why they call the senior-most rank ‗general,' because that rank is not specialized, it requires great knowledge and expertise. I noted the following example. The Battle of Montenotte in 1796 was between the French Army, led by Napoleon who was a brand new general, and the Austrian Army, led by General Beaulieu.
17
He thanked me saying, ‗You really explained something to me that had completely slipped my mind.' I told him that the right way was to look for people with experience, broad knowledge, and talent.
Murray: After Tala al-Duri escaped from the disaster of the 9th Division and sat on the trial of his successor who had command for all of three days, did Saddam give him a new appointment?
Hamdani: Yes, he became the secretary of the general command. He became like Field Marshal Keitel with Hitler. We were extremely surprised when he was appointed to this position. For the army it was step backwards, because we had been trying to work toward competence.
Woods: What were the key responsibilities of the secretary of the general command? What were his day to day activities?
The general command was formed the night of the attack on Iran, 22 September 1980. It consisted of high ranking staff officers representing all branches of the armed forces with the responsibility to offer military to Saddam.
Murray: Did al-Duri remain in that position for the rest of the war, or did he move to a new position?
Hamdani: He remained until he was pensioned off after 1991. Let me tell you a story about al-Duri. In the early 1990s, I took a vacation with my wife, while I was a division commander in the Republican Guard. I was in my civilian car on the expressway. A blue Mercedes was following me, with someone wearing blue inside. I tried to move to the right side so he could pass me, but he kept moving to my side. Then he passed me with his flashers on; he wanted me to stop so I stopped behind him. When he got out of the car, I saw that it was al-Duri. I got out of the car and shook hands with him. He said, ‗I would like you to tell Saddam the next time you see him that it is wrong that such a important officer like myself has been pensioned off.' He considered himself to be a great commander. I told him that no one could raise the issue with Saddam. I got back in my car and drove off. My wife asked who that was. I wanted to tell her briefly who al-Duri was, so I told her that he had caused the death of a third of the Iraqi Army and now wanted to return to finish the job! Today, he is the military commander of the Ba'ath Party with Izzat al-Duri in Syria. 
18
In 1978, Khairallah was a colonel. When Saddam took power in July 1979, Khairallah was promoted to a full general. Was he viewed as a political general?
Hamdani: I regard him similarly to how many other officers view him. During the war, I came across Khairallah in many situations. Let us begin at the beginning of his career as a commander of a tank battalion, and then commander of the 10th Armored Brigade. He had noble characteristics: high morals, strong professionalism, and a military spirit. His soldiers and his officers loved him. He was a role model for other commanders. Although he was Saddam's brother-in-law and took advantage of his position to help many, he never took advantage of his relationship with Saddam in a way that compromised his moral principles. He respected the people above him and below him.
The problem arose when he was appointed to be minister of defense in 1977 with the rank of colonel. The situation was strange because the minister of defense is a political position. He could have been pensioned off with his colonel's rank and then appointed as minister of defense as a civilian. As the minister of defense with his colonel's rank, he was the deputy commander of the armed forces with command over other generals including those with ranks much higher than colonel.
The first incident happened when Khairallah visited the III Corps in Basra in 1977.
When he paid this visit, the commander of the III Corps, Lieutenant General Adnan al-Shawi, was a three-star general. Al-Shawi was in a bit of a dilemma here. Normally an officer would go out to the aircraft and greet the high-ranking officials, such as the minister of defense, with a salute. Al-Shawi found it hard to salute a man with a lower rank. Since he was a good officer, respectful of military rank, he decided not to greet Khairallah outside, but instead to remain at his office. The new minister of defense arrived and was greeted by a staff officer. Khairallah asked, ‗Where is the corps commander?' The staff officer replied, ‗The commander is in his office, but is too embarrassed to come out to greet you.' So the minister of defense walked back to his aircraft and returned to Baghdad. He raised this issue with his political superiors. Bakr was the president then; Saddam was the vice president. 
19
Adnan Khairallah was loved by the Iraqi Army and was considered a safety valve of sorts. Most officers did not really care about his competence as a general officer-it was his personality they loved. In most armies the chief of staff of the army is the real person in charge. Because Shanshal, who was a four-star general, was the chief of staff of the army and a four-star general, he and the other senior generals did not really care that much when Khairallah was promoted. 
20
However, it became clear during the Iran-Iraq War that Adnan lacked the capacity for strategic thinking. The concepts at the division level are really important at the strategic level of command, but they were no substitute for a strategic vision. Adnan was the understanding type. He could listen to suggestions and consultations. In this regard, compared to Hussein Kamel, Adnan was a prince. He saved many commanders who had political problems with Saddam. Each command has both doves and hawks. Khairallah was a dove. With all his good characteristics, it is not surprising that everyone in the army loved and respected him. They felt he was a safety valve for the army and the only individual who could protect them from Saddam, because Saddam listened to Khairallah. I remember talking with Qusay just after the 1991 war, I said, ‗If your uncle Adnan Khairallah had been here, Kuwait would not have happened.' Although it was a harsh thing to say, Qusay nodded in agreement. Khairallah died on 5 May 1989. He was with his family on a trip to the northern Iraq. He left the family there and returned on a Ger- There have been comparisons of these two beloved personalities.
Woods: In the West, there was suspicion that Saddam Hussein was involved in Adnan Khairallah's death. 
21
There was a general feeling that the British Army was better than the US Army; however, General Tawfiq disagreed, ‗No, this is not true.' Then he gave us an example. He had once attended a training course in the United States and was impressed by the discipline of American soldiers. Because most of us followed the British military method, we quietly called him ‗General Tariq Tawfiq, The American.'
On another occasion General Tawfiq visited my unit, which was at the time assigned to a strategic location. He saw that I had military books relating to armored warfare, as well as the memoirs of Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery. 
22
Woods: What happened to General Tawfiq?
Hamdani: Because he was a good and competent commander, the Ba'athist command dismissed him. He was pensioned off in 1978, when he was the commander of the 3rd Armored Division. The army lost him because politics interfered with the military.
The Ba'ath Party removed many senior officers who had training and experience with foreign armies, whether British, American, or French. From 1970 on, the Ba'ath
Party was no longer willing to send officers to Fort Leavenworth, or Camberley, for training at the staff college to broaden their experience. 
23
Hamdani: There were two reasons: political and practical. In 1976, the political command wanted the Iraqi military to reject British military culture and move closer to Soviet military culture; military commanders disagreed. The problem for the military was that Saddam was strongly influenced by Soviet doctrine, which led to many of the changes instituted. Ba'athist ideology is an Arabic version of Marxist ideology. This is why Saddam thought that political leaders could run the military. Saddam's greatest mistake in the 2003 war was allowing political leaders to run the war. The idea of having political officers in our army was a Soviet phenomenon that Saddam introduced into the army. Saddam also wanted to replicate Soviet political guidance. These ideas all proved misguided and failed.

31
On the night of 24 February, I was injured as a result of an A-10 missile attack.
In 1994, on the night Saddam informed me that he wanted to invade Kuwait, I explained that the Abrams could hit five out of five targets while Iraqi tanks hit only one out of five. The Abrams system is very advanced. As a division commander, I had no comparable system. The Abrams tank fights better at night than during the daytime because GPS could locate everything, while we were blind. The Apaches had an eight-kilometer range with fire and forget missiles. Then, there were also the F-16 and F-15 attack aircraft, satellites, etc.
32
There was also Soviet technology and decontamination equipment. In 1984, I learned from friends that the Iraqi Army chemical corps had a highly secret project to produce chemical weapons. This was done in extreme secrecy.
In 1984, the Iranians had infantry superiority and utilized approaches like the water channels and lakes where we could not use our armor. The first use of chemical weapons came in the marshy area of Hawr al-Hawizeh. Our air force dropped chemical weapons in canisters; however, we did not know which agents were deployed and whether they were persistent or non-persistent.
We used to wonder whether using gas was effective. We asked the Iranian prisoners about the effectiveness of gas; most of their comments indicated it was not, because the weapons used were of the volatile type. Such use of chemical weapons was not practical, because it required information such as the speed of wind, etc. In 1986, the Iranians occupied the Fao area, which had a significant impact on us because it represented our only access point to the sea. Moreover, Fao was an extremely swampy area so that we could not use our armor, which usually gave us superiority. We learned that some of our artillery had been modified to launch chemical weapons, in addition to air dropped canisters.
Our sources indicate that Baghdad's first reaction to the attack on Fao was not to move troops, because the military command believed that Basra was the main target. Do you think this was a major factor in the heavy use of chemicals during the battle and throughout the war?
Hamdani: A headquarters was established to rotate exhausted troops in and out of the battle.
We had significant losses among our troops; there were major failures in the field. Victories were measured in meters; however, troops cannot use such standards in combat.
The Iranians crossed from Iran into Hawr al-Ahwar, near Fao. There was an industrial project in Hawr al-Ahwar to produce salt from the clayish mud in the area that was saturated with sea water. It was done through a series of parallel channels. Although this area was not ideal for troop movement, the Iranians were able to remain there. Missiles fired and bombs dropped from aircraft sank deep in the mud unless they exploded in midair. Once, when I was doing reconnaissance in the area, I was caught in an Iranian artillery barrage. Three shells hit near me, 2-to-3 meters apart. I was covered in mud. But the rounds sank 3-to-4 meters deep into the mud before detonating. Our artillery and air force had to use air bursts. This limited their lethality because the special fuses required for air bursts were hard to obtain in sufficient numbers. The Iranians quickly created concrete fortifications to protect against the air bursts, while that caused us even larger losses. Approximately 53,000 Iraqis died in the fighting with 287,000 wounded over a two year period. Iran was able to replenish after similar losses, but we were not. The result was that we resorted to the use of chemical weapons after our heavy losses at Fao.
Iranian losses were less than we had expected because the area was so soft and we did not possess air-burst chemical weapons. We resorted to bombing the orchards to the east; based on information gathered during the interrogation of Iranian prisoners, but our chemical weapons had only limited impact.
In 1987, the Iranians began using chemical weapons in a limited manner. On 17-18
April 1988, we launched a chemical attack to liberate Fao, but the wind shifted direction and affected our troops rather than the Iranians. We were forced to attack while wearing protective masks. The damage inflicted on us was greater than on them. Despite this, the attack was launched with a first-rate plan and preparations. The assault group possessed amphibious vehicles (like ducks) and a large mat to roll over the terrain, so trucks could drive over the swampy areas. Thousands of tons of gravel were poured into the marsh so tanks could operate without getting stuck. During the 1988 offensive at Fao, we lost only 1,086 Republican Guards.
We used chemicals in a limited manner to liberate Majnun Island and the marshes area later that year. We also used the airborne forces, pontoon, which carried tanks and vehicles, and helicopters which transported the infantry. Although we did not use chemical weapons in the other two battles, the Iranian forces collapsed.
In the north, the enemy's center of gravity was in Halabjah. Their forces held strong positions, and they did not expect us to attack. That is why the battle was successful. We used chemical weapons there in a limited fashion. We had the advantage of superior timing and injured, they were not the intended targets of the strike. In effect, they were collateral damage. There was an agreement whereby Jalal Talabani was supposed to evacuate the area of civilians; he provided a document or statement indicating that he had evacuated them from that area. It has been reported that 5,000 Kurds died because of the Iraqi chemical attacks. This is an exaggeration. The Kurdish leadership used the incident to attack us. This is the truth for those who want a truthful to history.
34
Woods: Who had the authority to initiate the use of chemical weapons? Was it the local commander or the higher command in Baghdad?
The order to use chemical weapons came from someone between the corps commander and the chief of staff of the army with Saddam's full knowledge.
Woods: Given all their experiences using chemical weapons in the 1980s, how would you describe the attitude of Saddam and the senior generals toward chemical weapons in general? What did he take away from these experiences? What did do you think they learned? Executions only took place during the battle after a withdrawal. Before the executions were stopped, anyone who carried out an execution was promoted by Saddam. Because Saddam was a violent person, he resorted to violence in order to make defeat worse than remaining in the field. This had a negative impact on the army's morale. The commander looses honor and dignity, and soldiers need to look up to their commander as a father.
The executions caused them to regard their commanders with fear as though they were the enemy.
Murray: I have seen a speech by Saddam, in which he says: ‗When soldiers no longer fight for the love of their leader, then they must fight by fear.'
Nathan: Was Colonel Jafar Sadit's superior officer [Kamel Sajid] held accountable for this failure?
Hamdani: No. Kamel Sajid was commander of the I Corps at the time and earlier had commanded an infantry division in the Republican Guard. He was also the corps commander responsible for the 66th Special Forces. He was not a competent commander because, although he was courageous and honest, he abdicated responsibility-he would dump responsibility on the shoulders of his subordinates. He eventually became deeply religious and spent the remainder of his life tormented by his sense of guilt. His performance in Khorramshahr in 1980 was competent and brave but the situation required more than that. Saddam admired Kamel Sajid, because he represented the ideal of physical fitness in the Special Forces. Sajid was honest, but he did not know how to handle problems. A commander's first task is to be responsible for his subordinate's mistakes. He became governor of al-Muthanna province in the south. He was a good, simple man; his weak-ness was that he did not want to take responsibility. He carried out the execution of Sayef Saud, but was not responsible for it. He was executed later because of his involvement in a conspiracy against the regime. It is a bloody history.
Woods: What were your impressions of the Popular Army? How were they used, and how did they work with the regular army?
Hamdani: When the Islamic Revolution flared up in Iran, one of its primary goals was to spread into Iraq because 1) Iraq had a secular regime [Ba'ath Party ideology is secular,
not Islamic]; and 2) Iraq was an obstacle to Iran's goal to liberate Palestine. Khomeini thought a second victory could be achieved in Iraq.
Iranian intelligence began stirring up Iraqi Shi'a, which made up 60 percent of the population. Most Shi'a leaders were graduates of Iranian religious schools. Thus, Iraq confronted major aggression. In 1979 and 1980, religious groups started to organize and expand within Iraq and within the Iraqi armed forces. There were more than 1,000 border violations by Iranian forces into Iraq by land, air, and sea, while terrorism occurred throughout Iraq. There were also attacks at special occasions and celebrations. Khomeini called for the overthrow of Saddam's regime. There was general belief among Iraqi leaders that the situation would persist until overall security collapsed in Iraq, and then Khomeini's Revolutionary Army would launch an attack.
Consequently, the Iraqi government decided to launch a preemptive war. There was some international support for the war.

Woods: This is interesting because, of course, the Iraqi Ba'ath is a product of two revolutions:
the 1963 revolution which ultimately failed and the 1968 revolution which succeeded.
Why did Saddam Hussein believe that presenting the Iranians with an external threat would allow a secular counter-revolution to succeed? Did he not think this would be used as a way to unify the Iranian population around the revolution instead of driving them away from it?
Murray: I might add that that it seems the problem for a secularist like Saddam or even the communists in Iran was their inability to conceive of a revolution stemming from religion. That is the leftist tradition in the West. It is, of course, wrong; revolutions can come from any source.
Hamdani: Saddam was a national revolutionary. The Iranian revolution was a religious revolution. Religious philosophy appears to be the opposite of national philosophy. Religion does not recognize patriotism or nationalism.
The goals of the Islamic Revolution came at the expense of a national revolution. There were no principles to start with, there were only interests and the interests were in contradiction. For example, Chinese Marxist theory contradicts Soviet Marxist-Leninist theory. Such interests could take on a revolutionary framework or a secular framework.
Saddam claimed to be a revolutionary. He thought that accomplishing Ba'ath goals in Iraq could be done only through his efforts. That posed a problem because the political approach cannot address all interests. Saddam wanted to control the Arab world, while Khomeini wanted to control the Islamic world. Iraq is a part of both. It was a conflict of basic interests. Most people are idiots on this subject; they just do not understand.
Murray: Saddam had one goal: drawing the revolutionaries out of Tehran; however, in reality, there were always multiple potential outcomes. Saddam seemed unclear about these What would Iraq gain at that time? First, Saddam would achieve a military victory and be considered a great commander. Saddam had read that the greatest commanders in history were those who fought and achieved victory. Second, in the process of military victory, Iraq would regain those areas given up in the Algeria Accords in 1975, which had been lost in exchange for Iran's ceasing to support the Iraqi Kurds, specifically small areas along the disputed frontier, the oil fields in Abadan, and Shatt al-Arab. 
39
If victory were achieved, Iran would owe something to Iraq, where as in the past it had been the other way around. There is a history of discord between Iraq and Iran-people 38 Salah ad-Din Yusuf ibn Ayyub (b. 1137) was the Sultan of Egypt and Syria who united most of the Levant. He is best remembered for recapturing Jerusalem from the Crusaders (1187). 
39
of the hill and people of the plains. Iraq has always been subject to raids and attacks from Iran because it was flat. The problem became worse with the discovery of oil.
Saddam thought he would achieve a great strategic, as well as political, victory, and would become leader of the Arab world. For this he engaged in a war for which he had not properly prepared. If the military academy and Iraqi staff college had developed the military plan, it would have been very different from the one he executed; he violated basic military principle during the invasion of Iran.
By 1982, the fighting had exhausted our troops. The Iranian population was three times the size of Iraq's; it was well-suited to wage a long war. The nature of a long war is described by Sun Tzu in The Art of War. 40 Saddam made a huge strategic mistake; he later realized he needed real reserves.
On the details of the military plan, from July 1980, when Iraqi military leaders were told to prepare for war against Iran sometime in the future, who was involved in military planning? Was it just Saddam, or were corps and division commanders involved? Did they have a chance to look at terrain, offer opinions, and make decisions?
Hamdani: General Shanshal was the chief of staff of the army. He and his planners adopted a political philosophy of war and turned it into a military concept. With regards to decisionmaking, the chain of command was as follows: Saddam to Adnan Khairallah to Shanshal to the planning and operations directorate. They called this process the ‗Guidance for Political Planning of War.' The leader of the planning directorate was a three-star general, Abdul al-Asadi. He was a graduate of British schools, an excellent officer and commander.
However, the process was contrary to traditional planning in the army. What we studied at the military academy and the staff college was completely different from this process.
Woods: When did the corps commanders become involved in the planning process?
Hamdani: On 6 July, there was a meeting attended by political commanders and the corps' ranking military commanders. The next day, 7 July, our commanders told us of the upcoming war with Iran. We were told that the war aimed at preventing an Iranian attack and an escalation of rebellious activities by the Shi'a in Iraq. Iraq's security was in extreme danger. It was such a threat that it required the country to launch a preventative attack. 
40
At that time (in either October or November 1980), some academic faculty from Bakr University visited my unit to discuss this issue. 41 These were some of our best military professors; they supported my suggestions, my ideas. They pointed out, however, that the decision not to withdraw to better positions was a political not a military one. That is when the long war started. The Popular Army filled the gaps along the border so that the regular infantry troops could move up to the front.
At what point do you think Saddam realized that Iraq was in a long war? I have seen some indications that as early as November 1980 he recognized that the war was not going as planned. And yet, the real mobilization of Iraq does not occur until the summer of 1981.
For politics, it is the same problem as for drugs. The UN and the Islamic Conference made some attempts to broker a settlement. On 18 September, Iraq declared the war by ending the previous Iranian infiltration. On 22 September, we entered Iran in depth. Even though no one declared victory, as when Napoleon entered Moscow, Saddam was waiting for someone to declare victory, but no one from the counterrevolutionary groups made a move. On 4 October, we were told to destroy all barriers at the borders, the control posts, etc., because on 5 October Iraq would announce a unilateral ceasefire. The high command gave these orders because once the war ended they thought Iraq would establish new borders. Iran refused the ceasefire, and the president of Iran made a statement that this was Iraq's first step backwards. Iraq along with the United Nations and the Islamic Conference then created a ‗Goodwill Committee.' [Julius Kambarage] Nyerere, president of Tanzania, was head of this committee. 42 Among those working on this committee was Yasser Arafat.
You have said that the army commanders knew the war was going to start. However, according to General Abousi, the air force was not aware the war was going to start until the day before the air strikes. Hamdani: I do not know what General Abousi said, but the air force and the navy commanders attended that meeting. It is possible their commanders did not notify their units or divisions the way the army did. All senior commanders were notified of the decision on 7 July and were told to submit a report evaluating the readiness of their units within 72 hours. If the tank battalion and all the other battalions were notified of the order, then all air force units must have been notified also. Nevertheless, Abousi is a better source regarding the air force than Iran.
Section 3: Personal Interactions with Saddam  Senior Leadership My first meeting with Saddam during the war was in January 1981, but our first personal meeting was in 1971. There was an incident with a downed aircraft and a failed coup in Sudan. The aircraft carried an Iraqi Ba'athist group that had gone to the Sudan to support a coup, but the coup failed and the group had to return to Iraq. 
44
On 23 July 1971, Saddam came to pay his condolences. I look very similar to my uncle.
I was very far away, when Saddam first saw me. He asked me if I were Farouk's brother.
I told him, ‗No, he was my uncle.' Saddam then asked, -What do you do?‖ I told him that I was an officer in the army and on vacation. The next day Saddam sent one of his secretaries with an invitation to his palace.
I went to his palace on 27 July 1971. Saddam praised my uncle. He said my uncle was a major asset within the intelligence community. Saddam suggested I should move from the regular army to the intelligence career field. I apologized, telling him that I was a soldier and was not fit to be in intelligence. He was disappointed and annoyed. As I was leaving, the secretary collapsed in a chair and asked, ‗What have you done?!' I did not see that there was a problem, because I did not know Saddam yet.
Saddam visited me in the field in January 1981. I explained the front line situation to him, and he was pleased because I had a thorough knowledge of our forces and those of the enemy. I had a reconnaissance symbol on my beret so Saddam asked about the insignia. I told him that this was the reconnaissance symbol and only the best components of the armored corps go into reconnaissance. The minister of defense, Adnan Khairallah told Saddam Hussein that I had been an instructor in the armored corps and now was here on the front. 
45
46
Saddam told my commander that he (Saddam) did not think much of me and that he liked the Kurdish commander better. Ten days later, the battle flared, the Iranians over ran and occupied the sector to my right. I was forced to fight on my right flank. If it were not for the positions we had prepared to our rear, we would have been crushed as well.
Saddam never again asked who would retreat or who would stand and lose.
My troops performed well, and Saddam said he wanted the best people who fought to join the Republican Guard. On 4 November 1982, I met with Saddam as a member of the Republican Guard and hoped that he would not remember the previous meeting. After that, I met him frequently.
Murray: How did Saddam deal with meetings? How did officers deal with him? Was there a sense of fear or intimidation in the meetings?
Hamdani: As a matter of fact, Saddam possessed a powerful and exceptional personality. to political changes, so the sanctions will be removed. What do you think of this?' I replied, ‗That is not logical either.'
Murray: It strikes me that this situation is similar to the American television show, The Sopranos, which is about the Mafia in New Jersey.
Hamdani: There is a similarity between the Godfather and gang members and the situation in Iraq under Saddam. Saddam actually killed his best friends while he was crying for them.
Before Hussein Kamel fled to Jordan, Saddam spent 90 percent of his time in Baghdad.
Afterwards, he would spend 80 percent of his time traveling between three places in northern Iraq: the Fao Palace, Tikrit, and Tal Afar Lake. In early 1996, I became the chief of staff of the Republican Guard corps in Tikrit. My headquarters was between the Fao Palace and the palace on top of the mountain. 
50
51
Saddam often requested that division commanders come to meet him. When I received these orders, I always thought something important was about to happen. The first time he sent for the commanders, when I was a corps commander, it was 1600 and we had to travel 100 kilometers. I thought he would ask for updates so I gathered the division commanders, while the intelligence officers brought their maps. I told the commanders, ‗If he asks you this, you answer that.' I was prepared to execute a military mission. We gathered in a hall. Usually as we entered one of Saddam's palaces, we would salute and state our name and rank. I was astounded to find a friendly atmosphere with a number of men and women. It was a poetry reading; Saddam and others were reciting poetry. I thought, ‗After this meeting, he will tell me about the mission.' Five hours later, dinner was served and everyone ate except for me and the other commanders because we were waiting for our orders. It was the same casual atmosphere when Saddam's guests returned from dinner to recite more poetry. Everything ended at 2300, at which point everyone left along with Saddam. I was still waiting, so I asked the escort, ‗Why did Mr. Hamdani: They lightly fired on the VI Corp. It was evident that they just wanted to keep the troops deployed in that sector.
When our forces were finally deployed against the Iranians on the Fao Peninsula, the Republican Guard special forces entered the battle on the strategic road along the pipeline. As they approached the battle front they could monitor the battle on the radio and took note of its ferocity. The first brigades of the armor crossed the coastal road, while the special forces were fighting on the strategic road. The 10th Armored Brigade and the 2nd Armored Brigade were part of the Republican Guard. There was no bridge, so they were forced to use small floats to transport their tanks and personnel. As a result, the I Republican Guard Corps was late. On the night of the 13-14 February, the entire 26th Division collapsed. It was by sheer luck that the commander of the 26th Division was able to escape. He was renowned for his competence, but the situation was hopeless, and the Iranians had achieved a great victory. We learned on 14 February that more than one Iranian corps crossed onto the peninsula.
Were the Iranian troops engaged in the battle at Fao predominantly light infantry troops?
53
Hamdani: The area was only suitable for infantry, so Iranian troops comprised an infantry division and a border corps. There were four brigades in the Republican Guard counterattack: three traditional (3rd Brigade, 2nd Armored Brigade and 10th Armored Brigade), and one border corps, as well as one armored reconnaissance battalion.
Were the Iranian infantry well-supported by artillery and helicopters?
Hamdani: Yes, they were well-supported by artillery, helicopters, and their air force. They fired artillery from both sides of the Shatt al-Arab, which proved deadly.
Were the 3rd Brigade and the 2nd and 10th Armored Brigades out of a particular Republican Guard Division?
Hamdani: They were from the Republican Guard division led by Brigadier General Hussein al-Rashid. 
54
They were heavily concentrated along the strategic road. The 6th and 2nd Divisions of the regular army tried to enter here, but met great resistance from the Iranians. Hamdani: The 6th and the 2nd were having a hard time because the tanks that moved along Shatt al-Arab were subject to firing from the front and from the other side of the Shatt al-Arab. These were heavily wooded areas with palm trees and so forth. The fighting was from one palm tree to another. The weather was not conducive to a counterattack. There was heavy rain, which made movement and supply difficult. The strategic access road was only 20 meters wide in this area. Along it one would find tanks, ambulances, and vehicles carrying rations, all concentrated in an area that was only 20 meters wide.
Losses were double the normal for every artillery shell that hit road. The infantry were in mud up to their knees. The ambulances could hardly move. It took three hours to travel just 1 kilometer. It was really depressing to watch what was happening. When we headed away from there, we felt that we had left hell and were headed towards heaven. It was 
54
55
a tough battle. The most difficult part was knowing that the Iranians were going to attack, and not being able to do anything about it.
At the time, Lieutenant General Sa'ad Jabbouri was deputy chief of staff of the army. He was an excellent officer; he became the minister of defense in 1991. When he sent our forces in the wrong direction, he said this movement rested on the best of intelligence.
Later we realized that this was not the main Iranian attack. It was confirmed on 17 February that the enemy's main effort was against the VII Corps. We reacted late and the Iranians were able to hold on to Fao. 
This seems like such a tribal act for such a high ranking officer in the Iraqi military.
Hamdani: This was indeed tribal in nature. When Rashid promised to liberate Fao, Saddam offered his own son to Rashid's daughter in thanks for the promise.
In December 1986, Iran launched a deception attack on the border between two corps.
The attack lasted only for a day and both corps held without serious difficulties. Tala al-Duri and Ma'ahir immediately began exaggerating the losses the Iranians had supposedly suffered. Every few hours they would confirm more dead in order to impress Saddam.
We had information confirming that the Iranians were going to attack Basra, but considering these false losses, it was reasonable to assume the Iranians would delay the attack on Basra for at least six months. Saddam titled the battle the ‗Battle of the Great Day,' because of the large volume of alleged enemy losses. The troops were numb and relieved that the fighting was delayed for six months. Vacations were given while troops were withdrawn to the rear to reorganize and receive more training. There was a state of relaxation for everyone, commanders and soldiers alike.
The corps commanders may have been lying to Baghdad, but surely the front line troops and the forward brigade commanders knew they had not killed 7,000 Iranians.
Someone must have known this was not true.
Hamdani: When you are really stressed and fear dying, it is easy to fool yourself.
Nathan: Were they more scared of Saddam's reaction than of the opposing troops?
Hamdani: Yes, in this way, they made Saddam happy. the enemy near Fish Lake. However, the Iranians were able to reach and occupy Tahir. 
57
Murray: Did the III Corps maintain control of the fighting throughout or did the Republican
Guard take control at any point?
The III Corps was there, but the orders for the Republican Guard were sent by Saddam himself. The coordination was between Republican Guard and III Corps. This battle was called the ‗Great Harvest' because there was such a harvest of dead for both sides.
The III Corps was running the defense. The Republican Guards arrived on 19 January to launch counterattacks. In terms of command and control, in this 30-kilometer-wide sector, you had III Corps units in the defense, Republican Guards units came in on the 19th as a counterattack force, but at any given time, was there a single operational commander? in Egypt [the Suez Crisis], once posited two requirements for achieving military success: ‗First, achieve the superiority you really possess at the time and place of your choosing.
Second, give yourself the freedom to act.' 
59
Murray: Did Saddam have any desire to learn from the Israelis?
Hamdani: Saddam did not like to hear that we learned from anyone whether they were Americans, Israelis, etc. For example, I always say that Iraqi soldiers learn 90 percent from their tribe. The American soldier is educated and civilized; he is better at looking for alternative solutions in a conflict than the Iraqi soldier. force. The 2nd Brigade of the Republican Guard was formed at the beginning of 1982.
Since it was an armored brigade they chose the best officers from all of the other divisions. I worked on this expansion along with other colleagues. There was a division of labor between the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the Republican Guard: the 1st Brigade, comprised of Saddam's relatives, was responsible for protecting the palace and vital zones; Murray: Which of these divisions existed at the time of the great Iraqi offensives in 1988?
Hamdani: All of them: Medina Munawara, Hammurabi, Baghdad, Adnan, Nebuchadnezzar, and the 16th Brigade Special Forces.
We have read that Saddam directed a military draft of university students. Where were these soldiers incorporated?
The university students joined the Republican Guard. They were mainly scientists.
The Republican Guard was an independent army and needed skilled troops to maintain the quality levels of the pre-war army. It had helicopters, artillery, missiles, air defense, chemical protection, administrative, and maintenance repair units; it lacked only air and navy forces. In the first drill, the soldier fires on a fixed target from a stationary tank. In the second drill, he fires and then moves the tank. The drills became increasingly complicated. In the final drill, the soldier fires at moving targets from a moving tank. This was extremely difficult because our tanks did not have advanced technology. The gunner had to calcu-late the firing solution, while he was buttoned-up in the tank. After each battle, I ran a test to analyze performance. I looked for mistakes.
Getting people within a squadron or company to work together in harmony was a constant problem. Companies are the most important unit within an armored division, because they are the smallest combat unit. If the company is competent tactically, then the rest is command and control. I was a battalion-, then regimental-, and then a division commander. I
was always the first one tested to encourage the rest of my unit. I would always salute someone who was competent. In this way, I forced myself to be competent.
While Hamdani: Before the war, I was the staff intelligence officer with the 35th Armored Brigade.
There was a rumor that security had arrested an officer and that he would be turned over to us because officers had to be arrested or detained by a military unit. It was confirmed that he belonged to the Dawa Party. 
60
The death, capture, or injury of a son to the enemy created major social problems for a family. Until 1982, we had no problem with morale within the army. However after-wards, the popular army was increasingly made up of average citizens who quit their jobs to fight on the front. The economy and the economic capacity of the Iraqi people were severely damaged due to losses in terms of casualties and death. Affected families blamed Saddam and his politics. By 1987, 40,000 Iraqis had been taken prisoner, 250,000 martyred, and 750,000 injured or handicapped, with a significant number missing who we could not verify as martyrs or prisoners. As a result, one million families had no one to support them or their provider could not work. Overall, the war weakened the Iraqi economy greatly. If we estimate that two million Iraqis suffered from the war directly and multiply that number by the size of the average Iraqi household (five), then ten million Iraqis suffered from the effects of the war. The Iraqi population was 18 million in 1980. Approximately two thirds of all Iraqis suffered because of the war. Iran's population is four times larger than Iraq's. Assuming they suffered similar numbers of captured, dead, and injured, their problem was one quarter the size of our problem.
Murray: However, the Iranians suffered much heavier casualties than the Iraqis.
Hamdani: True. However, when someone is hurt, they look for someone to blame. In general, the level of education of the Iraqi people is simple. Shi'a religious education instills in its members great loyalty to religious scholars, whereas Sunnis have no connection with scholars. Shi'a have religious institutions similar to Catholics. Khomeini is like the Catholic Pope to the Shi'a in Iran, similar to Ali al-Sistani's position in Iraq. 
61
You have seen what has happened over the last six years as a result.
From what you say, it appears that Saddam destroyed the sense of community and nationalism within Iraq during his 30-year reign.
Hamdani: At the beginning, Saddam had the chance to be the greatest of all Iraq's leader.
Iraq was a modern state with modern systems. We had approximately half-a-million scientists and engineers who had studied across the globe. This was a high percentage for a third-world country. Iraq had a strong economy, an air force, and a navy. It possessed organized political parties with logical and reasonable ideologies. Saddam's great ambition and his violent personality destroyed all that was good in Iraq. It was not clear at the beginning; the mistakes accumulated over time. Saddam and the Ba'ath Party had what the psychologist Adler called an inferiority complex. Saddam had this complex toward the great powers. For example, when he first assumed power, he greeted the ambassadors of great states, such as France, the Soviet Union, and Britain, personally.
When the ambassadors presented their papers, Saddam would tell them, ‗You are a great power. You view us as a small power, but with our will we are bigger than you.' As an observer, I was embarrassed by what he said, and I was even sadder that my president had such psychological issues. The attack was executed quickly and successfully. We estimated one week for each page of the campaign strategy, but it was all executed in one day. There were few enemy; reserve Iranian forces were also weak. The Pipes Bridge (a North Korean design), across the Shatt al-Arab was the only connection between the Iraqi and Iranian sides; the rest was isolated Iraqi lands. 
62
Murray: How many divisions did the Iranians have? Murray: What if Khomeini had said, ‗We are not quitting. We are going to continue to fight'?
62 According to Hamdani, engineers laid large steel culvert pipes in the bed of the canal or river. The pipes were stacked until they were just below the surface of the water and practically invisible from overhead detection. The whole structure was sturdy enough to support vehicle traffic. 
63
64
Hamdani: That area is mountainous, and the Iranians had superior infantry compared to ours.
Armor is significantly less effective in mountainous regions. This northern attack became a deception plan incorporated into the attack to recover Fao. We opened a fake headquarters and established a wireless communications station. The media took pictures of the Republican Guard units in the north and the minister of defense visiting them. The Iranians really thought that we were going to attack in the north. There are others who said this was a political, regional, and international issue, and Iraq was making political concessions to Iran to end the war. One of Saddam's characteristics was determination.
In this instance, determination about not accepting defeat was good.
In a war this large, foreign liaison officers like to visit the battlefield. For instance, after some of the early battles between the Iranian Chieftain tanks and the Iraqi T-62 tanks, the British were eager to see how their tanks worked. This was all in the context of the Cold War, NATO, and US-Soviet relations. Were there other examples of countries sending liaison officers to Iraq to observe and learn from the Iraqi experience?
Hamdani: We had many delegations after the war, the largest one was American. I do not have any information about delegations that visited during the war. The press reported 
64
comparisons between Russian and British weapons. British weapons were not very good.
The 90th Iranian Armored Division had Chieftain tanks; they had a lot of problems and did not fight effectively. The 16th Iranian Armored Division, which was equipped with Chieftain tanks, lost a battle against the 10th Iraqi Armored Brigade with T-72 tanks. It is hard for an armored brigade to destroy a division in 12 hours but it happened; it was a disaster for the Iranians. Kuwait was another disaster. It is hard to compare the Kuwaitis with us, but the result was that the British weapons quickly lost the war. There was a problem with British manufacturing. An order was issued that every tank had to carry two types of ammunition: the first was effective against heavy armor and the second was used against infantry and light armor. We were ordered not to inflict heavy casualties when we entered Kuwait, so we armed our tanks with the less effective ammunition, so the Kuwaiti tanks would be knocked out when we fired on their tanks, but their soldiers would survive. When we fired upon them using this less effective ammunition, I realized that even this ammunition destroyed the Kuwaiti Chieftains.  The GMID-Da'irat al-Mukhabarat al-Amah in Arabic-comprised three bureaus: the political bureau, the special bureau, and the administrative bureau. Within the political bureau was the secret service, which had numerous offices specializing in the collection of intelligence concerning a particular country or region. Sean Boyne, "Southwest Asia, inside Iraq's Security Network -Part Two," Jane's Intelligence Review 9, no. 8  (1997). I have never stopped collecting information about Iran; that country has always been on my mind. I have followed up on everything having to do with Iran, big or small. After the formation of the new intelligence organization after the American occupation, its commander asked me for data on Iran because he had nothing. 
4
Murray: When did you, as an Iran expert, recognize that the new Khomeini regime was a change from the shah's regime? It appears that Saddam did not consider Iran a threat in 1979.
Tarfa: Initially Saddam was happy when the shah was ousted, because the shah was brought to power by the Americans and had tried to police the Gulf region. We thought Khomei-3 Samarra'i rose to become the head of military intelligence in 1991. After his defection in 1994, he was associated with various foreign intelligence services and Iraq expat groups throughout the remainder of the 1990s. After the fall of the regime, Samarra'i became the security advisor to Iraqi President Jalal Talabani.
ni would cooperate with us, since Iraq was an Islamic country and he had lived in Iraq for so many years. 
5
We started submitting reports to the high command that Iran had hostile intentions against Iraq. Everything that we expected and anticipated happened.
During the late shah's period and into the early revolutionary period, did Iraq have good intelligence sources in Iran?
Tarfa: No, we did not have good human sources in Iran because we respected and honored our agreement with the shah, but there were some Iranian Kurds in our territory who did volunteer information. Even during the revolution, working with dissident groups was difficult because they considered themselves to be nationalists and thus, were unwilling to cooperate.
Tarfa: At the beginning of the war, there were only three officers in the Iran section: I, still only a first lieutenant, Major al-Samarra'i, and Major Qasim Abd-al-Mun'im. Our maps of Iran were not up to date, and we could not decipher coded messages. After Khomeini came to power, we received only sparse information because he created a protective shell around Iran. We gathered information from the fleeing Iranian officers, but they passed information we already knew. A colonel in the Iranian police also provided us with information, but it was of little use. The Iranian Army was being dismantled, and most of its weapons had been stolen. In this chaos we thought Iran was incapable of attacking us.
Murray: What impact did the lack of good sources have on the decision to go to war in September 1980? Tarfa: We did not want to go to war because we thought the Iranian Army was being reorganized and a coup d'état against the militants was imminent. Unfortunately, the religious 5
The shah expelled Khomeini from Iran in 1964 and exiled him to Turkey (1964-65) and Iraq (1965-78). Khomeini moved from Iraq to Paris for his final months of exile after then-vice president Saddam Hussein, under pressure from the shah and in accordance with the 1975 Shatt al-Arab treaty, asked Khomeini to leave Iraq.
scholars and ayatollahs were able to gain full control Iran. They formed militias and executed people on the street. There was a state of panic and fear inside the ranks of the Iranian armed forces; they had no other choice but to align themselves with the regime.
Higher ranking officers either fled or were killed. Those joining the regime were originally enlisted soldiers while others were civilians. Iran was plagued with ignorance then, as it is today. I was in Tehran after 1999 and saw how people acted. I expected them to revolt against Khomeini's regime and turn to the secular leaders. You can mark my words: the Islamic regime in Iran will be gone within the next few years. The reaction against the behavior of the ayatollahs has made the common people hate even Islam. The Islamic religion is not like this. At present, Islam is held hostage by extremist Sunni and the Shi'a groups, which has turned the public against the religion.
Woods: Could you speak specifically about changes in the Iraqi intelligence profession in the early years of the war? Could you describe the organizations that were built to deal with signals intelligence, image intelligence, etc.?
Tarfa: When the war started, we realized we needed to update our maps. At first, we relied on other countries. We requested maps from the military attachés in the Gulf region. We also started taking daily aerial photographs. We focused on signals interception to a greater extent during the initial period of fighting. The Iranians were sending messages in the clear. Unfortunately, one of Saddam's press attachés revealed we were listening to uncoded wireless messages, which created a problem for us.
Officers who were mathematically inclined and had already attended training on deciphering began preliminary operations with the help of myself and Farsi-speaking civilians. This organization was called the special intelligence group; it specialized in deciphering Iranian codes. I was divided between this group and al-Samarra'i's Iran section. In the early months of the war, we analyzed codes manually. We got a maximum of two to three hours of sleep per night. We could not leave even to see our families. It was like that for the first two to three years of the war. By the end of the war, the situation had gotten better, and we received four to five hours of sleep per night.
Tarfa: There were only three Farsi speakers in the entire Iraqi Army and within the intelligence apparatus. We had to interrogate prisoners, decipher codes, and listen to Iranian TV and radio.
Murray: Did the Iranians try to mix double agents in with people fleeing from Arabistan? Tarfa: Yes, but we knew they were double agents. We ourselves tried to run similar deception operations. We would give the right answers to some Iranian inquiries and then feed them misinformation.
Murray: General al-Samarra'i's organization had three people in 1980. How did the operation expand over time?
Tarfa: In 1981, there were six officers in the Iran section, which had five departments: ground forces; air forces; naval forces; a political, economic, and social department; and a topography and vital targets section. In 1986, the Iran section turned into a directorate with four sections, two platoons, one regiment of special forces (Unit 888), and one regiment for deep reconnaissance (Unit 999), which sent troops deep behind enemy lines.
All attended Farsi language training and different tactical schools such as sabotage, parachuting, and underwater training. The Iran branch expanded from three officers in 1980 to 80 officers in 1986.
Can you speak about some of the different strategic civilian and military intelligence services responsible for national level intelligence at the time? Tarfa: Iraq had the intelligence service, which was in charge of gathering information on foreigners located inside and outside of Iraq. It had nothing to do with the military intelligence directorate. The intelligence service also had sections that dealt with Iran, Israel, America, Arab countries, Asian countries, etc.
We always hear about the relationship between bureaucracies. What were relations like between the different intelligence agencies? Tarfa: Military intelligence definitely competed with the intelligence service because 95 percent of the intelligence personnel were civilians. The intelligence service lacked the databases to analyze information and form conclusions, especially regarding military information. Saddam never relied on the information coming from the intelligence service.
He would turn it over to us for analysis, which created sensitivities between us and the intelligence service. I worked in all three security systems: the intelligence service, military intelligence, and the special security apparatus. Our professionalism in military in-5A/B Freedom Fighter and the F-5E/F Tiger II are members of a family of light supersonic fighter aircraft introduced in the 1960s. The Boeing CH-47 Chinook is a twin-engine, tandem rotor, heavy-lift helicopter designed for troop movement, artillery emplacement, and battlefield resupply. It was first introduced in the early 1960s and is still in production today. telligence was high. We considered ourselves a school of analytic science, not just with regards to Iraq, but also with intelligence issues at the regional level. Our capacity did not compare with that of the Americans; however, in terms of analysis and conclusions, we were much superior to the Iranians.
Were the civilian intelligence agencies as small as the military intelligence agency in 1980?
Tarfa: No, they were much bigger than us, but they did little that was useful.
Murray: Saddam once said he only wanted information from the military, and he would do the analysis.
Tarfa: I have never heard this. If this recording exists, he probably meant that he wanted military intelligence to do the analysis.
Murray: How long did it take General Samarra'i's intelligence group to earn Saddam's trust?
Tarfa: Saddam relied on our analysis from the war's beginning, but he was disappointed with us when Fao fell. However, it was not that we failed in our job. The problem resided with the director of military intelligence, General Mahmoudi Shahin, whom Saddam appointed to head the group. He was not an intelligence officer, but rather was an armor officer, who had commanded a tank division.
Woods: General Hamdani described a great transition in Iraq's military forces after Saddam became president in July 1979. He started appointing Ba'ath political officers to important government positions. How did this affect intelligence?
Tarfa: We did not have that problem in military intelligence. Throughout my military career, from first lieutenant to general, I was always a low ranking Ba'athist, but that did not matter. This was also true for General al-Samarra'i; he was never more than a low ranking Ba'athist. In military intelligence, we relied on highly professional officers; that is why we were successful. He told me that he was assessing the barrier system of the Iraqi forces. This was an indication the Iranians intended to attack the area. Air reconnaissance by MiG-25s also showed engineering efforts on the Iranian side of Shatt al-Arab across from Fao.

Woods: Did General Shahin agree with your reports?
Tarfa: No, he did not. By the way, it was not my report. It was a report by all of us. I was just one of the authors.

The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-25 was a Soviet-designed high-supersonic interceptor and reconnaissancebomber aircraft introduced in the early 1970s.
Murray: Did you get the sense that that the leaders of the intelligence agencies were trying to keep their bosses happy by telling them what they wanted to hear?
Tarfa: Exactly. The same was true with regard to keeping Saddam happy. The officers would say everything is great; they would present hell as heaven to him. Saddam would be happy and laugh.
The degree to which foreign intelligence was used in 1986 was significant. Information was provided by the United States, France, and the Soviet Union. Was it used as part of this calculation?
Tarfa: Yes, American intelligence provided us with information before Fao. The Iraqi intelligence service brought a [US government representative], who provided satellite pictures, to meet us. General al-Samarra'i and I met with him twice. There was cooperation, but there was no direct coordination. We used to sit with him only to exchange information.
As a matter of fact, when we looked at the pictures the [US government representative] gave us, it was only raw intelligence, while our information was much more detailed.
French, Yugoslav, and Soviet intelligence agencies also cooperated with us. The KGB helped us decipher the Iranian codes. In return, we agreed to provide them with equipment related to the Iranian American-made F-4 aircraft. The American information supported our conclusions regarding Fao, but failed to convince the higher ups. Our information was complete to start with; any information we received from the [US government] was complementary. The problem was with the intelligence director.
After the battle at Fao, did Saddam remove those who were responsible for the intel- Murray: Did Saddam prefer to receive intelligence directly from the analysts rather than through bureaucratic channels?
Tarfa: No, not from analysts directly. He used to get the final analysis from the intelligence group. Our section received considerable raw material on Iran from deciphered codes. I submitted daily reports to the director of the president's office of information coordination, Dr. Ekram Othmam, who then submitted the reports to the president. The reports contained the same information I sent to General al-Samarra'i, the director of the Iran section. The President would follow up on how the intelligence had been exploited.
General al-Samarra'i used to blame me because he knew that I was the one sending this information to the president.
One day early in 1987 after the battle at Fao, an Iranian train was on its way from Tehran to Andimashq city in Yazfur carrying a division of Pasdaran, approximately 5,000 soldiers. I suggested to the president that we strike the train with the air force, since we knew the train carried a division intending to attack us and we had the train's timetable. The president asked the intelligence service to carry out this plan. General al-Samarra'i, in charge of Iran section, refused to implement the plan because it might disclose our source.
The Iranians would know we could decipher their codes. General al-Samarra'i blamed me and spoke out against me because I had turned the president against him. I suggested that the air force strike the train station among other targets. This way we could prevent the Iranians from realizing we had broken their codes. The air force failed to carry out this plan, because the intelligence service failed to provide the exact time the train would leave the station. I believe the intelligence service did this intentionally to protect its source.
Woods: Did Saddam often search for good intelligence analysts within the intelligence apparatus to provide him his own private information, while allowing the system to produce its reports?
Tarfa: After this instance, he did not do it as often. However, I remained in contact with the president's office regarding the breaking of the Iranian codes. For a while I was no longer under the control of the intelligence service. I acted independently in terms of breaking the code.
After the loss of Fao, besides the leadership changes in the GMID, were there any other major changes? How did Iraqi intelligence perform during the 1987 Iranian offensives against Basra?
Tarfa: There were changes in the commands of the corps and divisions. During the counterattack, they relied on Republican Guard's command. There was a complete collapse of the command and control system in the Iranian military intelligence apparatus from Khomeini all the way down during the liberation of Fao. As a result, our troops crossed the border without encountering any Iranian resistance. Our job as intelligence officers during that phase of the operation was to continuously feed the frontline troops with information. The way intelligence officers look at matters is different from operational soldiers. That is why the president trusted us with setting up deception plans, as well as executing them.
Woods: Did the GMID change in any particular way when the Republican Guard expanded from a division to a corps? How did that affect intelligence?
Tarfa: The GMID expanded to approximately three directorates and eight sections. In 1986, we expanded from being a section to being a directorate. The Iran section became the 5th sub-directorate and was run by General al-Samarra'i. It focused on Iran and was in charge of the secret service, strategic information, tactical information, special operations, and deep reconnaissance. We had agents in every embassy including Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey, Moscow before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the Gulf countries. We had sources and wiretap information reaching from the Gulf region and worked on improving our relations with Western intelligence organizations, such as those of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, the former Yugoslavia, Argentina, and Brazil.
This was all part of our effort to end the war in 1988. The expansion began in 1986, following the Iranian seizure of Fao. Woods: I read that members from Unit 999 were actually in Tehran trying to assess the effectiveness of Iraqi missile attacks. Was that true?
Tarfa: This is not true. We were effective at gaining information. We had no need to send our officers to Tehran and risk their lives. We already had 10,000 mujahidin in Tehran.
These Iranian opponents of the regime called their families and those helping them from Europe and the Gulf. Iranians were free to move to Europe and the Gulf region. For example, in September 1986, I went with General Wafiq al-Samarra'i to Ankara to recruit a senior Iranian air force commander. He was on vacation in Turkey with his family. We coordinated with him through the Iraqi military attaché in Ankara. We provided him with money, took pictures, did some recordings, and told him our future information needs on the Iranian Air Force. This is just one example of the fact that we had a little difficulty obtaining information. Thus, we had no need to risk sending highly trained officers to Tehran.
Woods: Was Iraq intelligence successful at working with other non-Persian groups in Iran, such as Baluchis?
Tarfa: Our military attachés in Afghanistan and Pakistan gathered information by contacting the Baluch, the drug dealers, the mafia, etc. Iranian Kurds, Persian Iranians, and Arabs from Ahvaz cooperated with us after 1985.
Woods: How effective or successful were Iranian intelligence operations against Iraq?
Tarfa: Iran used Hakim and the Dawa Party to carry out small terrorist operations in Baghdad by using bombs; they were not very effective. 9 They would occasionally coordinate with Iraqi deserters. The same thing happened to us; they would come to us. It was mutual.
There was never a deep penetration. Tarfa: Yes, they were good at interrogating prisoners. They pressured them with torture and then released them. They made them marry Iranian women and fight with the Badr Corps.
In terms of gathering information on our troops, the Iranians were not successful because they did not have air reconnaissance.
They were unable to break our codes, because we did not buy our coding machines; we manufactured them ourselves. We used telephone or wireless to pass along orders. The Iranians were unable to break our codes, so they did not know about our activities, such as our deception operations.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard represented a major problem for us because they also did not use communications equipment. They used couriers instead. Thus, we had difficulty gathering information on them. However, we were eventually able to discover their activities and operations. We had full command of the Iranian armed forces, general command, and naval forces codes.
States in 1991.

Can you give me some examples of deception operations? Can you describe for us a particular one? What were the principles you used?
The most important deception operation occurred during the liberation of Fao. We needed to send Iraqi forces closer to Fao, but did not want to alert the Iranians of our intention to attack their position on Fao. Before we sent Iraqi troops south, we made it appear as though we thought Iran intended to attack Basra from Fao. Therefore our troops appeared to be heading to the defense of Basra. So the Iranian's started running a deception of their own, pretending to send troops to reinforce our ‗belief' there really was going to be an attack on Basra. In the mean time, we sent Unit 999 behind Iranian front Iran. I would send him reports on Iran every two or three days. I even sent reports on Iran to General Ra'ad Hamdani.
Al-Samarra'i was from Samarra, which is a city approximately 10 kilometers southeast of Tikrit. There is an historical animosity between the people of Samarra and Tikrit.
There has always been a psychological barrier between them, because the people of Samarra believe they should rule Iraq. Al-Samarra'i thought he was smarter than the high command itself. This was commonly known because his telephone calls were monitored and widely reported. Saddam had him watched closely because he spoke with arrogance, as if he were a big deal, but had never received the chances he deserved. Wafiq al-Samarra'i remained the intelligence director for approximately two months. Suddenly in 1992, Saddam issued an order to pension him off. In 1994, he fled to the northern region and joined the opposition party because he felt he was about to be arrested. He returned after the American occupation to advise Jalal Talabani. Eventually, he resigned and fled to London because he thought the Iranians were attempting to assassinate him.
What was his relationship with Hussein Kamel? Was there competition?
Tarfa: No, there was no competition, because Hussein Kamel did not work in intelligence; he focused on military industrial relations. Not to mention the fact that no one would have dared compete with Hussein Kamel because of his position and relationship with Saddam.
Murray: General Hamdani felt that Hussein Kamel was the worst influence on Saddam. Do you agree?
Tarfa: This is true because Hussein Kamel was illiterate. He only finished primary school. He never finished middle school. Kamel resented army officers, who had graduated from the military academies, because he felt he did not belong. We felt the same towards him;
we did not like him because he did not deserve the rank Saddam had given him. He had his position because he was the president's cousin and son-in-law. We avoided him.
Murray: General Hamdani suggested that Hussein Kamel held a psychological hold over the president. Is that reasonable?
Tarfa: Hussein Kamel pledged complete loyalty to Saddam and tried to leverage his relationship with Saddam. He wanted to be Saddam's safety valve, but in fact he was only a negative influence. I often wondered how Saddam, who thought in grand terms, could take the advice of someone who knew nothing about science or the humanities. Tarfa: We were the unknown element within the Iraqi military. We were equal to the entire Iraqi Army and the Republican Guard because of the work we did gathering SIGINT.
Without our help, our troops would have fought blind. Instead they were in a boxing match where the Iranians were blindfolded and our forces were not. We created the advantage with respect to the Iranians; they were blind, but we were not.
Woods: Could you help me understand the quality of the intelligence at the tactical level, at the regional level, and the strategic command level? How confident were you that you could listen in on their conversations?
Tarfa: We listened to the general command of the Iranian armed forces and the operations commands from north to south, including the headquarters of al-Hamzah operations in the north and the headquarters of operations in the west. We listened to the headquarters in the south at the corps level or higher. We also listened to the Iranian naval command, which consisted of three navy support units, the headquarters of operations in the east in Sistan and Lojistan provinces, and along the Afghan border.
Woods: So you were able to intercept their radio communication and decrypt their codes throughout the war?
Tarfa: We used the Crypto C54 machines for breaking the codes. 
11
Murray: When did you begin to break the Iranian codes?
Tarfa: We had three phases in code breaking. Between 1980 and 1982, we broke the message codes manually. By the end of 1981, we were using the Crypto C52 machine to analyze codes. 
12
Murray: Did al-Qadhi bring the machine to the Iraqis? Did he desert the Iranian 64th Division? How did he get the machine?
Tarfa: Al-Qadhi brought it in with the help of someone within the division in Sabadash, Iran.
When he brought it to us, we knew the mechanics of the machine. We used it to decode brigade-and division-level communications until the Iranians replaced it with an electronic code machine. First, we broke that machine's transmissions by hand, then mechanically, and finally electronically. We advanced our intelligence capabilities in parallel with the Iranians efforts to improve their codes. The Iranians consistently failed to protect their sensitive information. The Iranian commander, al-Milali, who was a big gossip, created transparency within the command. We also took advantage of the Iranian press, which sometimes published crucial information. We analyzed the sermons of the senior mullahs on Friday nights in Iran and tried to read between the lines. We would compare the information in the newspapers, or the sermons with the information we already had before drawing conclusions. The sources of information were complementary;
if there was information missing from one source, we could usually find it in another.
Machine," Baltimore Sun, 4 December 1995. The Hagelin C54, introduced in the mid-1950s, was a later version of the C52 cipher machine. 
12
Murray: How did you break the electronic cipher machines, the Crypto T450, when they started using them?
13
Tarfa: The same was true for us. Iran would use one key for several messages. We took advantage of this deadly mistake. It led us to conclude that they were not competent. We used a key for only one message.
Murray: Why didn't the Iraqis make the same kinds of mistakes? What did the Iraqis do differently from the Iranians?
Tarfa: The Iraqis were more disciplined than the Iranians. We protected the secrecy of our information better. One day General al-Samarra'i heard an officer say the word ‗code.' He asked the officer what information he was talking about. Al-Samarra'i told the officer that this time he would not be punished, but next time he would have his tongue cut off.
The letter ‗g' is the first letter of the word for ‗code' in Arabic; al-Samarra'i eliminated the letter from our vocabulary. One officer said, ‗What if someone's name starts with the letter -g,‖ like Gamil?' The general said, ‗Call him Kamel.' That is how seriously he was about information security.
Woods: How well did Saddam understand all that military intelligence had done, while you were doing it?
Tarfa: If the Iranians had known we were breaking their codes, they would have changed their systems. Therefore, Saddam did not honor us with medals during the war in the way he honored others. He waited until after the war so people would not wonder why we were being honored and given medals. [Saddam understood the value of what we had done.] That is why our project was called the Mohammed Project. If it were not for our work, the Iranians would have reached Baghdad. That is how important our work was.
Murray: This discussion helps to explain why Iran, with its many advantages, was rarely able to take advantage of its strengths.
The codes you were able to break were predominantly those of the Iranian conventional forces, but you said you had problems with their other forces.
Tarfa: That is because the codes were only used by the conventional forces. The other forces did not use codes. When the Pasdaran joined the regular forces in the field, the regular army provided their logistics to the front without any encrypted message traffic. Because of this we knew the new units must be either Pasdaran or Basij, which was a second, less well-equipped militia. Because they did not have defensive units at the front, troops were brought in two days before the attack. Air photography would show unusual movements, holes for new defense locations, or tents in the rear areas. We would tell our troops to look for red, green, or yellow flags. We knew that anyone wearing a green headband was a Revolutionary Guard. After the attack, we could verify the identity of the troops once we had prisoners. Tarfa: We sent official intelligence reports based on decodes regarding enemy intentions that did not include Fao. Therefore, the Iraqi high command did not think Iran would attack Fao. When we finally incorporated intelligence that suggested Fao was part of Iran's plan, General Mahmoudi Shahin rejected the finding. We tried to go around the intelligence directorate so that Saddam would read the report. We created an intelligence status report, separate from the official intelligence report. However, Saddam's command and army command failed to read the intelligence status report; they focused on the official intelligence report. We added the finding regarding Fao to the official intelligence report to avoid being blamed for missing it, but our superiors disregarded the intelligence. We received daily tactical intelligence reports from the 26th and 15th Divisions. They mentioned increasing numbers of boats and pontoons on the other side the Shatt al-Arab. I underlined these reports in red because I considered them important. When General Wafiq al-Samarra'i returned to head military intelligence, he asked, ‗You underlined this. Why didn't they work this lead accordingly?' With the Iranian prisoner (the frogman), we had confirmed Iranian intentions. The problem was that we did not receive sufficient information through code breaking, so no one believed our intelligence. The only SIGINT we received said that troops would relocate from the north of Khorramshahr at night.
If there had been five or six messages, would it have been easier to overturn the disbelief of your superiors? The great irony here is that the lack of professionalism within the Pasdaran made for a difficult intelligence problem.
We had an intelligence problem with the Revolutionary Guard.
Were you able to successfully tap land lines?
Tarfa: Yes, there was a project called al-Faruq. We sent a deep reconnaissance unit between the Iranian units, where there were some field telephones. Cables cannot be listened to in the air because they are not wireless, but we could monitor cables from a short distanceusing our magnetized equipment. We listened to calls between Iranian troops through wiretaps; we only gathered tactical information that way, but it was still useful.
Were you able to tap into the command-level communications?
Tarfa: As you know, Khomeini did not use telephones, but we monitored the communications between the Iranian ministry of foreign affairs and the Iranian embassies around the world, because they were using the same machine as the military. We would intercept the information from the Iranian embassies in Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and any instructions from the ministry of foreign affairs to the embassies. We sent this information to the intelligence service to be analyzed. For example, when the Taliban had control in Mazar-e-Sharif, [in 1998] we had this information. We even followed up on Iranian operations beyond Iran. We exposed Iranian sources in Iraq through the embassy. Iran continued to use the T450 at least until the Americans occupied Iraq in 2003.
Did Iran know that their T450 has been compromised?
Tarfa: Yes, because many of the Iraqi Shi'as who worked with us at the time are now working with the current Iranian government.
We now know every major power involved in World War II was reading some, if not all, of the major codes of both their enemies and their allies. The Swiss T450 machine was from that era. It is a bit shocking that Iran continued using this machine into 2003.
Tarfa: Iran periodically updated the T450 machine. Every time they updated it, we would have problems for a several weeks, but then we would crack the code again. It still needs human thinking and analysis, which is more important than raw information. For me, knowledge is more important than information. Today, information is everywhere and who intercept the information, the officers in charge of mathematics behind code breaking, the translators, and the analysts. It was a big job. We had lots of people working with us. When the Iranian enemy initially attacked, the intelligence officers in charge were happy because they had been proven correct. This happened three times, but each time it was at the expense of tens of thousands of dead and wounded Iraqis. I had many problems with Wafiq al-Samarra'i, who was my teacher and my friend. I believed we should try to abort enemy attacks in Iran before they crossed our borders and attacked us. We often specified the time of an attack. Had we used the air force and artillery against enemy concentrations, we could have aborted most of the Iranian attacks. This is my belief. I would have considered this a success from an intelligence standpoint. It is not success merely to predict a given attack and watch it unfold as predicted. Everyone was waiting for Saddam to say, ‗Good for you. You did a good job. You were truthful.' I was disappointed and frustrated by such an attitude. That is why I provided information directly to Saddam, so that he could take preventative measures immediately. It is a problem when someone is selfish and wants others to tell him he is competent and knowledgeable at the expense of Iraqi lives. I was not the only one who was frustrated-there were others who helped produce the intelligence who were also frustrated. We hoped our efforts to produce this intelligence would be used to strike the enemy.
Murray: By 1987, how many people were working in this intelligence effort: intercepting, deciphering, translating, analyzing?
Tarfa: There were more than 2,500 people. Project 858, called al-Hadi, was established by a Japanese company.
14
Woods: Who was supporting Iran during the Iran-Iraq War?
Tarfa: North Korea, China, Libya, El Salvador, and Syria.
Murray: How much aid was Assad giving to the Iranians?
Tarfa: Assad had a personal grudge with Saddam over a personal issue. He wanted to retaliate against Saddam, so he helped the Iranians. The rest of the world, including the United States and the Soviets, was helping Iraq, which proves that we were right.
Woods: Did the Soviets provide satellite imagery or other intelligence?
Tarfa: No. The Americans provided us with more imagery than the Soviets. The Soviets helped us by providing code-breaking experts in return for an Iranian F-4 aircraft that had crash-landed and was only slightly damaged. We needed their help to solve some technical problems.
What was your reaction to the news that the United States had sold missiles to Iran in order to get its hostages released?
Tarfa: We realize that the US Government placed its interests before its principles. The Iranian threat was great in the area. US interests required that it reinstate relations with the current Iranian regime at the expense of its allies. Tarfa: If the Iranian regime ended, all of the regional problems would be solved. The Taliban is supported by Iran. Al-Qaeda is currently in Iran. Many of Usama bin Laden's followers are in Iran.
Woods: Who are the true nationalist leaders in Iraq now?
Tarfa: The Iraqi Army that fought Iran, whether they are Shi'a, Sunni, Christian, Turkish, etc.
These are the ones capable of preserving nationalism, as well as American and Western interests in Iraq. The stronger and more liberal Iraq is, the more it will be favored by the region, America, and its allies. The weaker Iraq is the more Sunni and Shi'a extremists will expand.
I am a pilot, not by profession but by hobby, from the time I was small. My father did not want me to become a pilot. He said I would kill myself. I said I wanted to be a doctor, but he said no because he said I was a donkey. So I said I would go into the military. He said, ‗Well done, my son!' In the military, I was always the first in my class.
Murray: Thucydides said that war brings out the worst in people; civil wars are the worst of all kinds of war. General Hamdani described Saddam as a Bedouin with no vision of the future or understanding of the world. Can you speak to these points?
Makki: Saddam was a Bedouin until his death. He governed with a Bedouin mentality. He would willingly kill his brother or his son, if he thought that action would further his career or position. He was clever, but not polished. Saddam even suspected those who liked him. We in Iraq were unfortunate to have him and the revolutions that followed the overthrow of the monarchy. Maybe our history made us like this, or maybe God meant us to be like this, but we did not deserve this fate. The common Iraqi may deserve such a fate, but not educated Iraqis. We are intelligent people; we are doctors, engineers, etc., and we are now all over the world. My grandson is in the United States, living in Pittsburgh. He plans to return to Egypt to continue his education. My youngest son is a plastic surgeon and is emigrating to Canada. Saddam drove the educated people out of Iraq.
They deserved a better fate.
The Shi'a clergy are the worst. Their turbans block their thinking. I am a Sunni, but General Kabi is Shi'a. The Shi'a clergy are extremists. We say Islam is a middle path; it takes the easy, logical, human way. Terrorism is against our nature. We have tolerated other religions since the time of the Prophet Mohammed. For example, the Prophet married a Christian.
Woods: General, in our discussion today there are three general themes we are interested in:
First, we would like you to describe the high-level discussions and plans relating to the war with Iran. But more specifically, we would like to understand the dynamics of decision-making in the run-up to and the early part of the war.
Second, we would like to hear about your time as chief of staff of III Corps. Please help us understand the nature of the long war, and the transition from a short war to a long war.
Third, we are interested in your time as the director of combat development. We would like to better understand how an Arab military, under the immense pressures of war, adapted to difficult circumstances. As you know, there are few examples of Arab armies adapting to the extent, speed, or scale that Iraq's Army managed in the mid-1980s.
And of course we are interested in any other insights into the Iraq-Iraq War that you feel might be important.
Murray: So, let us begin with a discussion of the dynamics of decision-making in the early part of the war, including the run-up to the war and the decisions leading to war. At times, Saddam understood the value of professionals and experts. Can you describe some of his senior military advisors and their roles?
Makki: I am the eldest general you will interview; the other generals were lower-ranking than I, except for Lieutenant General Shanshal. General Shanshal had the worst effect on Iraq's Army. His mentality was that of a 1940s officer. He was a good staff officer and instructor, but a bad commander. He refused to accept any responsibility.
Later, when Lieutenant General Adnan Khairallah (who was my student in the staff college and the defense minister), would ask Shanshal for advice, Shanshal's replies made no sense. In his capacity as chief of staff, he refused all responsibility for any of his decisions. He formed committees to study problems and accepted their decisions. Saddam loved him because he never said no. Saddam kept him as chief of staff for a long timefrom 1969 to 1982. After that he became minister of state for military affairs for a period of time. He then became minister of defense after Adnan's death.
Here is a typical story about Shanshal during his time as chief of staff. He was an old man, and we looked up to him as a father. He was a good man, but when he was angry he could become nasty. At the battle east of Basra, the III Corps commander was General Salah al-Qadhi. As a younger officer he had helped make the revolution of 1968 possible. 2 Not surprisingly, he became a high ranking member of the Ba'athist Party. Although he was a young man, he was promoted rapidly to corps command in time for this battle. When things did not go well, he was executed. Saddam did not hesitate to cut off his head. This story is but one of the tragedies that happened to the army. How is it that a lieutenant could be promoted to general and commander of a division? First, they made him divisional commander and then III Corps commander; he was responsible for the 2
The revolution of 1968, incited by corruption within Abdul Salam Arif's regime, Kurdish disturbances in the north, Iraq's failure to support Arab countries during the 1967 Six-Day War, and Arif's subservience to Gamal Nasser, resulted in the overthrow of the government by the Iraqi Army. Al-Qadhi's role in the revolution was not clear. Makki noted that he was an officer in the tank regiment guarding the palace.
defense of Basra. He achieved his position because of his role in the 1968 Ba'ath Revolution and the fact that he was a good Ba'athist, not because of his ability.
I was then deputy president for Bakr Military University, but like all soldiers I wanted to participate in the war. We were all zealous; we admired Saddam and we wanted to go to the front. My superiors sent me as an attached staff officer.
When the Iranians launched major attacks in May/June 1982, the III Corps was unprepared, so a decision was made to withdraw. Before the decision to withdraw, the Iranians attacked the corps' southern sector. This left two divisions, the 5th Mechanized and 6th
Armored, defending the corps' northern sector, but not under any pressure. These two divisions remained in the north away from the fighting. The right decision at the time would have been to use these divisions to attack and outflank the enemy attacking our forces in the south, thus catching them in the rear. superior what to do and this was the response! Poor General al-Qadhi knew they wanted him to withdraw. He asked, ‗If I withdraw these divisions, where would I withdraw them to-the border line between Iraq and Iran, or behind it?' Shanshal again refused to make a decision: ‗You will withdraw them to the place that provides security for the forces.'
This was neither a command nor guidance. He refused to take responsibility for any decisions. That was Shanshal.
Woods: Why do you think he avoided responsibility?
Makki: Shanshal was a logistician; he was not a leader. He was a good officer and knew what to do. He just did not want to take responsibility. Unfortunately, people thought he was brilliant officer. He was a good man, but that does not mean he was a smart officer. He was the author of a ‗school of thought' within the Iraqi military that refused to take responsibility.
to his command and begin training. No one mentioned we were going to war with Iran right away. Later, General al-Khazraji told me he heard the war had begun on the radio.
Murray: At this point it seems there were two factors influencing military thought in the Iraqi Army. First, Saddam promoted junior officers to corps commander positions. Second, Iraq stopped sending officers to be trained in other countries in 1968 because the Ba'ath Party did not want officers exposed to different ideas and methods. Can you speak about these two propositions?
Makki: We must distinguish between Bakr's era and Saddam's era. Bakr was an experienced general. He was calmer than Saddam. During his era, we did not feel the pressure of politics and ideology as strongly as we did under Saddam. Admittedly, both placed party loyalists in key positions and purged the army, but Bakr did not do it to the extreme that Saddam did. Bakr did not make junior officers into corps commanders, because he knew what command required. Saddam was never an officer, so he did not understand the needs of the military. I should also say that this was al-Khazraji's opinion. Murray: But why would Iran provoke a conventional military response? To me, this is confusing.
Makki: Iraq felt threatened, as if someone had entered the room with a contagious deadly disease. This was not the first time Iran had threatened us. It had threatened Iraq during my childhood. My father commanded the 3rd Division against the shah's army. I had the same feeling [of existential threat] both times. Iran and Iraq have never had good relations. We fear Iran will one day overthrow us, so we take precautions. We believe they will not rest until they occupy Iraq.
There were clashes along the border because the villages were intermingled. Shepherds went back and forth across the border. It is a border area between two backward countries.
Both sides only understand the language of force. To further aggravate matters, the border is not well-delineated. The local Iranian commanders would sometimes conduct these artillery strikes on their own, if they felt they had the advantage and would be supported by Tehran. Perhaps they received instructions from the Iranian government. This provocation scared the Iraqi regime, then led by Saddam and his arrogant, self-confident supporters.
Murray: Now [in 2009] the Iranian regime seems threatened by the modernization of its own people.
Makki: That is how your democratic, educated mind sees things in Iran. It is through this door that one can destabilize Iran. But for Iraq, Iran was always an external threat. This is why we were uneasy. The Iranian regime believed they needed to crush anyone who threatened its rule.
There is an interesting parallel here. During World War II, Hitler did not have to tell people what to do. They had their own understanding of what he wanted and acted on it.
Do you think a similar thing was going on with these border commanders? Were they reacting to rhetoric from Tehran?
Makki: Local commanders would not do such things completely on their own. They need orders handed down through the chain of command.
Murray: The shah's army was fleeing and the chain of command was breaking down. The local commanders were not getting any direction except from the rhetoric. Is it possible they were acting in line with what they thought Khomeini wanted?
Makki: As early as 4 September, the Iranians showed signs of going to war. They closed the border and airspace; they indicated they were going to invade Iraq. The rhetoric got stronger. They were clearly looking for signs of war. Thus, we had to make a pre-emptive attack. According to international law, the bombardment of Iraqi villages by Iran, the closing of the border, and the blocking of Iraq's access to the sea by closing the Shatt al-Arab were acts of war. From a military point of view, the threat was real so we launched preemptive air strikes. The air strikes were a failure. On the second day, Iranian aircraft bombarded us. I do not know why the Iraqi Air Force did not practice. Many bad things happened in the army, but it was not always because of Saddam. Who was the air force commander? He was a good attack pilot, but he was also Saddam's political appointee. This is how the war started and why the war did not finish in a two-week blitzkrieg.
In 1981, you moved on from the university to chief of staff of III Corps.
Makki: Yes, as a professional officer I wanted to participate in the war, as everyone did. Morale was high. Everybody supported Saddam because we were supporting Iraq. We supported him as an idea, not as a person. In a crisis, people rally around their commander.
At the time, everyone supported Saddam and thought of him as a national hero. I was eager to go to the front and participate. Although I was an intellectual within the army, I did not want to remain at bureau staff position. I wanted to gain experience like General Dwight Eisenhower did in his time. He was on the army staff in early 1942 and wanted to participate directly in the fighting, but his superiors did not want him assigned to the field, because he had never led a company in combat. So how was he to lead armies? As a result, they doubted his ability to lead an army. I have always had this example in my mind, and so I wanted to go and participate in the war. Before becoming chief of staff, I was attached to the III Corps headquarters to gain experience. I was a distinguished ar-mor corps officer and had commanded the armor school. But they wanted me to go to the III Corps and gain experience.
Murray: What was your view of the defeats of 1981 and early 1982 in terms of the Iranian offensives launched against the Iraqi Army that drove its forces out of the territories Iraq had seized?
Makki: Our commanders were not versed in the use of armor in a war. The people who led the armor units were either infantry officers or old school British-style armor officers.
The British use armor in cooperation with the infantry. British tanks move slowly; top speed of the British Centurion was only 22 miles per hour.

Section 10: Battle of Allahu Akbar Hill  First Battle of Basra ( 
1982
4
Murray: Your corps commander was really saying that Saddam and the army chief of staff did not agree. You are looking up rather than down.
Makki: You are right, but if the army chief of staff had agreed with me, he could have convinced Saddam. One time when we were discussing desertions to the Iranian side because our morale was low, General al-Raimi, the III Corps commander, told General Shanshal that we should re-group our forces, relinquish indefensible positions, and raise morale. Shanshal replied, -I will not tell him. You tell him, you are the corps commander.‖ The chief of staff of the army did not want to tell the supreme commander that troop morale was low. How could a corps commander convince Saddam to regroup? One learned not to say anything about such matters.
4
The location of Allahu Akbar Hill is unclear.
5
This was at the beginning of the summer in 1981, before the Battle at Bostan.
What was the response to the destruction of the tank battalion defending Allahu Akbar Hill?
The battalion was destroyed immediately in front of the headquarters in al-Amara.
Only nine survived. As an officer attached to corps headquarters, I was sent to assess the situation. I found nine dirty soldiers with long beards and unpolished shoes. As an officer, I know that soldiers looking like that have received no visits from their superior officers. Morale was obviously rock bottom. The soldiers told me that they had been defending the hill with no infantry support when Iranian infantry burst on them throwing hand grenades; they had not seen any officers. I understood the situation because Tala al-Duri never bothered to leave his division headquarters.
Saddam visited the hill with the staff from his high command. They sat in the middle of the area and ate lunch with the corps commander and army chief of staff. I was anxious to make myself known to Saddam because he did not know me. When he asked what had happened, the commanders told him the story without any of the details regarding why it had happened (for example, the bad tactics and low morale). I felt compelled to speak because you have to tell the commander-in-chief the whole truth. I considered Saddam like a god, and one should not lie to God, right? I raised my hand, introduced myself, and asked permission to tell him what I had seen. I told him the tank regiment was alone on a hill. I added that every soldier knows that tanks cannot defend without infantry. I told him that I had met with the nine survivors and deduced that they had wretched morale. There was silence; nobody spoke.
Saddam returned to Bagdad. The corps commander lectured me for speaking the truth. I told him he had taught me everything I knew, when we were at staff college and that I did not understand why he was angry. He left, and I returned to the corps headquarters. General Na'ima al-Mihyawi, the chief of staff of the corps as well as the commander of the staff college, was a friend of mine. He told me the commander-in-chief was also angry with me. Saddam had said, ‗This officer speaks about our forces and that Iranian infantry had overwhelmed our tanks.' I was sad, because I wanted Saddam to be happy with me. I had done nothing except speak the truth, which can hurt, but is essential.
I told the political officer responsible for the III Corps, who later became deputy minister of the interior, ‗You are my friend and you were at the meeting. Please tell me why Saddam is cross with me. Why doesn't he like me?' He replied, ‗Saddam Hussein never said this about you. I was with him. Just wait and you will see what happens.' The next day, I was in the corps headquarters, when Saddam returned to meet with staff officers. I was not allowed in the meeting because I talked. I waited in the corridor. When Saddam came out, he put his arm around my shoulder, walked me down the hallway, shook my hand, and walked away. Afterwards an order was issued that only the commander can respond to questions posed by the commander-in-chief. Staff officers were not allowed to participate in discussions. This is why people had not told Saddam the truth at the beginning of the war. One reason why Saddam was considered a tyrant was because he refused to hear the truth.
Were the division, brigade, and corps commanders afraid this would reflect poorly on their performance? From your story it appears that Saddam appreciated knowing about weak performance and poor deployments.
Makki: They were all ignorant political officers. His clique was not made up of professional officers. This type of circle of [yes men] supporters exists in every dictatorship.
Woods: Do you have any other illustrations of Saddam's interactions with his military?
Makki: I have one other incident that is worth mentioning to illustrate how he was and how he changed later. After the battle at Allahu Akbar Hill, but before the 1982 battle of Basra, there was a major battle near al-Amara where three Iraqi divisions were routed: the Saddam was rarely alone, so he asked Tariq to bring him some first-class officers to discuss the situation at the front, which appeared to be deteriorating. This chief of staff had been my student at the staff college, so he asked me to come, as well as General Na'ima, commander of the staff college, and the deputy chief of staff for training. At the time, I was the deputy commander of Bakr University.
I arrived late. Saddam sat at the head of a table with the others beside him. His face was tense and turning yellow, which it did when he was angry. I saluted and introduced myself. He told me to sit down. Tea was brought, but I wondered how I could drink, when I was worried about my safety. When Saddam was angry, he was completely unpredictable. He asked me, ‗Do you know what happened?' I replied that I did not. I knew some-thing was wrong, but not exactly what it was. General Na'ima briefed me using a situation map on the wall. ‗The enemy came from here and attacked from this area. All of our forces have had to withdraw. We have taken a defensive position here. When the enemy comes, these forces will make the enemy deploy in order to gather information.' Saddam ordered his subordinates to do what I suggested and take up defensive positions 20 kilometers inside Iran. He had changed his orders without becoming angry. General Khairallah was near the catastrophe. No one had told him either. People were either afraid or did not understand the situation. Either way, they failed to tell Saddam. He would listen when he was provided good advice. General al-Khazraji made him change his mind many times. This incident underlined for me that Saddam would listen if you discussed an issue with him in a logical fashion. You just had to be careful.
This seems to be another example of you providing professional military expertise to the senior decision maker. How did Saddam's senior staff officers react to the change when they returned from the front?
Makki: They were pleased because it was the right thing to do.
Woods: There are several instances of Saddam's being told things he did not want to hear, but listening, if they made sense.
Makki: Saddam may have been arrogant; he may have been strong-willed, but he was not a fool. Maybe he was a fool politically, such as when he invaded Kuwait, but when one talked to him in this way, at least one was doing one's duty. If he did not act on your advice, then the matter was his responsibility. So when I became chief of staff to the III Corps, the new corps commander asked me to come to his room. He said, ‗General Makki, you are a good staff officer and I need a good chief of staff.' This was right after the loss of Khorramshahr.
As you know we lost Khorramshahr in June of 1982. The old commander of III Corps had been executed, while his chief of staff had been relieved. Poor General Salah al-Qadhi had been executed. The results would have been the same at Khorramshahr for any other commander. Nobody could have done anything in that situation because the deployment was bad, and the forces were ill-trained.
General Sa'adi became the new commander of the III Corps. He had been looking for a chief of staff, and he knew me well because I had been his teacher in the staff college.
During the Kuwait crisis he became minister of defense. At present, he is in a prison, the poor man. He is a good and honest man; he was clever and courageous. Wallahi, I feel sorry for him. Even when he bought a box of tissue, he paid for it out of his own pocket. He never put his hand out for anything from the state. He is clever and courageous. Anyway, General Sa'adi became corps commander and told me he was looking for a chief of staff.
However, before he told me he was looking for a chief of staff, General Na'ima became commander of the I Corps in the north and requested me also. Sa'adi asked with whom I preferred to work. I told him, ‗As long as you ask for me, I will accept the position. You are harder than Na'ima, but I know you and you are more competent. I will accept your position because you are right.' I started my duties as chief of staff the next day, because I was already there. The battle of Basra was brewing. The situation was tense. We did a reconnaissance of the front and reorganized and redeployed the defense. The 10th Armored Brigade arrived as a reserve. After my appointment, I employed all the military staff techniques that I had taught once upon a time. The first thing I did was a plan of maneuver, which I learned in France (projet de manoeuvre).
6
The next day I explained it to the divisional commanders and the staff officers. Thus, we were prepared for defensive operations against an Iranian attack.
That evening I received intelligence that the enemy was moving his forces and that they had started arriving at the front. Izzat al-Duri visited the corps headquarters to raise our morale. General Sa'adi ordered me to come to his office, where al-Duri asked me what we should do. I replied, ‗We have to move the 10th Armored Brigade across the Shatt al-Arab into Iran immediately, because once the situation develops we will not have time.'
Once the 10th Armored Brigade crossed on the second day, the Iranian assault started.
There was a major battle, and there was a great amount of dust. The first attack was near Fish Lake. They used thousands of people in a way that we had never seen before: waves of civilians with light personal armor, wearing skirts and dishdashara. They had been told by their clergy that Najaf or Karbala was there. Karbala is a sacred place to the Shi'a. If you die after seeing Karbala, you will go to heaven. I wonder why Khomeini did not come to see Karbala with them. The attack stopped at Fish Lake, because we moved the 10th Armored Brigade into the area. This battle continued from 14 to 31 July. The Iranians repeated this tactic in five battles. This was the first battle of Basra.
Murray: What is your estimate of the Iranian losses?
Makki: I do not know. Their losses were immense. They kept launching the same attack five straight times: go in with human waves and get killed. One could see corpses strewn all over the battlefield between the tanks. When the Iranians reached the banks of Fish Lake, it was muddy, and their Chieftain tanks got stuck in the mud. The Iranians either died or deserted their tanks. I think thousands of them died.
On the eve of battle, in your meeting with Izzat al-Duri, how good did you think your intelligence was about what the Iranians were about to do and how they were going to do it?
Makki: It was accurate. Our intelligence provided us with the times of attack and the enemy's approach.
Murray: Was intelligence good in both a strategic and tactical sense?
Makki: I am speaking in a tactical sense about the intelligence.
In a strategic sense, you knew that the main Iranian effort was coming.
Makki: Yes, it was obvious and right in front of us. We did not need any special information to warn us. The Iranian attack came immediately after Khorramshahr; it was only logical for them to attack us east of Basra.
Murray: Did they do any deception operations or employ operational security?
The Iranians had announced they were going to attack and occupy Basra and push on to Karbala. After the attack they became slightly better about operational security. The battle of Sharq Basra was over by the end of July. We reorganized and cleared the battlefield of dead and wounded. We collected abandoned Iranian tanks and equipment and sent the booty on to Baghdad in convoys so everyone could see the spoils of war. There We all thought they would attack either the Shatt al-Arab, the Fao Peninsula, the III Corps position, or al-Amara. We never thought they would cross the Hawizeh Marsh; it seemed impassible, because it was 40 kilometers wide.
Murray: What unit took the brunt of the Iranians attack during the 1984 Majnun attack? 7
Makki: The Iranians attacked the area between III and IV Corps-which was a clever tactic-to attack the boundary line between the two corps. Neither corps thought it was responsible for the area. Beside, the Iranians had attacked from a location that no one considered possible, because we knew they did not have bridges or amphibious equipment. I was chief of staff, and it never crossed my mind that they would cross in that area.
Woods: You probably had it mapped as ‗no-go' terrain.
Makki: Quite right. We positioned a minimum number of the second-rate troops from the Popular Army there. We thought the Iranians might send reconnaissance patrols at night and that troops in the area would be able to handle it.
The advantage Iraq had in the long-term was that any major offensive across this terrain might succeed initially, but could not be supported logistically in the long term.
Does this come down to amateurs who failed to think of the logistical implications?
Makki: True. That was the nature of the area: they could cross and attack, but could not exploit any advantage they gained. I do not know if they were amateurs, but their objectives were greater than their resources.
7
Majnun Island (which comprises two islands) is located in the middle of the Hawizeh Marsh. The oil field in the south is 13 kilometers long and 10 kilometers narrowing to 7 kilometers wide (180 square kilometers). The northern field is 6 by 8 kilometers (53 square kilometers).
Murray: This attack also occurred in a time of year when you were not expecting it due to the weather, is that correct?
The marsh was flooded with high water. We would see strips of foam floating on the marsh in the morning. When joined together, these strips of foam created a bridge, about 30 kilometers long. It was an ingenious plan. They brought infantry across the bridge.
The Iranians appeared behind us on the road connecting al-Qurnah and al-Amara. The next day they appeared in al-Qurnah on the northwest side of the border.
It was an ingenious plan. They crossed Hawizeh Marsh, appeared in al-Qurnah, and cut the road between Basra and al-Amara. The waves of the attack consisted of large numbers of Pasdaran and Basij infantry. The Iranians reached Majnun Island. After the second battle of Basra, this area was reinforced and transformed it into a command called ‗The East of Dijla Command,' which evolved into a divisional command. 8
Murray: Majnun Island had rich oil deposits, correct?
The whole area is floating on oil. Majnun Island has some of the richest oil fields in the area. The Iranians had now seized it. They also reached al-Qurnah. The new commander of the III Corps, Lieutenant General Ma'ahir Adbul Rashid, was busy fighting the battle. 9 His new chief of staff, Major General Fawzi Hamid al-Ali, was in the advance headquarters. 10 I was in the main headquarters near the Shatt al-Arab. The political officer responsible for the southern area, Abdul Ghani Abdul Raful, called and asked me what to do now that the enemy had arrived in al-Qurnah. He wanted military help, and I told him I would act, but I could not reach any of the seven officers. We had a reconnaissance regiment as a reserve and the 6th Armored Division had a mechanized battalion in reserve. I ordered the corps headquarters' G2 to lead them to al-Qurnah and contain the enemy in that area until morning. The reconnaissance regiment, the mechanized battalion, and the corps G2 arrived and stopped the enemy's advance. In the morning, I ordered army aviation, the 2nd Wing, which served the III and IV Corps, to prepare helicopters and fixed wing aircraft to provide air support. The situation stabilized 8
The East of Dijla operational command was formed after the second battle of Basra and had command and control over the divisions deployed in the region west of Hawizeh Marsh, east of the Tigris, and between al-Amara and al-Qurnah. Responsibility for this area was not well-defined initially because it fell between the III Corps in Basra and the IV Corps in al-Amara. 9
Makki added as an aside that -Rashid was from Tikrit and related to Saddam. His daughter later married Uday. He was considered a good commander but was a very nasty person. He cursed everyone.‖' 10 Makki added that after the war, Al-Ali, a Shi'a, defected to India, when sent there for a course on national defense.
and the corps commander thanked me, but sent me back to Baghdad a few days later because I talked too much.
During battle it was the habit for the commanders and staff officers not to share situational information immediately. When the general commanding was asked for a situation report, he would not tell the truth if news were bad. The 6th Armored Division was defending south of Majnun. I told general command that the situation was stable. The next morning Saddam gave me a car, because he was pleased with my report. If the situation were bad, I was not supposed to tell general command. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated over night. I reported the situation. The divisional commander asked me what to do because his tanks were surrounded on Majnun, and he could not pull them out. I briefed the corps commander, and he said the division should pull out of Majnun and get on dry land. I told the commander of the division to pull back to dry land. I told him to destroy any tanks stuck in the marsh. Saddam was angry that the news went from good to bad. The corps commander would have kept this information until the battle was over.
He was not mad at me, but he asked me politely to return to Baghdad. This is all I know about the second battle of Basra. The Iranians crossed, did everything they could, but they lost the battle. Everything was restored to its original state. In 1988, all the Iranians who remained in Majnun were killed in the second battle for control of the island. Every campaign should have clear political objectives, upon which clear strategic concepts, strategic, operational, and tactical planning rest. This is a well-known military principle.
The attack into Iran should have been a short one, like a blitzkrieg, because Iraq did not have the resources for a long campaign. We knew that we were not prepared to fight a long war, and that Iran had a greater capacity in terms of human resources, wealth, and land mass. Logically, if Iraq fought a war against Iran it needed to be short, such as when Israel fought the Six-Day War. 11 Judging from the pre-emptive air strike and attack, this was the intention of Iraq's command.
We had 11 divisions to cover the 11 roads that connect Iraq and Iran. Only one division advanced along each road. There was no main axis of advance and no secondary axis of advance. Although the literature on the war suggests the main axis was in the south and the secondary axis was in the center, this was broadly defined. In fact, we were weak everywhere. Woods: If Iraq had held Bytaq Pass, Iran would not have been able to move reinforcements out of Iranian Kurdistan, move logistics out of Tehran, or evacuate their casualties.
Murray: They would have had to go 700 miles around.
Makki: Yes, especially when you take into account that after the Iranian revolution, the Iranian Army was in shambles. There was nothing left of it. Such a maneuver could not have happened because the organizational and logistical support would not have been there.
11 After numerous border clashes, Israel fought the Six-Day War (5-10 June 1967) with neighboring states Egypt, Jordan, and Syria. At its conclusion, Israel gained control of the Sinai Peninsula, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, and the Golan Heights.
Between the center and southern sectors lies Dezful Pass, where transport and oil pipelines from Hawaz converge. Dezful should also have represented a major objective. Only one armored division was allotted to the attack on Dezful, even though the 3rd Armored and 9th Armored and 5th Mechanized Divisions were all in the neighboring area.
Iraq could have secured Dezful, if the army command had allotted those divisions to that objective. But as I said, these divisions were divided up, one on each road. There was one division for each road in the upper part of the southern sector.
The main objective in the southern sector should have been to take the city of Ahvaz. We should have assigned the 5th Mechanized, the 3rd Armored, and the 9th Armored Divisions to take Ahvaz. If we'd taken that town, the whole surrounding area would have fallen to us. Instead, the high command assigned 3rd Armored Division, a single division, to take Khorramshahr. Moreover, it was a bad decision to task an armored division to take a port city. With an infantry division we could have seized the port easily, and the whole area would have fallen by itself. But who thinks this way strategically? This type of planning requires a competent strategic thinker and, in Iraq, a brave soldier. General al-Khazraji could have done this type of thinking; he would have ended the war early.
Murray: To accomplish this, wouldn't Shanshal have had to make a decision?
Makki: He did not even have to make a decision; he had only to make a suggestion. He did not make the suggestion because, if he had been wrong, he would have been blamed. Thus, the strategic plan was weak. Between 22 and 28 September 1980, we advanced into Iran. In the south, Ahvaz, approximately 80 kilometers inside the Iranian border, was our deepest penetration. The 5th Mechanized Division reached the outskirts of Ahvaz but was not sufficiently strong to occupy the town. The people of Ahvaz did not welcome the Iraqi forces because they were waiting to see who would win the war. The 5th Mechanized Division waited for reinforcements before attacking. Those never arrived. While the 5th Mechanized Division waited for reinforcements, the Iranians built dams and flooded the area between it and Ahvaz. In the southern sector, the 3rd Armored Division received the order to occupy Khorramshahr. Its troops got bogged down after they started advancing, so they requested infantry reinforcements. The 33rd Special Forces Brigade arrived to support them. They fought there for a month but only managed to take half the city. They could not occupy the far side of Khorramshahr near the Karun River.
Attempting to take Abadan, along the Shatt al-Arab, from behind was another mistake.
After partially taking Khorramshahr, the 3rd Armored Division was ordered to take Abadan. The 23rd Infantry Brigade was ordered to cross the Karun River and take Abadan from the rear. The original plan called for the 7th Infantry Division, commanded by General al-Khazraji, to take Abadan from the north. He left the middle sector and started training his soldiers to cross the river. After a month they were needed again in the middle sector near Diyala and as-Sa'Diyah. The high command forgot the operation to cross the Karun River.
The 7th Infantry Division was probably the right force to plan and conduct the river crossing.
Makki: The 23rd Brigade was given the 3rd Armored Division after the 7th Infantry Division was pulled back to the middle sector. The 7th Division should have crossed under the general command's direction, but it was under the control of the corps commander. When it pulled back, the task was left to the corps commander, who supported the operation halfheartedly. The 23rd Brigade crossed the muddy area easily, but could not continue, so it had to be pulled back. The Abadan Peninsula was occupied by the 6th Armored Brigade.
Think about this. We occupied part of the Abadan Peninsula, which was surrounded by an embankment, with an armored brigade. Three armored regiments and one mechanized battalion besieged Abadan by fire. The road to Abadan was impassable and the Iranians could not fire on it. The 6th Armored Brigade remained in Abadan for more than a year.
Luckily, we were able to pull its troops back when the Iranians launched their major offensive in 1982.
Woods: Please continue the narrative of the battles at Abadan and Ahvaz.
The Iraqi Army had to stop fighting after six days because it ran out of supplies. The Iraqi high command and Saddam believed Iran would negotiate when the fighting stopped; however, Iran refused Iraq's request for negotiations. Iraq then had to go on the defensive, because our resources were depleted along the 400-600km front. We only had 11 divisions, and we also needed to consider internal security as well as the Kurds in the north. In fact, we were fighting two wars: one against the Kurds and the other against Iran. It was a peculiar situation. So the Iraqi offensive stopped 40 kilometers inside the Iranian border, and we went over to the defensive. The winter, which is the rainy season, arrived and the muddy ground made it difficult to move for tanks, armored cars, and other heavy vehicles.
In early January, in these rainy conditions, the Iranians launched a major offensive for political reasons. We know that Bani al-Sadr was hoping for a military victory so that he could gain traction against the religious fanatics. Can you speak about that offensive? Hussein. Can you comment on that?
Makki: He was a good division commander, but he had no intelligence background. He could not do the job of the director of intelligence. He refused to pass along the information in order to please the new chief of staff.
Let's get back to the battle at Susangard. Some of the Iranians deserted their tanks while their engines were still running. We put the tanks we captured in an exhibition area in Baghdad. Our armor sabot round pierced a Chieftain on one side and the round went through the front armor and came out the backside.
At this time the British approached us to sell us tanks. Salah Askar, director of armor, told me that when the British called and offered to sell him Chieftains he had remarked, ‗We don't want your stupid tanks!'
We have a recording of Saddam in 1985 saying that military doctrine is important, and that he wanted to read every doctrinal manual that was going to be published.
Makki: He had good intentions regarding military doctrine. He spoke well of it. I sent every pamphlet, magazine, and publication to all of the commanders, from Saddam himself to the lowest rank. Before I became Director of CDD, Saddam came to the staff college to listen to a military lecture about doctrine. He also spoke at that lecture regarding his thoughts about military doctrine. At the time, there were two schools of thought regarding military doctrine: Eastern (Soviet) and Western. The Eastern school argued that military doctrine was equivalent to strategy in that it should affect the entire state. The Western school of thought argued that doctrine is not equal to strategy. I myself supported the latter approach over the argument that military doctrine should encompass the whole state. Officers who studied in Egypt leaned towards the Eastern school of military doctrine, because Egypt had adopted Soviet doctrine. I adopted the other one because it was more logical.
Murray: So it goes back to your schooling.
Makki: Saddam did not interfere much. While I was director of CDD, I wanted to publish a strategic digest, similar to Military Review. We also translated articles from foreign military magazines. As I indicated, Shanshal followed the Eastern school of thought about strategy. Most of our high-ranking officers did not know about strategy at that time, because the war college and staff college had not focused on that subject. I wanted to educate higher ranking officers on strategy. I arranged to publish a strategic magazine. For the first issue, I wrote an article on politics and the army: why the armed forces in the West are not allowed to mix in politics, as opposed to why armed forces in totalitarian regimes, communist regimes, and one-party states end up interfering in politics. After I published the article, Saddam read it, was impressed, and sent me a Mercedes. I earned this because I had written something.
Murray: I would have thought that Saddam would have been furious at such an article.
Makki: It explained why our army had become involved in politics from the earliest days. In principle, the army is an arm of the government. In a liberal democracy, the government is a political apparatus with a political ideology and theory which it applies. One day the leading principle is Republican, the next day it is Democratic. For such a government, the army must be transparent. A red government creates a red army; a green government creates a green army. The army is prohibited from having its own color. That is why the army is prohibited from participating in party politics in a liberal democracy. Totalitarian regimes, or regimes governed by one party do not allow other parties to control for leadership of the state. Their ideology influences anything. Thus, there appears to be little harm in covering the army in the color of the government. It will not change anything.
The leaders may change, but the ideology will remain the same, so the army can have political officers and political organization.
Woods: Was the reason Saddam liked the article because it gave a theoretical basis to what he was doing?
Makki: Yes. I wanted to understand it, so I had to analyze it, and now I understand the reason.
In the Eastern bloc, the minister of defense wears a military uniform, while in a Western democracy he is a civilian. He represents the idea that the armed forces should be under civilian, not military, control. It is dangerous for military forces to be under the direction of the military, because the military always thinks militarily. A military dictator is dangerous, because he will use the military easily, unlike civilians. Those of us within the military are not prepared to govern. Officers by their nature are not politicians. If I wanted to be a politician, I should leave the army. This is an important concept for a growing nation to understand. People must be educated to know this. I knew this reality because I studied.
Woods: So one of your innovations in your position at the CDD was to stimulate the army's intellectual side. You initiated this strategic magazine and these conversations. What else did you do?
Makki: After the publication of this pamphlet, I began organizing Iraqi military thought and strategy into categories. I emphasized the operational level of war as part of the curriculum. Before my time in office, the army did not recognize the operational level of war.
Similar to the British, we recognized only the strategic and tactical levels. I published a manual that argued that the military engaged on four levels: strategic, operational, tactical, and logistic. Because it was clear, the new concept was adopted by the Iraqi military.
I also wrote a history of the Iraqi Armed Forces.
Woods: I have seen an incomplete copy.
Makki: It is not yet complete. It has seven volumes. Book one is an introduction. Books two, three, and four are about the ground forces. Then, there are two books about the history of air forces and one book about the history of the navies. It would have been 30 volumes if I had possessed the time to finish. I published those seven volumes before leaving the CDD. It is unlikely that anyone else will write any more volumes in the series.
We also encouraged a return to foreign military education. The Iraqi military sent a number of officers abroad to India, America, Russia, etc., to take courses on operational level of military thought. We imported Russian and Egyptian books on the topic. Unofficially, we read histories on German operations during World War II. However, the most important books were American and British. The British had adopted the operational level. The Germans had used the term ‗operational level' during World War II. It consisted of the operational cycle, fire and movement, and the task of the corps commander to concentrate fire, support, and logistics. This is how we were educated before we started teaching at the war college.
Murray: Do you think the study of operational art had an impact on the 1987 and 1988 successes?
Makki: Of course; there is no doubt. General al-Khazraji used the concept of the operational and strategic levels successfully. The efforts of each branch of the armed forces were successfully applied at the end of the war. However, the air force planned for itself, the navy planned for itself, and the army planned for itself. There was no joint planning. Murray: After the battles in 1987 and 1988, the army produced doctrinal lessons-learned.
When did they begin making these lessons-learned assessments?
Makki: After each major battle, there was a lessons-learned conference to analyze what happened. This process started at the beginning of the war, but became more important after 1982.
Woods: So you and the director of training would go into the battlefield, conduct interviews, look at the terrain, and then host the conference?
Makki: Right. We also asked for a staff officer from each division and corps to write an analysis after each battle. The lessons-learned were deduced from the reports at the conference. Some lessons-learned were incorporated into a training pamphlet, while others were sent directly to industry to improve the effectiveness of weapons.
Woods: Were all of the senior command on board with the process of reading analysis and operations research?
Makki: They did not understand it at the beginning of the conflict. By the second half of the war, no one could become a brigade commander without passing the staff college and war college exams. This new requirement took effect in 1984. You had to study operational research, management, etc., in order to pass the examination. That is how a new generation of commanders was created.
Woods: So it took a few years, but had it started to pay off by 1986?
Makki: It needed time. General al-Khazraji was a rare mix: He was a good Ba'athist, but also a good, brave, professional officer who was not afraid of consequences, even though he did not graduate from the war college. In 1983, he wrote a paper entitled How to Regain the Initiative and Finish the War Against Iran, which he sent to Saddam, but Tala al-Duri, the secretary of the high command, read it superficially and then took it to Saddam, who also read it superficially. Saddam still was not well educated in military practices in 1983. Because al-Duri did not support the report, it was returned to al-Khazraji and had no impact. He was told it was a good strategic analysis, but nothing could be done, because the enemy had the advantage. General al-Khazraji was a divisional commander then and became a corps commander only later. He was busy fighting Kurds and Iranians, and he did not have time to write. He was a speaker, not a writer, so he asked for my help. I met with him and recorded what he said on the topic.
When al-Khazraji became chief of staff in 1987, he asked Saddam, ‗Sir, do remember when I wrote the paper on regaining the initiative in 1983? We have to finish the war now because Iraq is on the brink of collapse. We have used up all our resources and our people-some of whom have been in the army for ten years. We cannot stand this war for even one more year. We must regain the initiative and finish the conflict.' Saddam did not remember the paper, so al-Khazraji provided another copy and said, ‗Please read this paper again.' Saddam read the paper again and began discussing the ideas with him.
Of course, the situation was different in 1987 than in 1983 in terms of equipment and army size on our side and the Iranian side. Saddam asked al-Khazraji to rewrite the paper according to the new correlation of forces, which he did. After reading the paper, Saddam held a conference in 1987. Unfortunately, I was not there.
The new study's main points were that the Iraqi Army must return to the correct principles of war and must apply what the manuals say about fighting-namely, how to hold defensive positions. At that time, our defensive positions were manned based on old methods of fighting: a high embankment representing the front line, with a static and linear defense comprising a company, with a battalion or brigade slightly to the rear. There was no depth or distance between the soldiers and other positions. When the Iranians attacked, they hit the brigade headquarters in the first assault. This prevented Iraqi infantry from defending optimally, because the company or battalion commanders could not issue orders.
Murray: So you moved to the German-style defense in depth?
Makki: First, we had to return to the principles of defense in order to minimize the number of forces holding defensive positions as well as strengthen our defense. Second, we pulled a brigade out of the front line from each armored and mechanized division and half of the infantry divisions for training on defensive operations, while the rest of the forces held the front line. The Republican Guard provided a competent strategic reserve in case anything happened.
Within six months the retrained troops were back in the front and had significantly improved their tactical ability. Their equipment was better, their training better, their battlefield effectiveness better. As a result, morale improved, and our soldiers became better troops. When they returned to the front, the other half pulled off the front lines for training on offensive operations. Not all the brigade commanders agreed to this, but commanders who did not agree with the approach found themselves replaced. General Jamal (the III Corps Commander) was replaced with General Salah Abboud. General Isma'il Tail al-Raimi, the commander of the I Special Corps, which consisted of all recalled retired officers and NCOs [non-commissioned officers], was replaced by General Sa'ad Jabbouri, who later became minister of defense. General Shawket Ahmed Atta of the II Corps was also replaced.
Murray: Saddam seems to have identified those who were not paying attention to the new training approach; he was discovering precisely those generals who would not pay attention to the new doctrinal methods of doing business. They had to go. How did Saddam ensure that the replacements would adopt to the doctrinal changes? Were they good divisional commanders?
Makki: He knew them. He submitted their names. He replaced them, not only because they were unwilling to be retrained, but also because they did not adopt this doctrine. He knew he could not win the war with these people. That is why he brought in al-Khazraji.
Before this, al-Khazraji had achieved many considerable victories in his various commands. He had proven himself. Woods: A question in most Western histories of this war revolves around when and why Saddam allowed the Iraqi Army to professionalize? The general narrative says that after the problems of experienced between 1982 and 1983, Iraq's professional generals asked Saddam to allow them to take charge. By 1984, Saddam supported the operational approach of the professional generals. Is this how it was perceived within the Iraqi military?
Makki: Do you really believe anyone would go to Saddam and say, ‗We're going to lose unless we do this?' This view is wrong. As the war progressed, Saddam began to take the lead personally. He was also receiving a considerable military education. He started to understand more and more. However, he was willing to take responsibility to a greater extent than Shanshal.
Dhannoun was army chief of staff until early 1987 or late 1986. After the catastrophe of Fao in 1986, he was not replaced immediately, but eventually by General Saladin Aziz.
Aziz was an officer from the old Iraqi Royal Army. He studied in the United States. He is considered an intellectual, a clever and able administrator, but was an untried commander. In the Royal Army, he was military secretary for the Baghdad Pact. He was also an instructor in the staff college, but before that, I do not know. He is an old man. When he retired, he was a division commander. Afterwards, he became director of Iraqi naval ports in Basra, as a civilian.
Woods: What had General Jawad Dhannoun done to be fired?
Makki: Dhannoun was sacked during the battles of Jasim River, near Basra. Saddam had asked Dhannoun why Iraq was losing the fighting along the Jasim River. Dhannoun had replied something along the lines of, ‗How can I work when you are changing people without telling me?' Saddam did not like the answer and replaced him. Changing the army chief of staff was not easy. Saddam looked right, left, and then asked Shanshal whom he should pick. He wanted a good officer, who knew the right procedures of the army and was intelligent. Shanshal said that he should make Aziz the army chief of staff.
Aziz got the call.
Woods: How old was Aziz at the time?
What do you think the lessons were for the professional Iraqi military about their use in deployment? What is your perspective?
Makki: I do not know if you will believe me or not, but I do not know anything about the use of chemical weapons during the war. We did not use them in my sector, the southern sector. I have never seen chemical weapons used in front of me or read an order deploying their use. They may have been employed in the northern sector, where I did not work. You can ask General Abousi, because the air force might have used them. I do not believe the use of chemical weapons is humane. They are prohibited by international law. I have a degree in international law and know it is against international law to use chemical weapons. I have no firsthand experience, but I know that the Iranians also used them.
We have captured documents that describe the limited use of chemical weapons in 1983 and 1984. The first major use was the counter-attack at Fao in February 1986. The weapons turned out to be pretty ineffective because the ground was muddy. The chemical shells and bombs basically buried themselves.
Makki: Any bomb would sink in the mud, which would render its burst ineffective.
Murray: This would suggest that the use of chemical weapons was an issue Saddam considered strictly -need-to-know‖. It is interesting that chemical weapons did not impact army's doctrinal writings and combat development.
We did not include best practices regarding chemical weapons in our pamphlets, because that information was restricted. Our pamphlets were for the entire army. I remember no pamphlets about chemical weapons. Perhaps the chemical directorate wrote one, but I do not know.
We were told that the Iraqi military, organized more along Eastern European principles, did not depend heavily on its NCOs. It was more dependent on junior officers for tactical operations. The Iraqi Army was officer-led and officer-driven. Is that characterization true, is that changing, or did it change?
Makki: That characterization is true. We relied more heavily on officers than on NCOs.
There are reasons for this. The Iraqi Royal Army started in 1921. It was well-organized and modeled after the British Army. The NCOs were capable and trustworthy; the officers were well-trained. The army began losing its NCO corps, little by little after the Revolution of 1958. The mettle of the Iraqi soldier deteriorated over time. When the army started to expand in the early 1980s, the importance of NCOs diminished and more em-phasis was placed on the officer corps. Second, the moral fiber and level of education of the average Iraqi was not high. This is where the NCO corps came from. We could not trust them-not all of them, but most of them. As a result, the position of the NCO lost, little by little, its significance. Third, officers are better educated and more highly motivated. We had a saying: ‗If you want something not to be achieved, give it to an NCO.'
The status of NCOs was low, and they were not as highly regarded as they should have been. This was a bad thing of the Iraqi Army. Of course, we wanted to raise standards and have educated NCOs. The Non-Commissioned Officer School in Mosul existed even before the war, but it was not enough. We accepted educated people after completing primary school, but before they went to high school. Because we relied so heavily on our officers, our losses were much higher than any other army in the world.
Woods: Did the relatively low level of education among the NCOs act a limiting factor in the execution of maneuver warfare?
Makki: Yes. Because the truth is that the citizenry of a nation has to have a higher level of education in order to create a modern army, because a modern army is a scientific army.
This was a problem for Iraq.
Murray: Given the high losses within the officer corps, would an individual who turned out to be a good NCO be promoted to officer-what we call a battlefield commission?
Makki: Yes, because we needed them. The Iranian leaders at present understand that religious zeal is not enough. They must have competent science, knowledge, planning, and logistics. In 1988, it was too late.
They had lost so many lives, not just resources, that they lost their nerve. Our rockets hit their cities and our air superiority was demonstrated through the bombing campaigns as well. This combined with their massive casualties to destroy their will to fight.
Iranians Murray: They never solved the problem of how to exploit a tactical victory. The Iraqi Army understood that much better.
Makki: Not at that time. We only learned to exploit tactical victories in 1987.
The January 1981 victory over the 92nd Iranian Armored Division presented the Iraqi Army with a significant opportunity for exploitation. It could have taken Dezful, but the Iraqi forces remained on the defensive after destroying the Iranian attack.
No sir, I disagree. We did repel the Iranian attack, but an offensive required more forces. The Iraqi Army's expansion did not start until late 1981. At the beginning of the war, we had only 11 or 12 divisions; by the end of the war, we had 57 divisions. At the time of that battle, the Iraqi forces were still small in number. We were happy to repel that attack, but we did not have sufficient forces to pursue. Maybe we could have pushed the Iranians back a few kilometers, but no more than that. We needed logistics, artillery, and air support to proceed. We were not prepared to occupy a city and run its civilian government. A military cannot take a city or country without a government to run what it captures.
Murray: Saddam seemed unwilling to take any sort of insult. He had sent high emissaries to Khomeini before the war to request a reasonable agreement, only to be rejected with exquisite rudeness. Was there an element of revenge in Saddam's tactics?
Makki: This is a complex issue and was the result of the historical elements I have already talked about. Saddam was a mystery, but he was not all evil. I did not like him, but there were many good things about him. Unfortunately, the bad outweighed the good.
Nathan: Why did Saddam react positively to you? Was it your delivery, or because you were junior, or was it just luck that several times you could get through to him?
Makki: He responded positively because I spoke logically and I did not contradict him. I gave him logic and suggestions. I did not care whether he acted on my suggestions or not. Woods: Are there any incidents or events-specifically from your time as chief of staff of the corps-that stand out in your mind and that would provide insight into the operating environment in the early 1980s?
Makki: One time when I was chief of staff in the Basra area, Saddam called while General Sa'adi, the corps commander, was celebrating the Ramadan Eid with the troops. 17 Saddam knew I was not the commander and asked where General Sa'adi was. I replied that the general was celebrating Eid with the troops. I then took the initiative and asked Saddam how he was. To speak to Saddam was important because at that time, we all still loved him. Everybody thought he was a hero. Little by little, as he treated people harshly and began executing them, the truth revealed itself.
Murray: Except for those who stayed in his court.
Makki: Saddam gave gifts of land, houses, orchards, and citations for bravery. After being awarded three citations, you became a ‗friend of Saddam Hussein.' This tradition was modeled after Napoleon's ‗friends of Napoleon.' I had no citations so I never became a ‗friend of Saddam Hussein.' Being a ‗friend of Saddam' could help your child get into medical school or add points to your entrance scores if it was too low. This is how he looked after his people and friends.
Murray: It is much like a tribal chieftain.
17 Eid al-Fitr is a three-day celebration that marks the end of Ramadan. 
In one of the post-war FBI interviews of Saddam, he commented that he was going to be rescued and ‗give me eight years I will make Iraq a paradise.'
Makki: He was dreaming.
Kabi: Most countries with limited water access have to use common exits without claiming them as their own because everyone uses them. There is no need to control each other's space. Maybe the Kuwaitis have an excuse. Normally, there is trust between the two countries, but for obvious reasons this is not necessarily true in this case.
We are looking at a strategic and operational history of the Iran-Iraq War. We are not particularly interested in the technical aspects of naval warfare in the Gulf, but rather the operational scheme, the Iraqi Navy's ability to understand the battlespace, the decision- what became known in the West as the Tanker War. 
3
As you know, if history becomes just a recitation of facts, it becomes dry and boring. So we are interested in your view of some of the personalities. We want to understand how senior naval commanders interacted with the government in Baghdad, as well as with each other. I would like to know a bit about your peers. Who were the dynamic commanders, and the commanders who were not so competent?
Admittedly, we are asking you questions from our perspective as American historians.
As such our questions will likely fall short because we do not have the understanding 
We talked to Generals Hamdani, Tarfa, and Makki about war planning during the summer of 1980. They referred to a meeting in July 1980 that discussed the possibility of a war with Iran. As they described it, all the services were represented. Was the navy represented?
Kabi: I was the director of naval training when the war commenced. A few months later I became the director of naval operations. There were studies about the possibilities of war between Iran and Iraq when I was a commander. I took part in them at that time. The session that you refer to was conducted in the planning directorate of the ministry of defense.
There were many officers from all three services who participated in the discussion.
Woods: I am trying to understand the period just before the war started and the kind of planning that went on. Do you recall talking to your peers? Was it specific, or because the navy was independent, was it still up to the navy to think about what it would mean if Iraq went to war with Iran?
Kabi: As far as the navy was concerned, there was no serious planning before the war.
In terms of long-term planning and studying the potential implications of a long conflict, our impression of the Iraqi Army was that the situation was similar.
Kabi: Even in the army, I found there was no great standard of planning. For example, there were no maps available when the land forces began the invasion Iran.
Woods: As a naval officer during the period immediately before the war, can you recall thinking about the potential of a war with Iran? What were your top concerns? What were the things you worried about in terms of the Iraqi Navy and the potential of a clash with Iran?
Kabi: I was the commander of the training directorate. We were most afraid of their combatant missile boats; they had 6 with a contract with the French to buy 12 more. Their boats were armed with the American Harpoon missile. 
7
8
Woods: What types of modifications did you make to your Soviet missiles?
7
The AGM-84 (Harpoon) is an American-manufactured, all-weather, over-the-horizon anti-ship missile that entered service in the late 1970s.
8
The Harpoon missile had a range of approximately 90 kilometers, whereas the Styx missile had a range of approximately 40 kilometers.
point of view, our boats were inferior to those in the Iranian Navy. Iran also had a significant number of patrol ships and P-3C Orion surveillance aircraft. 9
Woods: What equipment did the Iraqi Navy use for surveillance? How did you extend your eyes out beyond?
Kabi: At the beginning of the war, we had problems with surveillance in the Gulf, because we did not have any plans in place related to that task, and the Iraqi Air Force had no experience flying over water. Of course I am speaking about the beginning of the war. Later on, the air force flew deeper and deeper out into the Gulf.
Murray: Was there any cooperation between the navy and the air force in 1980?
Kabi: No, never.
Murray: Did that develop over the course of the war?
Kabi: In November 1980, there was a major battle between the Iraqi and Iranian navies. Our air force failed to provide air cover for our ships. As a result, our naval ships became targets for the Iranian Air Force.
Murray: Was the air force supposed to provide air cover?
No, but they did begin providing air cover in late 1982.
Woods: Why did this change in 1982? Who was responsible for making the air force do combined operations with the navy?
Kabi: The needs of the navy drove the change to greater cooperation. The navy requested air cover at all armed forces council meetings. We said that this situation could not continue, that we must find a solution, otherwise we could not continue to operate.
Was there an advocate outside the navy in Baghdad?
Kabi: Saddam's general commander of the armed forces told us to sit together and find a solution. We were located close to the coast, not in the deep sea, within the area of the two oil terminals. 10 Under these circumstances, we were obliged to operate only at night, to avoid air attacks. Even our helicopters were not trained for operations over the sea. They had no IFF (identification friend-or foe) equipment. They had no way of differentiating between Iranian ships and ours. This was a dangerous situation. Thus, sometimes our 9

10
Woods: So by 1983, Saddam had realized he would need to conduct an economic war against Iran. He turned to his navy to start attacking Kharg and the northern Gulf area economic zone. Can you explain how you developed your targeting method, what the information was, how crews were briefed, and whether they knew the nature of the targets they were going after? Were the targets specific? If I were a helicopter pilot taking off from Umm Qasr to look for targets at Kharg, would I have been briefed to look for a specific target, or would I have been told to go to the area south of Kharg and attack any naval target? Kabi: We began offensive operations, when I became commander of the navy. For the first operation, I decided to attack ships in the Bushehr area. We sent three attack boats to troll for targets between the Persian Gulf base and the Khawr Abdullah channel. Then, they changed course towards Iran. The operation lasted 20 hours, and the missile boats launched six missiles and sank five ships. We knew we had to develop our offensive naval operations.
Kabi: This was my initiative; it was not directed by Saddam. I went to the armed forces headquarters to discuss it with the general staff. They indicated they could not authorize such an operation. A few minutes later, Saddam arrived and asked me if I had anything for him. I told him my intentions to launch an attack on ships anchoring south of Bushehr.
He asked me to explain the operation, so I laid the map out in front of him. He asked me a question, which is important because it is proof he was clever, ‗Are you sure you will find ships in the area, when you get there? If there is any anchorage in this sector, you definitely will find ships there, and you can attack.' I told him that I was sure this was an anchorage and that we would find ships. Saddam approved the plan, but it had been completely initiated by me and my staff.
Woods: There was a degree of risk: you had never run offensive operations across the Gulf. This was a new operation for your crews. Kabi: Yes. Let me give you an example. On the first mission, the missile boat, which was commanded by the man who currently commands the Iraqi Navy, broke down approximately nine miles from one of the Iranian oil fields. 
14
Woods: Some of the histories we have read of this period expend much effort trying to understand if there had been a strategy to hit tankers from certain countries more than other countries. In other words, part of the strategy would be, if we attack Indian tankers supporting Iran, we can influence Indian political support for operations against Iraq. Was there any specific kind of guidance that led you to think about targets?
Kabi: Although we could detect a ship or tanker by radar, we could not determine its port of origin. Because we relied on radar, its mere presence in the northern Gulf made it a target. We attacked everything that our radars detected.
Between March and September, we had a station, which could detect any movement within 30 miles and as far south as Bushehr and Kharg. We could detect ships once they were five-to-six miles outside of the harbor. So we made what we call a ‗casual plan' where we projected the future point of the target. We originally had our helicopters at al-Sha'iba Air Base. 
15
We relied on the helicopters.
Were there any particular problems for your crew flying that far out over open water at night? Kabi: It was a naval helicopter, so it was provided with sea-going instrumentation and had a good range. It was well-equipped with navigational devices, and as I told you, we trained them for this type of flying. Eventually the pilots were tasked with attacking ships (in the northern gulf) and laying mines.
Kabi: We replaced the helicopter's missile equipment with a rail system and loaded the mines inside the helicopter. We initially used old-fashioned Russian contact mines.
15 Al-Sha'iba Air Base is located 11 miles southwest of Basra.
At this same time the missile boats received a new mission: attacking the tankers that gathered the oil produced at each oil field. Because we relied on the helicopters to attack ships in the open sea, we tasked the missile boats with attacking the oil fields.
We attacked the Soroosh oil field three times, Bushehr four times, and the Bahregan Sar oil field twice. 
16
Woods: What were Iraqi Navy losses like during this period? Kabi: The navy lost two missile boats during the first battle at the terminals in November 1980 before I became the navy's commander.
Woods: How were they lost?
Kabi: They were sunk by the Iranian Air Force. Iran also lost two boats. When the operations began, an officer and 12 soldiers defended each terminal. The Iranians arrived by helicopter and fired on the terminal. After they captured the terminal, an Iranian missile boat was sent alongside the terminal to recover the Iraqis, who had been captured. One of our missile boats sank the Iranian missile boat with our POWs onboard. Another Iranian missile boat was sent in support of that first boat, and we sunk that as well. After that, they depended only on their air force to attack our boats. Because we had no air cover, despite requesting air support from our air force, the Iranians sank two of our missile boats. In total, we lost only four missile boats during the entire war.
Were the other two boats lost in deep operations?
Kabi: One night in 1983 or 1984, we sent a missile boat out after detecting a target. We told it not to exceed the range of the terminals so we could launch our helicopters. The missile boat did exceed the limits of the terminals. After it sank the ship, it was sunk by an Iranian missile boat. This was the only ship we lost as a result of an attack by an Iranian missile boat.
Back to the original question-the third stage of the war began after the invasion of Fao in 1986. The navy became critical, because after the Iranians invaded the Fao Peninsula, our route to the sea became constrained. We had no choice, we had to go. the navy's command. The navy knew how to use the aircraft and how to conduct an operation in the Gulf.
Murray: Did you coordinate with the commander of the air force in discussing procedures?
Kabi: Sometimes. For example, during the missile boat operations conducted against Kharg in 1984, we coordinated with the air force for air cover at certain times and the air force provided the cover. This was in 1984.
Woods: Was it possible that your intelligence was good enough to decide which country owned which ship and that you were targeting specific countries to influence their support of Iran?
Kabi: We could not.
The way you're describing it, I agree: nighttime operations that fire on a radar picture, which itself is a vague target, make it impossible to discern the nationality of a ship.
The radar picture does not show which country owns the ship. You just detect a tanker or ship.
Murray: This explains why the USS Stark was hit. 
18
Kabi: It was in the wrong area at the wrong time. The air force could not identify a ship's country of origin. The pilot saw a ship and attacked. We launched missiles against Iranian oil fields: 15 against Narouz, 16 against Ardashiya, 12 against Soroosh, 8 against Bahregan Sar, 2 against the western jetty of Kharg, and 4 against the eastern jetty of Kharg. To achieve Iraq's interests in any future war, the navy must operate outside the Gulf. Oil will remain a strategic commodity, which Iran will depend on to support its war machine. Iran will search for an alternative solution outside of the Gulf, in the Oman Gulf. Even if Iran were to establish links outside of the Gulf to export oil, its main installations-I mean oil fields and so on-are still vulnerable to attack.
Woods: This is because the primary oil fields are in the northern Gulf, so even if the Iranians operate outside of the Gulf, they will still need to get oil out of the north.
Kabi: Yes, to achieve a strategic naval victory, Iraq must depend on facilities inside the Gulf to maintain fast and powerful capabilities-missile boats, corvettes, helicopters, slip boats, and patrol craft like the Italian Sparviero. 
21
Murray: One thing that was noted from reviewing naval operations during the war is that the possession of Bubiyan was crucial for any sort of expansion of Iraq's naval capabilities into the Gulf.
Kabi: Bubiyan was one of the goals to which the leadership gave great attention. Unfortunately, Kuwait was unwilling to provide us access to the island. Woods: Was there coordination between the navy and the port directorate?
Kabi: The port directorate commander was General Salim Hussein. He was retired at the time, but still thought of himself as a general. Thus, he refused to coordinate with the navy.
Many incidents occurred because he did not withdraw the ships from the terminals.
Woods: What port was he in charge of?
Kabi: He was commander of the Basra area. The Iraqi Navy gave an alarm, which allowed the Iranians to withdraw its warships, escort ships, minesweepers, and hovercrafts from Khorramshahr and Abadan.
Woods: Did they withdraw them after 22 September?
Kabi: They withdrew them a few days before the war began. However, that withdrawal created a need for Iraq to find an alternative route to the Gulf. Umm Qasr is approximately 20-30 kilometers south of the port of Basra and leads directly into Khawr Abdullah. If we could have dredged a channel between Basra and Umm Qasr, we would not have been subject to Iranian attacks along the Shatt al-Arab. That would have attenuated a lot of problems.
Moreover, we could have used the water for cultivation because it was fresh water.
Woods: Was this an idea to provide Iraq an alternative to the Shatt al-Arab in the postwar period in case Iran and Iraq were to dispute the Shatt al-Arab again? If you think about the amount of investment, this would have been a worthwhile project, because it would have removed much of the tension between the two nations.
Kabi: As I told you, we had two landing ships, three anti-submarine ships, and missile boats.
We transferred the anti-submarine ships and the missile boats over land in huge trucks to Umm Qasr at the beginning of the war in 1980. The landing craft were too large to move.
Woods: Could the ships have been moved out of Basra earlier?
Kabi: The navy was not given warning that war was imminent. Our ships were still at Basra for maintenance and docking.
Woods: So because of the coordination we talked about earlier, you did not know the war was coming, and you certainly did not know that war was coming on the 22 September. Your ships were still in maintenance dry-dock in Basra and now were trapped.
The air force was informed, because the war began with a major air force attack, but they were only given three or four days notice, so their planning was pretty minimal. Are you saying that the navy was not informed at all?
The air force and the land forces were informed.
Murray: This story reflects the history of Iraq's military, which had been almost exclusively land-centered in its strategic focus, even though the lifeblood of Iraq's economy flows out by sea. Woods: What about naval operations from 1980 to 1988-do you think they are not well understood and should be emphasized in an English-language history of the war, from the military side, or from the professional naval officer side? What is important that we have not already talked about for professional naval officers to study and better understand? Iraq's fate was the consequence of his dictatorship, just like Hitler's and Mussolini's impact on their countries. He was the only decision-maker. There were only three men with whom Saddam discussed the attack on Kuwait: himself, Chemical Ali, and Hussein Kamel. 
25
25 Chemical Ali (Ali Hassan abd al-Majid al-Tikriti) was tried and found guilty of crimes against humanity for his involvement in the use of chemical weapons against Kurdish insurgents and civilians in Iraqi Kurdistan.
Abousi: I returned to the same place as the assistant to the director of training for the air force. I noticed that air force training efficiency was low in 1991. Moreover, aircraft were no longer well maintained.
Murray: Aircraft were not operationally ready?
Abousi: I wrote a report detailing the air force's below-average performance. As a result, Iraqi aircraft were not used for combat operations. The best aircraft had been flown to Iran during the Gulf War. 7
Woods: Could you describe for us what you thought the conditions of the air force were before the Iran-Iraq War; its role in the Iraqi military; and Saddam's attitude towards the air force? We learned from talking to army officers that their focus was on Israel, not on Iran. Was the situation the same for the air force?
Abousi: The air force was not at all prepared for the war with Iran. We did not even think we were going to fight the Iranians. In the period just prior to the war, immediately after Khomeini came to power, the Iranians started provoking Iraq. If we look at the air force in general, its capabilities were at least half those of the Iranian Air Force. We evaluated our air force in comparison to the Iranian Air Force: a correlation of forces. There were some mistakes in the original study, but I have corrected them in the new one. 
The equipment was hard on the pilot, like other World War II aircraft. When we flew against the Iranians at the beginning of the war, we suffered from these problems. For example, the maps we used for our sorties were necessarily large. But the cockpits of Soviet fighters were small and space was limited, which made flying and navigating at 10-to-15 meters above the ground extremely difficult. Before the war, we needed to establish a balance between the Iraqi and Iranian air forces, so we increased the tactical training our pilots received. We did this in extreme secrecy. Mohammed Jissam al-Jibouri was named the commander of the air force just before the start of the hostilities;
he was an excellent commander. Within the air force there were jokes made about the fact that they were bringing a new commander who would train the air force in a new way. None of pilots or the staff realized that this was in preparation for war with Iran.
Woods: When did al-Jibouri become the air force chief? What was he specifically working on to change and why? What was motivating him?
Abousi: Al-Jibouri became air force chief in 1979. He was a British Hunter pilot and trained in America. In addition, he was aggressive, courageous, and dedicated to the air force.
He attended training exercises regularly. On one occasion, he attended a training exercise brief at Hurriya Air Base and got personally involved. 9 He had lots of sessions with the pilots. He had a good relationship with the airmen.
In 1980, Saddam brought in a series of incompetent Ba'athist officers to lead the army. Did Saddam do the same thing with the air force?
Abousi: Not at all. The air force was mainly led by competent officers. Incompetent officers were not allowed to join the air force. Besides, General Adnan Khairallah was in control of the air force. We used to say that if Adnan had still been alive, Iraq would never have invaded Kuwait. Saddam listened to Adnan, but not to anyone else. When Adnan was killed, the army died too.  Woods: Forty-eight hours before the start of the war did you know this was a combat mission or did you still think it was a training mission?
Abousi: As a formation commander, I actually did not know. I thought to myself this might be real. But when nobody told us to stop, I knew it was the beginning of war. I was on the runway with some other pilots. We usually ran taxi exercises-turn on power, roll to a speed of 150, shut off engine, reduce RPMs, taxi back, and park. Nobody told us to stop and return to our parking spot, and the aircraft were soon airborne. We were at war.
Most Western accounts say that Iranian aircraft were parked in the open. Your earlier written account indicates that they were under shelters.
Abousi: I flew several sorties on 22 and 23 September. When we arrived over the Iranian bases, I was looking for aircraft on the ground but could not find anything. Shahrokhi
Air Base is large with three runways and many shelters, but there were no aircraft! 10
Woods: Who did the detailed planning-flight plans, location of refueling, communication plan-for the mission?
Abousi: Headquarters planned everything, but we suggested changes to parts of it, because their plan would expose our aircraft to Iranian defenses. The original flight plan took the planes over a large town with a lot of people and army personnel who could report our air raid. We recommended a change that diverted the flight path.
Were any changes made between the time you received the plan on 21 September and the morning of the mission on 22 September?
We learned of the plan on the 20 September. An officer named Haldoun was the base commander.
Woods: As a wing commander, were you made aware of the training plan on 20 September?
The plan for the air force was sent to us on 20 September. They told us to choose the pilots, but not tell them anything because the mission only involved training.
Woods: But you recommended changes to the plan not to fly over Iranian cities? Did they implement your changes to the plan?
Abousi: I made my suggestion to a base commander. He sent someone to Baghdad to notify the command of the changes. They approved it. The major difficulty we encountered was that the bomb load of the aircraft was small-only 1,000 kilograms (approximately 2,500 pounds). This limited amount could not cover the entire target, so our results were not sufficient to prevent the Iranians from striking back. On the first afternoon after our strike, the Iranians attacked al-Sha'iba Air Base and al-Kut. However, they could not fly missions after our second strike. Their engineering efforts were excellent. For instance, they were already repairing the runway by the time our second strike began. The Iranians 10 The Shahrokhi Air Base is located just outside of the Iranian city of Hamsadan.
had completed repairing the runway by the time we launched our second strike on the second day. They had a lot of aircraft prepped and ready for missions. I even hit one aircraft myself on the runway.
Murray: Did Iran attack with F-4s?
Abousi: Iran attacked with F-4s and F-5s. The F-4s carried a two-and-a-half-ton payload.
Even the F-5s could carry more [ordnance] than the Sukhois. Iran has plans to develop its own version of the F-5. They say they can build this aircraft, but it is an Iranianmodified American-developed aircraft. We do not believe anything Iran says.
Woods: Did the tactical training that General al-Jibouri began in 1979 include precision strikes against enemy airfields as a specific target? Did your crews practice hitting airfields?
Abousi: Yes, we were trained in striking runways, because our aircraft did not have electronic equipment that could detect or deal with missiles. Our mission success relied on visually identifying the target: a shelter, a runway, a taxiway, a tarmac. On the other hand, the Mirages had an electronic targeting system, but we did not yet have them in the squadrons. In the Sukhoi, the pilot flies the aircraft; in the Mirage, it is the other way around.
The pilot has nothing to do; it is all programmed and easy. We believed even the Americans could not have executed the strikes the Mirages carried out.
Murray: One of our sources suggests that part of the Iraqi difficulties in the early days was that Saddam was afraid of the air force participating in a coup, so he limited the lowlevel training of Iraqi aircraft. You seem to be suggesting the opposite.
Abousi: At the beginning of 1979, when Saddam came to power, General Khairallah was Saddam's advisor, and Saddam was not afraid of the air force. By the end of the war in 1989, Adnan Khairallah was dead and Saddam feared the air force. For example, when Saddam attended an air force show, he was very careful about the pilots who carried out the demonstration flying. The drop tanks were removed from the aircraft to prevent the pilots from dropping them as a bomb.
Woods: By 1988, the Mirages were carrying heavy drop tanks on them. In September 1980, did you have any special munitions for cratering runways, or were they just heavy iron bombs?
Abousi: We used drag bombing, especially for runways. They were not rocket bombs. They were regular bombs-called the Shah 500. However, the Iranians were good at repairing runways. It was harder for us to repair runway damage greater than 30 meters across.
The American-made M84 could create craters greater than 50 meters wide by 10 meters deep. 
11
Woods: Can you describe the morning of 23 September, when the Iranians struck your bases?
The Iranians struck Baghdad and many other targets on 23 September. I was at Hurriya Air Base in Kirkuk, but it was not struck that morning. Most bases were not struck on 23 September; Iran targeted industrial installations. We expected the air force headquarters in Baghdad to be struck, but by mistake the Iranian bombs hit another location-a grain silo or a non-vital target.
Woods: Did their target selection seem random or did the Iranians have a plan?
Abousi: They had a plan. When we captured prisoners on the 23 September, they had plans to strike all the Iraqi bases, but our strikes had surprised them and prevented their attack. If it had not been for this surprise, they would have destroyed Iraq's air force.
Murray: It strikes me that the Iranian strikes focused on Iraqi's command and control system?
Abousi: If you mean the headquarters, then yes.
Were any of the squadron and wing headquarters struck as well? 
In 1980, he was more reasonable; he listened to us when we met with him. Later he acted on his own. In 1996, we did a study assessing approaches to counter the US Air Force. General Ra'ad Hamdani was present when we presented our arguments. We indi-

Abousi: Many air clashes happened in the war's opening days. The skill level between the Iraqi and Iranian pilots was almost equal. The Iranians downed a small number of our aircraft over our territory; however, most of our downed aircraft resulted from their air defense operations and Hawk missiles. The Iranians are weak when it came to air-to-air combat.
Woods: Why do you think that was?
Abousi: The Iranian F-4 and F-5 aircraft clashed with our aircraft over our territory. They would intercept our aircraft; we tried to evade them. On 23 September, some F-5 aircraft were chasing several of our fighters. We dropped down to 10 meters above the ground;
we flew close to the hills, climbed the hills, and then came down on the other side. They would just ignore our strike formations, because they could not hit us. However, they were able to down some of our bombers, the Tu-22s, so we stopped flying them into Iran after 23 September.
Murray: How effective were the F-14s with the Phoenix missiles and Sidewinders?
14
Abousi: They are excellent aircraft, but the pilots were not very good and the maintenance was poor in the earlier days of the war. The situation changed after we received the Mirage, at which point the Iranian Air Force became much weaker than ours.
In American doctrine, before you do low-level strikes on an enemy airfield, you need to establish some degree of control over the airspace. In the initial plans of 22 September, did the strikes include air superiority aircraft to hold off Iranian fighters?
We had to achieve an element of surprise to guarantee the success of our strikes. We did not have any intelligence. We did not know anything about the Iranian air bases. We merely identified the location of Iranian air bases on a map. Fortunately, they were where we expected. Moreover, we did not know anything about the Iranian air defense system. If it were not for the courage of the pilots and the training they had received, the strikes would not have been successful. Formation commanders who had experience led the wings. We had experience from the northern war with the Peshmerga in 
1974
-75 and with Israel in 1967
and 1973. 15 . 15
In the fall of 1980, Saddam supposedly dispersed the air force to the airfields of Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates.
Abousi: No, that is not correct. Bandar-e Abbas Airport in Iran was far away. The 36th Squadron was supposed to fly Tu-22s out of Oman, but the runway there was too short. Because the Tu-22 requires a runway at least three kilometers long, we flew from Habaniya. We struck the Tehran Airport and nearby oil installations. This was two or three days before the start of the war. It was not supposed to be war, but a cooperation and partnership building exercise between the Iraqi Air Force and Omani Air Force.
In a book published in the United States, there was a discussion that after the Iranian counterstrikes in the fall of 1980, some Iraqi aircraft were dispersed to Jordan and Saudi Arabia in order to preserve the Iraqi Air Force.
Abousi: Not at all.
Woods: They all stayed in Iraq?
Abousi: A MiG-25 did make an emergency landing in the Emirates, a Mirage landed in Saudi Arabia, and Super-Frelon helicopters landed many times in Kuwait, but our aircraft were never dispersed to other countries.
After the initial strike, the air force knew Iraq was at war. Was there mobilization planning?
Abousi: The air force started to improve its level of performance throughout the first half of 1980. The close-air-support (CAS) was the main mission for the air force. Close air support, interdiction, reconnaissance, air defense also became missions of the air force. At the beginning, the army had many requests for CAS and as a result, we lost a number of our aircraft, because the level of training in the Iraqi air defenses was bad. They shot down 16 of our own aircraft. More often than not, they failed to recognize our aircraft.
Murray: Clearly Saddam must have been upset by the relative ease with which the Iranians were able to slip F-5s and F-4s into Iraq and attack targets, but the Israeli raid at Osirak in 1981 must have pointed out to him the inadequacies of the air defense system. 
16
The air defense fighters were not very good, but it was also good timing on the part of the Israelis. The Iraqi pilots were tired late in the afternoon, so they were allowed to sleep in the evenings. The Israelis took advantage of this. The strike took place at approximately 1900, just as our fighters were coming back from patrol missions. They had no threat, and the Israeli aircraft carried out their strike on the reactor. Saddam was extremely upset with the air force; the air defense commanders were blamed for their negligence. After that, Saddam asked for security measures to be increased around the reactor. For instance, the defenders of the reactor attached balloons on 300 meter long cables around the reactor. High tension wires were placed around the balloons to knock any attacking aircraft down. However, it was not an effective security measure. An aircraft with a long range weapon could still target the reactor.
Woods: Who took the blame?
The air defense deputy director of operations, Shakir Mahmoud, was the officer who took the blame for this failure.
We understand that the other weakness in the defense of the Osirak Reactor was that the ground air defense missile commander and his crew were on a supper break. This suggests outstanding intelligence by the Israelis.
The Israelis are known for their good intelligence. All of these weaknesses were taken into account in their plan.
Woods: It represents the kind of intelligence you needed on the 22 September.
The intelligence we had on Iran was extremely weak. That is why we relied on the courage of our pilots. The Iranian air defenses were strong. Each air base was like a ball of fire. We would lose one or two of our aircraft on every mission.
Woods: Can you describe the air support the Iraqi Air Force provided to the army? How did it coordinate that support? How effective was it? You have said already that the coordination for air defense was weak, but how did you receive your missions and coordinate the targets?
Abousi: The air force command comprised of officers from the air bases who used to be wing commanders or base commanders. We thought the close support missions were not that important. Artillery could be used, for instance. We assigned these missions to army aviation (helicopters).The requests or orders came from corps or division commanders, who
were not well-informed regarding the problems and the limitations of the air force. One day in early 1981, Saddam realized that our air losses were disproportionately higher than those of the Iranians. He stopped flights for approximately a month so the air force could reorganize. From then on, all requests for air cover went through air force com- Abousi: Iraq wanted to put an end to the war as early as 28 September 1980. Saddam gave a speech that night. We were ordered to stop all combat flights for three days. Iran took advantage of this period and bombed all our bases. Saddam waited approximately 24 hours; then we resumed military operations. When Saddam realized that Iran had refused to end the war, we focused on paralyzing the Iranian economy. Our most important targets were the oil reserves and refineries. We controlled the air and sea. We targeted aircraft carrying supplies and ammunition from Israel to Iran. We defined a zone in the Persian Gulf area, where we targeted every Iranian ship. The navy's capabilities were limited, so it made a lot of demands on the air force. When we could not keep up with their demands, they accused us of refusing fulfill the mission. General al-Kabi, when he was navy force commander, he and I had a feud, because he continued the same demands as the navy forces.
Woods: This is a little like the story you told us about cooperation with the Iraqi Army.
We stopped filling the requests, because they were always telling the high command they had such great capabilities. They always said they had the same capability as the air force as far as aircraft and could meet the demand. After that, we started planning for the navy. The navy would alert us when an Iranian ship was approaching the range of our aircraft. Iraqi intelligence intercepted the message traffic of international companies and knew ship movements as tankers approached. Gulf countries also helped us regarding ships along the Iranian coast. In the latter half of the war, the Americans also started helping us. We used to inform them when we were launching strikes in the Gulf, especially after the Stark was hit. 
18
18 According to most public accounts, the Stark was hit by an Exocet fired from an Iraqi F-1 Mirage. The fact that Iraq had secretly modified a small transport aircraft, the French Falcon-50, to serve in an anti-shipping role was no doubt a state secret and may explain why the pilot was never made available for interview to the US Government team investigating the USS Stark incident. See also Frank Francona, Ally to Adversary: An Eyewitness Account of Iraq's Fall from Grace (Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 1999), 35.
Woods: Prior to this, had the Iraqi Air Force ever considered anti-shipping missions? Had it practiced, or thought about attacking ships in the Gulf?
Abousi: No, we had no training for this, so we began with significant losses.
Woods: What did your pilots think when you gave them their first missions?
Abousi: The missions were difficult because we were flying Soviet aircraft. The C5K Rocket was not effective against ships. 
19
They would not shoot the missiles down directly.
Murray: They were using chaff dispensers like the British did in the Falklands.
Woods: And they put reflectors on boats to give the Exocets mixed signals.
Abousi: Those near the ports and along the Iranian coast. The Mirage could go much farther.
We would locate and intercept ships at great distances. The only air defense the ships had were F-14s. This affected air force operations.
Woods: Especially in the Strait of Hormuz.
Abousi: Exactly. F-14s were there in the Bushehr area [in Iran] because of the reactor. At the beginning of war, there were no F-14s in the Bushehr area; they were protecting Tehran.
The anti-ship issue was such a complicated issue. We lost a lot of pilots, as I recall approximately ten, in the Gulf. Woods: How many F-14s did you shoot down with the Mirages (using C-530s)?
Abousi: Approximately two F-14 aircraft and maybe twenty-one Sukhois.
Woods: Did you ever lose any Mirages?
Abousi: We lost one Super Etendard. 
21
No, not at all. There are two types of Mirage. The Mirage AQ5 carried the Exocet. 22
The targeting system in the cockpit is designed specifically for the Exocet. The cockpit for the ground attack and refueling version is the Mirage AQ6; it is general purpose aircraft.

force had formed the Mirage and MiG-25 squadrons by the end of 1981. This gave our air defense a longer reach. This really helped to improve our air defenses. The organic field air defense inside the divisions and corps had limited weapons and SA-6s. 
26
27
28
Woods: Was the Falcon 50 flying a normal raid by itself?
Abousi: We only had one of these aircraft. It made many trips. We modified this aircraft, so it could reach Larak Island without requiring refueling by the Mirages.
Woods: When did you first hear that Iraqi forces had hit an American ship?
Abousi: I do not recall the date when I first heard that.
Woods: I am trying to see if there was a major reaction in Iraq to this event, or if it was just an accident of war that happens?
Abousi: It was a mistake. After the incident, the Americans spoke with Saddam and the military command and reviewed our plans regarding the zone and the pilot's report. Saddam apologized to President Ronald Reagan and honored the families of those who were injured. The Americans understood that it was a mistake. A considerable amount of money was given to the families of sailors who had died, I believe.
Woods: One of the intriguing things about this incident is that the American delegation asked to see the pilot but was never allowed to talk to him.
Abousi: They were afraid for the pilot. Frankly, I do not know the pilot, because he was not a Mirage pilot; he was a transport pilot.
Woods: I am also interested in the long-range strikes against infrastructure targets in Tehran.
Tehran is such a large city. How were those planned, and how did you get better targeting information?
Abousi: Every command had a complete map of Iran with the targets. When we learned about a target in a given area, we would first identify it on a map, then brief the pilot and give him a full picture.
Woods: So planning was done at the squadron level?
Abousi: Yes. We used to have an operations room at the base where briefings would take place. Each squadron had an operations room, as well. The tactical issues would be dealt ing in France. No foreign pilots participated in our combat missions. Pilots from many countries participated in our training-India, Egypt, Pakistan, and Czechoslovakia. The command of the air force college was a foreigner; the college included many Egyptians.
Adnan Khairallah had an excellent relationship with Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak and his minister of defense, Abd al-Halim Abu Ghazala. This is the Ghazala by the way who wrote a book about the Iran-Iraq War, but most of what he wrote was inaccurate.
He wrote a slanted history, which favored Iran.
Murray: Between 1980 and 1988, the Iraqi Air Force underwent a major expansion, both in numbers and technological complexity. What were the processes of training, not just of the pilots, but also of the maintenance crews, electronics crews, electronic counter measures (ECM) crews, radar crews, and ground control? Were they trained in Iraq or foreign countries, or some combination?
The air force expanded from 30 squadrons to 50 squadrons. From the tactical side, the methods of usage changed and improved during the war. A flight leader school training was developed. This helped the pilots' attending this school. At the combat level, we started flying inside Iran and we achieved air superiority after 1985 because our electronics were so advanced. We installed detection and warning equipment and the aircraft carried anti-radar missiles.
Murray: These were French missiles?
Abousi: Yes, the aircraft carried Bazaal and X-28 Radiation missiles.
32
Murray: Did you have much trouble transitioning pilots from the relatively simple Soviet aircraft to the more complex electronics of the Mirage?
Abousi: All Sukhoi pilots were good pilots. However, the Mirage required more than just a good pilot; the pilot needed to be more intelligent.
Murray: Did some of the pilots fail the transition?
Abousi: When they graduated from the flight school, the best pilots were assigned to fly the Mirage. We reassigned all the Tu pilots to the bombers, because the original bomber pilots were not good. At the beginning of the war, a bomber pilot was executed, refused to fly a mission. Murray: What kind of Iraqi aircraft was shot down?
Abousi: They shot down a Sukhoi-22. After the fall of the shah, many of the experienced Iranian pilots fled; only the novice pilots remained. We learned this from Iranian prisoners during their interrogations. The Iranian Air Force was divided into two parts: the main air force and the al-Haras al-Thawri al-Irani. 
33
34
Woods: Were you aware of foreign trainers in Iran helping the Iranians during the war?
Abousi: I do not think so. Iran did not have good relations with the rest of the world before or during the war. Only after the war did Soviet and Chinese pilots assist them.
Woods: I read a report that there was some concern that Iranian aircraft were operating from Syrian airfields. Did that ever happen, or was that just a false report?
Abousi: That did not happen. Iraq had a good relationship with Syria. In fact, one time an Iranian Phantom F-4 formation flew through Syrian airspace to strike al-Walid Air Base. 
35
Murray: You mentioned that the Iraqi Air Force was intercepting and attempting to shoot down transport aircraft from Israel to Iran. Did the air force actually shoot any such aircraft down?
Abousi: Yes, we shot one Iranian C-130 down using a MiG-25. 
36
Were the Iraqi air force pilots captured by Iran repatriated?
Abousi: They were returned in batches, in 1989, 1990, and 1991. Not all of the pilots returned.
For example, Talal Jamil, who flew Sukhoi-22 aircraft, defected to Iran in 1982. He was a coward and a poor pilot. He would get nervous and sweat when briefed on a mission.
The questions we have ask come from our limited understanding. Our questions may not do service to the nature of your story. Could you tell us anything you think is important that we have not asked about yet?
The most important thing to note is that the air force developed in a way that was not expected at the time. Western nations, especially Israel, started looking at us differently than they had in the past. They started taking Saddam's threats towards Israel seriously.
The Iraqi Air Force was on par with the Israeli Air Force. For that reason, when Israel threatened to bomb Iraqi oil installations, there were fears that Iraq might attack Israel because Iraq immediately mobilized its air force. Israel did not honor the threat and carry out the attack. In return, Iraq cancelled its plans to bomb Israel.
Woods: When was that?
transmissions. 39 AWACS called them regarding the two Iraqi aircraft, but the CAP was not listening to the transmission. The aircraft went right past the CAPs. A Saudi F-15 pilot, who heard the AWACS transmission, shot down the Iraqi aircraft. 40
We thought the American aircraft were saying, 'Why are you letting them fly? Shoot them down when they are over the sea.' The Americans swarmed the airfield on the first two days that we tried to launch. We felt like every time we tried to fly we were swarmed. A successful take off on the third day was very surprising. We did not understand why we were being allowed to do this when the earlier missions were stopped.
Woods: When did al-Duri speak to the Iranians about this?
Abousi: Two days before the war. The pilots did not receive any assistance. The conditions were so poor that many of them landed in the streets.
Were the pilots returned immediately or held until the end of the war?
Abousi: They were returned one week later, after the Iranians had interrogated them. We lost approximately 10 aircraft in this mission. Some were hit by American aircraft, while others crashed.
Murray: Initially, the American aircraft thought the Iraqi aircraft were heading south to attack. The Americans were not prepared for when they turned east. It surprised them. 39 AWACS is an airborne early warning and control system based on radar.

On 17 January 1984, several commanders of the Republican Guard, including myself, met with Saddam: Adnan Khairallah, General Hamed Fathi, and a military counselor to Saddam. We were there to review Republican Guard capabilities. At the time, I was in charge of fielding the new T-72 tanks. Saddam changed the subject from readiness and started to talk about luck and coincidence in war. He asked if it were possible to make luck and coincidence a ‗principle of war.' Most of the attendees nodded in agreement, suggesting that it was possible. I interrupted to say that it was impossible for luck and coincidence to become a principle of war. The way Saddam paid attention to me noticeably caught Khairallah's attention. Saddam asked, ‗Why?' I immediately felt my blood pressure rise to 150 even though I knew I was right. I noticed Khairallah sink in his seat and Hussein Kamel adjust his position as he stood behind Khairallah; their body language to me said ‗Be careful.' Saddam asked, ‗Why not?' I told him principles tend to be sensible and have the power to remain steady and in place, while luck and coincidences were metaphysical concepts. If we think of luck and coincidence, we cannot differentiate between the two of them. I gave Saddam a number of examples. Saddam had a stern look on his face. I was saved when Saddam had to leave the room to take a phone On 11 September 1994, Saddam asked me what my problem was, and why I always seemed to oppose him. He said that he had no more patience with me. I could not say that my problem was him, so I told him, ‗We have a civilization problem.' He asked what I meant. I told him Iraq's leaders were looking at war in terms of tribal philosophy. I said, ‗War is larger in scope. The conflict is more than a tribal one; it is between civilizations.' I knew that he was convinced after the reasons I gave him. Saddam then sent me back to my division, saying he had another decision to make. I was later told that Saddam was considering sending me to prison, but he then changed his mind. This was rare. My colleagues told me I was lucky.

Saddam blamed King Hussein of Jordan for Hussein Kamel's defection because he believed the King convinced Hussein Kamel to flee. One of Saddam's escorts told me of an incident that happened in a small meeting of Saddam with Ali Hassan al-Majid, Izzat al-Duri, and two others. Suddenly Saddam changed the subject and the atmosphere. He banged the table hard and said, ‗I will never forget this of King Abdullah Hussein of Jordan!' Everyone was scared of his temper. When he banged the table, everybody left the room. His temper was dangerous. In a split second, he could jump from one temperament to another.

tion. They held out for three days. I listened until the commander was captured on 19 February. I never knew his name, because I was only receiving a wireless signal, but I sympathized with him and wished I could have done something. This same scenario played out earlier in 1984 when the 1st Regiment of the 419th Brigade was pinned down in the Badrah region east of al-Kut. The regiment commander kept fighting. It is difficult to hear someone ask for help when there is nothing one can do. The battle at Fao continued until the end of 1986. The entire army engaged in the battle, but sporadically, at one point or another. A group would take over a sector, be destroyed, and then be replaced. The battle see-sawed back and forth: our troops would advance and then the next time Iranian troops would advance. Gains were never more than 100 meters at a time. The battle was similar to the [World War I] Battles of Somme and Verdun in 1916. Woods: After the Iranians established control at Fao, were there indications they would use it as a launching point for offensives into Umm Qasr or Basra? Or did they intend to just hold it? Woods: How did Saddam react to this intelligence failure? Hamdani:

during the US occupation of Iraq. After Abdul Aziz's death in 2009, his son Ammar al-Hakim became SCIRI's new leader, and SCIRI was renamed Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq (ISCI) to better fit the new politics of Iraq.
We do not deserve what happened to us in Iraq. The Iranians should have suffered this tragedy because they were more of a threat to the region that Saddam. Saddam's biggest mistake was invading Kuwait-he had no ambitions in other countries-whereas Iran desired the entire Middle East region for itself. If you ask me today whether I prefer relations with an Islamic Iran or Israel, I would choose Israel, because I do not believe Israel has ambitions outside its own borders. There is no Israeli threat in the Middle East. The threat comes from Iran. I tell my friends, who were commanders in the army, that, if matters required us now to go to Tel Aviv, we should go to Tel Aviv, but I am not waiting to go to Tehran and shake hands with the

: What was your impression in 1980 of US technology versus Russian technology in terms of aircraft? Abousi: 8 Murray: 7 Battles: Saddam Hussein's Strategic Plan for the Persian Gulf War, Official US Joint Forces Command Report (Annapolis: Naval Institute Press, 2008), 192-93, 94, 280.
Murray: Saddam's attitude in 1980 was that people like Tala al-Duri could be good division commanders, because they were good Ba'athists.
Interviews done to support this monograph were conducted from 4-14 November 2009.
General Kabi served in the Iraqi Navy throughout his career, but that organization used army ranks for its officers.
Not exactly Saddam's view of the world. The dictator had reissued a book written by his uncle entitled, Three Whom God Should Not Have Created: Persians, Jews, and Flies.
There may have been no representative from the air force either, but the interviewees were uncertain as to that aspect of the meeting.
Only the Austro-Hungarian Army's invasion of Russian-occupied Poland in August-September 1914 appears to have been as poorly planned and executed.
The chance to win the Arab tribes in southern Iran died a quick death when Major General al-Duri, one of Saddam's favorites and among the most incompetent of the Ba'ath generals according to the some of the interviewees, began executing local Arab tribesmen for their lack of enthusiasm for Ba'ath rule. Word of his actions spread throughout Arabistan and insured that the tribes became hostile to the occupying Iraqi forces.
The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), also known as the Pasdaran, is one of Iran's two major irregular light infantry forces. Its structure parallels that of the regular armed forces and comprises ground, naval, and aviation forces. It was originally created to counter support for the shah at the time of the Revolution.
The latter never fully recovered during the course of the war. Simply put, their army could not spare outstanding officers and non-comissioned officers to rebuild the special forces given the heavy casualties the Iraqis suffered throughout the conflict.
In fact, General Abousi, the Iraqi Air Force general interviewed, seemed unaware of most naval activities in the Gulf despite the extensive role the Iraqi Air Force was to play in the tanker conflict, which began in earnest in February 1984. Saddam saw attacks on international shipping in the Gulf as a way to shift the war away from a battlefield stalemate and put economic pressure on the Iranian regime.
This is confirmed directly by an Iraqi military estimate from July 1980 as well as a number of other intelligence documents from that period. For a commentary on the July 1980 Iraqi intelligence estimate, see Kevin M. Woods, Mark E. Stout, "Research Note: New Sources for the Study of Iraqi Intelligence During the Saddam Era," Intelligence and National Security 25, no. 5 (2010).
One is reminded of the appallingly bad logistical and intelligence planning by the Wehrmacht's senior leadership in operation Barbarossa, the invasion of the Soviet Union, which led to military disaster in front of Moscow.
The similarities between Saddam and Stalin are striking; it is not surprising that Saddam chose the Soviet dictator as his model.

In 2006, Hamdani published a memoir of his experience as an Iraqi soldier. Ra'adHamdani, Before History  Left Us (Arab Scientific Publishers, 2006), (Arabic).
The battle of Muhamarra is best known as the battle ofKhorramshahr (22 September-10 November 1980).
The Battle of Montenotte was fought during the first French Revolutionary Wars (1792-97) near the village of Cairo Montenotte in northwestern Italy; General Jean Pierre Beaulieu de Marconnay (1725-1819).
After the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime, Izzat al-Duri and numerous other senior Ba'ath officials fled to Syria. After Saddam's execution in 2006, it was reported that Izzat al-Duri was -elected‖ leader of Iraqi's exile Ba'ath Party.
Referring to Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery of Alamein, "The Memoirs of Field Marshal the Viscount Montgomery of Almein, K.G.,"(New York: Collins, 1958).
The American M-60 series of tanks was a second-generation main battle tank, first introduced in the early 1960s. Sources vary, but in 1980, Iran possessed approximately 780 British Chieftain tanks and 460 M-60 tanks. Iran also possessed 400 older American-made M-47 and M-48 tanks.

The history of what occurred at Halabjah (as well as the larger Anfal Campaign) remains controversial both inside and outside of Iraq. While Hamdani was not directly involved in either operation, he presents here what is most likely the general view of his peers. For alternative views of these events, especially on the controversial issue of civilian casualties, see Joost R. Hilterman, A Poisonous Affair: America, Iraq, and the Gassing of Halabja (New York: Cambridge University Press, 2007); Stephen Pelletier, "A War Crime or an Act of War?," New York Times, 21 January 2003; Human Rights Watch Middle East, Iraq's Crime of Genocide: The Anfal Campaign against the Kurds (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1995); Jennifer Trahan, "A Critical Guide to the Iraqi High Tribunal's Anfal Judgement: Genocide against the Kurds," Michigan Journal ofInternational Law 20, no. 2 (2009).
Nizar al-Kharzraji was the Iraqi Army chief of staff. He defected in 1996 and became associated with various Iraqi ex-patriot movements through the fall of the regime.
Hamdani appears  to indicate that the Iraqi intelligence officers were dispatched to support a counter-coup in Chad. On 19 July 1971, a communist-backed military group ousted President Gaafar Nimeiry. Nimeiry was restored to power on 22 July with the assistance of several Arab states including Egypt and Libya.

Project 1946: Phase II
Woods: What was the reaction of the senior officers when they were told on 6 July they would be attacking a country three times Iraq's size?
The corps and division commanders were convinced that war was inevitable, because Iran's continuous attacks were threatening Iraq's security, but they disagreed with the plan. For national considerations, not political, we were hoping that we could stop or deter this attack. These were our feelings.
Were there any other special preparations for this rather large operation?
Hamdani: The entire country started to get ready for the war.
Were there any staff officers or commanders who verbalized their dismay over the plan?
Hamdani: The dissent did not last for long after the political decision had been made.
Once the decision was made, none of the military officers were going to tell Saddam that Iraq did not have the appropriate military means to execute his plan. Is that correct?
Hamdani: That issue was raised on 6 July. Saddam said, ‗The announced and unannounced reserves are the people. It is not the responsibility of you, the officials.'
Were there any senior officers or planners who said that Iraq needs to do certain things beyond this plan to ensure military security?
Hamdani: Shanshal and the planning committee led by al-Asadi were in charge and took responsibility for political security. The training directorate from the minister of defense took the plan and assigned training tasks that all of the units worked on from July through September. We fulfilled all necessary quotas, equipment, and supply requests and started the final preparations for war.
The end result of this was that the army entered Iran and ended up in indefensible tactical positions with no possibility of coordination between the different units. They were just stuck out there in Iran.
Hamdani: You are correct. These initial indefensible positions extended the war. Only some of the armored troops achieved their objectives. For instance, Ahvaz is a big city and required an infantry corps to take it, but, we lacked sufficient infantry, so the armored troops simply moved into the desert area and the empty areas, but not into the city. The armored troops remained in front, but should have been in the rear, behind the infantry, which could infiltrate enemy lines at night. Our army was not sufficiently large to cover Woods: Do you remember the specific event when the journalist revealed that Iraq was listening to Iranian radio transmissions?
Tarfa: It was early in the war. Saddam had consulted with a Shi'a journalist from Najaf province. He was close to the president and worked in his office. He read my intelligence reports on the Iranians and tried to publish a story about the suffering of the Iranian soldiers based on signals intelligence. He did this with Saddam's knowledge. No one could do anything unless Saddam knew about it. We considered that story a major mistake.
Saddam was arrogant; he wanted to parade Iranian losses inflicted by Iraqi forces for the entire world to see. However, the story created major problems for military intelligence, because almost immediately the Iranians began to send their radio transmissions in code.
Saddam was ignorant about military intelligence matters.
Murray: Did Saddam's understanding of intelligence improve during the course of the war?
Tarfa: By 1985, Saddam began to understand how essential information security was. We used to mention in our reports specifically who or what our sources were. At one point, Saddam wrote a comment at the bottom of a report requesting that we not disclose our sources. He did not mean from himself per se, but rather the others in his office. Eventually he told us not to type the reports. He knew we could not type and that we had to give them to the commissioned officers to type. Saddam specified that intelligence reports had to be handwritten by the intelligence officer himself.
Woods: How did you handle open source information? Did you set up a separate organization for information gleaned from radio, TV, Friday prayers, public statements from Khomeini, etc.?
Tarfa: Arab Iranians from Ahvaz city started fleeing from Khorramshahr and Abadan in 1982. Kurds from the Democratic Kurdistan Party of Iran, especially the followers of ‗Abd-al-Rahman Qasemlo, also started fleeing. They both started cooperating with us.
Qasemlo was killed by Iranian intelligence in Europe, because he was cooperating with us.

We also sent the minister of defense, Adnan Kharaillah, to northern Iraq to visit troops and all the commanders. The commanders were in the south preparing their troops by the time his visit was aired on television.
When the Republican Guard attacked Fao, Iranian troops were caught totally by surprise.
We appeared to be in a defensive posture, but we attacked them because they did not know our troop numbers or our intention to liberate Fao.
Section 8: Senior Leadership  SIGINT  Foreign Assistance  Attitudes toward Iran
Woods: Could you help us understand and appreciate some of the senior members of the Iraqi intelligence service during this period? What kind of relationships did they have with the president? Who did well and who did not?
Tarfa: The best officer in military intelligence at the director level was General Sabar al-Duri.
He was trusted by Saddam. That is why when the Iran-Iraq War ended he was appointed director of the intelligence service. Saddam appointed General al-Samarra'i as the director of military intelligence to honor him for his service during the war.  (1981-84) and then deputy and finally director of the ministry of defense's directorate of combat development (1984-88). In 1988, he became the president of the Bakr University for Higher Military Studies and retired from the Iraqi Army in 1989.
Section 9: Personal Background  Saddam's Personality  Senior Leadership  Events Leading to Iran-Iraq War  Preparations for Iran-Iraq War Woods: Could you please start by providing us with your background? Makki: I was trained in the West, but spent my career in the Iraqi military. I was not a Ba'athist. I don't believe in mixing politics with the military. My father was minister of defense during the old regime, the monarchy, and before that he was chief of staff of the army. I entered the military voluntarily, for love of the military life and my country. When I started, Iraq was a small flower opening up. We had good relations with everyone.
1
Referred to during the transcripts as Makki.
Murray: So Saddam was executing corps and division commanders. If the signal from the president was that you would be executed for a wrong decision, the solution was to make no decision.
We became more afraid of the commanders than the enemy.
Woods: Did you and your peers discuss the impact of Shanshal's approach?
Makki: We discussed it among ourselves, at least among those who had been educated in the West like myself.
Woods: So you knew things were going to get worse?
Makki: We knew it was going to get worse. This practice of committee-based decisions caused us to lose the Fao Peninsula in 1986. Everyone, especially Major General al-Khazraji, told the leadership the enemy would attack at Fao rather than Basra or al-Amara. The problem was that committees took too long to make decisions; we had lost Fao by the time it decided to act. Mountain Division at the time. Saddam was not at the meeting, but the minister of defense, General Adnan Khairallah, General Shanshal, and the deputy chief of staff for operations, Lieutenant General Jabar al-Sadih were in attendance. A question was raised at that conference about the army's preparedness for war. Everyone was thinking about Iran, its post-1979 threat, and defending against the Iranians. Everyone was anxious about the possibility of war. General al-Khazraji argued that the political situation made him think we would go to war, but that we would require two years to prepare and train.
One year would be required to bring the troops up to the standards demanded of conventional war. A year would be needed to reorganize the army and raise the standards of discipline. In year two, we could focus on training, resupplying, and armaments. Makki: Yes. But after me, they were never able to find another director for the CDD. They brought in four or five different officers who could not handle the job, so it was rolled into the directorate of training. I was responsible for military doctrine. When I came to the directorate, it was chaos. I found formal military manuals from Russia, America, and Egypt. There were contradictions among them. The officers in the CDD could not reconcile the differences. The first thing I did was publish a manual describing our military doctrine. All other manuals were then written in harmony with this main pamphlet. I collected concepts from many armies, but we learned toward following American doctrine because we found it to be logical, detailed, and easy to apply.
Were you aware of the major doctrinal arguments going on in the United States?
Makki: Yes, we were. In 1985 or 1986, I published a manual called Application of Force and gave it the number ‗one' because the army's manuals were numbered officially. They were all signed by the chief of staff himself. It was not a small manual, because the army's leaders wanted to put everything into it.
Makki: I do not know. He was told, ‗You are now army chief of staff.' He did not have any military clothes. He went to Baghdad, and they promoted him from major general to four-star general and sent him to the front immediately. He asked for help from people he knew, like me. I was in the CDD at the time. Aziz sent for me and the directors of training and transport. He asked us for a situation report. We told him that the situation was delicate. The war was grinding to a standstill. They were bringing brigades from the north, which had only done patrol work and counterinsurgency in the mountains for the last several years to fight in the south. Before reaching the front line, entire brigades would disappear because of the mortar fire and machine gun fire. We lost a lot of soldiers in these battles.
Woods: So General Aziz was showing up in the midst of this. How long had Aziz been retired when he was named army chief of staff?
Makki: Aziz had been retired since 1978 or 1979. He was trying to figure out what he could do to turn things around. We suggested that he train reinforcements for at least one week, examine the army's weaponry to ensure they were not rusting. Thus, we started to train the brigades and reinforcements to the southern sector for one week: Day 1 was inspection of arms, Day 2 was checking equipment, Day 3 was training on offense and attack, Day 4 was live fire; and on Day 5, we sent them into battle. This was how it was until the great battle ground itself to a halt.
Basra was about to be lost when Aziz arrived. Aziz was placed on the retirement list about three months after the battle. The deputy chief of staff for operations, Sabit Sultan, was demoted to his old rank of brigadier general and made a brigade commander. Can you imagine such management of armed forces?
Murray: Saddam was obviously annoyed.
Makki: And this man was his relative.
Murray: After the Jasim battles, the retirement of Aziz, and the demotion of Sultan, Saddam turned to al-Khazraji. How did Saddam know al-Khazraji was any good?
Makki: He knew him.  Woods: Were the Soviets still providing the majority of technical and logistical support for the boats at this time? Kabi: Yes, but they stopped when the war began.
In September 1980, when military operations began, it appeared that Iraq's military planning was somewhat inadequate. Was any real attention given to the use of the navy in terms of early operations? Kabi: At the beginning of the war, high command considered the navy to be the weakest link in the armed forces. Most early missions assigned to the navy were defensive in nature.
The Iraqi Navy appeared to be involved in the defense of installations, the surveillance of enemy naval activity, and the prevention of enemy landings on Iraqi shores.
That was all the navy did. We were restricted to simple tasks. However, during the war, operations developed in line with needs. The high command did not expect the navy to take such an active role in the war.
Woods: Well, they were all army officers, so they probably had no concept of naval operations.
Kabi: There was a lack of understanding concerning naval affairs within the high command. I am speaking in particular about the general chief of staff and his assistants. They had no idea, and they had no desire to learn.
Woods: But Iraq did not have a large naval culture, as you said?
Kabi: Iraqis have no naval culture.
Murray: Given that senior military leaders had no sense of the navy and did not want to learn about it, could the same have been said about Saddam?
Kabi: Saddam was clever. He became interested in the navy after he saw what the navy was doing. I was among the leaders in the high command of the general armed forces. Saddam eventually discovered what the navy could do. The navy was self-contained; it was almost a separate military off by itself. Nobody interfered in its affairs. The navy solved its own problems, planned its own operations, and implemented them on its own.
From early 1979 until the war broke out in 1980, did this period of Iranian provocation include provocations at sea? Were the Iranian's being aggressive towards the Iraqi Navy?
Kabi: There were clashes on the land border. At sea there was tension, but no firing.
Kabi: Radar detection is limited by the height of the target, the size of the target, and overall distance between targeting system and target. Between March and September, the range will be doubled in the Gulf. I do not know what phenomenon governs that specification.
The curvature of the ground in the Gulf is less than in other places, which also expands radar range.
Murray: You said the Iraqi missile boats trained to a high degree. Were the Iranian missile boats training as well during this period? Or were they experiencing a similar degeneration and collapse that the Iranian Army experienced due to Khomeini?
Kabi: The Iranian Navy did not suffer from the revolution. The regime purged the leading generals from the army, but most of the naval officers remained.
Murray: Were they training in a fashion similar to your efforts in the period before the war?
Kabi: Yes, of course. We did many exercises during this period.
Woods: How about cooperation with the other Gulf States? Were you training in cooperation with Kuwait or any other countries during this period?
Kabi: Not at all. No one helped us.
Woods: Why do you suppose there was no cooperation during this period?
Kabi: The Kuwaitis did not want to interfere or involve themselves with Iran. They were afraid of Iran. They thought that Iran could overrun Iraq easily.
If you want to continue on with your monograph we'll use that as the outline, as you suggested.
Kabi: Here is a comparison of forces, from an armament point of view. The range of the Harpoon missile was approximately 90 kilometers, whereas the range of P-15 (SS-N-2 Styx), our Russian missile, was approximately 40 kilometers.
Were the electronics on the Russian missile inferior to the electronics on the Harpoon?
Kabi: Our missiles were inferior in range and technology, but the Soviet warhead was larger than those on the Harpoons. The ranges of the missiles were different. The guns onboard the ships were also different. The maximum caliber of the guns on Iraq's missile boats was 30mm, whereas the enemy boats had a 76mm aft gun, and 40mm rear gun. So from a gun aircraft hit our own merchant ships. Moreover, there was no coordination between the navy and the port administration at the beginning of the war.
Murray: When did the navy start acquiring French-built Exocet missiles for its helicopters?
Kabi: In the late 1970s, perhaps 1978. France supplied them during the war.
Murray: But without air cover, you did not want to fly your helicopters in the daytime, and at nighttime they were dangerous to everybody, including your own ships.
Kabi: Occasionally we had to sink a boat in order to supply the [oil pipeline] terminals. We placed one battalion of marines armed with 57mm guns and small caliber machine guns on each terminal. Their task was to protect the terminal from Iranian attack. Khor al-Amaya was situated 20 miles offshore. 
11
The Iraqi Navy placed a Silkworm missile battery on the tip of Fao Peninsula. When did you start using them?
Kabi: We started using the Silkworm in 1983.
Murray: What kind of intelligence did you have?
Kabi: We relied on three long-range detection radar stations, which could reach out more than 100 kilometers. In 1985, we put a radar station on one of the terminals. Starting in 1983, we added a radar station with Silkworm missiles. We had another in Umm Qasr so we could monitor the entire northern portion of the Gulf.
Covering the northern part of the Gulf was only one of your three defensive missions.
Operating within 100 kilometers of Fao allowed you to do that, but did not help you do anything farther down in the Gulf.
We launched an operation to Bushehr with missile boats. We sank approximately 20 tankers, using the helicopter, mostly after 1983. Murray: Before we get to the second stage, could you describe the navy's involvement in the siege at Abadan? We know Iraqi land forces had cut off the Iranian garrison in Abadan from the land routes, and the Iranians had to supply their troops by sea.
We stationed two landing ships in the port at Basra. Each ship had two Katyusha rocket launchers mounted on it to support army troops on land. 
13
Woods: When did you modify the landing craft with Katyusha rocket launchers-before or after the war started?
Kabi: We adapted the ships at the beginning of the war, when Iraqi forces invaded Khorramshahr. The army asked us to provide artillery support. We said it was possible, but could use the ships only at night.
The second stage, from 21 November 1982 through 8 February 1986, represented an offensive stage. We attacked the Iranian ships near Kharg, Bushehr, and the southern part of Kharg, using our missile boats and Katyusha rocket launchers.

failed and was not sending fuel to the engine. After repairing the boat, Ali turned back and two other two boats carried out the mission. They fired six missiles and sank five ships.
Woods: There were commercial activities in this area. Which ships were targeted?
Kabi: We targeted one Indian tanker, two Greek merchant ships, one Iranian merchant ship, and an Iranian yacht.
From what range were the missiles fired? You said you had modified them.
We fired from a distance of 35 kilometers. We gradually increased the size of our operations. We attacked all the oil fields in the Bushehr area. During this second stage of our mission, the navy completed 178 attack operations and sank 102 tankers and 145 merchant ships.
Woods: What was Saddam's reaction?
Kabi: He decorated me.
Woods: You had shown the value of the navy, and he wanted more.
Murray: Why do you think you were appointed the head of the navy?
Kabi: I was introduced to Saddam by the previous navy commander, Aladdin Hammad al-Janabi. He had served most of his career in the army, but was assigned to the navy in 1979. During the discussion, al-Janabi told Saddam that I had potential; that is when I got my post. I was commanding a brigade at that time, but I wanted to be director of operations. Al-Janabi made me director of training. About two or three months after the war started, he made me director of operations. After that, al-Janabi introduced me to Saddam, and we discussed theories about the usefulness of passive and active floating mines. I had no idea I would become a commander, but I became commander two or three weeks later.
Tell me more about the shipping attacks during the period from 1982 to 1986.
We attacked the east and west jetties on Kharg by helicopters four times. We succeeded in cutting the flow of convoys through the Khomeini and Mashahr ports to the northern portions of the Gulf.
Woods: When do you think your operations began to succeed in preventing significant tanker and merchant shipping in the northern part of the Gulf?
Woods: Were the alternative channels non-navigable?
Kabi: It was not very navigable, and it belonged to Kuwait. Kuwait would not let us use this channel. The Iranians protected the channel with small boats armed with heavy machine guns and anti-tank armament. They made two or three lines to prevent our boats from passing. Before we could even attempt our missions, we had to fight our way into the Gulf.
Woods: These are like army ‗screen lines.' You had to fight through them to get out of Umm
Qasr before you could go on your operations.
Kabi: It was difficult to do. Moreover, during this period, the enemy attacked and seized the northern terminal of Khor al-Amaya. We still held the southern terminal. Nevertheless, the Iranians held the northern terminal for only 48 hours before we were able to recapture it.
The Iranian screen lines were comprised of small boats or skiffs armed with RPGs [rocket-propelled grenades] and machine guns. Correct? Did you develop any particular tactics to break through?
We just fought our way out. We had no choice but to go through. 
We were able to withdraw the Silkworm post to Umm Qasr. It still covered part of the original area, though the range was reduced.
From the description of some of the army commanders, the Fao campaign caught the high command by surprise. How did you anticipate it, and how did you get the Silkworms out?
Kabi: Each month we did training exercises as if the enemy were invading the peninsula. Our troops and specialists were well-trained.
In other words, they had a well-rehearsed evacuation plan.
Kabi: I told the commander, ‗In the event that the enemy attacks, you should withdraw your equipment. If it becomes clear that the operation was not against your area, consider your efforts practice.'
Woods: That advice clearly paid off.
We did not lose any Silkworm equipment except for the cables; they were underground so they were difficult to remove. Of course, we had spare cables in the magazines.
In terms of your attacks on Kharg and the Iranian shipping to the south, it is clear the air force was now beginning to cooperate.
Kabi: During this period, Iraq had received Mirage F-1 aircraft, which carried Exocet missiles. 17 They participated in attacking tankers, but depended on our detection systems.
When we detected a target, we developed the attack plan, which estimated the future position of the ship. Then the Mirage F-1 would attack it at its estimated position.
Woods: So you used the same procedure as the ‗casual plan' you mentioned earlier: longrange radar detected movement of ships out of Kharg; you informed the Mirage F-1s
where to find the ship; and the Mirage then showed up, turned on its radar, saw the target, launched the Exocet, and flew home.
Kabi: Same philosophy.
Woods: So in this phase, the Mirage F-1 pilots launched on naval targets based on what the navy passed along to their airfield before launch. In this case was the navy in command of the Mirage F-1 strikes over the Gulf, or were you just passing targeting information?
We were only passing targeting information. But if you were to ask me whether this approach was correct, I would tell you it was faulty. The aircraft should have been under they could fly over open sea. 
19
Woods: For all practical purposes, you controlled the northern Gulf by late 1984, correct?
Iran was able to get small things into Bandar-e Khomeini, but with your continuous pressure, it was never going to be anything large.
Kabi: Yes.
At what point did you start coordinating with Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, and others with economic interests, who were supporting Iraq in the war? You did not want to hit Gulf State tankers while they were loaning money to Iraq and supporting Iraq's cause-especially Kuwait. Was there any coordination at this point to de-conflict between the navies?
Kabi: Most of our attacks occurred at least 12 miles outside of territorial waters.
Were the tankers coming to Kuwait inside their territorial waters?
Kabi: We normally watched this area, but we did not interfere in activities. If we launched any operation, it was normally outside of territorial waters.
Woods: I just want to confirm that that the Iraqi Navy effectively controlled south of Bandar-e Abbas.
Kabi: This is the operational area.
Woods: You avoided commercial shipping lanes heading toward Gulf States. You focused your attacks on Iranians shipping lanes.
Exactly. We defined the operational area in such a sketch. We announced the operations area. In any case, what we learned from this war was that for Iraq to succeed, it could not rely on war inside the Gulf. It must have naval power outside of the Gulf. It needs facilities outside of the Gulf.
Like where?
The political leadership tried to establish bases in Arab nations, such as Somalia, Yemen, and Djibouti.
When did this concept begin to emerge? Was it actively pursued by Iraq's diplomats?
Woods: Fao was a back door the Iranians failed to open?
Kabi: Yes, I will return to my discussion with the corps commander. I told him, ‗Suppose the width of the river in any area is normally between one meter and three kilometers. We can say in any assessment that it is 500 meters. If a small boat can reach a speed of approximately 20 knots, then it could cross in 30 to 50 seconds.' I told him the Iranians could cross this vast frontage at night. With 20 soldiers per boat, a single brigade made up of two battalions would need only 50 boats. I warned him that we could not sink more than ten of these boats. He did not agree with my opinion. He thought it was impossible for the enemy to cross the Shatt al-Arab. This was in 1985.
Woods: Why did he think it was impossible?
Kabi: He thought he had sufficiently strong defenses.
Woods: You recommended these changes in late 1985. Obviously nothing happened. What role did the navy play, either in active fighting or information gathering, during the Iranian offensive?
Kabi: The western road remained clear for a period of time, and we could go back and forth easily. There was no problem. We withdrew the Silkworms when the attack started; they reached Umm Qasr intact.
A few days after the invasion, the navy, which had freedom of movement, destroyed all the ships along the Bahmanshir River in order to help the army. The Iranians sent many small boats to the area. We had two kinds of Russian mines: KB contact mines, which are huge; and Yum floating contact mines, which weigh approximately 350 kilograms. 
22
Woods: So the Iranians were using the Bahmanshir River to move supplies to Fao?
Kabi: Yes, they were using the Bahmanshir River and the Khawr Musa channel. They moved supplies and logistical support through those waterways. Another important fact was that the Iranians tried to build a bridge between the tip of Abadan Island and the tip of the Fao Peninsula. We sent two missile boats there and replaced them regularly. They permanently disrupted the Iranian efforts to build the bridge.
Woods: You stationed two missile boats in front of the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab?
Kabi: Each one has four missiles. We could see the efforts to build a floating pontoon bridge by radar. We destroyed the bridge as soon as they finished building it.
Woods: So this was a continuous operation? How long did it last?
Kabi: This continued for seven days.
Murray: Finally, the Iranians gave up?
Kabi: Yes. Because of this operation, they relied on dam bridges instead of pontoon bridges.
They sank pontoons and then built a fixed bridge on them.
Woods: They filled the channel? What happened to the water? Did this cause a flood?
Kabi: They left gaps in between the bridges so the water could get through. When the army attacked and retook Fao in 1988, its troops attacked this bridge.
The description I had heard is that the Iranians took large sewer pipes and laid them side by side so that water could go through the pipes, while they could drive across the top of the pipes to cross the channel. That was a pretty smart solution to filling in the channel.
The bridge was destroyed by the air force during the attack on Fao.
Woods: Did the navy use its rocket boats to provide fire support for the campaign?
No, but we provided fire support during the first stages of the attack. When the enemy invaded the area, there was no artillery on the peninsula, so the landing ships armed with Katyusha rockets provided support.
Woods: Was the naval brigade you described as controlling this long front under the command of the navy or was it attached to VII Corps?
Kabi: It was attached to the VII Corps.
The loss of Fao had a major impact on the navy. The Iranians could now control your access to the channel.
The width there is about seven kilometers.
Murray: Each sortie from Umm Qasr had to fight its way through a line of small boats with RPGs and anti-tank missiles to get out.
Kabi: Yes, we had to fight our way out the channel.
Woods: And then fight your way back in. That is dangerous.
Were you laying mines even after the battle at Fao was over?
Kabi: Yes. We then laid mines by helicopter.
Could you give us the context, some of the details of the event, and what happened inside Iraq after the Stark incident? From your impression, the Stark was probably on the boundary line of the forbidden zone. I have read some accounts that suggest that there was a commercial vessel near the Stark.
Kabi: I have no idea where the Stark was exactly, but the pilot was aiming for it.
Was it targeted because it showed up on radar, or specifically because of which vessel it was?
Kabi: We thought this was a vessel going to Iran.
Woods: Do you remember anything about the pilot? Was he a particularly qualified or experienced crew member?
Kabi: I do not trust Iraqi pilots over open sea. Even if he were a qualified and experienced pilot, one could not rely on his ability to differentiate between friend or foe.
Woods: What was the reaction at headquarters when it was learned that an Iraqi aircraft had hit the Stark?
The navy had no reaction; it was the air force's problem. I heard about it from a broadcast. I immediately said it was the pilot's fault.
Kabi: No.
Woods: How do you think Saddam or the senior command reacted?
Kabi: They tried to find a solution through diplomacy. This is really all that happened.
Were there any changes in the way you did targeting after the Stark incident?
Kabi: No, because we stuck to our operational area.
Woods: Did the regime itself or the air force think about targeting differently? Were they more cautious?
The method of targeting stayed the same; there were no major changes.
Woods: It probably flows from the nature of the mission. You had decided how to conduct these operations earlier in the war, and they had been successful to that point. Given your objective of disrupting Iranian shipping, you were being successful, so why change tactics.
Kabi: Of course.
To what extent was the navy involved in planning to re-capture the peninsula?
Kabi: The navy was not given a major role in the operation. It depended on the landing forces.
We only had two marine brigades at the time. The 440th and the 441st Marine Brigades led the attack under the command of the Republican Guard, because the marines knew the area better than the Republican Guard. General Abboud Kombar, my coastal defense assistant, and General Muayid Abdul Gharfour, commanded these brigades. 23
Murray: General Hamdani did not mention that the marine brigades were in the lead.
Kabi: General Aladdin Makki was here yesterday. I showed him my paper and asked his opinion. Later he told me that he did not know of most of the things in it. He told me, ‗I had no idea about this operation.' We attacked along Shatt al-Arab from two directions. One was from the front and the other was from the southern part of Umm Qasr. Here we launched approximately 200 frogmen from Umm Qasr. They swam up the Shatt al-Arab and attacked enemy fortifications from the rear. This provided an excellent diversion when the army attacked the fortification from the front. General Ma'ahir led one attack while the Republican Guard led from the other direction. 
The aim of the Iranian operation was just a demonstration. The area around Fao is not important except to the navy.
If it was more than a demonstration, its aim was to prevent the Iraqi Navy from doing the damage it was doing.
Kabi: That was one of its major goals.
Murray: Nobody has mentioned that to us, nor have I read it. The Fao campaign is described in terms of a land battle entirely. The land is all swamp and bad terrain with no strategic value except for cutting the Iraqi Navy off.
The other goal was to make the Persian Gulf countries afraid of Iran.
Murray: But in terms of straight military operational impact, the damage you were doing to the Iranian economy from bases here had reached a significant level. Umm Qasr could have been seen as a major objective, not just as an objective en route to control of Basra. Woods: So in one way the Iranian deception to make the Iraqi Army defend north of Basra was effective, because it removed the two brigades of infantry meant to defend that coastal road out of the Fao Peninsula.
Murray: It was shortsighted of ground commanders; given the damage you were doing to the Iranian economy, to shift those two brigades from the peninsula.
Kabi: They were thinking that there was no threat to this area.
Woods: Do you remember anything about the particular types of operations done along that road? Did the two battalions fit into a static line? What kind of fight did they encounter when they got there?
Kabi: They established fortifications along the coast. We deployed the Silkworm launchers.
We established defensive barriers along the roads. A barrier was established here either by the army or the navy for some other purpose. They used it as a fortification to prevent the enemy from advancing.
Were you able to get air support from the air force for your defense?
Kabi: After the invasion of course, there were a lot of sorties attacking this area. Saddam visited the front a week after the invasion and said we had to stop all operations in the area.
For the defense along this coastal road, were you able to get any air force support, or were you limited to your rocket boats and the infantry?
Kabi: They launched ground attacks during the invasion and it continued even after the operation ended, until Saddam said to stop.
Murray: Your details make the motivation behind the Fao battle clearer. The Iranians had a different major reason for doing the operation; it was not just about getting to Basra. This is not the easy route to Basra.
The road was narrow and not even paved. The route is long, approximately 50 kilometers. It was not easy for them to get to Basra by this route.
Are there other things we have not discussed that you think we ought to know?
Kabi: We did not discuss the operations in detail, but you will find everything in detail in my manuscript.
Murray: Did Saddam know how important this defensive position was?
Kabi: I told him, and he appreciated it.
Nathan: Did you feel as if you had more autonomy than the ground commanders did in terms of your relationship with Saddam and the rest of the high command in Baghdad?
Kabi: As I was a member of the general counsel of the armed forces, I attended approximately 50-60 meetings with Saddam, some of which would last more than 12 hours. They would start at 1800 and finish at sunrise. Three of the meetings had only two generals in attendance.
What was your impression of Saddam as a leader, when briefed by officers on these issues?
Kabi: You cannot say he was a military man, but he tried to learn. He was always asking questions.
Woods: I imagine there was a major difference between Saddam when it came to naval warfare from 1980 to 1988? Given these meetings with you and his reputation for learning from his generals and senior commanders, do you think he was a competent military leader in terms of understanding naval issues by 1988?
Kabi: Yes.
Murray: But Iraq paid a heavy price for the fact that he was an amateur at the beginning.
Kabi: From a political point of view, I agree with you. Saddam should have tried to avoid this war because it led to the destruction of Iraq. I cannot deny that Saddam was a dictator.  The Sukhoi Su-22 was a Soviet-designed tandem two-seat cockpit combat-trainer, export version of the Su17UM attack aircraft.
1983, I was a student at the staff college on al-Sha'iba Air Base in Basra. 
3 Between 1983
and 1984
, I remained in Basra. Between 1985
and 1988, I was base commander in Habaniya. 4
I have flown 22 different aircraft as a fighter pilot. As a base commander, I was told not to fly, because they did not want to lose a senior officer. I stopped flying in 1984. However, I started flying again in secret. One time I lost five pilots in the 109th squadron. I was sad for their loss and told the surviving pilots, ‗I will fly with you.' I did not tell the air force's high command. Instead of honoring me and giving me a medal, when they found out, the air force leaders punished me.
Abousi: I flew everything as a fighter: MiG-15s, 
Mirages,
and Jaguars. 5
The Mirage was my favorite aircraft to fly because it was so responsive. I still suffer from flying the Soviet aircraft: my body and my bones still hurt. The seats were hard, so we all had hemorrhoids. Moreover, it was so hot in the cockpit that we had to take salt capsules to prevent dehydration.
Were you able to continue flying? Abousi: Yes, I continued until I became a major general. I was exceeding the age limit; I should have stopped flying at the age of 40 because of medical issues. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-17 was a Soviet-designed high-subsonic performance jet fighter introduced in the early 1950s. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-21 was a Soviet-designed supersonic jet fighter introduced in the late 1950s. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 was a Soviet-designed swept-wing fighter aircraft introduced in the early 1970s. The Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-29 was a Soviet-designed jet fighter introduced in the early 1980s to counter the American F-15 Eagle and the F-16 Fighting Falcon. The Sukhoi Su-7 was a Sovietdesigned swept-wing, turbojet-powered fighter bomber introduced in the late 1950s. The Sukhoi Su-25 was a Soviet-designed single-seat, twin-engine jet aircraft introduced in the early 1980s to provide close air support to ground forces. The Tupolev Tu-16 is a Soviet-manufactured medium-range bomber that entered service in the mid-1950s. The Tupolev Tu-22 is a Soviet-manufactured supersonic bomber and reconnaissance aircraft that entered service in the mid-1960s. The SEPECAT Jaguar is an Anglo-French manufactured ground-attack jet aircraft that entered service in the early 1970s.
Murray: How many hours of flying time did you have?
Abousi: Approximately 3,000 hours as a fighter pilot.
Murray: Was the Iraqi military running a full staff college course during the war?
Abousi: Yes, they ran courses continuously.  Murray: Was more attention given to air bases housing particular Iranian aircraft, such as the F-14 bases?
Abousi: We did not target the base with F-14s, because they were too far south and beyond the range of our aircraft.
Woods: How did intelligence support to the change over the war's course?
Abousi: We used the MiG-25 and the Mirage for photoreconnaissance missions over Iran.
Woods: So the air force generated its own intelligence by doing the reconnaissance operations to support strikes?
Abousi: Of course-we're talking about imagery intelligence and not signals intelligence.
Woods: I would like to know about both.
Abousi: Signals is more related to political issues. Imagery intelligence focuses more on the information that will affect one's job within the military. refueling, though we did not use it after the war. We also learned to modify the Ilyushin-76 transport aircraft as a refueling aircraft for the  Murray: When did you begin doing air-to-air refueling of Mirage aircraft?
Abousi: From 1985-86 onwards.
Woods: During the missions to attack Larak Island, were the Mirages refueled off Saudi Arabia and then Qatar, before the strike?
Abousi: They were refueled twice. Fourteen aircraft were involved in the operation: two were electronic aircraft; six were the second-leg aircraft; the remaining six were the refueling aircraft, and they returned to al-Sha'iba Airport afterwards. Somewhere off the coast of Qatar, three of the attacking aircraft were then refueled; the refueling aircraft returned to Saudi Arabia, while the other three aircraft attacked their targets.
Woods: How often did Iraq use air-to-air refueling during the course of operations?
Abousi: There were a hundred missions. There were many missions like this one. All of the difficult refueling missions occurred near the end of the war.
Murray: How often were these kind of long-distance raids with Mirages done?
Abousi: Only once, approximately one month before the end of the war. It required numerous aircraft and complex planning. All of these strikes required training over Lake Habaniya.
We rehearsed out in the western desert.
Murray: These kinds of raids were obviously designed to increase the pressure on the Iranians.
Abousi: Of course. They were intended to pressure Iran to end the war. Iran occupied much of our territory late in the war. If we had not pressured them, they would have occupied Kirkuk.
Woods: Can you tell us about chemical weapons and the Iraqi air force?
Abousi: No one in the air force ever used chemical weapons. Some people have said so, but that is not correct. 25
Woods: Well, in fact there is quite a lot of evidence that says the charge that Iraq used chemical weapons was true. I can accept that you may have had no knowledge of it, but we know the Iraqi Air Force had the capability.
The artillery may have used chemical weapons, but I was in charge of the three main bases, and we never used chemical weapons. We did use napalm. We dropped it from Ilyushin aircraft making low-speed passes over a target. For an occupied country such as Iraq, you have to take extreme measures. Iran used to push hundreds of thousands of people to the front. They used human wave attacks. They did not care if their soldiers got killed or not.
The Ilyushin-76 napalm mission is an interesting use of transport aircraft.
We used napalm in Khorramshahr and Penjwin. The entire strip between Penjwin to
Halabjah was occupied by Iranians and Peshmerga.
Woods: How big were the napalm containers?
The barrels held about 200L. We mixed the napalm material and attached a fuse to the capsule. When the barrels were dropped, the fuse would go off spreading napalm everywhere.
Woods: What did the Ilyushin pilots think about becoming bomber pilots?
Abousi: They were like many other soldiers; they followed their orders.
Woods: What altitude did they drop the napalm from?
Abousi: Approximately 6,000 meters.
Murray: I want to get back to the intelligence, particularly in 1982 and 1983. General Kabi suggested that long-range naval radars from Fao were crucial to providing information for air and naval strikes. I am interested particularly in cooperation between the navy and air force. Was this naval radar information from Fao passed to you when convoys were moving north to Bandar-e Abbas? According to the naval commander, the radars at Fao could reach all the way to Kharg Island.
Abousi: Kharg is between 280 and 300 kilometers from Fao. Are you talking about the ground radar?
Murray: Yes, long-range ground radar.
General Abousi had no knowledge of the use of chemical weapons in other parts of Iraq due to the compartmentalization of such information within the Iraqi military.
Abousi: I do not know exactly. We had no cooperation in this regard. The navy asked the air force to run constant sea patrols in order to provide them with information on shipping in the Gulf. If they had such radar, why would they need aircraft to carry out reconnaissance missions?
Section 19: Attitudes toward the Air Force  Air Defense Systems  Bombing of USS Stark
Woods: Can you describe events as they unfolded after 1982? What was the opinion of Iraqi senior leadership, including Saddam and the general command, with regard to the air force? How did it change?
Abousi: Saddam and the command realized that the air force was achieving major successes.
Unlike the ground forces and the naval forces, we did not get any rest; we flew constantly. Saddam changed his perception of the air force to be in line with the opinion of the minister of defense, Adnan Khairallah. Adnan interacted with us directly. He occasionally flew reconnaissance missions with us in the Sukhoi. Aadil Suleman was a pilot who worked with General Khairallah at the headquarters. He was the best pilot in the world.
One day on our way to France, he asked the French to let him dogfight with their best fighter pilots. He shot him down three times in simulated dogfights. The French then removed their pilot from squadron operations, because he was unfit. Suleman was always with General Khairallah. He always trusted him when they went out. Three of Khairallah's sons were Mirage pilots. The oldest was killed in a plane crash.
Woods: How about the Iraqi air defenses? What was their reputation over time, after 1982?
Abousi: Air defense depends on three things: fighter aircraft, ground-to-air rockets, and antiaircraft artillery, in that order. Air defenses improved in a number of ways during the war. The only thing we lacked was a long-range detection capability. We were forced to maintain and man observation posts. These posts possessed early warning equipment, such as radar.
Woods: How many layers of observation did the air defense maintain?
Abousi: Generally two, but some areas had no detection. An important target would have a small mobile radar that could detect targets up to 50 kilometers away. We only had seven squadron fighters at the war's beginning; they flew MiG-21s and MiG-23s. The air with in the squadron operations room. The result of this planning process was accuracy.
After the attack run, the MiG-25 would take post-strike photos of the target. The Mirage also has a camera that turned along with the aircraft, zoomed in, and took detailed, accurate pictures. This was for battle damage assessment.
Murray: After firing Scud missiles, would the MiG-25s do reconnaissance to assess damage? 29
Abousi: No. We did not do reconnaissance on damage from Scuds because they were not accurate. We did not attack important targets with Scud missiles. Abousi: Our most influential person was Adnan Khairallah, when he was the minister of defense and the secretary of the military office. He and Mohammed Abdullah Shehwani, the director of intelligence, were both pilots. General Khairallah spoke with the formation commander before the first strike and helped the pilots with salaries, housing, etc.
He would pay for medical treatment outside the country. We loved Adnan Khairallah.
The other influential person was Mohammed Jissam al-Jibouri. He was a wonderful commander of the air force.  pushed back against the decision to send our aircraft to Iran. We concealed some aircraft in orchards. We relocated non-operable aircraft outside the base with their wings opened. The American forces shot the aircraft down as soon as they took off. They had full command of the area. Woods: What was the air force doing to assist in this deception operation?
We withdrew small units from other sectors. Iran expected an attack on Halabja.
Even our own troops expected an attack on Halabja because we deceived them as well.
Iraqi command prohibited any movement near Fao. The Republican Guard was already there. After Iraqi troops mobilized in the Halabja area, we attacked Fao on 17 April.
The air force prepared all of our air bases to use in the Fao campaign. The air force did not lose one person in the Fao campaign. It was easy; the Iranian troops fled quickly. It was hard for the Iranians to pull back their troops from Halabja. That was when the second, third, and fourth Tawakal al-Allah operations began. There was excellent cooperation between the air force and the army during these operations. The ground operations were supported by the air force. Thousands of Iranians were killed on the Great Day as they attempted to occupy Basra, thanks to our bombers. Saddam honored the pilots because he was so pleased with their success. The only victory the bombers ever achieved was on the Great Day in December 1987.

In 1946, a team of US Army historians and intelligence officers established a long-term exchange with a select group of former members of the German General Staff, enabling a "red-team" understanding of WWII and expanding strategic insight into potential enemies on the "new Eastern Front." Sixty years later, the US Government was given another rare chance to examine doctrine, intelligence, operations, and strategy through the lens of a recent military opponent. An exchange with former Iraqi Generals Ra'ad Hamdani, Mizher Tarfa, Aladdin Makki, Abid Mohammed Kabi, and Alwan Abousi opened up a wealth of knowledge of and operational experience in: the Iraqi Army, Navy, and Air Force as well as intelligence capabilities during the Iran-Iraq War. This new knowledge provides valuable insights into the political, strategic, military, and cultural dynamics of the Middle East. The report includes a series of oral histories taken from interviews of former Iraqi military personnel, places them in historical context, and provides a summary and analysis of the information revealed in the interviews.
