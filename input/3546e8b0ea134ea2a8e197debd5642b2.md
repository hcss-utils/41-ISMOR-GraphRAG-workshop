evaluating the performance of the Luftwaffe's air defenses using a simple binomial equation that compared flak with fighter performance. This myopic focus on fighters versus flak led the Luftwaffe's leadership consistently to ignore or grossly underestimate the contributions of other elements of the ground-based air defense network. German flak defenses accounted for at least half of American aircraft combat losses during the war and an estimated thirty-seven percent of Bomber Command's missing aircraft during night raids, while anti-aircraft fire damaged more than 66,000 U.S. bombers and over 9,000 British bombers. Anti-aircraft defenses not only destroyed and damaged aircraft, they also severely degraded bombing accuracy by driving bombers to higher altitudes and inducing evasive maneuvering on the final bomb run. Flak damage also crippled Allied aircraft making them in easy prey for Luftwaffe fighters. However, Luftwaffe leaders largely ignored these "hidden" effects by focusing solely on the number of aircraft destroyed. Likewise, they often failed to recognize the outstanding returns achieved by decoy and deception measures at relatively low cost, despite the large number of Allied bombs that fell on these sites. Another example involved the critical support provided by searchlights to night fighter forces at different stages of the conflict, as well as the contributions made by smoke generators and barrage balloons to point defenses.
In the end, the Luftwaffe's ground-based air defenses provided a capable and effective adjunct to the Third Reich's fighter defenses; a contribution largely ignored or underestimated by both contemporary Luftwaffe leaders and post-war historians of the air war.
IV First and foremost, I would like to thank the members of my committee, Tami Davis Biddle, Melissa Bullard, Konrad Jarausch, and Alex Roland,
for their instruction and assistance throughout my graduate career.
The combined programs at UNC and Duke offered me a rewarding journey along the roads of early modern European, modern German, and military history. I especially would like to thank my Doktorväter, Richard Kohn and Gerhard Weinberg, for their meticulous attention to detail and expert advice in the preparation of this manuscript. I am profoundly grateful to both for sharing their insights, professional expertise, and friendship.
In addition, I would like to thank the German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) for a research grant to examine archival and library holdings in Freiburg and Potsdam. While in Freiburg Horst Boog and Wilhelm Deist were both gracious hosts and stimulating discussion partners. Likewise, the staffs of the Bundesarchiv-Militärarchiv and the Militärgeschichtliches Forschungsamt provided the author with friendly and expert assistance during his stay in the Federal Republic.
Similarly, during a research visit to the United Kingdom, the author benefited from the helpful and knowledgeable advice of the staffs of the Public Records Office, the Imperial War Museum, and the Air Historical Branch.
In the case of the last, I am indebted to Sebastian Cox for sharing his insights, many cups of tea, and several hours from his busy schedule. In addition, special thanks are due to Steve
Chiabotti and Rob Owen of the School of Advanced Airpower Studies for their support of my graduate studies. I also owe many thanks to the staffs of National Archives II and the USAF Historical Research Agency for their assistance during my visits to both locations. I also would like to thank the League of World War I aviation historians for honoring the first chapter of this work with their 1999 essay award. In the course of the war, the Royal Air Force (R.A.F.) and the United States Army Air Forces (U.S.A.A.F.) obliterated entire sections of major German industrial and population centers under a hail of high explosive and incendiary bomb loads. Operating largely at night, the R.A.F. launched its "bomber streams" against Germany's major industrial and urban centers in a strategy of area bombardment designed to "dehouse" the German population and break their will to fight.
In 1943, the U.S.A.A.F. joined the R.A.F. in raids against Germany by focusing on a strategy of daylight "precision" bombardment aimed at the heart of German industrial production. During the course of the air campaign against the Third Reich, tens of thousands of British and American bombers pounded targets within Germany with over 1,200,000 tons of bombs.

In the wake of this aerial Armageddon, countless monographs and articles have examined the efficacy of strategic bombing in World War II. With few exceptions, these accounts focused on the contributions of either the Royal Air Force or the Army Air Forces to the defeat of Germany. The majority of Anglo-American accounts have focused on the view from the perspective of Allied military planners and the crews in the cockpit. When examining Germany's air defense network, most historians have concentrated on the role of the Luftwaffe's day and night fighter forces in the battle for control of the skies over Europe.

First, many historians accepted the post-war testimony of leading figures within the Luftwaffe that ground-based air defenses, in particular the Luftwaffe's anti-aircraft or flak forces, had achieved limited success in destroying Allied bombers. Field Marshal Erhard Milch, the head of the Luftwaffe's Air Armaments Program and the second-in-command of the Air Ministry, was the most prominent official to make this argument. After the war, the British Bombing Survey Unit (BBSU) also adopted this line of reasoning. The BBSU severely underrated the importance of the Luftwaffe's anti-aircraft gun defenses by describing them as "plentiful" but not "very lethal." 5 A second widespread criticism of the flak centered on the contention that the ground-based air defenses cost too much in terms of both fiscal and personnel outlays. This argument found its initial expression in both the United States Strategic Bombing Survey (USSBS) and the report of the British Bombing Survey Unit. Both reports contended that the production of flak guns and flak ammunition prevented the transfer of these resources to more critical areas including the manufacture of regular artillery pieces. The resource argument has also been applied
to the number of men and women employed in the anti-aircraft arm. In this context, the argument holds that the hundreds of thousands of German men and women employed in these defenses could have been employed more effectively in other military or industrial tasks.

effective versus the bombers than the flak and therefore constituted the first, and, best resort for the defense of the skies over 
Germany. 8
The first argument concerning the limited effectiveness of the flak is patently false. During the course of the war, German antiaircraft defenses destroyed a high proportion of American and British fighter and bomber aircraft. For example, German flak accounted for at least half of American aircraft combat losses during the war. 
9
10
The second criticism of the flak arm concerns the anti-aircraft arm's supposed diversion of critical materiel and personnel resources addition, those who argue that flak weapons and ammunition production resulted in lower production of these items for the field armies often fail to take into account the important contribution of Luftwaffe flak forces in support of the ground combat operations during the Wehrmacht's campaigns on all fronts.
In fact, the Luftwaffe's flak arm played a critical role in support of army ground operations in the invasion of both France and the Soviet Union. The use of the flak in a variety of roles besides air defense refutes the simplistic calculus that holds that one flak gun was one less artillery piece available for the German army. With regard to personnel, the flak did indeed require a large contingent of men, and later women, to successfully perform its mission. However, contentions that the anti-aircraft network robbed the Wehrmacht of men who might have been better used in hundreds of new divisions is also spurious. Clearly, anti-aircraft defenses did involve large numbers of personnel.
In 1940, there were 528,000 men serving with the flak arm alone; however, this number had increased to only 573,000 by November of 1944 as a result of the mobilization of factory workers, young men and young women, and even prisoners-of-war.
In fact, from the fall of 1944 these auxiliaries constituted from onethird to one-half of all persons serving in the flak arm.
In addition, in 1945, over one-third of those persons serving in the flak came from high age groups or were unfit for military service due to medical disabilities.

In the final analysis, a myopic focus on flak and fighters has resulted in a profound underestimation of the contributions of all elements of the ground-based air defense system.
A second aspect that contributed to the general underestimation of the performance of the flak arm during the war involved the psychological reaction of the Luftwaffe's leadership to the "failure" of anti-aircraft defenses to prevent the destruction of the cities and factories of the Reich from the Allied aerial assault. In an oft repeated and now famous boast, Hermann Goring exclaimed, "If an enemy bomber reaches the Ruhr, my name is not Hermann Goring. You can call me Meier." 20 While often cited as but one example of Goring's penchant for pompous proclamations, his boast clearly reflected his belief that the strength of the Luftwaffe's air defenses would make Germany largely invulnerable to attacks from the 'third dimension.' In truth, Goring's belief was not based on simple delusion. At the start of the conflict, Germany did in fact posses the most extensive and capable ground-based air defense system in the world. However, it was certainly true that the Luftwaffe's high expectations were founded on erroneous assumptions. For example, pre-war flak studies estimated that one 88mm anti-aircraft projectile exploding within 33 yards of an attacking aircraft would bring the bomber down. 
21
feet had better have their wills prepared as they would not get a second chance. Likewise, he noted that the estimate of 33 yards for a lethal hit had plummeted to a mere 13 yards and even an explosion at this distance was not guaranteed to bring down a four-engine bomber.
It was at this point that the commander of the Luftwaffe's flak forces, General of the Flak Artillery Walther von Axthelm grudgingly confessed that "At the moment we [the flak arm] are the supporting arm to the fighters."

leaders after the war. Ultimately, extreme disappointment and a tendency to denigrate the accomplishments of the Luftwaffe's flak forces proved to be the price for the failure to meet the high expectations of the prewar period.
The following work examines the organization and operations of German ground-based air defenses in the period between 1914 and 1945.
In the battle for control of the skies over Europe, technology played a critical role in shifting the balance between the defenders and the attackers during the course of the war. Likewise, resource limitations and economic considerations affected the manner in which the war could be waged. Finally military doctrine and political decision-making played an important role in determining the Luftwaffe's response to the Allied bombing campaign. In short, the development of the Luftwaffe's ground-based air defense system aptly demonstrates the linkage between economics, technology, military doctrine, and political decision-making in the age of modern industrialized warfare. The evolution of German ground-based air defenses also tells a story of the role of expectations and perceptions in the formation of military strategy and illustrates the military and political consequences engendered by the failure to fulfill these expectations.
In preparing this work, it was soon apparent that, in order to tell the story of ground-based air defenses fully, an accompanying discussion of the Luftwaffe's fighter forces and the development of The Great War witnessed a dramatic, if overly romanticized, battle between the forces of the Allied and the Central Powers for control of the "third dimension," the heavens above the battlefields and homes of the combatants.
In their accounts of the air war, most historians have focused on the role and performance of the flying crews and their aircraft. The battle for the skies over Europe was not waged, however, in the air alone. During the conflict, German groundbased air defense systems began a slow but steady evolution in an effort to control the heavens from the earth below.
In the face of a positional stalemate, the steadily expanding performance of aircraft led to an increasing awareness among the German political and military leadership of the need for viable and effective air defenses, both at the fighting front and on the home front. The ultimate contribution of ground-based air defenses to the overall German war effort was relatively modest. However, an evaluation of these defenses offers a story that clearly demonstrates the interrelationship between technology, resources, and doctrine in warfare.
It is also a story that enriches and expands the contemporary understanding of 'the first air war.'
The origins of German anti-aircraft efforts reach back to the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871. The use by the Communards of hot air balloons to escape from the besieged city of Paris resulted in an urgent request by the German army for an effective weapon with which to engage the French balloons. 
1
Of the sixty-six balloons known to have left Paris during the siege, the Germans succeeded in bringing down only one, the "Daguerre," on November 12, 1870. 
2
In any event, the French simply began making flights at night thus minimizing the threat posed by the guns. 
3
The introduction of airships and aircraft at the turn-of-thecentury led to an increasing realization of the potential militarysignificance of both lighter-than-air and heavier-than-air aircraft for the conduct of reconnaissance and artillery spotting.

In the latter case, the Zeppelin fleet achieved commercial success by transporting approximately 34,000 people throughout Germany in the years between 1910 and 1914. The "Zeppelin Craze" had, however, a darker side and triggered a series of Zeppelin bombing scares in England and France evocative of the naval scares of the same period. 
6
In conjunction with their own advanced progress in airship design and manufacture, German industry embarked upon a program for the development of anti-aircraft guns designed to shoot down these lighterthan-air platforms, a fact evident in the German use of the term bis zum Beginn des Weltkrieges, 1914, Anlage-Band, Dokumente-Karten-Tabellen (Berlin: Ernst Siegfried  Mittler und Sohn, 1941), 332.
Ballonabwehrkanone.
In 1906, the Artillery Proving Commission 7
{Artillerie-Prüfungs-Kommission) of the War Ministry warned of French advances in balloon technology. In an order, dated January 29, 1906, General Sixt von Arnim cautioned that measures must be taken to combat the potential French threat. He, therefore, ordered the artillery schools to study the problem and prepare a report for the 
Commission. 8

In addition to its 65-mm gun, Krupp introduced a 75-mm gun mounted on a motorized vehicle and a 105-mm gun for maritime air defense. The unique feature of several of these guns included the use of armor plating to protect the gun crews, a feature that some viewed as superfluous based on the perceived inability of balloons and airships to threaten the gun

General von Renz served as a senior officer in the Luftwaffe responsible for the evaluation, procurement and technical development of German anti-aircraft weapons, munitions, and targeting systems during World War II.

10
Still, the German army's burgeoning interest in the subject of air defense led to several tests to evaluate the use of standard army weapons against aerial targets. In 1907, the army employed conventional field artillery pieces fired at a balloon towed by a motorboat. The results of the trial were less than satisfactory and led to the finding that conventional artillery was not suited for combating aerial targets. 
11
12
The difficulties associated with firing on canvas-covered balloons extended beyond the physical shape and composition of the projectile itself. The fuse type used to detonate the projectile proved an equally thorny technical challenge. The light resistance offered by a balloon's soft fabric required an extremely sensitive contact fuse, a fuse which then offered the potential catastrophic consequences of premature detonation during firing from the gun's tube. 
13
In combat against aerial targets, however, this was impossible. Some other method was necessary for discerning the flight path of the projectile in order to adjust the fires. Once again, the engineers of Krupp provided a solution by designing a shell that carried an incendiary in the forward half of the projectile and a smoke-producing substance in the rear. Once fired, the shell trailed a black plume of smoke allowing for improved flight path tracking with a corresponding improvement in fire adjustment.

Kochler, 1921), 44. This work is held by the Air University Library at Maxwell AFB, Alabama. According to Höppner, this problem persisted into World War I.
" Bernard Delsert, Jean-Jacques Dubois, and Christian Kowal, La Flak, 1914-1918, vol. 1, (Guilherand  Grange: La Plume du Temps, 1999) wheeled carriage as it could be fired immediately, without the delay associated with the entrenchment of wheel-mounted guns. The authors also highlighted the motorized gun's greater mobility, which allowed for both more flexibility in responding to airship attack as well as in the pursuit of enemy airships. Second, the report called for the construction of a "purpose-built" artillery piece with the contention that "According to the present state of technology, there is no doubt that a purpose-built gun {Spezialgeschütz) is always a better solution than a regular artillery gun." 
15
considered the standard reference for technical questions related to German flak artillery, munitions, and fire control equipment in WW I.
The German army's senior leadership also acknowledged the growing importance of defense against airship attack. In a memorandum of March 14, 1910, General Helmuth von Moltke, Chief of the General Staff, discussed the threat posed by French airships. Moltke advocated the arming of German airships, but cautioned that "We must be, however, in the position to destroy the enemy's airships from the ground." Moltke, however, rejected the request for purpose-built guns. He further urged the expeditious conduct of long-planned anti-aircraft firing trials in the Bay of Danzig "despite all of the difficulties standing in the way [of these tests]. " 
16
Moltke's personal involvement produced the desired results.
During the annual army maneuvers of 1910, the army tested two weapons platforms for organic air defense. The first was a 75-mm gun mounted on the open bed of a truck.
In addition, the army mounted an infantry machine gun on the open bed of a second truck. 
17
18
In contrast, the mounting of the machine gun offered a more promising solution. The greater ease in manipulating the gun into various firing positions, its higher rate of fire, and its reduced space and crew demands were definite advantages. The primary disadvantage with the machine gun centered on its relative lack of range; a significant handicap that allowed for unrestricted aircraft operations at a height above the machine gun's reach. 
19
The German General Staff recognized that advances in aircraft technology had significant implications for future military operations. The Italian campaign in Libya between 1911 and 1912 and the use of aircraft in the Balkan War of 1912 demonstrated the emerging potentialities of aircraft. 
20
21
As early as in March 1911 the General Staff had gained the impression from the performance of airships and aviators during the imperial manoevers [sic], from artillery practice against aircraft, and through information relative to the advances made by France in military aeronautics, that aviation material should be assembled and that the role of aircraft as a means of reconnaisance [sic] be taken up and further developed.  Höppner, War in the Air, 23; see also Ritter, Der Luftkrieg, 57. Ritter remarks that machine guns were ineffective above 1,000 meters.

Heinrich Hunke, Luftgefahr und Luftschutz: Mit besonderer Berücksichtigung des deutschen Luftschutzes (Berlin: Verlag von E.S. Mittler & Sohn, 1933), 3.  According to Höppner, insufficient funding and a general shortage of qualified officers and enlisted troops combined to retard the growth of both German aviation and air defense in the years prior to the war. 
23
In April 1911, the "Special Commission on the Combat of Air Vehicles" delivered a report on ground-based air defenses to the War Ministry. The commission warned that air defense capabilities continued to lag behind the capabilities of modern airships and also noted the threat posed by smaller and more maneuverable aircraft. Recommendations to strengthen ground-based air defenses included the construction of a purpose-built gun as well as increased and more realistic training for the gun 24 A War Ministry report of April 5, 1912 concerning the "combat of aerial vehicles" provided ambiguous support for the commission's findings of the previous year. The War Ministry recommended increasing the numbers of drills and exercises under live fire conditions as well as advocating the broader dissemination of air defense procedures among the troops. In addition, the report identified the need for an accurate and reliable range finding device. However, in contrast to the commission's findings, the War Ministry contended that traditional field and foot artillery was perfectly "suitable" for combating aerial vehicles.

But he strictly prohibited the conversion of existing field artillery batteries into A.A. batteries as this would only "weaken" the division's organic artillery firepower. Moltke concluded by stating his intention to notify the Kaiser's cabinet of these decisions and by remarking on the "great importance" that he had always placed on air defense. Finally, he called for extensive tests involving air defense systems during the planned army maneuvers for the fall of 1914.

Germany, but on the battlefields of France and East Prussia. Still, the German army continued to experiment with air defense concepts in the months preceding the start of the war. For example, the army conducted anti-aircraft trials in April 1914 at a test range in Swinemünde. The tests included firing modified artillery pieces at imaginary targets in the air; a practice not designed to engender advanced levels of proficiency among the gun crews.

development of aviation technology contributed to a general atmosphere of increasing discussion, but slow-paced modernization within the antiaircraft arm.
The apparent neglect of ground-based air defenses in the years directly preceding the Great War appears paradoxical in light of the stated opinions of the War Ministry and the senior army leadership.
However, a comparison between Germany's air defense efforts and those of her European neighbors in the years before the war offers the clearest benchmark for evaluating German progress. N.W. Routledge, a historian of British air defenses, noted that the British army lagged behind Germany and France and remarked that prior to 1914 "no [British]   Army AA organisation existed." 
32
33
In addition, the German navy had pursued its own program of research and development of flak guns in the years prior to the war producing some of the finest antiaircraft guns of the war. 
34
35
36
The general state of air defenses was not surprising when given the type of conflict envisioned by the General Staff in the German war plan. As has been noted often, Germany's military blueprint for World War I, the Schlieffen Plan, sought to avoid the perils of a two-front war by first defeating France in a six to eight week campaign, and then turning east to confront the Russian 'colossus.'

explained in great part the belated German emphasis on air defense within the army. The widespread belief that the war would be a brief affair much like the Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 also helped to explain the almost complete neglect of German homeland air defense in 1914. Military forces acquire arms and equipment for the war they intend to fight, and not for a struggle they either wish to avoid or fail to foresee. At the outbreak of World War I, German military planners anticipated a war of movement {Bewegungskrieg) and not the meat-grinder of positional war {Stellungskrieg}.
In the final analysis, German military planners recognized the potential value of a limited air defense capability, but air defenses did not rate among the army's top priorities in the first half of 1914.
At the outbreak of the First World War, German air defenses consisted of only six motorized guns and twelve horse-drawn 77-mm guns.
The available guns were well below the forecast strength envisioned in pre-war plans.
In fact, mobilization plans called for each numbered army to receive four motorized guns and each division a horse-drawn battery. 
38
39
38 Koch, Flak, 10-11; see also Hogg, Anti-Air craft, 41. Hogg states that the six motorized guns were the original guns introduced by Krupp and Rheinmetall at the 1909 Frankfurt exhibition. See also Fritz Nagel,  Fritz: The World War I Memoirs of a German Lieutenant, ed. Richard A. Baumgartner (Huntington, W. VA: Der Angriff Publications, 1981), 41. Nagel, a reserve officer in the German anti-aircraft service states that the batteries consisted of two guns, thirty horses, and forty men commanded by a lieutenant.
the problems of air defense associated with the protection of important industrial sites and urban areas.
The Commander of the German Air Service, General von Höppner, explained this oversight with the contention that, "The need for the defense of cities was not anticipated." 
40
41
In fact, General Erich von Falkenhayn, the chief of the General Staff remarked in a report of May 26, 1915 that "the combat of enemy aircraft by artillery fire has been up to this point generally accompanied by only very limited success, even with large expenditures of ammunition."

for German use, a widespread practice also followed during the Second World War.
In 1915 alone, the German army designated approximately 1,000 captured French, Russian, and Belgian artillery pieces for use in air defense and by the end of the war, captured foreign artillery pieces constituted almost half of all German flak guns.

Fritz Nagel, a reserve officer in a B.A.K. battery, remarked that:
We were one of the very first anti-aircraft batteries formed, but nobody knew much about firing at airplanes and we had no idea what our future role would be. The letters B.A.K. stood for Ballonabwehrkanon [sic]-balloon defense canon-and we therefore presumed the protection of our observation balloons would be our main jobs. ... It was obvious that we needed special training to fire our French guns. On February 25, 1915, we were shipped to the Krupp target range at Tangerhuette where Krupp engineers instructed us. We were shooting at kite balloons and became quite efficient.
Nagel' s experience was not unique and the performance of the German flak defenses in the early stages of the war proved abysmal.
In fact, Nagel contended that German Army Headquarters circulated a directive

strikes against targets within Germany.
In an attempt to preempt Zeppelin attacks against the British Isles, the R.N.A.S. launched raids against Zeppelin hangars in Cologne and Düsseldorf on September 22 and October 8. British aircraft also bombed German dirigible sheds at
Friederichshafen and Ludwigshafen on November 21. 
48
It was, however, a raid on the city of Freiburg in December 1914 that brought about a rapid change in the existing attitude concerning the air attacks.
In the wake of the city's bombing, German civilians began to demand better air defenses and an improved warning system to notify of an impending attack. 
49
One of the major deficiencies of the German home defenses concerned the various agencies exercising authority within Germany.
These agencies included the state governments (Länder), bureaucratic and police agencies, local army headquarters, and local military bases.

of an officer, Major Hugo Grimme, to inspect and coordinate improvements in the air defenses of the German homeland, the western frontier, and the Western Front on May 1, 1915. 
51
52
However, Grimme's influence within the army proved circumscribed, and in the spring of 1916, despite his objections, the Chief of Army
Ordnance took control of the anti-artillery guns. The Chief of Ordnance promptly dispersed the horse-drawn guns within the divisions and assigned the motorized guns to the anti-aircraft staff officers within the numbered armies.

of more traditionally-minded army generals as well as the superficial nature of the first air defense organizational reforms.
In addition to reorganization efforts, the army also focused on the material shortcomings within the German air defenses. The Allied air attacks against the German homeland resulted in the diversion of some flak guns destined for the front to the defense of Germany proper.
In March 1915, the War Ministry warned, "The desire for the increased supply of flak to troop units must for the time being take second place."

The Chief of Aviation was constantly looking ahead to provide against hostile air attacks against our frontiers, coasts, harbors, and positions of military importance in the zone of the interior. Our means of defense had been makeshifts improvised as the war went on and were devoid of any methodical plan. A series of military authorities shared the responsibility of protecting the Empire against aerial attack-the War Ministry, the Chief of Aviation, Inspector of the Anti-Aircraft at [the] Great General Headquarters, Inspector of Anti-Aircraft in the Zone of the Interior, local commanding officers, various offices under the control of the navy. To secure results from all these, unity had to be obtained. 
62
Höppner's appointment underscored the need for a single commander to direct all aviation activities and constituted a major step towards the more efficient employment of German aviation and air assets in both an offensive and defensive role. In short, the Kaiser's order effectively centralized control over all aviation related activities, including the organization and training of the air service, logistics, flak, and civil defense measures under Höppner's command." The move had the added benefit of rationalizing the system of aviation procurement and technical development. Prior to his appointment, the army and the navy had pursued independently their own programs. This dual system of development and procurement led to higher costs, excess personnel, and wasted material. In addition, no mechanism existed for sharing the advances made by either with its sister service.

Prior to the establishment of the Air Service, the army also had initiated some modest steps to increase the effectiveness of their air defense forces. One measure involved the creation of a training school for officers of the anti-aircraft branch at Ostende, Belgium in 1915.
The two-week course included both theoretical and practical instruction, including a live fire final exam in a prepared antiaircraft position a few miles north of Ypres. Crews destined for duty at the front and those stationed in Germany received their training at Ostende until 1917 when, at the Navy's request, the school was moved twelve miles north to the coastal town of Blankenberge. The army recognized the importance of expert instruction, and the school's faculty consisted of officers with extensive experience at the front.

Early in the war, the German army concentrated anti-aircraft positions in areas along the frontlines frequented by Entente pilots. In these areas, the gun crews established anti-aircraft barriers {BAK-Sperren).
Allied pilots began cutting-off their engines during an attack in the middle of 1916. The Germans responded by establishing balloon barriers as a deterrent.
Still, the paucity of trained crews and the limited number of guns allowed only for partial coverage of the front. The army also employed anti-aircraft guns to protect some vital areas such as headquarters and supply depots. By 1917, the increasing mobility provided by motorization and the greater numbers or anti-aircraft guns began to allow for more effective coverage of the front. 75
The major limitation of the guns remained, however, 76 Koch, Flak, 13; see also Hunke, Luftgefahr und Luftschutz, 17. Hunke claims that the difficulties in coordinating searchlights with listening devices led to the reliance of barrier fire. 
77
order to achieve optimal results from the German ground-based systems, an effective method of "directed fire" was absolutely essential.
In the last years of the war, a number of technological and armament improvements succeeded in increasing the effectiveness of the ground-based air defense system. For example, the introduction of a better range finder {Entfernungsmeßgerät) in 1917 enhanced the accuracy in determining target distance for computing firing solutions. 
78
In effect, the operator's two eyes achieved a practical separation equal to the length of the cross-arm with a corresponding improvement in depth perception. For example, the German 4-meter device resulted in increasing the effective distance between the operator's eyes to thirteen feet. A superimposed cross hair could then be manipulated with respect to the target allowing for the calculation of the slant range. 
79
78
Technological advances in armaments and munitions also played a role in improving effectiveness. In 1917, the Germans introduced an artillery piece designed specifically for anti-aircraft defense, the forerunner of the famous 88-mm gun of World War II fame. 
80
81
82
In turn, the length of this delay depended on the proficiency of the individual gun crew. The relatively slow speeds achieved by early aircraft and their modest operational altitudes allowed for some success using this technique, a technique that by World War II became essentially unworkable due to increasing aircraft speeds and higher Front.

better coordination between the early warning service and the active air defense forces, but this system was also resource intensive. 89 In conjunction with flak and searchlight defenses, the Air Service introduced tethered balloons to act as low-level barriers to aircraft attacks in January 1917.

In addition to the anchor cable, the Germans attached a number of free hanging cables in order to improve the coverage area or connected several balloons together to create an aerial fence. 
94
In addition to active defense, the Germans adopted a number of passive defense measures including blackouts for cities and industrial centers, the construction of dummy targets, and the expansion of civil bomb shelters.

97
In order to achieve a truly effective defense, the Air Service required active measures that united aircraft and ground-based assets into an integrated network.

the Air Service reserved nine fighter squadrons for the role of home defense. 
98
The employment of both ground-based and interceptor (pursuit)
forces was significant because it demonstrated an understanding within the Air Service that air defense required a combined arms approach. As early as 1915, the army leadership recognized the need for both antiaircraft guns and fighter-interceptors in the conduct of air defense, especially in the vicinity of important industrial installations.

The German appreciation of the combined arms approach to air defense did not involve tremendous foresight or operational acumen.
Indeed, the question was not whether to allocate resources either to flak or interceptors, but rather in what proportion available resources should be divided between the two. This question, although pertinent during the Great War, also emerged as a dominant issue in the air defense of the Third Reich between 1939 and 1945.
The last year of the war offered a promising portent for German ground-based air defenses. Indeed, flak defenses achieved their greatest success in 1918. By November, the Air Service operated 2,770 anti-aircraft guns, with approximately thirty percent of these guns serving in the defense of 
Germany. 103

Höppner proved decidedly more optimistic in his evaluation of the performance of German air defenses in the war than Ludendorff:
A comparison between the rapid development of anti-aircraft and its ever-increasing list of victories is its best claim to glory, and it showed that its technical development and tactical employment were based on sound principles. Its success is due chiefly to the devotion of its officers, non-commissioned officers, and men in the performance of a task that was difficult and unfamiliar.
It is due to them that anti-aircraft grew from 7 Ibid., 457.

What new guidelines have been developed from the use of new weaponry in the war? A. Which new problems, put forward by the war, have not yet found a solution?
16
In 1919 using these guidelines, the former Air Service Chief of Staff, Lieutenant Colonel Wilhelm Siegert, supervised more than twenty officers in a study of homeland defenses. Likewise, three additional committees studied various aspects of air defense including the employment of air and ground-based defenses. 
17
In 1921, an article, entitled "Flak" appeared in the major German military weekly, the Militärwochenblatt. The author, Captain Seydel, reviewed both the strengths and weaknesses of flak during the war. A major weakness discussed by Seydel was the poor standardization of the flak artillery that had resulted in the use of twenty-five different models of guns. He also noted the need for a more efficient communications system for relaying and coordinating air defense efforts. Looking towards the future, Seydel mentioned that, despite the success of flak in the latter stages of the war, rapid advances in aircraft technology demanded a corresponding improvement in flak guns and munitions to counter the anticipated high altitude operations of the bombers of tomorrow.

The Practice of Air Defense
The appreciation of the role of aviation and air defense found expression not only in Reichswehr doctrine, but also in the military exercises of the interwar period. Commenting on the Reichswehr's fall maneuvers of September 1926, a U.S. military intelligence report noted, "
The assumption of the presence of both friendly and hostile air forces was made in every maneuver witnessed during the year, which assumption the umpires never failed to bring home to the commanders of every grade by constantly giving them an assumed air situation."

This report came from a U.S. military attache and also provided details on the German army's emphasis on passive defense measures to include camouflage and dispersion. The popular belief that the Rappallo Treaty contained secret military clauses was incorrect.
In fact, the first substantive meetings on German and Soviet military cooperation had occurred already in 1921.

In contrast to the advances made in German aviation, the German-Soviet agreements did little to benefit the development of the Reichswehr's ground-based air defenses. In 1928, Soviet representatives approached the firm of Krupp for assistance in the production of high-grade steel and artillery, including anti-aircraft guns. After showing some initial interest, Krupp decided against the venture, and as a result the Soviets subsequently turned to the firm of Rheinmetall in January 1930.

The negotiations between Rheinmetall eventually led to an understanding by the summer of 1930 and the delivery of some flak artillery pieces; 57 however, the end of Russo-German military cooperation was already on the horizon.

These modified guns were subsequently exported to the Soviet Union, with German engineers providing on-site technical expertise.
In addition, the captured weapons unit also recovered older models of German fire directors and auxiliary fire directors from Soviet forces. By 1941, the vast majority of the captured weapons and equipment were of simple design and good quality, but well behind the technical standards of the latest Luftwaffe systems.

In addition, the In an article of October 18, 1929, entitled "Luftschutz der deutschen   Industrie" (Air Defense of German Industry), W. Hofweber, an engineer, played upon the anxieties of the German people and the military.
Hofweber described Germany as an "disarmed Fatherland" (entwaffenetes Vaterland), and argued that "only dreamers believe in eternal peace, defenseless peoples have always been the desired object of attack."

defenses; however, the reviewer chose to focus exclusively on Niessel's discussion of passive air defense measures. The reviewer agreed with Niessel's suggestions concerning the utility of using searchlights to blind pilots during nighttime attacks and the necessity for gas masks for the entire civilian population. He also concurred with Niessel on the limitations of smoke generators and camouflage for protecting large areas as well as the need for air raid shelters in the vicinity of important industrial sites and communications facilities.

On the one hand, they are indicative of a wave of literature dealing with air defense issues that began appearing in the late 192 0s and early 1930s. 
79
On the other hand, the authors of these articles largely limited their Under this plan, the total number of weapons devoted to home defense included 792 heavy machine guns, thirty 37-mm guns, twenty-four 75-mm guns, forty-eight 88-mm guns, and four 105-mm guns. 
83
First, it demonstrated the Reichswehr's determination to increase the size of the army despite the existing prohibitions of the Versailles Treaty. Second, the plan identified the necessity of providing air defense to both forces in the field and to the homeland. Not surprisingly, the plan did highlight a continuing bias within the army favoring the troops at the front as indicated by the allocation of 108 heavy guns (75-mm and above) and 168 light guns (37-mm) for the former compared with 76 heavy guns and 30 light guns for the latter.

He finished the report with the statement that "All other tasks are at 86 Karl Friederich Hildebrand, Die Generale der deutschen Luftwaffe, 1935-1945, vol. 3 (Osnabrück: Biblio  Verlag, 1992)  The report also reflected two other important aspects of German air defense doctrine, the need for a combined arms approach and the appreciation of air defense against strategic attack. Under "Tasks of AA Weapons," the report remarked, "AA has the task either alone or in cooperation with the Air Force to protect all vital installations for the protection of the homeland as well as to protect the troops in the field from attacks from the air." 98 According to the report, the primary aim of the anti-aircraft defenses was "always the destruction of the hostile planes. . . . [although] their actual and morale effect, will hinder the enemy at least in the execution of his tasks or force him to abandon his activities altogether." In addition, the air defense planners realized that the number of guns would be limited, but they felt that mobility could "compensate for numerical weakness." 
99
In fact, the report presented a prioritization of air defense needs. The programs deemed "urgent" priorities were the 88-mm gun (interim solution), the 20-mm and 37-mm medium flak guns, searchlights, radio locators including listening devices, barrage rockets, fire directors, and infrared tracking. In addition, the report identified barrage balloons as an "important" priority and remote controlled anti-aircraft guns as "not urgent." 100
The plans for barrage rockets and infrared tracking of aircraft The "Driving Sections"
In 1933, the army began a process of reorganizing its seven existing Fahrabteilungen (literally driving sections). The use of the term "driving section" was a veiled attempt to disguise the fact that these units were actually motorized flak units. The reorganization was in truth a direct result of the Conversion Plan {Umbau-Plan) of November 1932 and the Reichswehr leadership's desire to increase the size of the army, and in particular the size of anti-aircraft, signal, and artillery units.

The total of seven air defense units for the support of the army and the protection of the Reich was clearly inadequate for defending 
The activities of Fahrabteilung 3 in the months from March to May 1933 revealed the increased pace of training exercises experienced by the flak units. In March, the unit received orders to conduct field trials three times a week combining searchlights and sound detectors.
These field exercises were intended to serve as preparation for the war games scheduled in the summer. In April, the unit was to continue the weekly drills, but was expected to conduct them under simulated battlefield conditions. In May, the battle exercises continued and integrated a two-week long live fire trial at the gunnery range in Schillig followed by another week of searchlight and combat trials involving new recruits. 
13
The report also emphasized cooperation between the sound detector personnel and the searchlight crews in training for engaging bombers at night. In sum, the report demonstrated a realistic appraisal of the limitations associated with sound detection, and an equally pragmatic approach to future training exercises. 
14
15
Indeed, the thorough theoretical training of air defense forces should not be overly surprising as it merely continued a tradition of excellence established by the Prussian and German armies in this area.

In October 1933, the flak and searchlight forces included

of the flak defenses. In this respect, although continuing to emphasize the use of directed, or aimed fires, using a fire director, Rudel also remarked on the "usefulness" of barrage fire in the absence of a reliable acoustic procedure for locating aircraft in poor weather and at night. Finally, he remarked on the "considerable advances" made by searchlight crews in the performance of their duties, but again warned that the training of these crews required more realistic combat conditions.
30
Rudel's analysis was significant in several respects. First, it clearly showed the progress that had been made by the air defense In the conclusion to his report, Rudel declared that the commanders of the air defense units needed to master not only the regulations concerning their own systems, but those of the fighter aircraft as well. In fact, he argued for a detailed "understanding of the tactics and weapons capabilities" of these aircraft as well as the need to take advantage of every opportunity to work together with fighters during planning exercises and field trials. 
31
Since 193 0 the army had resisted efforts to remove air defense forces from its command.
In the Weimar period, the army had consistently won every battle against the advocates of forming an independent air arm with control over both aviation and air defense forces. 
32
Goring. Goring, a fighter ace in World War I and the last commander of the famed Richthofen flying circus, was an ambitious political opportunist whose appetite for the finer things in life was exceeded only by his desire for political power. As Hitler's self-professed "truest paladin," Goring's political fortunes were inextricably tied to those of the Führer. 
33
Hitler also acceded to Goring's desire for a leading role in the expansion of German military and civil aviation and selected him to head the Reich Commission for Aviation on February 3, 1933. On April   27, 1933, Reich  offered a series of basic doctrinal precepts in its opening paragraphs:
1. The war in the air, in attack and defense, will be carried out by the Luftwaffe. The Luftwaffe consists of aerial forces: bombers, reconnaissance and fighters; antiaircraft artillery; and the air force communication troops.
2. From the start of the conflict, the air forces bring the war to the enemy. . . .
The antiaircraft artillery directly protects the homeland. Its primary mission is the defense of the homeland in cooperation with the fighter force. . . .
The air reporting service is a support for leadership and battle in the defense. In cooperation with the air warning service, it enables the rapid deployment of the civil air defense.
The civil air defense fulfills the aerial defense. It limits the effect of enemy air attacks against the people and their homes. primary task of protecting the homeland; however, it was a responsibility that involved "cooperation with the fighter force."
Fourth, the air reporting service with its lines of observation posts (later radar sites) and communications stations played an important role in providing an overview of the air situation as well as passing this information along to military and civil defense authorities. 
43
A subsection of Regulation 16, entitled "The Defense," offered a number of more specific guidelines for air defense operations including the organization of fighters and anti-aircraft artillery under a unified commander as well as the close cooperation of night fighters with both flak and searchlights units. Further evidence of the commitment to combined operations appeared in paragraph 2 73, which stated:
Cooperation between fighter and anti-aircraft forces requires the most thorough liaison. Simultaneous attack by antiaircraft weapons and fighters against the same enemy formation will normally not be carried out owing to the danger to our own fighters.
Fighters should engage the enemy before he enters the antiaircraft zone: an attack at the right moment can disperse the bombing formation and create favorable conditions for antiaircraft defense.
Paragraph 2 73 also cautioned that fighters wishing to press an attack within the flak zone did so at their own peril. The regulation further mentioned the extreme difficulty of coordinating fighter and flak operations at night and argued for a separation of engagement areas. 
The doctrinal tenets of the Luftwaffe did not remain relegated to the written page. Indeed, the Luftwaffe conducted several war games in Finally, the report remarked that "rapid engagement and full use of

In total, the amounts allocated for systems development and 61 Ibid., 38. Hitler's plan concerning these flak towers was later realized with the construction of immense concrete flak towers in the cities of Berlin, Hamburg, and Vienna. In addition to these mammoth towers, the Luftwaffe also constructed smaller concrete and wooden structures, especially for light flak guns. For a more in-depth discussion of the flak towers see Michael Foedrowitz, Die Flaktürme in Berlin, Hamburg  und Wien, 1940-1950 (Wölfersheim-Berstadt: Podzun-Pallas-Verlag, 1996). The personnel requirements necessary to fuel the increasing number of batteries was substantial. For example, the allotted personnel strength for each heavy and light battery was 143 and 179 men respectively, and ranged from cooks to gunners. ss This rapid expansion of the force could not be accomplished through the organization of active-duty full-time units alone. Indeed, the mobilization and training of reserve air defense forces proved critical with twice as many reserve heavy and medium flak batteries planned and equal numbers of searchlight batteries divided between the active and reserve force.
The Luftwaffe undertook a number of steps to facilitate the mobilization of these forces in the event of a crisis. One measure involved the selection of personnel from recruiting districts in the vicinity of the mobilization areas. A second measure entailed the concentration of weapons, equipment, and munitions at specific 64 "Organisationsprogramm der Flakartillerie [November 11,1935]," T321/Reel 3/Frame 4737718, NARA.

collection points {Beständelager) within the mobilization area.

68
Second, the Luftwaffe's commitment to the protection of army forces in the field required a highly mobile force in order to keep pace with ground forces conducting offensive operations.
In In October 1936, the Luftwaffe was satisfied with the results of the initial trials and ordered further tests. Prior to 193 9, the balloon barriers appeared to be too effective, constituting a significant hazard for Luftwaffe aircraft and leading to several accidents. These mishaps involving German aircraft resulted in restricted training heights for balloon operations. 
72
73
74
The flak artillery has the task, alone or in cooperation with our fighters, to protect every vital infrastructure of the State against aerial attack including the Wehrmacht, the economy, cities, the population, as well as the fighting forces of the army and the navy.
In order to do this air defense forces must be in a position to effectively combat enemy aircraft and the crews [of these aircraft] through moral and material effects from successfully carrying out their designs. 
82
Despite the implications of this debate on future expectations with respect to the flak arm, the question remained unresolved. Would the measure of effectiveness lie in the number of aircraft brought down, or would it be found in the more indeterminate standard associated with the success in protecting the bomber's intended target from damage?
A handbook published prior to the war by the Air Defense League entitled Air Defense: Guidelines for Everyone also addressed the issue of measures of effectiveness for the general public. The League's handbook identified three primary duties for ground-based air defense forces in the event of hostilities. The first responsibility of the air defense units was to keep an enemy air force at an altitude that would prevent precise bombing. The second task of the flak arm was "if at all possible to shoot down the aircraft, or at least to force it to break off the attack." The final duty of the anti-aircraft forces was to force enemy reconnaissance flights to the "highest altitude possible." 
83
In turn, the destruction of the attacker constituted a desirable, but secondary objective.
In addition, the author of the handbook provided a caveat to his discussion of groundbased air defenses by asserting that "the best air defense will always be attack-ready fighters." 
84
85
First, he called for weapons capable of engaging aircraft at an altitude of between 33,000' and 39,000' traveling at speeds of up to 375 m.p.h. Second, he commented on the necessity for finding effective methods to engage aircraft operating in instrument conditions (aircraft flying in or above the clouds) and aircraft using quieter engines.
Finally, he identified the use of increased protective armor in contemporary aircraft and described the associated difficulty in shooting these aircraft down.

In contrast, the mainstays of the Allied bomber forces the Avro Lancaster, the Boeing B-17 "Flying Fortress," and the Consolidated B-24 "Liberator," were each limited to a maximum speed of approximately 290 m.p.h. The Lancaster had a service ceiling of 24,500 feet, the Flying Fortress had a service ceiling of 35,000 feet, and the Liberator had a service ceiling of 28,000 feet. 88 However, B-24s and B-17s with a full bomb load were limited to ceilings of 24,000 feet and 30,000 feet, respectively. 89 Furthermore, U.S. Army Air Force bomber crews rarely conducted operations above 30,000 feet due to the physiological dangers associated with high altitude operations and the equipment problems experienced in conditions of extreme cold. 
90
Likewise, the introduction of quieter or muffled engines would complicate the work of the sound detector crews during the war, while improved armor protection such as that enjoyed by the "Flying Fortress" would allow it to absorb a great deal of punishment and keep on flying.
In fact, the ability of the "Flying Fortress" to endure massive damage became legendary by 1945. For example, in a raid against Berlin a flak shell hit one B-17; the shell blew a three-foot hole in the top of the fuselage, but the crew were still able to bomb the target and return 88 Jane's Aircraft of World War II (Glasgow: Harper Collins Publishers, 1995), 167,175,185,209, 215.

By 193 9, German commercial firms had constructed three different test models including the "A-l" or "Freya" radar developed by Gema, the "A-2" developed by Lorenz, and Telefunken's "A-3." The "Freya" was a general search radar with a range of between 24 and 45 miles and an accuracy of plus or minus 2,200 to 4,400 yards for range finding and plus or minus 5 to 10 degrees in target location. However, it could not provide altitude information. The "A-2" and "A-3," although capable of locating aircraft at maximum ranges of only 6 to 7.5 miles, were considerably more precise with a range finding error of plus or minus 110 yards and an accuracy of 3 to 4 degrees for the former and only .25 degrees for the latter.

was too great to protect them all. He then introduced a three-tiered priority system:
Category I: contains political, military, or economic installations of decisive importance to the war effort that must be adequately protected under all circumstances. Without exception, these [installations] receive protection by the creation of flak artillery bases in their vicinity during peacetime that are responsible for providing initial defense without delay [in the event of war].
Category II: contains political, military, or economic installations of essential importance for the prosecution of the war that require continuous protection, unless the situation makes this unnecessary. After the creation of the reserve flak units, these [installations] will receive protection from the reserve forces and equipment stationed in the specific region.
Category III: This category contains all installations, that under specific circumstances could require protection, whether due to heightened threat from a neighboring state, due to a planned or actual operation of the army, the navy or the air force, or due to the actual destruction of similar facilities. 108
This three-tiered system for organizing air defense priorities provided a viable framework for allocating the Luftwaffe's ground-based air defenses.
Deichmann The Luftwaffe learned a number of valuable lessons during the fall exercise. For example, one evaluation described the system for passing orders within the air defense network as "too slow and bureaucratic." The post-exercise appraisal also noted the need to improve the speed of communications within the air reporting system.
In addition, the attempt at creating a smoke screen over Stettin was judged a failure as a result of commencing the operation too early;
leading to the dissipation of the smoke before the bombers reached the area. Despite the areas noted for improvements, the overall exercise evaluation concluded that both flak and fighter forces had performed well over the course of the maneuvers.

The new air districts received non-continuous roman numerals coincidental with the existing army districts throughout the Reich.
The new air districts included the annexed areas within Austria and the Sudetenland. Although subordinated to the commander of an air region, the commanders of each air district exercised authority over all Luftwaffe flying and ground units within their areas, and were responsible for coordinating the actions of fighters and flak forces in air defense.

During the prewar military build-up, Hitler and Goring had lavished substantial sums on the creation of the finest ground-based air defense force in the world. Only two questions remained to be answered, "Would these forces be used in anger?" and if so "Would they be effective?" By 1939, Hitler had long since laid his plans for conquest, and the threatening clouds of war began to take shape on the European horizon.

The initial emphasis on the construction of air defenses centered not surprisingly on the border west of the industrial Ruhr valley. On The purpose of the Air Defense Zone-West is to create an aerial barrier. The enemy formations will be forced to an altitude between 19,500 feet and 26,000 feet. This means at once a loss of time and increased fuel consumption during the initial penetration and a corresponding decrease in the range of action. Furthermore, the necessity of having to climb to a higher altitude will limit the weight of the bomb load and finally flying at such heights means an extraordinary strain on the flying crews.
Hanstein then addressed an added benefit offered by the West Wall:
In order to bomb point targets the aircraft must descend and then climb again to 26,000 feet on the return flight.
In the meantime, the fighters are also in the air. Whichever aircraft are now badly damaged [krankgeschossen] or for any reason are unable to reach the safe altitude of 26,000 feet, will again be the prey of the A.D.Z. [Air Defense Zone]. And so one can imagine, that the existence alone of the A.D.Z., so to speak an "A.D.C. in being," is in any event not conducive to enemy aerial attacks.

After the war, General of the Flak Artillery Walther von Axthelm remarked simply that "The Air Defense Zone-West did not meet the expectations associated with it." 14 In this case, Axthelm's remark was somewhat misleading, as the Air Defense Zone must be seen in the context of the times. For example, British doctrine throughout the 1930s called for the daylight bombing of targets from approximately 10,000 feet; from this altitude, the flak forces of the A.D.Z. would have been highly effective in either engaging these aircraft or forcing them to higher altitudes. The R.A.F. simply chose to ignore the danger posed by anti-aircraft fires at an altitude of 10,000 feet and relied on the speed of the aircraft to get it through the flak zone quickly.

Corps underestimated the effect of flak, it is equally true that both Hitler and Goring overestimated the effectiveness of flak in the years prior to the war. However, they had undertaken substantive measures in creating the most modern ground-based air defense force in the world, ultimately, the foundations of the West Wall were built in equal measures on high expectations concerning anti-aircraft effectiveness and an underestimation of rapidly developing aircraft capabilities, but the cornerstone of air defense did not rest upon sand.
On  The commission's calculations, although strictly limited to flak guns and searchlights, demonstrated that there was a major disparity between planned and projected strength in the area of heavy flak guns alone.
In July 193 9, Hitler reacted to the deficit in heavy flak guns by ordering increased production of the 88-mm flak gun as well as accelerated production of all equipment associated with the operation of the heavy flak batteries.

Socialist government exerted prodigious efforts in the area of civil defense. The Reich Air Defense League (Reichsluftschutzbund) acted as the primary organization for directing all passive air defense initiatives. The League continued to publish its twice-monthlymagazine, Die Sirene, and organized exhibitions and essay contests throughout the Third Reich. By the end of 1938, the number of dues paying members had risen to almost 13 million women and men with over 63 0,000 persons acting as League officials.

With the outbreak of the war, both the German active and passive defense networks were put to the acid test of combat. It is clear that the senior political and military leadership held extremely high expectations concerning the effectiveness of Germany's air defense network. In the case of Hitler and Goring these expectations were especially lofty for the flak arm, which in turn received primary responsibility for homeland air defense.

Goring published a daily order to the flak forces in which he exclaimed "Every round from your barrels will guarantee the lives of your wives, mothers, and children and the safety of the entire German people."

his ability to discern the direction of aerial warfare as well as his open-minded approach to air defenses. He observed:
Air defenses (fighters and flak) have shown themselves to be very strong during the day. At the present, our fighters and attack aircraft are clearly superior to the British and French bombers with respect to speed and armaments. It is therefore to be expected that the British and French will favor the nighttime for bombing raids against targets deep within Germany. 36
Rudel continued by explaining that either night fighters or flak forces could conduct operations during periods of darkness. However, he cautioned that the use of both at the same time required "careful preparation" and was possible only under certain conditions. He also remarked on the key role played by searchlights in nighttime operations, whether used in conjunction with flak or fighter forces.
He even went so far as to state that flak crews were "dependent" on the searchlights.
In a telling aside, he declared that "at the moment the most [Gruppen) of dedicated night fighters.

In addition to evaluating the evolving air war over Germany, the In an analysis of the role of air defense forces in the Polish campaign, Rudel offered three suggestions for improving future performance. First, he maintained that flak command centers and flak forces needed to be moved from the numbered army level to a lower echelon and forward to the front lines. Second, he noted that flak forces could be used effectively in support of direct ground combat when the aerial situation permitted. Finally, he recommended that the number of guns in the mixed battalions be increased with the justification that future opponents would have more capable air forces.

From the German perspective, it should have been clear that flak forces operating in coordination with fighters increased the effectiveness of both.
In contrast, the official battle report of the Luftwaffe Fighter Group 1 concerning the December 18 engagement claimed thirty-four Wellingtons (out of twenty-four) shot down by fighters and credited only one aircraft to flak.

France.
German flak forces played an important role in the operations against the Low Countries and France between May 10 and June 22, 1940.  This table shows that Allied air activity increased substantially by the spring of 1940. The later missions also included flights as far as Munich and Vienna. However, for the entire period an estimated 75-80% of all flights were reconnaissance missions along the borders that intruded upon German airspace "only for a few minutes." 
81
The report also noted that, in general, planes immediately turned towards the west after coming under fire from the flak. In addition, Allied aircraft began flying above 19,000 feet after their first encounters with German fighters. Besides an isolated attack against
Freiburg on October 5, the first bombing raids in Air District VII did not occur until June with missions against Munich, Ulm, Memmingen, and the Black Forest. The success of German air defenses was modest.
Between September 1939 and June 1940, fighters accounted for seven 'kills' while flak forces also received credit for seven shoot downs.
The low number of aircraft brought down resulted primarily from the limited penetration of most flights into German territory. However, the report's most telling comment concerned the fact that not one aircraft had been shot down during night operations. 82
In the summer of 1940, the Achilles' heel of the German air defenses was in fact the lack of an integrated night fighting network.
In As the majority of the British bombing effort shifted to the hours of darkness, it became clear to the commanders of the flak forces that a new and improved tracking system was needed.

In contrast, Telefunken's "Würzburg" radar had almost double the range of the Lorenz device but was less accurate. However, the Air Reporting
Service already had placed orders for the "Würzburg" system and began receiving shipments of the devices in August 1940. This latter point tipped the scales in favor of the "Würzburg" device despite the need to upgrade its accuracy for radar gun-laying operations.

In July 1940, Hitler intervened in several issues related to air defense. First, he ordered an increase in the production of 88-mm ammunition to one million shells per month. He also raised production targets for 2 0-mm flak guns and ordered the use of captured flak guns in the defense of the Reich. 
100
108
Ironically, despite the increasing build-up in the size of the flak force, one of the greatest successes achieved by the ground-based air defenses in the early stage of the war involved the construction of numerous dummy installations {Scheinanlagen) throughout the Reich. by the passage of a streetcar. 
115
In order to lure R.A.F. crews to the phony target, the facilities were poorly lighted to make it appear as if the lighting was a product of sloppy blackout procedures. In addition, flak guns commenced firing and searchlights scanned the skies upon the approach of British aircraft in order to divert their attention from the actual target towards the fake. The Luftwaffe also detonated pyrotechnics at the fake sites to simulate bombs bursts in a further effort to divert approaching aircraft to the site. 
116
117
In one respect, flak batteries apparently tipped their hand through a too obvious display of gunnery.
German interrogations of British prisoners-of-war found that several remarked on the "extraordinary firing displays" in the vicinity of the dummy installations.
In the period between July 26 and August 9, British aircraft flew over several of the installations even releasing flares, but not their bomb loads. 
118
119
120
In fact, both Goring and Milch suggested improvements to the operations.
In the case of the latter, Milch ordered that only captured flak pieces be used at the sites, a measure that prevented the further dilution of German air defense resources and saved the best flak guns for operational targets. 
121
In August and September, the Luftwaffe calculated that the R.A.F. had dropped 415 high explosive (HE) bombs, 1,607  The success of the dummy installations in the early stages of the war offers another example for gauging the overall effectiveness of the entire ground-based air defense system. Although these sites were not bringing down British bombers, they were in fact achieving the desired effect of substantially diluting the impact of the R.A.F. attacks.
Furthermore, the existence of the dummy installations offers a tantalizing insight that helps in part to explain the results presented in later R.A.F. studies concerning the general inaccuracy of British bombing operations early in the war.
In any event, the impact of the phony sites needs to be considered in any equation for calculating the costs and benefits associated with the ground-based defense network. They required in fact few resources and very little effort to maintain. In addition, Milch's order to use only captured flak guns meant that the guns and, to some extent, the munitions were also an expendable resource.
Furthermore, these sites offered an excellent live fire training ground for inexperienced gun and searchlight crews as well as recentlymobilized reservists. During the course of the war, the installations gradually lost some of their effectiveness as the R.A.F. crews became better trained in recognizing them and as electronic navigational procedures improved.
In addition to the dummy installations, the Luftwaffe In general, barrage balloons proved most effective at night for the protection of discrete objects including dams, oil refineries, and bridges. This last point was of critical importance as the Luftwaffe's flak arm struggled in its early efforts to engage successfully British bombers in their nighttime raids against the Reich.
Unfortunately for Luftwaffe air defense commanders, not every element of their defense system worked as well as the dummy The poor performance in night firing operations was the result of several factors. First, accuracy suffered in part from the large influx of inexperienced reservists and hastily trained replacements as well as a shortage of fire directors.

District VI a prototype of a gun-laying radar assisted in the destruction of one aircraft at night with the expenditure of only thirty-nine rounds.

There were two reasons for the high number of aircraft destroyed by flak in the West. First, the R.A.F. conducted numerous attacks on port facilities and airfields in the occupied territories normally in the late afternoon against troop and supply concentrations and German ships preparing for the planned cross-channel invasion.

The only lighting was masses of blinding searchlights stretching along the Dutch and German coastline and strategically placed along the German/Dutch border and surrounding all major cities and towns.

The technological deficiencies in aircraft tracking systems did not prevent the air defense forces from pursuing a number of guidelines, and decrees. Furthermore, it offered a forum for feedback from operational units in matters relating to all aspects of air defense. 
5
6
The air defense leadership also focused on improving practical instruction. The shortage of radar sets forced the air defense units to continue their search for, and training of, personnel for service with the sound detectors. The Luftwaffe also conducted trials to determine the most effective method of aural detection by evaluating three procedures to locate the British bombers. First, they continued to use two separate sound detectors to plot an aural intercept from both devices. Second, crews tried locating the sound detectors at sites away from the guns in order to decrease the ambient noise level.
In contrast to the second method, as a third approach, some sound detector crews operated within the battery position itself to determine if better results could be obtained in direct proximity to the guns.
General Wilhelm von Renz, the former chief of the Flak Development Office, stated that the last of these procedures achieved the greatest level of success.
In addition, von Renz asserted that "success through surprise fire was possible particularly when a unit had moved into a new firing position, or when an enemy unit was on a constant course directed by beam radio. Sudden fire under such circumstances, with no preliminary warning of searchlights and so forth repeatedly produced astonishingly good results." 7
The primary weakness in aural detection attempts centered on "sonic lag" involving the distance traveled by the aircraft in the time The flak batteries awaited the introduction of the radar gunlaying equipment with much enthusiasm and optimism. Because the training state of the crews was poor and the equipment often had technical troubles, at first every success remained out of reach, so that the mood gradually threatened to turn around in the opposite direction. In the last weeks of February, however, we have overcome these deficiencies through increased useable target representations, and the batteries and the gun-laying radar equipment are on the best course in the second half of February to attain the good results that are possible with this equipment.
The report then ended with the telling observations that "the air defense units are in any event extraordinarily thankful that they henceforth possess a device that can lead to success in night gunnery." 
11
By the spring of 1941, the increased performance offered by radar was becoming important for an additional reason. The Luftwaffe's use Luftwaffe planners soon recognized the need for more flak rounds and increased monthly production quotas first to 400,000, then to 1,000,000, and eventually to over 2,000,000 rounds. 
14
15
In the case of the shell casings, the Luftwaffe counted on new productions as well as recycling expended ammunition.
But recycled casings needed to undergo a cleaning process before they could be used again, and the capacity of the cleaning process was limited. The gunpowder and explosives bottleneck was in part alleviated by the use of captured equipment and facilities in the occupied territories as well as through the use of alternate explosive compounds. 
16
17
In a period of nine months, the output of 88mm ammunition increased by 710,000 rounds per month compared to first quarter production figures. 
18
The difficulties associated with the production of munitions provide some insight into the complexity and scale of effort needed to create and maintain the air defense units. There were, however, other obstacles and problems associated with the increased consumption of munitions. The high expenditure of ammunition resulted in the need to replace the barrels of the flak guns at shorter intervals of time, a problem exacerbated by the fact that flak gun barrels wore out more quickly than regular artillery barrels due to the flak projectiles' higher exit velocity. Throughout 1941, the Wehrmacht lost an average of forty-one 88-mm guns per month due to excessive wear or destruction  in combat, a rate four times greater than 1940. 
19
20
The high wastage rate of gun barrels and the large expenditure of ammunition were just two of the problems encountered by the gun batteries. Additionally, the flak batteries experienced a serious incidence of flak rounds exploding in the gun barrels in the spring of 1941. This was obviously a severe problem as it destroyed the barrel and endangered the entire gun crew. The causes for the mishaps proved twofold. First, poor assembly of the rounds themselves, involving the threading of projectile housings with the shell casing, caused the majority of the premature explosions. 
22
23
ly Ibid. In contrast, the latter offered an example of the role of chance and friction in warfare, an inherent element in the prosecution of armed conflict.
In a situation report of February 20, 1941, General Kurt Steudemann, Inspector of the Flak Artillery, commented pessimistically on the current problems within the flak forces by noting that "in the near future neither equipment nor weapons and munitions can be characterized as sufficient for the tasks to be solved." 
24
Second, better weather conditions allowed for improved optical targeting using fire directors. Finally, the slow infusion of gunlaying radar promoted increasing accuracy within the entire air defense arm, as more of these units became available to operational units throughout Germany and the occupied territories.
In fact, antiaircraft units had received almost 300 of the modified "Würzburg" radar sets by the middle of 1941.

In any event, searchlights assisted both flak and fighter operations in the first quarter of 1941. In the period, fighters accounted for kills at an overall rate of 2. In the bureaucratic struggle over the flak, the army had lost a battle but certainly not the war.
In actuality, the army had controlled a modest anti-aircraft force since the start of the war. 61

clearly not the answer to the problem of nighttime gunnery, but the continued paucity of gun-laying radar made them indispensable despite their limitations.
In In this procedure, one night fighter flew within a specific area and worked with a radar controller who coordinated the intercept from separate radar returns received from the target and the fighter. The major weakness of this system was that only one night fighter could fly within the proscribed area at any given time. The R.A.F. quickly took advantage of this deficiency by sending streams of bombers through the same air space at short intervals thus overwhelming the German defenses.
In addition to ground controlled radar intercepts, the Luftwaffe also developed an infrared tracking device {Spanner) for its night fighters that could detect the engine heat of the British bombers; however, the range of the device proved extremely limited.

In a directive issued on July 9, Bomber Command restated the objectives of future bombing raids as "dislocating the German transportation system and destroying the morale of the civilian population as a whole and of the industrial workers in particular."

After examining post-strike photographs of the targets, the report concluded that no more than one crew in five of all aircraft dispatched had dropped their bombs within five miles of the correct target.
Furthermore, the flight crews had obtained even worse results in the heavily built-up and smog-filled Ruhr where only one in ten bombers placed their bomb load within five miles of the target.

The Flak and Popular Opinion Despite the R.A.F.'s objective to strike at the heart of civilian morale, the British bombing raids appeared to be little more than a  To be sure, jokes concerning the flak forces did circulate during the war. One of the most biting, and hence most popular, of these anecdotes involved the tale of a soldier who had been condemned to death and given his choice of several means of execution.
In the story, the apocryphal soldier chose execution by anti-aircraft fire.
He was then placed in a tower surrounded by three flak batteries, which fired for a period of three weeks. At the end of this time, the soldier was found dead, not from flak wounds, but rather from starvation. 108 However, one must be careful in overdrawing the significance represented by the gallows humor of a people at war. Even after the war when Germany lay prostrate and her cities reduced to rubble, the U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey found that fifteen percent of the population described anti-aircraft defenses as "adequate" and thirty-four percent described them as "adequate in the beginning 
By the end of 1941, it was clear that the ground-based air defense units had made considerable progress in the past twelve months.  The exchange between Portal and Peirse in the fall of 1941 identified the existence of a new radar countermeasure that would later

140
The most direct result of the catastrophe of November 7 was a Bomber Command order of mid-November limiting attacks to coastal targets and occasional raids on the Ruhr. In the wake of the disastrous raid, Peirse sent a letter to Portal on December 2, in response to criticisms concerning the heavy casualties experienced by 
139
Bomber Command in the mission against the German capital. Peirse wrote:
As regards our losses on Berlin, I certainly do not regard them with complacence, but I have to deal with facts as they are, and it is certain that with our present equipment and standard of training we will incur an average loss of approximately ten per cent in such attacks. The figures for individual attacks of reasonable magnitude in the past have varied from five per cent to thirteen per cent, and in the last big attack on the 7/8 th September it was nine per cent.
On the night of the 7/8 th November enemy fighter activity, as deduced from the number of interceptions reported, was only slightly less than normal, and a considerable amount of R/T traffic was intercepted although no 'Sieg Heils' were heard. . . . Further, a very accurate anti-aircraft fire was reported over BERLIN. A loss of at least ten per cent cannot therefore be regarded as unusual or unexpected.  
In addition to evaluating the performance of the flak arm, one must also examine the economic costs associated with the organization and maintenance of these defenses.    of twenty-seven percent, thirteen percent, and twenty-three percent, respectively. In the Reich proper, the number of heavy gun batteries increased from 537 to 744 (28%), light gun batteries increased from 395 to 438 (10%), and searchlight batteries expanded from 138 to 174 (21%).
7
The growth in the size of the searchlight batteries was 12 Dietrich Eichholtz, Geschichte der deutschen Kriegswirtschaft, 1939-1945, vol This report found that total aircrew casualties as a result of flak numbered 95 and total aircrew casualties inflicted by fighters numbered 105. in turn, the percentage of fatal aircrew casualties resulting from flak effects was 9.5 percent while the percentage resulting from fighter attacks was 14.8 percent. In contrast, the percentage of critical (dangerous) injuries inflicted by flak was 10.5 percent and critical injuries resulting from fighter attacks was 8.3 percent. The report also indicated that the casualties (all types) per aircraft damaged was seven times greater in aircraft engaged by fighters versus aircraft engaged by flak. 
18
19
The O.R.S. analyses often provided only one piece of a very large puzzle. For example, an aircraft damaged by flak was far more susceptible to fall prey to a fighter due to its decreased maneuverability, slower speed, or increased visibility due to smoke or engine fire.

For example, a report for the night of January 22 indicated that «controlled night fighters were very busy assisted by numerous lights."
in another example, after a January night raid against Bremen, crews reported, "Heavy flak intense and accurate with searchlight cooperation. Searchlights very numerous operating in cones of 20/30."

In fact, one historian of the air war has contended that being caught in the cones of searchlights was the «greatest fear" of R.A.F. bomber crews.

The Luftwaffe, however, faced a shortage of gun-laying radar throughout 1942. in turn, German industry began developing and producing an auxiliary firing system, designated as the »Malsi-converter.-These devices essentially could use the data obtained from a gun-laying radar set located at one site and then convert this data for use by a gun battery at a separate location.

Furthermore, the study concluded that in view of the limited sample and incomplete information «all that can justifiably be said is that on the whole, the ratio of losses due to fighter to losses due to flak is not greater than 60 to 35."

There is every indication that in approximately the next six months the quality of our A.A. gunfire due to the introduction of new equipment will improve very considerably. Nothing is known of impending enemy improvements, but it is reasonable to suppose that progress will be made. Although our losses due to enemy A.A. gunfire at night have been small in the past, they have shown a gradual increase, and it is considered that they are likely to increase still further, unless energetic action to implement counter-measures is taken.

ground-based air defense system.
The report also demonstrated a measure of strategic vision intended to prepare the forces of Bomber Command for future operations.
The report's forecast for advances in the German ground-based air defenses proved to be prophetic even if «nothing» was known of   Furthermore, he remarked that some of the needed resources could be obtained from existing and as yet unfinished partially manufactured goods and materials. He also noted that supplies of chrome lay in the Ukraine, but could not at present be transported to the Reich.
In  shortage of chrome was affecting the manufacture of artillery guns while sufficient amounts of copper were available to support artilleryproduction. He mentioned, however, that the heavy searchlights, the 150-cm and the new 200-cm models, required a high quantity of copper, 56 0 kilograms and 1,410 kilograms, respectively. Goring then interjected that changes in design plans aimed at substituting other materials were needed.

In a post-war interrogation, Milch made exactly this point as he described how his predecessor, Udet, calculated the need for 16 tons of aluminum and 4 tons of copper per aircraft. However, when Milch toured the aircraft production factories he found that some had stockpiled enough reserves for eight or nine months of production.

The beginning steps on the road towards industrial rationalization in the early months of 1942 came at an important juncture in the air war.
In  The March raids against the Ruhr provided continuing evidence of the success experienced by both German active and passive ground-based air defenses. Air Commodore J. Searby described the attacks using GEE in this period in the following terms, "It could take us to the Ruhr and within sight of the objective, but the precise aiming point, more often than not hidden by smoke and industrial haze, had to be discovered by visual means--an almost impossible task in the deluge of heavy flak burst and dazzling searchlights." Another pilot provided a vivid and detailed description of the approach to the target:
Long before you reached the target area you would see ahead of you a confusing maze of searchlights quartering the sky, some in small groups, others stacked in cones of twenty or more. These often had a victim transfixed, as if pinned to
; Greenhous et al, Crucible, 578, 611-612; see also Musgrove, Operation Gomorrah, 33.
the sky, their apex filled with red bursts of heavy flak. . . .
The Germans liberally sprayed the ground with dummy incendiaries and imitation fire blocks in the neighbourhood of important targets, hoping to attract a share of the bombs. Gun flashes, photoflashes, bomb-bursts, streams of tracer of all colours, and everywhere searchlights--it was all very confusing, especially when the air gunners were directing the pilot to avoid flak and searchlights in all directions at the same time. 67 
In addition to the active defensive measures taken against the bombers, the Luftwaffe also continued to conduct deception operations using dummy installations; however, by the summer of 1942 the R.A.F.
became increasingly adept at identifying these sites.
In one case, British bombers overflew twenty dummy sites in Air District VII during the night of August 28 but released only a single high explosive bomb on a site near Augsburg. Still, even as late as December, an R.A.F. bomber dropped ten high explosive bombs and 100 incendiaries on one dummy site. The interrogations of two downed pilots in September produced a mixed evaluation of the sites, with one pilot remarking that the lighting of the dummy sites made them easily discernible while another pilot described the effectiveness of the sites, especially those northwest of Berlin. 
69
The fire sites were simple but extremely effective decoys.
In the wake of a failed raid on Mannheim on the night of May 19, 1942, Harris   berated his Group Commanders over the issue of bombs being released 
68
over the fire sites.
In a lengthy passage, Harris showed his anger with his crews:
It is apparent from the night photographs and from the reports of crews, that almost the whole effort was wasted in bombing large fires in the local forests, and possibly decoy fires. Nevertheless, in spite of the now incontrovertible evidence that this is what in fact occurred, the reports of the crews on their return from the raid were most definite in very many cases that they had reached the town and bombed it. . . . The cause of this failure is beyond doubt to be found in the easy manner in which crews are misled by decoy fires or by fires in the wrong place.... somehow or other we must cure this disease, for it is a disease, of wasting bombs wholesale upon decoy fires . . As an adjunct to the dummy sites, the Luftwaffe also began to use smoke generators to conceal the primary target and divert the bombers to the fake installations. 
72
bombing raids. 
73
74
Despite the success of early 1942, the Luftwaffe could not defend the entire Reich or decoy all R.A.F. bombers away from their intended targets.
In If the object of the attack was to develop a lesson on the ability of aircraft to engender a conflagration, then the mission was a decided success. The raid devastated the ancient city center as incendiaries found ready fuel in the old wooden structures located throughout the district.
In the end, the raid killed over 300 persons, inflicted over a thousand civilian casualties, and seriously damaged over 2,000 buildings in the city. 
76
German reports estimated the destruction to the city center at eighty percent. 
77
The attack proved costly not only for German civilians, but for the crews of British bombers as well.
In the raid, the R.A.F. lost thirteen bombers or 5.5 percent of the entire force to German defenses, a rate according to Harris that, if continued over time, threatened to prevent the expansion of Bomber Command, or at the least keep its offensive from reaching its fullest intensity. 
78
Moreover, the Luftwaffe expected increased British efforts in the near future.
In a case of extreme historical irony, Goebbels noted in a diary entry prepared the day before the attack that "The Führer also does not put very much store in the threats by the R.A.F. He believes to be sure, that it is possible, that the English will risk a couple of very large blows. But the necessary precautions have been taken for this [eventuality] ," 
83
Despite Hitler and Goebbel's apparent optimism in the very shadow of the Cologne raid, previous experience had not prepared them for this type of massive attack.
In fact, the size and scale of the raid clearly caught the German defenses by surprise. By entering the continent along a relatively narrow front, the R.A.F. bombers swamped Kammhuber's night fighter system using the "four poster bed procedure" (Himmelbettverfahren) involving ground-controlled intercepts. This procedure divided the western areas of the Reich and the occupied territories into boxes. Within each box radar operators used two 
82
83
separate Würzburg Giant {Riese) radar; one radar tracked the enemybomber while the second radar provided the position of the night fighter. The positions of both aircraft were displayed on a plotting table and a ground controller guided the fighter to intercept the bomber. 
84
In fact, the R.A.F. lost an estimated twenty-two aircraft over the target; sixteen to flak, four to fighters, and two to a mid-air collision. In addition, 116 aircraft returned to the United Kingdom with damage, with eighty-five damaged by flak and twelve by fighters. 
85
85
88
In the wake of these attacks, the Luftwaffe leadership now faced more vocal demands from civilian Party officials for increasing the protection of their respective towns, cities, and industrial sites.
Party officials insisted on the need for more anti-aircraft guns and searchlights, requests that led to the transfer of searchlights from western belts in the occupied territories to the Reich. Kammhuber subsequently labeled the latter move as "a terrible blow." 
89
90
It was a lesson that Luftwaffe commanders were about to relearn.
Despite the manifold increase in the size of the Luftwaffe's ground-based defense forces, neither the German economy nor its manpower base could support the necessary expansion needed to protect every important target within Germany and the occupied territories.
One response involved an attempt to rely on mobility to move flak forces more quickly to threatened areas. For example, the Luftwaffe high command ordered the construction of increasing numbers of railroad heavy and light flak battalions capable of being moved quickly throughout the Reich. 
91
93
In fact, the concept eventually led to the creation of "super batteries" in the spring of 1942 involving the linkage of three batteries of four guns each to one centrally located fire director. The problems in transmitting firing data to twelve different guns at three separate sites proved "acute." However, with the introduction of the improved "Würzburg" gun-laying radar the Luftwaffe largely had mastered this problem by the middle of 1942. In the super batteries, the three flak gun batteries formed an equilateral triangle with a gun-laying radar and three fire predictors located in the center of the triangle. The radar fed the firing information to one of the predictors, which then electrically transmitted these values to each of the batteries; the remaining two fire predictors were kept in reserve in case of the failure of the main predictor. 
94
Finally, the super battery also reduced the number of technical support 
93
95
Axthelm observed that "In the time to come these super batteries proved themselves very well during the ever stronger and more intensive attacks in the second half of 1942 . . . " 
96
Goring, a man normally loathe to involve himself in tactical details.
However, it was equally clear that the super batteries were not meant to constitute a stand-alone air defense system, but rather were intended to be part of a coordinated interceptor and ground-based defense network.
In addition to organizational initiatives, the Luftwaffe attempted to increase the performance of the flak artillery by introducing more capable guns. In this respect, the Luftwaffe 95 Ibid. 
96
leadership belatedly recognized the capability of the previously mentioned 88-mm/Model 41 flak gun. In his meeting with Goring on March 6, 1942, Milch described the "gratifying performance" achieved by the new weapon, but also remarked on two concerns associated with the gun.
The first problem arose due to design of the multi-section inner-barrel that required the use of shells with copper driving bands as shells with steel driving bands tended to expand in the joints of the lower section and the cartridge case would not extract. 
97
Second, Milch discussed the disadvantage associated with the shorter life of the inner barrel of the Model 41, due to the gun's increased muzzle velocity, in comparison to the 88-mm/Model 36. This problem was mainly a result of the higher performance capabilities and hence higher muzzle velocity associated with the Model 41 that produced greater stresses on the barrel and reduced service life.

weapon of the Second World War.
In terms of efficiency, the 128-mm gun averaged 3,000 rounds per aircraft brought down, half as many as the 105-mm guns and less than one-fifth of the totals for the older 88-mm models. 
104
The The 128-mm flak gun was indeed an imposing and capable weapon.
However, its length of almost twenty-six feet and weight of over 28,000 pounds made it essentially a fixed-base weapon despite the Luftwaffe's efforts to build several large transporters in order to make the gun mobile. By 1942, resource restrictions led to the cancellation of orders for the massive "Meiller transporters," and the 128-mm guns were assigned to specially designed railroad flat bed cars, the roofs of the flak towers, or in fixed positions throughout the Reich. 106
With respect to the last point, Milch had suggested placing the larger caliber guns in fixed positions already in March, and by June
Goring issued an order to increase the numbers of anti-aircraft in static positions, including all 128-mm guns.

In the end, economic considerations outweighed tactical concerns as the Luftwaffe increasingly chose to build fixed anti-aircraft sites in place of mobile guns, a decision that would have important consequences as the fronts in the east and the west began to collapse in late 1944. 110
By the middle of 1942, the Luftwaffe began to feel not only the pinch of economic constraints, but the pressures of personnel shortages as well. 
111
In March, Jeschonnek informed Goring that this plan was impractical, as in the event of an Allied landing the crews would certainly face air opposition and would be forced to man the shore artillery positions and abandon the flak guns.

123 "Heimatflak (Home Flak) [January 8,1943]," AIR 40/Folder 1151, PRO. In this report, British intelligence noted the "tremendous strain on manpower" within Germany as a result of the activities of the field army. The report then continued that "It is not surprising therefore to find that an attempt is being made to ease this strain by the adoption of the policy of employing factory and office workers as part-time Flak personnel." In the end, the decision to form the Home Guard and Emergency Flak batteries can be evaluated from essentially two perspectives. On the one hand, the establishment of the batteries might be seen as an act of utter desperation. On the other hand, the creation of these units might be regarded as a measure designed to take better advantage of available manpower and surplus equipment in the face of increasing British bombing efforts and the looming shadow of American entry into the air war over Europe. The actual explanation appears to lie somewhere between these two interpretations. The worsening manpower crisis throughout the Wehrmacht clearly played a key role in the decision to search for alternative methods to man the Reich's groundbased air defense network.

If Hitler had been willing to forsake the V-  
After having more than two months to consider von Axthelm's suggestions, Goring approved the program on September 1. In his cover letter, Goring ordered:
The suggested performance improvements in the attached development program concerning the weapons and equipment of the flak artillery and the new developments, especially the flak missile and the super heavy flak gun (in close cooperation with the navy) are approved.
The development efforts are to be pushed forward with the most extreme vigor. 
154
Allied capabilities aptly demonstrated the potential pitfalls associated with worst case planning. In addition, von Axthelm, the trained artillery officer, displayed a surprisingly myopic focus on the flak artillery to the exclusion of a holistic view of ground-based air defenses. For one thing, he completely failed to discuss improvements to the dummy sites (Scheinanlagen) that had been used to such great effect in the previous two years.
In an ironic twist of events, Goring met with almost the entire of 1943, one of his few accurate prophesies during the war. 
166
In any event,
Goring reiterated his earlier order that all 128-mm guns were to be emplaced at fixed sites. Weise stated that lack of construction resources (Bauvolumen) hampered the expansion of the building of fixed sites. Goring responded that Speer certainly would rather provide the material for building fixed sites than those materials necessary for the production of gun carriages. 1S7
Subsequently, Goring moved on to a related subject and asked who was responsible for the construction of the dummy installations.
Jeschonnek replied that Weise coordinated these requirements with the Inspectorate of Civil Defense (L In 13). Goring then recommended that these sites be moved periodically in order to prevent the British from Clearly, the representatives from the flak artillery branch felt that more resources and persons were needed, but this did not necessarily reflect poorly on the current performance of the flak arm.
After a thirty-five minute break, the meeting reconvened and Jeschonnek responded to a question by Goring concerning the amount of "cushion" available in the area of flak guns. Jeschonnek informed him that "every useable gun is employed," and that there were not even any more weapons available for the barrier fire batteries. Weise then added that German industry produced the equivalent of twenty batteries every month.  182

In one respect, the Luftwaffe was a victim of its own success. As long as it held the upper hand, there appeared to be very little impetus to prepare for a coming air war they did not foresee, or refused to see.

The situation for the Luftwaffe at the end of 1942 constituted in many respects the calm before the impending storm.
In At the end of the year, Goring praised flak as the "backbone" of the air defense system on all fronts. 
212
The total number of confirmed aircraft shootdowns for all theaters since the start of the war stood at 8,707. 
213
In addition, the number of flak guns and the amount of air defense equipment had increased dramatically in the course of the year. The expansion of the flak 209 Ibid., 233, 237.

force proved to be, however, a two-edged sword, for the Luftwaffe had to resort to the employment of less qualified men and women in an attempt to keep pace with the growth of the various ground-based air defense sites. Indeed, the rapid expansion of military and civilian flak forces had produced visible cracks in the air defense edifice.
From the Luftwaffe's perspective, the mobilization of men and women from the civilian sector resulted in a decrease in the quality and readiness within the air defense arm. 
214
Up to this point, the air defense system for the most part had worked well. R.A.F. raids against Lübeck and Cologne had temporarily shaken many German civilians and angered Hitler and the rest of the Nazi leadership, but they had failed appreciably to affect morale or lessen support for the regime.

The set backs experienced by the Wehrmacht in North Africa and the Soviet Union engendered a corresponding increase in the pressure felt within the anti-aircraft forces.
In an attempt to ease the personnel shortages within the German armed forces, the Luftwaffe leadership finally acted upon the recommendations for the mobilization of teenage boys and girls discussed in the fall of 1942. On January 13, 1943, Hitler issued a directive, entitled "Comprehensive Employment of Men and Women for Duties in the Defense of the Reich." Hitler's directive proclaimed, "The need for forces for duties in the defense of the Reich makes it necessary to lay hold of all men and women, whose labor capabilities are not at all or not fully utilized, and to bring their abilities to bear." 
15
In the search for replacements, the Wehrmacht cast its net wide, including all men between the ages of 16 to 65 and all women between the ages of 17 to 50, a National Socialist levee en masse. The directive did allow for some exceptions including mothers of small children, men and women in the civil service, and men and women employed full time in agricultural
In addition to the mobilization of young men, young women found increasing employment in aerial observation command posts and fixed radar sites within the Reich and the occupied territories in 1943. The Luftwaffe drafted young women for service in barrage balloon and searchlight batteries, and, even, flak gun batteries.

"attempted to enter into love affairs" with these teenaged women. He remarked that he expected supervisors to protect the honor of their female subordinates and to treat them as one would like his own sister to be treated. Finally, he threatened that any future misuse of authority in this manner would be punished with the "fullest severity under the law." 
26
27
It is difficult to judge the full impact on the readiness and performance of the air defenses caused by the employment of these male and female auxiliaries. Without doubt, many of the young men and women drafted into service approached their duties with great enthusiasm and dedication. 28 However, training courses were often abbreviated or conducted piecemeal as conditions permitted. One former flak auxiliary described the specialized training as "short and concentrated" lasting between two weeks to two months. In fact, time pressures led to some young men being assigned to flak guns after only several days of training.

The continued growth of the Third Reich's ground-based air defense was necessary in order to keep pace with the expanded scope of the Allied bombing campaign, especially the R.A.F.'s offensive against the Ruhr in the spring. By March, Harris and Bomber Command were prepared to embark upon a major air campaign aimed at German cities throughout the Ruhr valley. The campaign against the Ruhr witnessed the marriage of tactical and technical innovations as the R.A.F.
employed "pathfinder" aircraft to locate and mark the target while using two improved navigational aids, OBOE and H2S. Neither of these innovations was in fact entirely new.
In the summer of 1940, Portal, then Commander-in-Chief of Bomber Command, experimented with the use of flare ships to identify the objective, followed by incendiary marking of the target, but initial results had been less satisfactory than expected.

Force" composed of handpicked crews. These crews were expected to become intimately familiar with specific geographical areas within Germany in order that they might lead bombing raids against targets located within these areas. After Peirse's departure in early 1942, Bufton approached Harris with the idea, but Harris rejected the Suggestion outright.

In the aftermath of the raid on Essen, 160 acres of the city including 3,000 dwellings lay in ruins, with an additional 450 acres severely damaged. The ostensible object of the raid, the massive Krupp factory complex, received damage to numerous buildings, but the raid failed to destroy the factory's heavy equipment or to disrupt production significantly. 
71
72
The attack on Essen has now inflicted such vast damage that it will in due course take historical precedence as the greatest victory achieved on any front. You have set a fire in the belly of Germany which will burn the black heart out of Nazidom and wither its grasping limbs at the very roots . . . and within the next few months the hopelessness of their situation will be borne in upon them in a manner which will destroy their capacity for resistance and break their hearts. 73 Despite Harris's florid description, the attack on Essen did signal a new phase in the battle for control of the skies over the Third Reich.
The most significant aspects of the attack for German groundbased air defenses involved not only the size of the attacking force, but, more importantly, the concentration of the bombers over the target

in a relatively brief period of time.

75
It did not take long for the implications of the R.A.F. effort to become apparent to some members within the Nazi leadership.
In a diary entry of March 6, Goebbels reflected on the course of the air war:
Almost every night massive air attacks take place against some German city. These [raids] cost us much in material and morale terms. For example, reports to me from the Rhineland indicate that the population of one or another city are gradually getting somewhat weak in the knees. That is understandable. For months the working population there has had to go into air-raid shelters night after night, and when they leave they see a part of their city in flames and smoke.... Through our war in the East we have lost air supremacy in important sections of Europe and are now in this respect somewhat at the mercy of the English.

hiding place in a cramped garden hut. For this young boy, the falling bombs evoked feelings of hope, not danger. 
77
In response to the raid on Essen, Goebbels remarked, "If the English continue to prosecute the air war in this way, they will prepare extraordinarily great difficulties for us." He then bemoaned the fact that Germany still did not have enough flak and that while the night fighters had achieved considerable success they could still not force the R.A.F. to abandon their attacks.

The inability to cover all potential targets and the necessity of shifting guns between threatened areas meant that there would naturally be areas left unprotected at given periods. In turn, the increasing ferocity of the bombing campaign resulted in greater demands on the part of the civil population for more protective measures. The operation of the decoy target indicator sites was important in several respects. First, the creation of decoy rocket sites married with the existing fire sites provided a further illustration of the Luftwaffe's ingenuity in the field of ground-based air defenses.
Second, these sites required little maintenance, proved difficult to identify from the air, and offered high returns on a minimal investment. Even if the sites proved successful in diverting only a portion of the attacking force, they had served their purpose well.
Third, the sites, although not by intent, may have played a significant role in inducing the "creep back" phenomenon associated with many Bomber Command raids during the war. Finally, the sites demonstrated the cat and mouse game of move and countermove being played by both sides in the air war over Germany.
In addition to the decoy markers, the Luftwaffe also continued to rely on traditional camouflage and decoy methods. For example, British intelligence identified a "dummy town" located northwest of Berlin described as "a realistic reconstruction by dummy lights, factories and marshalling yards of a nearby town or factory target."

case, the R.A.F. verified the existence of a decoy lake at Wedel near Hamburg altered to resemble the port city's famous Außen Alster. In this case, the deception was believed to have contributed to fooling a "large proportion" of aircraft during a raid on the night of March 3.
In fact, an O.R.S. report noted that "It seems likely that the whole village of Wedel has been made into a decoy for Hamburg, which it resembles somewhat in shape, and the possibility that such decoys exist for other German cities should not be overlooked."

In the case of the fighter force, Kammhuber envisioned the creation of a Fighter Air Fleet 94 Hoffinann, "Der Luftangriff auf Lauffen," 8.

resources on the scale demanded by Kammhuber to support his proposal for a Fighter Air Fleet. Hitler was not, however, oblivious to the need to increase protection to the Ruhr. He ordered that additional flak gun batteries be sent to Germany's industrial heartland as well as the relocation of some factories to safer areas.

The Birth of the "Wild Boars"
In March 1943, a young bomber pilot serving on the Luftwaffe Air Staff, Major Hajo Herrmann, prepared a report that identified a projected shortfall of German fighters in the face of accelerated Allied bomber production. Herrmann like Kammhuber, recognized that the German night fighter force needed to be increased; however, Herrmann did not merely call for the increased production of night fighters. In addition to increased production, he noted that "The huge shortfall in night fighters into 1944 can be remedied by operating day fighters at night, backed up with all possible technical, organisational and training support."

In one respect, many Allied bomber crews displayed a remarkably similar tendency during the final bomb run to the target. The issue of violent evasive maneuvers was vitally important, as excessive maneuvering by the pilot over the target could significantly disrupt bombing accuracy even if the objective measured the size of a city's entire central district. In fact, the experience of Bomber
Command in March indicated that only about forty-eight percent of aircrews placed their bomb loads within three miles of the aiming point. 
118
The enemy has put up a very great deal of effort into his A.A. defences with the result that our bombers have to face fire of considerable intensity. Much evasive action is normally taken with a view to minimising the effectiveness of this fire and bomb-aiming is in consequence rendered considerably less accurate and many bombs are wasted. The enemy is, therefore, achieving his purpose to a great extent.
The memo warned aircrews that, "a large part of the evasive action at present being carried out by bomber crews is completely useless against any form of A.A. fire," and underlined the "evil effects of evasive action" on bombing accuracy. 119 Bomber Command's Eighth Air Force counterparts also addressed this issue in the first years of American bombing operations. After taking over the Third Air Division, Colonel Curtis E. LeMay gathered his group commanders together to discuss evasive maneuvering over the target. In theory, the bombardier using the Norden bombsight assumed control over the aircraft during the final run-in to the target from the initial point (IP). The bombsight was linked to the auto-pilot allowing the bombardier to fly the aircraft from his station. LeMay mentioned, however, that, in practice, pilots continued to override the auto-pilot during the final bomb run. He castigated his commanders by observing, "Too many times, the command pilot, who is supposed to lead a mission, is the one who causes it to fail. Every time he sees a burst of flak, he takes the wheel and swerves his plane. That causes trouble for the whole group." He continued, "If there is anything that is necessary on a bomb run it is that there be no evasive action." 120 In his own memoir, LeMay described the initial bombing efforts of the Eighth Air Force as "stinko." He recounted, "It was SOP [standard operating procedure] to use evasive action over the targets. Everybody was doing it. And everybody was throwing bombs every which way."
121
Thus flak batteries, by inducing evasive maneuvering by both the crews of Bomber Command and their American counterparts, reduced bombing accuracy.
In the case of the Eighth Air Force, the effects of maneuvering to avoid flak proved even more profound based on the American doctrine devoted to the "precision bombing" of point targets.
In this respect, Bomber Command's area bombing policy certainly allowed for a more widespread bomb pattern in order to be considered effective; however, in the case of the Eighth Air Force, the likelihood of hitting a point target while conducting evasive maneuvers was almost nil.
In addition to somewhat unorthodox solutions, like Herrmann's "Wild Boars," the Luftwaffe also pursued more conventional methods in an effort to improve the Reich's air defenses. For example, the German military released a manual that dealt extensively with the question of fighter and flak cooperation in March 1943. The manual made the following general observations concerning cooperation between flak and fighters:
The employment of day and night fighters is the most important reinforcement of Flak protection. In areas where both fighters and Flak operate, fighters form the forward defences.
Successful air defence is dependent upon close liaison between the commanders of the day and night fighters, Flak, and the early warning system. Personal liaison is necessary between commanders of fighters and flak divisions.
If the command posts are not close together, liaison officers must be appointed and telephonic communication maintained. 
122
123
The manual also provided additional explanation concerning the liaison between flak and fighters during the day and at night. For day operations, the manual offered six additional "rules":
(i) Enemy aircraft will be engaged by both fighters and Flak. (ii) The fighter commander must advise the warning services and the Flak division or local Flak commander of take-off, position, height and landing of fighters. Flak divisions or local Flak commanders must report to the fighter commander the numbers and heights of aircraft picked up visually or by radar. (iii) As a rule Flak will engage leading aircraft of any attacking force. (iv) The fighter commander must decide how far into the Flak zone he will continue to attack the enemy aircraft. He must accept the danger from Flak fire, as an immediate cessation of the Flak fire is not always possible. As soon as the ground defences see that a fighter is in a position to attack, fire must be withheld. (v)
If a single enemy aircraft flies into the area, the Flak commander may, at the request of the fighter commander, order Flak not to engage.
(vi)
Fighters should avoid light flak zones of engagement.
124
These expanded guidelines for day operations clearly showed that, although military planners sought to maintain physical separation between the two arms, they also recognized that this would not always be possible.
In turn, fighter pilots were given a good deal of latitude in their decision whether or not to enter the flak zone.
The instruction to concentrate fire on the lead aircraft was in response to the American practice of placing the best crew and lead bombardier at the front of the formation in order to signal the bomb release point for the rest of the formation's aircraft. The Luftwaffe's flak crews apparently achieved a good deal of success in these efforts as reflected in the post-war memoirs of General Curtis LeMay. He recalled, "Then the flak batteries united in trying to knock down the leaders." He added, "Vaguely I knew that I was losing more Lead Crews than I was producing, and that our Division would be bound to go downhill as a result. Finally, I woke up, and put a big input of crews into the Lead Crew training program." 
125
The manual addressed the issue of flak cooperation with night fighters as well by noting that cooperation between flak and night fighters was "especially important" in order to "ensure that [one's] own fighter aircraft are not engaged by Flak and that maximum firepower is directed against enemy aircraft." The manual also directed that night fighter command posts must be collocated with the command post of the flak divisional commander. Furthermore, the manual established five "rules" for flak and night fighter operations:
(i)
The local Flak commander is alone responsible for the defence of the immediate target area; night fighters form the outer defences and have no responsibility for the defence of the particular objectives. (ii)
In night fighter areas, Flak has the right to fire up to any height, and also to fly balloons at maximum heights, unless special conditions apply in the area. (iii) In areas of light Flak concentrations, the night fighter operates above 1,000 metres (3200 feet), whilst Flak may fire up to that height. The night fighter must accept the risk that some rounds will burst higher than 1,000 metres. (iv) When single enemy aircraft are flying through the area, or if night fighters are in difficulty or have lost touch with their ground control, the night fighter commander may request the Flak commander to cease fire. (v)
Night fighter command posts must have a Flak liaison officer. 
126
In addition, the emphasis on liaison personnel illustrated a continuing effort to harmonize the operations of flak forces with their night fighter counterparts.
By the middle of June, the Luftwaffe's Flak Development Committee was in the midst of pursuing several technical initiatives designed to increase the performance of the flak force. One project involved the development of a 55-mm medium flak gun prototype.

(Luftminen). The aerial mines consisted of a projectile, roughly the size of a shoebox, fired by flak gunners to a point above the bomber formation whereupon it exploded, releasing a number of small explosive devices that descended on parachutes into the bomber formation.

The major drawback to the incendiary pellets involved their use of a contact fuse that remained armed upon its fall back to the ground in the event that it did not strike an aircraft.
addition, a suggestion was put forward to modify the fuses of the 88-mm projectiles with both a timed fuse as well as a contact fuse.
According to General von Renz, an office chief in Speer's armaments ministry rejected the idea based on the increased risks involved with the transportation of this type of ammunition. 
134
Ironically, the German flying bomb (V-l) project and not flak guns and munitions proved to be in the forefront of the thoughts of the Luftwaffe's senior flak officer, General von Axthelm, in June 1943.
Indeed, retaliation and not defensive measures were on the mind of many of the Third Reich's leadership in the wake of the intensifying Allied bombing effort. In a private meeting on March 9, Hitler confided to Goebbels that "the British terror attacks will be answered with terror from our side." 135 Hitler's determination to retaliate for British and American bombing raids found resonance within the German public, especially in areas devastated by Bomber Command raids. 
136
143
In any event, it soon became apparent that solving the overwhelming technical difficulties associated with missile guidance and control would require a substantial investment of research effort and considerable resources.
In fact, one report estimated that the training and assembly line preparations for a production run of 5,000 missiles per month using 14,000 workers would total slightly more than accompanying ground organization to support these operations.

The "Wild Boars" go to War
In In his post-war memoir, Herrmann described the situation:

147 Renz, Development of German Antiaircraft, 414, Kl 13.107-194, AFHRA.
We were not flying above General Hintz's flak but over Cologne-Mulheim, in the area of the 7 th Flakdivision, which was illuminating bombers and fighters indiscriminately. They fired on us without paying any heed to our flashing belly and navigation lights. Searchlight beams were concentrated around us, and ahead of us we heard the thunder of our artillery.
In the intoxication of that summer night's battle we forgot the countless flak splinters and other dangers that faced us, and we tore into the witch's cauldron hot with anger and spurred with enthusiasm. This was Wilde Sau pure and simple.
By the end of the night, twelve bombers had been brought down in the skies over Cologne. Herrmann claimed all twelve victories for his fighters, a claim that resulted in some acrimony between him and the 7 th Flak Division. Herrmann's fighters and the flak division subsequently received credit for six aircraft each.

150
In fact, the Wild Boar procedure relied completely on either searchlights or flak to provide illumination for the initial intercept, thereby allowing the fighters 
148
149 Ibid., 166-167.
to press home their attacks. Admittedly, it was the fighters that finished-off the bombers, but ground-based air defenses provided the necessary conditions for ensuring this outcome.
The success of the wild boars over Cologne did not go unnoticed. In the area of the Flak division in the Ruhr, where the illumination conditions are fairly good, you can expect, on average, that 80 to 140 enemy targets will be captured by the searchlight beams in the course of an air raid, and in fact will be tracked for more than two minutes. The requirement I place on crews is that every target which is tracked longer than two minutes by the searchlights will be shot down. . . . they can quite easily lose an additional 80 aircraft during the course of one night, if I get the necessary aircraft to do the job.

Additionally, Herrmann's night fighters also came to rely on searchlights for ascertaining their positions. Ground crews arranged groups of two to four searchlights in specific patterns to denote particular cities within Germany and established lanes of vertically stationed lights between airfields and important cities throughout the Reich.
In fact, the use of searchlights for navigation and illumination flares fired by flak batteries emerged as the primary methods for guiding Herrmann's fighters toward their targets. 
154
The R/T [radio transmitter] was full of noise. Curses were flung about, against each other, against the Flak that was peppering the fighters with gunfire or dazzling the pilots with searchlights, against the enemy that wouldn't go down but got away: curses at their own stupidity and bad luck.
The curses of the anti-aircraft crews erupted on other frequencies and so were unheard by our ears. Everything looked red.

On July 28, in the wake of the second raid on Hamburg, Goring ordered Milch to designate the air defense of the Reich proper as the main emphasis for future Luftwaffe production.
In turn, Milch ordered the accelerated development and production of an aerial intercept radar for the Luftwaffe's night fighters that would be impervious to British In contrast, Kammhuber's objections to von Lossberg's plan fell on deaf ears.

Axthelm also mentioned that the need for concentrated fires had led to the creation of the super batteries, but that many operational areas only had double batteries of four guns each and still lacked super batteries of their own. In turn, von Axthelm identified the primary obstacle to the establishment of super batteries as the lack of available personnel. He concluded his discussion by suggesting three tactical initiatives. The first proposal involved the combined targeting by all of a battery's guns on the leading aircraft in the bombing formation. The second suggestion involved the restriction of flak fire to the lowest flying aircraft within the formation. The final tactical proposal advocated the use of dispersed, but directed barrier fire barrages aimed at known primary approach avenues to the target. 
195
As he had demonstrated earlier, Hitler's immediate reaction to the growing devastation inflicted by the Allied aerial assault involved increasing the size and strength of the Reich's air defense forces. In a meeting with his naval leaders, Hitler optimistically predicted that:
We shall master the danger from the air through new methods, by expanding our anti-aircraft and fighter defenses. We must do this, because [the aerial threat] is an extraordinary burden on the people. ... We shall succeed in maintaining our armaments program; the new technologically advanced defensive weapons will make the air raids too costly and will cause them to be discontinued.   This statistical sample for a period of almost five months offers a strong inference that, at night, flak gun batteries assisted their night fighter counterparts at a much greater rate than fighters assisted flak in achieving aircraft 'kills.' In part, this result was to be expected as in the period between March and July fighters had damaged 183 aircraft rendering an additional 10 completely unserviceable due to extensive damage, while flak batteries damaged 2,155 aircraft and rendered another 37 unserviceable due to severe damage. 
218
The Battle of the Ruhr, the R.A.F. attacks against German cities, and the increasing strength of American bomber strikes into Germany offered a glimpse into the dangers facing German industry and the civil population in the coming months.
In the three months following the campaign against the Ruhr, many within the Luftwaffe leadership increasingly became disillusioned with the flak arm and began to place their hopes on Germany's fighter defenses. In contrast to the views  226 Webster and Frankland, Strategic Air Offensive, vol. IV, pp. 306-307.  calculus in which five times the number of flak guns had no effect while twice the number of fighters would double Allied losses is both misleading and patently false. Clearly it was true that twice the number of fighters might have a more profound effect on aircraft losses than doubling the number of flak guns, but according to Milch's logic there essentially existed an imaginary number of flak guns after which no gains could be made in aircraft destroyed.
In his evaluation of Germany's air defenses, Milch was guilty of committing several strategic and computational errors. American bombers, 9.3 times as many aircraft as Luftwaffe fighters in 1943.

227
linear progression, rather they involve several variables including types of guns, availability and type of fire directors, spacing of batteries, etc. Finally, it was an argument that Milch did not make that seems most interesting. He did not argue, as others have, that flak production impinged on resources available for fighter production.
In turn, it seems reasonable to imply that, at least at this point in the war, the oft cited resources argument played a much smaller role than is often assumed. Goring began the proceedings with a warning to his air defense commanders that "The Luftwaffe stands at the moment in its gravest crisis, at its lowest point." He then bitterly observed that the Luftwaffe had lost the trust of both the German people and the German fighting man. Goring continued with a description of the public's impression of the Luftwaffe:
The crisis is concentrated above all on the fighters, and certainly with the day fighters. And it is concentrated here because the people do not know the combat tactics of the fighters. The population says: our fighters run away and come too late; the enemy mass formations fly undisturbed for hours and in parade formation [Nürnberger Formation]that has become a slogan--over our cities.
Then the flak. Before they missed, and now they still miss. They are only astounded when they occasionally hit something. . . . With respect to the flak it is said-perhaps rightly so-they can't do it, it's just not possible, when the aircraft fly so high, they just can't shoot them down. Consequently there is not a crisis [with the flak]. The flak enjoys very high regard among the population and the fighting forces namely due to their toughness and unquestionable success in ground combat.
The reputation of the night fighters has risen considerably. It is doubtless that the population views this [the performance of the night fighters] as absolute progress. But here again the leadership says: by every high estimation of the activities of the night fighters, we must reconcile ourselves to the fact that now the bad [weather] season is coming when the night fighters will not be able to do much. 
234
On the one hand, it was clear that Goring was parroting many of the criticisms expressed by Hitler to him in previous conversations. On the other hand, the Reich Marshal made his own disillusionment with the flak repeatedly apparent in a number of disparaging comments. For example, he mentioned a complaint by the District Leader (Gauleiter) of Frankfurt concerning the performance of the fighters in a raid against the city. Goring acidly noted that the complaint did not mention the performance of the flak as "one expected nothing more from the flak than that they fire [their guns] ." 
235
He questioned von Axthelm concerning the expected date of operational deployment for the missiles. Axthelm responded that it would be at least twelve to eighteen more months before the missiles could be employed whereupon Goring j ibed sarcastically "Have you appointed such well chosen idiots there?" Axthelm responded that his development team included 500 of the best members of the flak arm. In this instance, von Axthelm received assistance from a somewhat unlikely corner as Milch interjected that the technical problems associated with a flak missile were "considerably more difficult" than for the A-4 (V-2) missile. Somewhat mollified, Goring exclaimed that all he needed was a projectile with an acoustical detonator that could be fired into the mass formations of American bombers. 
236
On October 8, the conference reconvened with a discussion of the current state of the Luftwaffe's defenses including the status of the measures designed to negate the Allied use of chaff (Window).
Kammhuber confidently reported that "the anti-Window countermeasures 243 "Monthly Flak Report-October, 1943 [November 1, 1943]" from the 1 st Bombardment Division; "Monthly AA Report for October [November 4,1943] from the 3 rd Bombardment Division; and "Monthly Flak Report-October 1943 [October 31,1943]" from the 2 nd Bombardment Division, 520.3813, AFHRA. On this date, the 2 nd Bombardment Division sent 41 aircraft against the submarine yard at Vegesack near Bremen suffering flak damage to 14 bombers without a loss. The official history of the Army Air Forces' proclaimed that by the middle of October the Eighth Air Force "had reached a crisis" as a result of the month's disastrous losses.

In contrast to their American counterparts, Bomber Command crews ended the year with a campaign against the most heavily fortified target in all of Germany, Berlin. Command had lost almost 5 percent of its attacking force in the raids; however, unlike the situation in 1942, the R.A.F. could now afford these losses, an ill tiding for a Luftwaffe stretched to its limits.
In August, Goebbels had exclaimed, "The air war is our open wound through which we are losing more and more blood.

little effect.
In the course of five additional missions before the end of the month, 2,826 bombers delivered 6,379 tons of bombs against Berlin at a loss of 187 aircraft and 1,870 aircrew members killed or captured.
In contrast, these raids resulted in the deaths of 774 of the city's residents and left over 43,000 homeless.

In April, Galland noted in a report concerning Luftwaffe fighter losses that "the day fighters have lost more than 1,000 aircraft during the last four months, among them our best officers. These gaps cannot be filled. . . . Things have gone so far that the danger of a collapse of our [fighter] arm exists."

flew on for terribly long minutes until finally we were passing over some large buildings almost in the middle of town. The formation was completely haywire. The flak burst were so thick it seemed to me some of the shells must be colliding with each other. A couple of bombers I could see were already heavily hit.
Ardery continued:
The flak was all around us, and we could see the sheets of flame in the explosion of many shell bursts. The ships kicked around in the air like canoes in a Lake Superior storm. . . . Once out of the flak, I looked around to take stock of our situation. Many airplanes showed gaping holes, many had feathered propellers marking dead engines. Some were smoking as if they were about to burst into flames, and a couple had gone down. 86
The routine employment of escorts to protect the American bombers in the spring of 1944 shifted the burden for air defense increasingly from the Luftwaffe's fighter arm to the ground-based air defenses. By the beginning of April, the Luftwaffe had 6,387 heavy flak guns, 9,333 light flak guns, and 5,360 searchlights stationed throughout 
Germany. 87

Reich's defenses to the frontlines became a common practice during the last ten months of the war, a practice that caused an eventual hemorrhage within the home front's ground-based air defenses.
As Allied armies advanced through France during the summer of 1944, American and British tactical and strategic airpower pounded German flak and armor formations in the West. After the landings, Flak
Corps III moved forward to support German forces near the Normandybeaches.
In initial operations, the corps claimed 2 5 aircraft destroyed while suffering "considerable" material and personnel losses.

Shortly after receiving Speer's letter, Hitler met with Admiral Dönitz at his headquarters on July 9. Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Hitler's senior military adviser, was also in attendance at the meeting. In response to Speer's appeal, Keitel asked Dönitz to assign naval forces to the protection of the oil facilities. Keitel declared that "at this time, the continuous destruction of these plants constitutes the greatest concern for the [further] conduct of the war."
He also informed the naval commander that the Luftwaffe had doubled the smoke screen protection of the plants, but that the air force resources
were not sufficient to strengthen adequately the defenses at these sites. Keitel, therefore, requested that the navy provide its allotment of 128-mm gun production as well as some of its own smoke generator units for the protection of the oil facilities, a request that Dönitz agreed to consider.

Of the eighty-two aircraft destroyed due to known causes in raids on Leuna, flak defenses accounted for fifty-nine, fighters received credit for thirteen, and seven fell to accidents.
In other words, flak accounted for 72 percent of known losses, a figure

The view from the cockpit confirmed the increased lethality of the flak defenses surrounding the oil facilities.  Leroy Newby, a Fifteenth Air Force bombardier, remarked that increased flak defenses around Ploesti had forced B-24 bombing heights up from 22,000 feet to over 24,000 feet, a profile that often required the bombers to jettison some of their bomb load in order to reach this altitude. Newby provided the following dramatic description of a raid against Ploesti:
We were less than thirty seconds away from the bomb release point, . . . As I shook the perspiration out of the chin section of my oxygen mask . . . there was a loud explosion just outside the nose section. A large piece of flak tore through the right side of our compartment and across, just above the eyepiece of the bombsight and out the other side. Two gaping holes told a graphic story. If I had not lifted my head from the sight, the piece of flak would have gone right through my head-or at least would have hit my helmet.
I got back to work and refined my cross hairs at the base of the tower of black smoke that was spiraling its way toward our altitude. . . . When the bombsight released the bombs, I hollered ^bombs away,' closed the bomb bay doors, and peered over the sight to watch the results of my handiwork.
The flak was now worse. The loud bangs were happening more frequently and the familiar sound of gravel thrown onto a tin roof never seemed to stop. Another of our sister ships peeled over on one wing and went into its death dive. 
50
In fact, the number of fighters assigned to the protection of these installations had fallen from 495 aircraft on June 1 to 255 aircraft by the end of July. 
58
In comparison, the records of the Eighth Air Force's 1 st Bombardment Division for this period listed 1,215 aircraft as "seriously damaged" by flak, or twenty-two percent of the division's aircraft damaged by flak. 
65
In order to provide a broader context for evaluating flak effectiveness in the summer of 1944, it is instructive to consider bomber losses due to flak in relation to total American bomber losses.
According to an Army Air Force operations analysis of aircraft losses, the Luftwaffe's flak defenses emerged as the chief cause of loss of American bombers in June 1944. Furthermore, flak batteries were inflicting ten times more damage than fighter attacks at this point in the war. 66 Slowly, some German political and military leaders began to recognize the improved performance of the flak arm.
In a speech of August 1, to the Luftwaffe's fighter staff, Speer praised the performance of the anti-aircraft force:
In the last few months the flak has shown that in massed raids on cities even more enemy aircraft can be shot down than had ever been believed possible. It will acquire an ever greater importance. In view of the expected shortage of aviation fuel we do not know how defence will fare both at home and against enemy aircraft at the front. However, the flak will at least force enemy aircraft up to greater altitudes and reduce their aiming accuracy accordingly. 
67
In mid-August, Galland telephoned Speer at his office in Berlin.
Galland sought Speer's assistance in an attempt to reverse a "Führer Order" transferring the Reich's fighter reserves from the defense of Germany proper to the Western Front. Galland feared that the young and inexperienced pilots from these units would be annihilated while serving no useful purpose in the West. 
68
I will disband the fighter arm. With the exception of several advanced fighter Groups, I will carry on air defense solely with anti-aircraft defenses. Speer, I order you to immediately submit a new program. Production is to be switched from fighters to flak guns and increased immensely. 
73

72
One indication of the increased value placed on the flak included the appointment of a flak general, General Otto Deßloch, to command the air defenses of Air Region 3 in the areas still occupied by Wehrmacht

By the end of the summer, however, it was apparent that neither flaktrained commanders nor flak defenses alone could hope to prevent Allied bombers from ravaging German cities and industry.
In their favor, the flak defenses were less affected by the growing fuel crisis than the fighters were, and sufficient quantities of trained crews still were available to operate the batteries at the most important sites. Still, the Allied attacks on the hydrogenation plants led to a precipitous decline not only in oil, but also in nitrogen supplies that affected the Wehrmacht's entire ammunition production. The resulting shortage of explosives led to the widespread use of rock salt as an inert filler. 
78
In the three months following the Allied invasion, Bomber Command aircraft concentrated on providing tactical support to British and American ground forces in France. During the summer, Harris' bombers attacked transportation networks, German naval shipping in French ports, and even conducted close air support operations for armies in the field.
In addition, Bomber Command, unlike its Eighth Air Force counterparts, proved enthusiastic in its raids against V-l launching sites located in northern France. 
79
81
Luftwaffe's new SN-2 radar had been impervious to Allied jamming efforts; however, the R.A.F. used the captured device to modify its radar countermeasures to successfully disrupt the German on-board radar. 
83
Command crews ventured against strategic targets within Germany, the Luftwaffe's air defenses were still able to inflict heavy casualties.
For example, on the night of June 12, Bomber Command lost 17 Lancasters in an attack on the synthetic oil production plant at Gelsenkirchen, 6 percent of the attacking force.

forces. There are several important points to be made concerning the percent of Wehrmacht resources devoted to the flak arm in this period. First, the total percentage devoted to weapons production remained essentially constant with a slight rise of two percent in the third quarter.
Despite the constant nature of these expenditures, production rose It becomes increasingly evident that it is the visual target which appeals to the Hun, and that at times he hardly even bothers to engage targets which are flying above 10/lOths cloud. His reasoning for this state of affairs may be that he is fully aware of his inability to overcome effectively the difficulties presented by the unseen target-difficulties which are now becoming even greater owing to the many and varied counter measures employed by our formations-added to which, the necessity for conserving ammunition (accentuated by local transport difficulties) and equipment, is probably a very real factor, resulting in comparatively stringent regulations restricting the engagement of targets when conditions are such that the chances of any kind of success appear remote.

Men and women of the flak! In the coming year, by day and night with every shot at the enemy's aircraft think of the murdered women and children, the razed and destroyed cities and villages, the demolished cultural sites of our people. And in close cooperation with our fighters, with unsurpassed zeal, with never tiring energy and a committed will to duty you will achieve our goal, the breaking of the enemy air terror.

At the beginning of 1945, Allied ground forces stood on the doorstep of the Reich. In the East, Soviet forces were massing for a planned two-phase offensive with the capture of Berlin as the ultimate goal.
In the West, American and British forces were clearing the bulge caused by the German attack into the Ardennes as well as pushing
Wehrmacht forces back across the Rhine.

U.S.A.A.F. and the R.A.F. had risen to over 10,000 bombers and more than 13,000 fighters, a force capable inflicting vast destruction while roaming at will across the skies of the Reich. 
125
Ironically, in the last four months of the war the Luftwaffe's anti-aircraft defenses increasingly found themselves flung against tanks and not bombers as the ring of Allied ground armies closed around East.

A definitive accounting of the total death toll is not possible as at the time of the bombing the city was filled with thousands of refugees fleeing from the advancing Soviet forces in the East; however, the estimate of 25,000 is supported in part by the records of the Dresden police which gave a total of 18,375 dead among the city's registered residents.
In addition to the lack of munitions, a shortage of fuel and transportation forced the Luftwaffe to commandeer milk trucks and fire engines to shift Berlin's flak defenses within the city.

In April, the flak arm went from the farcical to the absurd as 3,000 flak personnel trapped in East Prussia were withheld from ground combat until they could be re-equipped with flak weapons while fifty flak batteries composed entirely of women trained for combat.

supporting fire from other bombers, these "stragglers" became easy prey for Luftwaffe fighter pilots who viewed these aircraft as preferred victims for adding to their shootdown totals.

In the case of fighters, one must take into account the infrastructure costs associated with the construction and maintenance of airfields, aircraft upkeep and repair, fuel costs, as well as the expenditure involved in pilot training with its specialized training and hundreds of flight hours.
One method by which the cost of an individual flak kill can be placed into perspective involves examining the production costs of some of the aircraft that they were intended to destroy. For example, the cost of a fully outfitted B-17 was approximately $292,000 while a fully equipped B-24 cost approximately $327,000 in 1942. 
51
52
In any event, it is apparent that a cost of $107,000 per shootdown for the heavy flak guns and $15,000 per shootdown for the light flak guns was not excessive in comparison to the costs involved in the production of these aircraft. However, the entry of the United States into the war with its vast economic resources and massive production potential

industrial workers in the search for Wehrmacht replacements leaving very few able-bodied workers in all but the most critical areas.
If the flak arm did not rob the Wehrmacht of a vast manpower reserve, the creation of thousands of batteries of anti-aircraft artillery did have an effect on the production of field artillery by consuming resources for flak production that might have been used to manufacture artillery for German forces in the field. In his postwar memoir, Albert Speer remarked:
Our heaviest expense was in fact the elaborate defensive measures.
In the Reich and in the western theaters of war the barrels of ten thousand antiaircraft guns were pointed toward the sky. The same guns could have well been employed in Russia against tanks and other ground targets. Had it not been for this new front, the air front over Germany, our defensive strength against tanks would have been about doubled, as far as equipment was concerned.

army, even as late as December 1944, despite the emphasis on increasing the size of the flak force.
In fact, one USBSS report found that Wehrmacht ground forces were better armed at the beginning of 1944 than at the start of the war against the Soviet Union, although the artillery situation, not including anti-tank and self-propelled guns, was viewed as "slightly poorer."
63
64
65
In addition to production figures, it is also necessary to note that Wehrmacht doctrine favored the tank at the expense of artillery.
In fact, it was mobility and not firepower that was intended to propel German ground forces to victory. 
66
Munitions Division, The United States Strategic Bombing Survey: Ordnance Industry Report (Washington, D.C.: GPO, 1945), B-5, B-7, B-8, B-10. favor armor at the expense of field artillery provides an important contextual factor that helps explain in part the Wehrmacht's priorities with respect to field and anti-aircraft artillery.
In the end, the production of flak artillery and field artillery required the Wehrmacht to decide between competing priorities. In turn, the allocation of artillery production between the army and Luftwaffe appears adequately to have balanced the conflicting demands between armies at the fronts and Luftwaffe forces protecting against a growing Allied aerial armada.
In the last year of the war, it was munitions and not artillery tubes that proved the greatest concern to the Wehrmacht leadership.
According to one USSBS report, the Allied attacks against the synthetic oil facilities and hydrogenation plants not only affected Germany's fuel situation, but also "had a profound effect on Germany's powder and

Aircraft operating in or above the clouds were therefore impossible to locate using optical systems.

The term "Maginot mentality" referred to a series of military border installations designed to protect France's eastern border in the event of a war with Germany. The term later became associated with a attribute of 'defense-mindedness,' the psychological antithesis of the pre-World War I French emphasis on the offensive.

The three-piece construction did harbor some technical difficulties as the steel cartridge cases expanded upon firing and became stuck in the barrel at the seam where the bottom two sections joined, a problem that led to the requirement for brass casings. Later versions incorporated a two-piece barrel to alleviate this problem.

After allegations that American airmen were purposefully landing in these countries in order to avoid further bombing missions, Spaatz requested an investigation by neutral officials to determine the validity of these claims. The investigation subsequently determined that the vast majority of the aircraft had been too badly damaged to return to their bases in England.

In contrast, 94   percent of all 105-mm flak guns and 99 percent of the 128-mm flak guns were stationed within the borders of the Reich at this time. The reason for this disparity resulted in large part due to the general use of fixed or stationary gun positions for the 105-mm and 128-mm guns.

Führer himself must decide that." Jeschonnek suggested that captured Russian weapons be used to replace German flak guns in the East and East Prussia. Weise expressed reservations with this plan based on the raids against Danzig and Königsberg. He then observed that the "largest flak gap" was in middle and southern Germany and that in relation to its size Berlin was insufficiently protected. He also remarked that only at this time were the Home Guard heavy flak batteries beginning to appear. Weise's comments again must be viewed with a degree of skepticism. As previously discussed, Home Guard heavy flak batteries had appeared in Air District VII already in July.
In addition, his comments on the "insufficient" protection of Berlin and his overall evaluation of the lack of guns seemed to have been based on two motives. First, he was attempting to support his argument for more weapons. Second, although the capital had not been attacked since the November of 1941, Weise sought to provide himself with cover should Berlin be struck on the scale experienced in Cologne. Still, Kammhuber supported Weise's request to strengthen the Berlin defenses and both men argued for the establishment of the Fourth Fighter Division to increase the defenses around the capital.

responded that, in addition to the guns and the gun-laying radar, each battery had a fire director, an auxiliary fire director, and an optical distance-measuring device. Weise then added that in Air Region, Center, there were 2,800 heavy flak guns whereupon Goring exclaimed, "No country in the world has such a strong flak artillery [arm]."
Weise quickly moved to downplay expectations by wistfully observing that he could think of nothing better, than to be able to protect "little England" with the forces available to him.

In fact, von Axthelm would continue this pattern of behavior in the coming years. Like his instigation of Major Haider's memorandum concerning missile developments, von Axthelm allowed others to take the point in issues surrounding air defense. He seemed content to observe from the sidelines instead of risking direct confrontation with either Goring or Milch. Finally, Weise, the commander of the Reich's air defenses, repeatedly sought to downplay expectations by noting his need for more personnel and equipment.
The atmosphere of the conference provided a striking contrast to the tone of von Axthelm's development program, a program signed on the very day during which the conference took place. Indeed, the conference itself demonstrated that the flak forces were experiencing stresses and strains caused by personnel and equipment demands, but that overall these problems were neither crippling nor seriously

Hitler viewed the missiles as the perfect weapons for retaliating against the Allied bombing campaign.

Axthelm briefed Goring on the proposed construction arrangements for the command and supply areas as well as for the planned 96 launch sites. Goring ordered that the sites proposed by von Axthelm be constructed with the "greatest urgency." Furthermore, he agreed to contact Speer and Fritz Sauckel, the Third Reich's chief of slave labor, with a request that additional workers and materials be provided for development and production. Finally, Goring remarked on his hope for the production of an astounding 50,000 missiles by the end of the development stage as well as his intention to brief Hitler on the plans for the employment of the missiles.

Based on Herrmann's description, one might suspect that numerous Luftwaffe fighters must have fallen victim to their own flak guns.
Losses to friendly fire did in fact occur and were certainly a source of concern for the Luftwaffe, but not a major problem. Although some 229 aircraft were lost in 1943, the pilots were still over German territory and could often return to their duties, albeit with psychological if not physical wounds.

The psychological effects of the British and American attacks against the Ruhr and Hamburg rippled throughout Germany among the civil populace.
In the wake of the raids, the Security Service reported that the bombing of Hamburg had produced a "shock effect" on the "population of the entire Reich." Rumors also spread throughout Germany's western industrial area that Berlin had "written off" the Rhineland.
Furthermore, a Security Service report noted that many blamed Goring for the fiasco and questioned why the Luftwaffe did not possess adequate defenses to prevent such massive attacks. Finally, increasing numbers of persons were becoming impatient with the Luftwaffe's failure to conduct the promised retaliatory strikes against Great Britain. 182
Public dissatisfaction combined with the impact of the devastating physical destruction experienced by Germany's second largest city led to a frantic search for measures to improve the Reich's air defenses.

In this case, the air district cautioned that "at the very least" the inner defense ring needed to be manned by German auxiliaries.

Hamburg. Axthelm argued that the attacks provided two lessons for Germany's ground-based air defenses:
(1) The formulation of the question 'shootdown or deterrence' has become untenable, as the flak artillery is no longer capable of conducting a real defense against the enemy mass attacks. There remains only one possibility--by the present condition of the means available at this time--only through shootdowns [can] the enemy be weakened in the long run.
(2) It has been shown that the shootdown rate with solely electrical [radar] tracking is significantly lower as compared to targets held visually by searchlights.
The reason for this lies in the second place on the better firing particulars.
In the first place, the success is attributable to the concentration of flak fire of many batteries against targets held in searchlight beams.
Axthelm's statement concerning the flak's objective of achieving shootdowns instead of deterring or impeding an attack clearly showed his support for measuring the effectiveness of the flak arm by the number of aircraft destroyed.
Indeed, this attitude continued to dominate the thinking of the Luftwaffe's leadership throughout the war.

Apparently, Hitler had placed his faith in the promise of his rocket program and the further expansion of the Reich's air defense forces.
In pursuit of the latter objective, the Luftwaffe drafted another group of young men from German secondary schools on August 16. 
The raids against Hamburg proved to be the last chapter in Harris' "Battle of the Ruhr," but it was also the opening phase of a 208 Bomber Command Operational Research Section Report, 'S' Series, S-98, "The Effect of Window on Bomber Operations [ August 19, 1943]," AHB.

In contrast, Herrmann's wild boars operating with the searchlights achieved a number of kills and the R.A.F. lost 26 bombers. 5 During this raid, the flak gun batteries achieved little success as they were prohibited from firing above 16,500 feet in order to give Herrmann's fighters free reign over the capital.

The two raids against Berlin cost Bomber command 54 aircraft and accomplished very little. These raids did show, however, that the Luftwaffe had begun to recover from the setbacks of late 1943. Despite the problems experienced due to Allied jamming initiatives and the intensifying level of air attacks, German air defenses had effectively blunted the British and American bombing effort by the beginning of the

After the initial raids on Berlin at the beginning of the year, Bomber Command visited the capital of the Reich four more times in January.
In addition to these raids, Bomber Command also struck the  In his post-war memoir Harris evaluated the effort against the capital:
The Battle of Berlin cost us 300 aircraft missing, which was a loss rate of 6.4 percent. This could not be considered excessive for a prolonged assault on this distant, most difficult, and most heavily defended target; . . . But it did mean that the enemy had succeeded in reorganising his defences and finding new tactics.

In addition to the establishment of these units in port cities, the Luftwaffe stationed smoke generator units at synthetic oil plants throughout Germany.
Approximately 500 chemical smoke generators and 6 00 ovens for smoke production were located at the synthetic oil facility at Leuna alone by fall 1944.

On the one hand, the success achieved by German air defenses demonstrated the benefits of integrated fighter and flak operations.
On the other hand, the losses and damage suffered by the bombers highlighted the continued effectiveness of anti-aircraft fire in areas of concentrated flak defenses.

In fact, without the Luftwaffe's considerable searchlight force, Herrmann's "Wild Boar" procedure would have been unworkable, and the success of flak gunnery at night would have been seriously diminished.
In addition, both barrage balloons and smoke generator units effectively augmented the Luftwaffe's active defenses at various times.
By the end of 1944, the former suffered a precipitous decline in efficacy, while the latter literally ran out of the chemicals needed to sustain 'smoke' operations.
In destroyed by flak fire. The strict nature of German shootdown confirmation procedures provides one explanation for the disparate view of flak effectiveness between the R.A.F. and German reports. In order to receive credit for a "confirmed" kill, Luftwaffe flak batteries were required to submit a number of items to the Luftwaffe's "Shootdown Verification Commission." These items included a standardized report from the flak battery claiming the shootdown, a deposition from at least one impartial witness, a sketch by the witness and the flak battery of the location of the supposed crash site, and physical remains of the wreckage.

A final hidden effect induced by ground-based air defenses involved the psychological reactions of the aircrews forced to face flak and searchlights in their daily or nightly raids against the Reich. The constant flights into the teeth of Germany's most strongly defended areas began to take a physical and psychological toll on both the crews of Bomber Command and the United States Strategic Air Forces.
The threat created by the flak batteries and the probing searchlights were two major sources of emotional stress for British airmen.
Likewise flak proved a chief source of stress for American aircrews.
John Comer, an aerial engineer and gunner in a B-17, exclaimed, "Flak, while not nearly as dangerous as fighters, scared the hell out of me.
When it was bursting around us I stood in my turret and cringed and shivered." 32 Another American ball turret gunner on a B-   Furthermore, of the regular service personnel serving with the flak, 21 percent were between the ages of 3 9 and 48 while a further 35 percent were older than 48 or medically exempted from combat duty.

In the end, the flak arm could not change the fate of the Reich nor save German cities and industry from destruction, but these defenses clearly deserve more credit than they have received.
