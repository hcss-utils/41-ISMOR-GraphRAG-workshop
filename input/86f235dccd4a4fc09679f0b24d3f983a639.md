Catalonia's independence referendum in 2017, by which the Spanish autonomous region of Catalonia wanted to secede from the rest of Spain, is another example of how the Russian Federation took a favorable opportunity to amplify an internal conflict in a NATO and EU member-state.
In doing so, Russia's main goal was probably to weaken and divide the West and its organizations.
