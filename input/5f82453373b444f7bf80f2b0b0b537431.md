# Fulltext:
The German Army developed the concept of decentralized execution known as Auftragstaktik between the Wars of Unification and World War I. This concept evolved within the German Army command culture that included the culture of attack and the importance of the general staff officer.
Auftragstaktik enabled the German Army to more effectively react to the rapidly changing conditions of the modern battlefield.
This increased effectiveness would be achieved through the use of mission-type orders that provided subordinates with the purpose and intent of the mission.
It required the subordinate to determine the best way to execute the mission and entrusted him to make decisions within disciplined initiative due to changing situations on the battlefield.
With these concepts in place, the army developed plans in the event of war to enable a quick, decisive victory over France in the west before turning to the east to fight Russia.
As the war began, the German Army enacted its war plan.
In executing the Marne Campaign, the German Army failed to effectively conduct decentralized execution due to key leader appointment, span of control issues, lack of clarity in purpose of orders, communications technology, lack of situational understanding, and the culture of attack.
