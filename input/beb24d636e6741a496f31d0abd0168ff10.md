Russia is waging wide-reaching information warfare with the Western world.
A significant part of its ongoing efforts takes place on social media, which Russia has employed to spread disinformation and to interfere with the internal politics of other countries, targeting varied audiences, including the U.S. military.
The impact of Russia's social media activities on specific outcomes (such as votes or policy decisions) is uncertain to date, but Russian information warfare threatens to undermine the integrity of democratic processes, erode the belief in factual truths, and cause concrete harm with well-timed or sophisticated disinformation.
We sought to help the U.S. Air Force (USAF) and the joint force more effectively respond to this threat.
