Russian military involvement in Afghanistan has a long history, going back to Tsarist expansions in the so-called "Great Game" between Russia and Britain.
This interest in the region continued on through the Soviet era, with billions in economic and military aid sent to Afghanistan between 1955 and 1978.
However, few in the west took notice until the Soviets took the city of Kabul in 1979.
This was the first time in several decades that the Russians fought an unconventional war against an enemy that used guerrilla style tactics.
Up to this point, the Russians had successfully conducted and thwarted unconventional means of warfare.
