Threat operations will seek to separate attacking combat vehicles from their accompanying infantry.
They will use light and portable anti-armor ambushes to attrit the enemy whenever possible.
They will carefully recon firing positions to ensure that minimum arming range restrictions will not hamper operations.
They will integrate mines and barricades into the overall defensive plan to attrit, slow, divert, and separate enemy elements.
Operations such as these were responsible for destroying 112 of 120 combat vehicles of the Russian 131st Motorized Rifle Brigade in January 1995 while engaged in operations in Grozny, Chechnya.
