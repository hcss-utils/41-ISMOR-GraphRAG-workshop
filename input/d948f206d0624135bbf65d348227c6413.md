-Niccol√≤ Machiavelli, The Art of War On December 26, 1991, the world stood still as the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) dissolved when the Supreme Soviet voted to abolish the union between the fifteen independent republics.
As the post-Soviet world approaches the thirtieth anniversary of the fall, through the ashes a more modern federation has risen in its wake.
During these years, Russia has modernized its military forces to re-emerge as a near-peer threat to the United States.
The Russian Federation has upgraded its tank corps, air forces, and air defense assets that, in some cases, outperform the US equivalent.
On February 20, 2014, Russian forces conducted joint military exercises in vicinity of the Crimean Peninsula of Ukraine, resulting in the annexation of this vital piece of terrain, and invaded the eastern portion of the country.
The speed, tempo, and results shocked the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Western powers into wondering how the Russian military was able to pull off such a military operation so discretely and deceptively.
