Russia also maintains an array of space surveillance control facilities, which make up its Russian Outer Space Control System.
Russia's civilian and military functions overlap in some areas, and, as with most national surveillance systems, information is shared.
Control of Russia's military space and counterspace assets takes place from several facilities around Moscow, including the 821st Main Space Surveillance Centre, the 820th Main Centre for Missile Attack Warning, and the 153rd Main Trial Centre for the Testing and Control of Space Means.
The three control centers are part of Russia's Outer Space Control System.
