Russia had considered Tartus little more than a "minor resupply point" with "little military significance" since the fall of the Soviet Union but that it acquired increasing significance as a core foundation of Russia's aspirations to develop an expeditionary force following its initial deployment in Ukraine.
Indeed, losing access to Tartus would mean the loss of a critical naval resupply and logistics hub in the eastern Mediterranean, a prospect that Russia deemed unacceptable.
