Looking back, Russia's development of its ground capabilities reflects the strategy we identified for the armed forces, within the constraints of Russia's economic performance, defense budget, demographics, and military personnel system.
Russia improved its long-range strike, C4ISR, and air defense capabilities to strengthen strategic deterrence.
Changes in military personnel policy, among other reforms, enabled the professionalization, increased reliability, and greater readiness of Russia's rapidly deployable forces.
In turn, these forces strengthened Russian military capabilities for the task of regional dominance, as shown by its operations in Ukraine.
Russia's investment in rapidly deployable forces and long-range strike also improved its expeditionary capabilities, as shown by Russia's operations in Syria.
Still, Russia retained the ability to fight a major ground war with the West or China through the capability of its maneuver ground forces, indirect fires, and long-range strike, its rescue of firms producing ground vehicles, and the retention of conscription.
