We begin with three basic assumptions.
First, the Russian military incurs costs in recruiting, training, and retaining these personnel (e.g., salaries, benefits, housing, leadership training).
Second, we Russian military leaders have preferred to retain some, but not all, of these professional personnel based on evolving manning requirements at various ranks, specialties, and services.
Third, the Russian military has had a finite amount of resources that it can dedicate to retaining these professionals.
Under these assumptions, we review recent, publicly available research on the Russian manpower and personnel system.
In the next section, we review our sample of Russian research that highlights what types of issues might have been salient to Russia's military leaders prior to the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine.
