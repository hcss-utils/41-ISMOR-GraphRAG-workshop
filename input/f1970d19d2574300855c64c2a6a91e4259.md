On the surface, Hitler's declaration of war against the US appears to be a repudiation of his single front strategy.
Some authorities point out that this is not necessarily the case.
First, in December 1941, Hitler's planned submarine warfare against the US did not change Hitler's long-held plan to concentrate against Russia.
He could not use his submarine forces to directly attack Russia.
Since his submarine forces were available and already deployed to the Atlantic, and if in his mind he was going to have to fight the United States sooner or later, he might just as well attack while his submarine fleet was potent.
