Successful counterinsurgencies require engagement with a target population and control of territory.
Airpower is not suited for direct contribution to either task, but is exceptionally well suited for an indirect contribution.
In that respect, "we are critical enablers" was valid.
On the other hand, while fighting irregular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US Air Force also had to prepare for major conventional conflicts against a number of potential adversaries.
Whether that adversary was China, Russia, or North Korea, airpower would certainly play a more central role in such a conflict than it played in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Therefore, "we are critical enablers" alone was insufficient.
