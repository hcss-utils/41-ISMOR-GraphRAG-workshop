Russian policy towards the Baltic States post-Ukraine is likely to incorporate softpower in lieu of military might.
Despite tactical military victories in Ukraine, RBS, and the Kremlin in general, have failed to achieve their political goals.
The conflict is an expensive stalemate, diverting resources that Russia could use for power-projection, or to develop its own economy.
Furthermore, Russia's imbroglio in Ukraine has been a strategic failure through its diplomatic and economic consequences.
The U.S. and EU-led embargo, falling oil prices, rising inflation, and a lack of investor confidence is eroding Russia's economy.
