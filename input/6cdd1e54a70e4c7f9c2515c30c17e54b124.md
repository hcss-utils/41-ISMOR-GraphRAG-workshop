Marvin Kalb in his book "Imperial Gamble: Putin, Ukraine, and the New Cold War," argues that Putin's "gamble in Crimea (and it was a gamble) was reckless, even dangerous," but was based in part on the lack of military intervention after Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008.
Kalb is a nonresident senior fellow with the Foreign Policy program at Brookings, a Harvard Professor, and former Moscow bureau chief and host of Meet the Press.
