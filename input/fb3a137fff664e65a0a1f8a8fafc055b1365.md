Napoleon's Continental System had a significant effect on British trade, causing British exports to fall 25-55 percent between 1806 and 1811 compared to pre-1806 levels, unemployment rose, government bonds fell by 40 percent, and the pound sterling fell in value.
Britain was in crisis in 1810-11 when bankruptcies occurred to an extraordinary extent among merchants, unemployment rose sharply, and British currency considerably depreciated.
British industry stagnated, helping spur the Luddite protest movement against unemployment.
