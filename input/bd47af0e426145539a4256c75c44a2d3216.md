With or without a nuclear capability, Japan with a growing military, whether supported by the US or not, would likely drive the PRC and Russia closer together.
Both China and Russia have separate long-standing issues with Japan.
China has long sought reparations and a proper apology for atrocities committed during World War II.
In addition, there are unresolved territorial sea claims with potential oil reserves in the East China Sea.
Russia and Japan still disagree on sovereignty of the Kurile Islands.
If any of these issues were solved, better relations could ensue.
Nevertheless, bad blood between Japan and Russia has never really benefitted China.
Enhancements in Japan's naval and air capability, especially in combination with greater interoperability with the American navy, favors neither China nor Russia.
