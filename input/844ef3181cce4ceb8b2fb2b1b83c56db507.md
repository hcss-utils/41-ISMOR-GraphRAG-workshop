Echelon numbering varies among authorities.
As employed here: the first echelon comprises those Pact forces in Eastern Europe committed immediately to the attack; the second echelon comprises those Pact forces in Eastern Europe withheld from the immediate attack, but committed very soon thereafter; while the third echelon comprises Soviet forces normally deployed in the Westernmost military districts (MDs) of the U.S.S.R. The leading alternative is to designate (most) Soviet forces deployed forward in Eastern Europe (and the better Pact-allied forces) as the first echelon; to designate the "category one" (of readiness) forces of the Baltic Belorussian, Moscow, Kiev, and Carpathian MDs as the second echelon; and to designate as the third echelon those Soviet units in the Western MDs that require substantial mobilization to be brought up to strength.
