Weapons of mass destruction (WMD) are a topic that can be viewed daily in the news, ranging from the proliferation in countries such as North Korea and Iran to nuclear warhead arsenal reductions between Russia and the United States.
Since the end of the Cold War, nuclear weapons are no longer deemed as necessary among many leaders, giving the impression that nuclear disarmament may finally be possible in ways never before envisioned.
While reduction and non-proliferation of these weapons is an honorable goal, the unfortunate reality is ownership of a weapon of mass destruction provides a nation with an elevated status, granting security and a deterrent against external aggression.
In addition, terrorists' organizations seek to acquire weapons of this type in an attempt to push their own agenda or hold hostage a nation through the fear of employment against the civilian populace.
Because of the status and power granted to those with weapons of mass destruction, it is likely these weapons will continue to play a role in national strategy for many years.
