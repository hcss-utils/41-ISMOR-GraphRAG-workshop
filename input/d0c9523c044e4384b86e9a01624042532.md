the term "unrestricted warfare," Rus sian officials have used "soft power" and "new generation warfare," and a variety of terms are in use by U.S. officials, including "gray zone conflicts," "hybrid warfare," "asymmetric warfare," and "irregular warfare."
The latter term has been officially defined in U.S. military doctrine and Department of Defense (DoD) directives, but one impetus for a new nomenclature is to place emphasis on the nonmilitary and nonlethal elements of this form of warfare.
Those elements may be readily combined with conventional warfare, but the focus of this examination is on the less obvious, more ambiguous forms of conflict that may catch policymakers unaware if they are insufficiently attuned to these methods and their abilities to sow conflict, weaken, destabilize, disrupt, and, in some cases, create more dramatic consequences, as seen in Russia's rapid annexation of the Crimea without resorting to all-out warfare.
This examination of political warfare does not presuppose that this term is necessarily the most apt appellation for current nonconventional contests of power, but it employs the term as a matter of historical record and convenience to bound the study to the nonmilitary and nonlethal military methods used.
By the same token, mea sures short of war may be usefully employed to deter conflict or prevent it from escalating or worsening.
