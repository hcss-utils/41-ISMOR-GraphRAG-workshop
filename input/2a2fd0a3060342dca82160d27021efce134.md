Syria, which is one of its national strategic goal.
The United States, for its part, would be executing the version of irregular warfare that seeks to impose costs on Iran by preventing Iranian influence in Syria with minimal exposure.
The American strategic goals in this instance would be disrupting Iranian support to its proxy network and preventing Iran from directly threatening Israel, potentially preventing a broader and more open war in the Middle East.
Additionally, it would be to harass Russia as it attempts to stabilize Syria, maintain a reliable ally, and preserve access to the warm water port in Tartus.
