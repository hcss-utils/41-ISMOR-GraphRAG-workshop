William Howard Russell was not right when he said the first war correspondent was a "miserable parent of a luckless tribe."
The war correspondent may periodically be criticized and controversial.
He may be posted a long way from home on occasion (since the war in the Crimean in 1854 US war reporters have covered such conflicts as the US Civil War, France-Prussian War, Turkey's invasion of Bulgaria, Turko-Serbian War, Spanish-American War, Boxer Rebellion, Russo-Japanese War, Boer War, World War I, Russian Revolution, Japan's invasion of China, Italy's invasion of Abyssinia, Spanish Civil War, World War II, Korea, Algerian War, and Vietnam conflict).
But the war correspondent remains essential to checking on government and determining which version of the facts reach the public.
We may not always like him but a democracy cannot do without him either.
