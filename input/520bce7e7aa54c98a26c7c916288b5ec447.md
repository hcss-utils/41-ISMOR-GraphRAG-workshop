Russia's intervention was designed as a "limited-liability" expeditionary campaign, modeled after the U.S. air war in Kosovo, with a small theater footprint predicated on Russian aerospace and naval forces providing support to allied Syrian, Iranian, and Shi'a militia ground forces.
Russian strategists sought to avoid committing overwhelming ground forces, limit conspicuous losses, and avoid sunk costs.
