11 Desert Storm succeeded as a new style conflict only because it ended when it did.
Had allied forces been required to move from the open spaces of the desert into the heavily populated areas of Iraq, or had they been compelled to conduct house-to-house fighting in Kuwait City, much less in Basra or Baghdad, the resulting warfare would not have been swift and decisive, even if the final outcome remained the same.
The cases of Vietnam or of World War II Russia are only marginally different in this regard.
