Chechnya: 19 While President Yeltsin needed to first war in Chechnya to secure his reelection by way of an easy military victory for the post-Soviet military, he needed Russia's second war with Chechnya to propel his newly appointed prime minister, Vladimir Putin, to the presidency as his handpicked successor.
President Yeltsin had lost faith in his prime minister at the time, Sergei Stephashin, and sought a replacement who was resolute on resolving the Chechen problem.
Putin, a former KGB member, vowed to resolve the problem mercilessly to prevent the spread of Islamic radicalism throughout the North Caucasus.
