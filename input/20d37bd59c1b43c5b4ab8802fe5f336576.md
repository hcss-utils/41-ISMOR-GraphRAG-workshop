There has been a resurgence of interest in recent years in proxy warfare, prompted in part by concerns such as state support to terrorist groups in the wake of the September 11, 2001, attacks; Iranian-backed Lebanese Hezbollah's relative success against the Israeli Defense Forces; and Russia's support for the Donetsk People's Republic and Luhansk People's Republic in Ukraine (marked by the conflict there beginning in 2014).
The implications of proxy wars for U.S. defense planning are, however, still highly contested.
