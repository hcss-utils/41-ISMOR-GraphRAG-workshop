Under what circumstances is Russia successful in waging hybrid operations short of the use of armed force?
For the last two decades, Russia has undertaken structured cyberattacks, political destabilization, subversive activities, and psychological influence throughout the world as part of what has become known as "hybrid warfare" or "New-Type War" (NTW).
At the same time, Russia has sponsored the involvement and training of paramilitary units and organized crime in operations abroad.
The initial covert use of its specialized military units and special services brought rapid and decisive progress to the Russian Federation in annexing Crimea and destabilizing eastern Ukraine.
Today, the Russian Federation remains active in spreading its influence in Europe, Eurasia, and Middle East.
