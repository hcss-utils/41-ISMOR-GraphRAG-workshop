Third, the nature and range of possible conflicts has evolved significantly, and Moscow sees the need to meet a variety of potential challenges: from a major war erupting between states, to the outbreak of lowlevel conflict near Russia, to the possibility of (externally fomented) unrest in one of Russia's neighbors or even within Russia.
