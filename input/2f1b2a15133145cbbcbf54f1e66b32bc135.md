Finally, since Russia was able to withdraw from Afghanistan relatively unscathed -it had only lost approximately 13,000 service members and the Afghan government was supportive of the Russians -it appeared that the Afghanistan war did not present itself as a Kuhnian crisis to the Russian way of war.
Rather, it presented itself more as an anomaly that did not require a massive change in doctrine or policy.
