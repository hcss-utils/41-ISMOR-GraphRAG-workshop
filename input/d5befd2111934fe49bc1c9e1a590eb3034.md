In 1947, George Kennan, the U.S. Ambassador to Russia wrote the "X-article" in Foreign Affairs that described the world's security environment and then outlined the U.S. strategy for containing communism over what turned out to be the next 50 years.
Engaging weak/failing states, like containment in the Cold War, will require a global strategy and a long-term commitment.
The National Security Strategy presents some key ideas for a weak/failing state engagement plan: "We will defend the peace by fighting terrorists and tyrants.
We will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers.
We will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent."
17 Furthermore, President Bush reiterated the call for an endeavor of Cold War proportions in his second inaugural address when he said, "The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands.
The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world…America's vital interests and our deepest beliefs are now one…it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements and institutions in every nation and culture, with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in our world."
18 With these words, President Bush announced the "great objective of ending tyranny as the concentrated work of generations."
