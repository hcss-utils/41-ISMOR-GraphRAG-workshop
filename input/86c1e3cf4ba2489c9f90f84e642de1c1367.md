The wildcard, as it was to a degree during the Bush administration, are the threats perceived and recognized.
If the 2010 defense budget, the appointment of Ashton Carter (a proponent of cutting Cold War weapons, as the Undersecretary for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics), and recent comments by Defense Secretary Gates are any indication, the threats from a rising China or resurgent Russia will be discounted.
The Administration has cut many of the conventional-war acquisition programs and is reallocating funding to programs most likely to be employed in today's fight.
