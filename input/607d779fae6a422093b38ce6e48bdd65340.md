As of December 2021, a relatively new initiative-said to be a pet project of Minister Shoigu-was ramping up across Russia: Avangard youth centers that deliver military-patriotic education and basic military training to youth.
The mission of the Avangard centers is to "develop a team spirit; [a] sense of responsibility for oneself, one's family, and close ones; acquaint youth with state-of-the-art defense technologies; and improve their physical fitness."
