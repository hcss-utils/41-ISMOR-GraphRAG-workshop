The purpose of examining these historical cases was to provide a brief comparative assessment to help analysts put present-day RGF power into context.
Rather than present a comprehensive analysis-which would require considerably more detail and structure-this quick overview is intended to serve as a guide for ongoing and prospective research.
These cases can help address such questions as (1) the degree to which Russia can achieve the global influence once held by the Soviet Union, (2) the RGF's relative force deployment capability in comparison to the Soviet Army and other armed forces, and (3) the true global threat of Russian ground combat power.
For example, it is useful to consider Russia's current far deployment to Syria, which involves approximately one reinforced brigade, alongside the failed Soviet corps-level near deployment to Tajikistan or the partially successful far division-sized deployment to Yemen.
