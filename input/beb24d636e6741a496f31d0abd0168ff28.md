Members of our research team also conducted fieldwork interviews in Kyiv, Ukraine, on an anonymous basis.
Ukraine arguably has been at the forefront of Russia's disinformation effort and, because of the 2014-2015 conflict in Eastern Ukraine, also provides insight into how Russia might employ these tactics in an actual military conflict.
Interviews were conducted with experts in all major state bodies involved in responding to Russian information operations, representatives of Ukraine's robust network of NGOs engaged in monitoring, debunking, and investigating Russian information warfare and/or cyber activities, representatives of the private sector (including the technology sector), and researchers.
In addition, we examined the large body of publicly available research pertaining to Russia's activities in Ukraine issued by government bodies, NGOs, and individual researchers.
We also drew on media reports, including Ukrainian-language sources.
Again, we assessed the credibility of each source cited and caveat our claims accordingly.
