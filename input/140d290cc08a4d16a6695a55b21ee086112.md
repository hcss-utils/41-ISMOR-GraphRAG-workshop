However, Russia's strategic direction shifted during the 21st century with its scrutiny of NATO's eastward expansion, adversary military technological developments, and the traditional and nontraditional operations of both a military and nonmilitary nature executed by the US and its allies.
Russia noted the rise of unilateralism executed outside of international law, specifically actions by foreign actors to use a population's protest potential and other nonmilitary methods to destabilize the internal stability of a state and undermine the concept of sovereign statehood.
Additionally, Russia observed that contemporary conflicts involve spheres of confrontation that favor the inclusive use of political, economic, information, and other nonmilitary measures with military force.
Therefore, Russia developed a military strategy that emphasized the concepts of active defense, limited action, and the development of military and nonmilitary forms and methods of operations and their employment.
The execution of the concepts centered on the principles of strategic deterrence, the preemptive neutralization of threats to state security, and the advancement of national interests outside of its borders.
The Russian military campaigns in Ukraine and Syria highlighted the implementation of the principles and concepts that define Russia's current military strategy.
