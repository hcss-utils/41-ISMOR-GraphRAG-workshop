Furthermore, expanding the aperture of qualitative evidence beyond our five case studies, we note by way of simple descriptive data that relationships with the United States might be a strong predictor of major contributors; as summarized in Box 5.1, 74 different countries qualified as major contributors in at least one of the 37 U.S. coalitions conducted between 1946 and 2018 (including troop-contributing host nations when applicable).
Not surprisingly, the list of the top ten most-frequent major contributors to U.S. coalitions is rounded out by NATO states, led by the United Kingdom and France (23 U.S. coalitions each); what is perhaps more interesting is the diversity of regional powers in the Asia-Pacific and in the Middle East and North Africa that have qualified as major contributors between four to eight different times.
Looking to the future, the finding that states with close ties to the United States are more likely to join coalitions has significant implications for planning and preparation for possible future conflicts.
In the case of Russia, the United States already has a strong base of potential partners, including NATO allies and others, that have close ties and willingness to join military operations when required (though this willingness should not be taken for granted or assumed).
The Pacific, however, is a tougher situation.
Although the United States has several key allies, it has only lukewarm political and military ties with most states in the region (e.g., Vietnam, Philippines), more-limited economic ties, and weak cultural ties.
This poses potential challenges to the United States when it comes to forming effective coalitions able to counter major adversaries, such as China. (
To those ends, we again note the most-frequent major Asia-Pacific contributors identified in Table
