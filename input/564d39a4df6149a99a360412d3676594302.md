The Korea and Vietnam Wars presented a problem for the USAF PIOP narrative, since SAC's strategic nuclear capabilities had failed to deter lower-level aggression by either North Korea or North Vietnam.
In the case of Korea, Alexander de Seversky inserted a last-minute forward in his 1950 book Air Power: Key to Survival arguing that it was not a "real war," that the United States risked being weakened by a series of peripheral conflicts designed to attrite U.S. forces, and that, therefore, the United States should not intervene militarily.
For de Seversky, There are no genuine strategic targets in Korea.
The sources of North Korean war-making capacity lie elsewhere, in Manchuria and Russia. . . .
Control of the air would be decisive if it gave us access to the enemy's heart: his industries, fuel, transportation, communications.
But Korea's "heart" is located in Manchuria and Russia, well beyond its frontiers, where it is completely shielded by the cloak of a bogus neutrality.
