To summarize, there were four interlinked causes to WWI: a hegemonic challenger, a power imbalance, a history of repeated crises, and entangling alliances.
No variable pinpoints the most important cause.
However, each factor was apparent, even in the complex environment prior to the 1914 July Crisis.
The systemic pressures of having a hegemonic challenger-Germany-drove its neighbors into decisions that made war more likely.
Just as Britain was concerned about Germany's growth, Germany had a reasonable fear about Russia's latent military strength, with its huge population and landmass.
The for great power war loom need to be acknowledged and handled appropriately.
This chapter does not seek to predict the future, but rather elicit a greater understanding of the highly dynamic nature of today's US-China relationship to guide American policy-makers.
