Russia off-sets these military, economic, and demographic disadvantages with an active information campaign to brand itself as a secure alternative to the United States and Europe: the "West."
Sustaining this narrative for both continued domestic and foreign advantage means framing Western interests as diametrically opposed to Russia's prosperity and security-playing on fear for political gain.
As this thesis argues, it also involves reviving the brand of Russian nationalism to appeal to domestic, regional, and increasingly global audiences, broadening Russia's influence and undermining that of the West.
From historical, religious, and cultural sources, Russia frames its status as the truly secure, free, and conservative defender of traditional Christian values against the corrupt, imperial, and morally-debased influence of the West.
Through disinformation and "active measures"coordinated disinformation and deception activities intended to influence opinion or policies in foreign countries-Moscow's information warfare also weakens the political and decision-making processes of the US and Western democracies, curbing the appeal of democratic ideals on the world stage.
