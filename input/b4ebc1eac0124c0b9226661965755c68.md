At rst glance, the Pashtun village of Gourogan had the charm of a hamlet in Mexico or Spain-a hard-packed path too narrow for cars twisting uphill between tall stone walls, a few donkeys trudging along, a farmer or two in the elds, arbors of green grapes and small copses of g trees baking under the scorching sun. Cpl. Ben Woodhouse wasn't fooled twice, though. Yesterday he had turned a corner in just such a tranquil setting and bumped smack into an equally surprised Talib clutching an AK automatic ri e. Woody and the bearded Pashtun both jumped back, shooting harmlessly at each other. The Talib leaped over a small wall and ran away at sprinter's speed, leaving behind a corporal who turned each corner in Gourogan with his rifle ready to fire.
Moving through the elds on either side of Woody was a skirmish line of Marines. By the time the troops reached the top of the hill, all the villagers had ducked indoors. The Afghan soldiers with the Marines shouted for the elders to come out and hold a shura, or meeting. Gradually, about a dozen old men, many wrapped in shawls despite the brutal heat, gathered under the skimpy awning of the only store. Dust was shaken from chipped porcelain cups and a round of steaming green tea was poured.
The chubby mullah, who was quick to grin, pointed at my Red Sox hat with the big red B. I explained that baseball was like cricket. Asked the score of a game, I said about 8 to 4. Oh, the mullah said, we are sorry your team plays so poorly. (Cricket players score in the hundreds.) The elders burst out laughing. They had never seen Americans, and the Taliban had warned that the saman dirian (Marines) killed everyone. Yet here they were, sitting in the dirt, all very young, clean-shaven, and polite, while the older one didn't even know how terrible he was as an athlete.
Sgt. Bill Cahir, who was in charge of civil a airs on the patrol, spent some time explaining the size of the United States. Afghanistan, he said, was smaller than Texas, one of fty states. So why are you here? an elder asked. To help your president defeat the Taliban, Cahir said. Karzai is Pashtun, an elder said, so he should be president. But Kabul is too far away. Our teacher went to Iran to work after the Taliban closed the school. Of course, there weren't any Taliban still in Gourogan, at least not once the Marines started up the hill.
Over another round of tea, the elders complained about their dry elds and the lack of everything-electricity, clean water, safety to go to market, the tribe across the river, the price of seed, no education for the children. As the cups were lled a third time, Cahir took out his notebook and asked what they really, really needed. The jovial mullah said batteries for his loudspeakers for his calls to prayer. Some elder said his voice was already loud enough, and everyone laughed. The saman dirian weren't so bad.
Batteries, x up the school, money to hire another teacher, supplies for the dispensary, maybe a hydro generator if the current was swift enough in the river. Okay, Cahir said, we Marines can do that for you. Now in return, will you tell the Taliban to keep out?
"How can we do that," the mullah said with a genuine smile, "when you cannot?" "Tell us when they are here," Cahir said, "and we'll take care of them."
The mullah scratched at the dirt and did not answer. The fun was over.
For years, soldiers like Cahir had projected goodwill and brought resources. In return, the villagers were expected to reject the insurgents, or to risk death by informing against them. Instead, people like the mullah accepted the aid and remained neutral, waiting to see who would win on the field of battle. By giving away billions, we created a culture of entitlement rather than a rebellion against the radicals.
Preventing a terrorist takeover in Afghanistan is a sound goal. It would severely damage America's credibility if the Taliban reseized Kabul. If chaos spread into Pakistan, terrorists might seize one of Pakistan's nuclear bombs. Although the chances of that were slight, one bomb would incinerate tens of thousands of American civilians.
But in 2002, America had larger ambitions. Together with the United Nations, the United States agreed to build a democratic nation. Hamid Karzai was in e ect chosen to be the president of the new Afghanistan, with a strong central government controlling 31 million uneducated tribesmen. Only the American military had the manpower and organization to achieve that stupendous goal. Mistakenly, the generals agreed that defeating an insurgency required our soldiers to be nation builders as well as war fighters.
Thus our military became a gigantic Peace Corps, holding millions of shuras, drinking billions of cups of tea, and handing out billions of dollars for projects. Risk in battle was avoided because generals proclaimed that killing the enemy could not win the war. Senior o cials fantasized that the war would be won by protecting and winning over the population. The tribes, however, were determined to remain neutral, while the Afghan president tolerated corruption and ine ectiveness. The futile e ort to build a democracy diverted the energies of our soldiers and weakened their martial spirit.
Since it would be disastrous to pull out and we can't win with the current strategy, is there an alternative? This raises several questions. What does the war look like to those ghting it? Like war in general, counterinsurgency is an incoherent body of thought, with history providing lessons that contradict one another. So can only one strategy succeed in Afghanistan? If so, why did the strategy change with each of the six U.S. generals who were put in charge? What is being accomplished today? And how do we get out?
In seeking to answer those questions, this book describes the ghting, the objectives, the interaction with the tribes, and the di erent tactics our military has undertaken. This is a di erent American military than the one that fought in World War II, Korea, and Vietnam. Instead of soldiers chosen at random by a draft, America has warriors who have selected themselves. They did not volunteer because the military o ered jobs. They came from comparatively affluent families and had career opportunities that paid more than the military. These soldiers chose to be on the battlefield. America is the last Western nation standing that ghts for what it believes. No nation can remain a world power without such a martial spirit. Courage, Aristotle wrote, is that quality that makes all other qualities possible. As the stories in this book show, our troops are the hunters, not the prey.
Their aggressiveness and professionalism o er a way out of Afghanistan. If we put aside building a great Afghan society, we can reduce the size of our forces by replacing large battalions with small adviser task forces, letting the Afghans fight their own war.
Why one approach seems better than another raises the question of how we learn. We learn mainly from our own experiences, or trust
Why one approach seems better than another raises the question of how we learn. We learn mainly from our own experiences, or trust books where others write of their experiences. From these small slices of life, real and vicarious, we build theories that we apply broadly. This is true of all professions-politicians, traders, warriors, and the like-where success depends upon the actions of other human beings.
I write from the perspective of an infantryman. This book is based on eight extended trips to Afghanistan in three years and over a thousand discussions with our troops in the eld. The focus is upon the ghting in the northern mountains along the Pakistan border and in the farmlands of the south. I was embedded in many of the battles and took the photos in the book, as well as the combat videos on YouTube posted under BingWest.com.
When I was a grunt in the 1960s, the Marines sent me from one end of Vietnam to the other. One of my subsequent books, The Village, chronicled an American squad that fought and advised in a Vietnamese village for sixteen months. The Village has been on the Marine Corps Commandant's Reading List for forty years. So strong are the parallels in the ghting today that remote outposts in Afghanistan bear the names of the Marines killed in that village so many years ago. Later, the Pentagon sent me to the front lines in Cambodia. Since 2001, I've made dozens of extended trips to Iraq and Afghanistan. In various climes and countries, I've been on hundreds of patrols and operations. (Surviving has more to do with luck than many will admit.)
As an assistant secretary of defense, I participated at the top level of government in discussions about irregular wars in Vietnam, El Salvador, Tunisia, Morocco, and Egypt. An insurgency, though, depends on local conditions, not upon pronouncements from on high. So this book is not about generals, or bureaucratic in ghting among senior o cials, or backstairs gossip at the White House. It is hardiness and grit in battle, not rhetorical debate, that will determine Afghanistan's future.
Sgt. Robert Kightlinger, twenty-three, lay behind a dirt mound as rounds cracked overhead. His binoculars were xed on a concrete mosque with arched windows on the far side of a poppy field. A young man in a gray burka was peeking out of the mosque.
"Six, I have eyes on one of the shooters," Kightlinger said, speaking into a handheld radio. "He's in a mosque. A hundred meters due south, there's a dicker watching us through binos."
Kightlinger listened for a moment, then yelled to his squad. "Hey! Did anyone shoot at the mosque?" "Negative!" a fire team leader yelled. "We know the rules. We're not fucking stupid." "Salty mothers," Kightlinger said with a grin. He spoke again over the radio to his platoon commander, Lt. Shawn Connor, who was at an outpost two kilometers away. "I don't have a video feed from a Predator," Connor said. "I can't watch your anks. You're too exposed out there. Come on back. I won't risk losing one of you to kill a few guys paid five bucks a day."
This wasn't how America was supposed to ght in the twenty-rst century. The Pentagon had envisioned "network-centric warfare," with data zipping across the Internet and enabling our forces to strike with blinding speed. Once the enemy army was destroyed, the opposing government would accommodate our interests.
That theory seemed validated by the response to the bombing of the Twin Towers on September 11, 2001. Within a few months, American aircraft had driven al Qaeda and the Taliban from Afghanistan and installed a new government. Victory looked assured. Yet strategic errors followed.
The leadership of the Taliban and al Qaeda, including Osama bin Laden, settled into the tribal frontier lands of western Pakistan, while the Pakistan military played a double game. On the one hand, it accepted billions of American dollars and permitted strikes by American unmanned aircraft on al Qaeda leaders. On the other hand, it shielded other terrorist leaders as a hedge in case the Taliban again seized power in Afghanistan. On the political front, in 2002 the United States and the United Nations had supported Hamid Karzai's election as Afghanistan's president, with strong powers intended to marginalize the nation's regional warlords. This arrangement upended the traditional decentralized balance between the regions and Kabul. The international coalition granted total suzerainty to Karzai's cobbled-together government, meaning the coalition had to do the ghting but did not have the authority to remove corrupt or incapable o cials. Karzai responded by giving his tribal cronies the political power in the provinces to the east and south of Kabul, where the Taliban was strongest.
In the States, the administration of President George W. Bush assumed the war in Afghanistan had been won and in 2003 invaded Iraq. As the Iraq War escalated, Afghanistan became a strategic afterthought.
Six American commanders between 2002 and 2009 had followed no single strategy. In 2003, the emphasis was upon chasing down al Qaeda ghters. In 2004-2005, the U.S. military turned to counterinsurgency, trying to convince village elders to support the occasional forays of Afghan o cials into the countryside. In 2005, the U.S.-and NATO-led coalition vainly urged Karzai to adopt reforms rather than assigning provincial posts based on tribal and crony patronage.
By 2006, the ghting in the south was sharp. As Taliban forces solidi ed, the coalition temporarily shifted back to raids and gun ghts. All along the Pakistan border and extending into the interior Pashtun provinces, the Taliban gradually assumed shadow control because they hadn't been defeated in 2001; they merely had been temporarily displaced by tribal and personal cronies of Karzai. The Taliban had governed for six years, though, and were able to regenerate the networks that had lost power under Karzai. The insurgents knew whom to contact and whom to avoid. Tribal rivalries again flared.
In 2007, the tide of battle turned in Iraq. That war had become a referendum on the Bush presidency, absorbing the full attention of the administration, the press, and the Congress. In Afghanistan, the American response in 2007 was to search and destroy the enemy. Most rural Afghans expressed dislike of the Taliban. The enemy, however, wore no uniform, avoided repower duels with Americans, and moved unreported among the farming communities. This nulli ed the traditional American way of war of destroying the opposing army in decisive battle.
In 2008, the insurgency was falling apart in Iraq, while in Afghanistan the insurgents were becoming stronger. Adm. Michael Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Sta , said, "I'm not convinced we're winning in Afghanistan. I am convinced we can. That is why I … am looking at a new, more comprehensive strategy for the region."
Seven years of failure before looking at a new strategy was an indictment of military as well as political leadership. By the time Bush left office, the Taliban resurgence had spread widely.
Opposed to the American involvement in Iraq, Obama had campaigned on the promise that "Afghanistan was the war that had to be won." In 2009, President Obama declared that the United States was beginning the war anew, with a focus on counterinsurgency. "The United States really has gotten its head into this conflict," Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said, "only in the last year [2009]."

This book describes how this new approach has played out. The setting is Afghanistan's two most violent provinces-Konar in the northeast, and Helmand in the south (Map 1). More coalition troops were killed in those two provinces than anywhere else. Konar in the north is a major in ltration route from Pakistan. Helmand in the south is the region where the Taliban rebellion began. The struggles in these two provinces provide a framework for understanding the nature of the war as a whole.
Each chapter illustrates di erent factors about this maddening war, from the lawlessness along the mountainous border in the north to the drug tra cking in the south. There is a grinding inconclusiveness to the battles that yields a grudging admiration for the endurance of the Pashtuns and a resentment against the sanctuary Pakistan provides. The valor of our soldiers is on display, as well as the determination, cunning, and Islamist fervor of the Taliban and other opponents. Di erent strategic and operational approaches are tried, but none provides pivotal moments or political breakthroughs. Instead, there is a frustrating repetition of patterns. The American military loathes the mere mention of "a war of attrition." But Afghanistan is a war of attrition, because Pakistan provides a sanctuary for the enemy. Therefore, America has to shift its military emphasis from protecting the population-a never-ending task-to strengthening and advising the Afghan America has to shift its military emphasis from protecting the population-a never-ending task-to strengthening and advising the Afghan forces so they can fight their own war, which will go on for many, many years. fall. Rain poured through the soggy sandbags and soaked their sleeping bags. They defecated in tin cans and used kerosene to burn their shit. Their uniforms tore and split apart. They ate the plastic-wrapped MREs, Meals Ready to Eat, sprinkled with local vegetables or goat meat. Sooner or later, every soldier came down with dysentery for a few days or a week.
They patrolled constantly. They were polite to all the villagers. They learned the names and habits of the enemy leaders. Haji Matin and Abu Ikhlas, an al Qaeda facilitator, coordinated the attacks in the Korengal. In the Waigal Valley, Habib Jan and Juma Khan were the key leaders.
Navy Cmdr. Doc Scholl, an F-18 ghter jock who had been Cavoli's classmate at Princeton, led their Provincial Reconstruction Team. The PRT-consisting of reservists with specialties in agriculture, engineering, and the like-acted as the hub for projects to improve the lives of the Pashtuns. Scholl never met a project he didn't believe he could complete. He paved the Pech River road, opened schools, handed out books, pencils, and paper, and erected clinics. All Afghans knew the acronym PRT, and scolded insurgents who shot at any PRT Humvee.
Still, a donkey-laden resupply patrol was ambushed outside Aranas in August. The soldier at point, nineteen-year-old Pfc. Andrew Small, fought o the attackers, allowing the main body time to react. Small and two other soldiers were killed. Villagers from Aranas helped recover American equipment after the ght, and collaborated in the arrest of a village elder. Acting on tips, Capt. Sloan expelled three men from the town.
In September and October of 2006, the enemy launched daily harassing attacks against Bella and the Ranch House. The Waigal Valley matched the Korengal, attack for attack. On the last day of October, Sloan and two other soldiers were killed by a roadside bomb near the Bella Outpost. Angry and grieving, Cavoli pressured the governor of Nuristan to hold a large shura in honor of a good man who wanted to bring good things to a remote mountain tribe.
Then came the snows and the cold of November, and the hard-core insurgents trudged back to their warm homes in Pakistan-or into nearby villages-to await the next ghting season in the spring. At Bella, the Ranch House, and the Korengal (Map 3), the soldiers ate MREs, stood guard, and dug deep into their sleeping bags for nights of fourteen-hour darkness.
The patrols clambered up and down the ridgelines, seeing no human tracks in the snow. They endured through the end of December, buoyed by the promise that they were going home. Then came crushing news. In early January of 2007, even as some elements of 1-32 had arrived back in the States, President Bush decided to surge 20,000 troops into an Iraq that was descending into civil war. In both Iraq and Afghanistan, a four-month extension was ordered to compensate for a lack of replacements. Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno spoke for commanders in both theaters when he told me, "We knew how terribly hard that was on the soldiers. It had to be done, but it was the hardest decision I ever made."
Bush addressed the nation, displaying his determination to stay the course in Iraq. But in an odd way, the speech cast Afghanistan as an afterthought, or a lesser battlefield where success depended upon what happened in Iraq.
"From Afghanistan to Lebanon to the Palestinian Territories," the president said, "millions of ordinary people are sick of the violence, and want a future of peace and opportunity for their children. And they are looking at Iraq.… We can, and we will, prevail." By all accounts, after nine months without a single day's relief, Attack Company in the Korengal had gone a bit around the bend. Mail and care packages from home were their only link to normalcy. With MREs posing as food, sleeping bags as mattresses, freezing temperatures, a bleak and blasted landscape, and neighbors intent on killing them, by winter the soldiers had developed decidedly strange attitudes. They were detached, almost numb.
In his classic book The Anatomy of Courage, Lord Moran described the e ect of combat without rest: "All around me are the faces of men who do not seem to have slept for a week. Some who were tired before look ill; the very gait of the men has lost its spring. The sap has gone out of them. They are dried up. Men wear out in war like clothes."

Staff Sgt. David Metcalf was the company's character and symbol. Thick around the middle and balding at middle age, Metcalf directed his mortar section with an unsettling focus. A bachelor, he lived alone in a trailer back at Fort Drum in New York, leading to rumors that his roommate was a mortar tube. He spoke a jargon of numbers, azimuths, and de ections. He became enraged when any enemy with a similar stovepipe tube and a shell with a few powder bags took a shot at his encampment.
Earlier in December, the Taliban launched a heavy attack at the Korengal Outpost. Metcalf rushed from a safe bunker to his gun pit, dragging his crew with him. With RPGs exploding around them, Metcalf placed one soldier on a machine gun and the other on a Mark 19 40mm gun, while he adjusted his 60mm mortar. The insurgents were ring from a ridge 200 meters away. Two successive explosions knocked Metcalf and his two soldiers off their feet. Each time, he popped up, screaming for his men to return fire. The duel continued for ten minutes, until nally he dropped a mortar shell on an enemy machine gun position. Metcalf hopped out of the gun pit, dropped his trousers, and pointed his ass skyward.
"You blind fucks can't hit my ass!" he screamed. Around the perimeter, the soldiers cheered. "Metcalf is the craziest of us all," Williams said. "He's certifiable. We love him in a gunfight." "Give me any ten soldiers for three months," Metcalf told me, "and I will give you back seven good grunts and three to send home that don't belong out here."
Officers and enlisted were treated the same on the lines. "In the Korengal," Raps said, "no one thought he was better than the next guy. We had one captain who was an asshole. The other o cers were same as us."
"I fell in the Pech River," Spc. Miguel Solano said. "I was swallowing the goddamn river. Then this strong arm hauled my ass out. It was my lieutenant. We were tight in the Korengal."
It had been two years since three SEALs had been killed, and sixteen fellow commandos had perished when their rescue helicopter was shot down. Since then, American forces had hunted for their killers. At the same time, handheld camcorders, the Internet, and YouTube had combined to make Afghanistan the most graphic war in history.
The videos were remarkable, showing three faces of the combat. One showed coalition patrols in the at terrain of the south responding to inaccurate enemy re with fusillades, often accompanied by aerial bombing. Another showed U.S. soldiers in the mountains ring at attackers hidden on a distant hill. A third showed the Taliban launching attacks against U.S. isolated outposts and against convoys trapped on narrow roads. One video in particular was posted on the Internet after the American commandos were killed. It clearly showed a fullbearded man in a green military jacket, with a water bottle tied around his neck, gesturing at two dead SEAL commandos and holding up an American identification card.
"We had a clear picture of the leader stopping another guy from stomping on a SEAL's chest," Solano said. "We got a tip that the guy was at what we called the butcher's house. So we went after him."
On March 9, 2007, Solano and nineteen other soldiers from Attack Company left the wire at three in the morning. They had aerial photos showing the house owned by the butcher in the town of Babeyal. After a steep two-hour climb, the platoon was in position outside the threestory stone house.
At dawn, they politely knocked on the front door. A man in his mid-fties let them in, calmly claiming that he was the only male in the house. As the soldiers searched room to room, Solano saw in the dim candlelight the icker of a shadow in a storage bin. He shoved the door open and pointed his rifle at a tall, fortyish man with a long beard and clean loafers, leaning on a cane.
Solano looked at the photo he was carrying of the suspect, and read a name. The man nodded. When questioned, a surprising number of the insurgents readily give their true names, a defect in tradecraft their al Qaeda mentors have tried for years to fix.
The soldiers quickly started back down the trail, letting their prisoner set the pace. He hobbled slowly, fumbling with his cane, frequently stopping to rest while looking around wistfully.
After the third stop, Solano walked over to Sgt. Ramon. "The fucker's dogging it until his men get here," Solano said in rapid Spanish. "I'm changing the route; we're going down the back way." When the patrol turned around, the prisoner spoke in alarm. "What are you doing?" he asked in English.
Solano cinched a rope around the prisoner's chest and pulled him down the trail. Within a half hour, the patrol interpreter had picked up their pursuers talking on their Icoms.
"Iqal, we're in position. Where are they?" "I don't know. I think they doubled back and went out a different way." Back at base, the prisoner stood stiff and proud while awaiting a helicopter to take him away. "Why do you hate America?" Solano said. "Because you are an empire. We will destroy you." "Send me a postcard from Guantánamo, fucker," Solano said. Several months later, I asked the colonel in charge of the prison at Bagram Air Force Base if I could speak to that prisoner. The colonel checked his records and said that no prisoner had been logged in on March 9. Solano had seen the helicopter depart with the prisoner on board. A majority of insurgents arrested bribe their way free. On the other hand, this prisoner had many enemies.
What happened to him remains one of war's small mysteries.
The month of March 2007 had ushered in the ghting season, and Attack Company resumed the slugfest in the Korengal. Cavoli's brigade commander, Col. Nicholson, said later, "My brigade red 30,000 rounds of artillery and dropped thirty tons of bombs-accounting for 75 percent of all the ordnance expended in Afghanistan." Capt. Mike Harrison, stationed in the Pech Valley, supported Cavoli's operational logic.
"It was really rough on Attack Company in the Korengal," he said. "The Korengal, not the Waigal, was the enemy's dominant terrain. Most attacks in my sector down on the Pech came from the southwest-from the Korengal. If we didn't stop or divert them there, we couldn't have built the road along the Pech."
Harrison made friends along the Pech, and they consistently warned him of attacks. Of seventeen IEDs found on the Pech road during the latter half of the battalion's deployment, fourteen were discovered and turned in by locals. Altogether, the 3rd Brigade had increased the number of American outposts in northeast Afghanistan from twenty to forty-three over the course of fteen months, paving an "ink line" of roads to link the rural population with government centers and to reduce the threat from IEDs.

"I patrolled there constantly. It was like watching a Greek tragedy play out," he said. "We went into the Waigal to help where there was no government. But our presence drew in outside ghters and the local people got hurt. When I left the Waigal after a year, the people had turned cold. They wanted us out of their lives."
That attitude vexed Cavoli. "There was a security problem in the town," he later wrote, "and I had come to help with it. No, no, came the immediate cry … nobody was shooting at them … the only security problem would likely come if we stuck around-then there would be security trouble."

"Killing insurgents-while necessary, especially with respect to extremists-by itself cannot defeat an insurgency," the manual read. "Victory is achieved when the populace consents to the government's legitimacy and stops actively and passively supporting the insurgency."

11
"Over time," the manual advised, "counterinsurgents aim to enable a country or regime to provide the security and rule of law that allow establishment of social services and growth of economic activity."

Although the Pech River tribes outnumbered the hill tribes in the Waigal and Korengal by ten to one, the Afghan government prevented the Americans from organizing local militias, and the Pech tribes did not organize to defend themselves. It was ne that the Americans provided projects. And it was equally ne that they and the Afghan soldiers did the ghting. They stood aside as bystanders, a neutral attitude that frustrated Cavoli.  "I call it the ostrich approach to security," he said. "If my head's in the sand, I can't see the security problems that are biting off my ass." Battalion 1-32 su ered twenty fatalities and 127 wounded in fteen months of ghting. The Korengal had taken the lives of ten soldiers, the Waigal claimed another six, and four were killed along the Pech River. The American soldiers had no way of bringing the enemy into a decisive battle, and they could not change the culture of the mountain tribes.
In June of 2007, the 173rd Brigade Combat Team assumed control over Konar and other provinces. Battle Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 503rd Parachute Regiment-the Sky Soldiers-took over the positions occupied by Battalion 1-32. Within days, Pfc. Timothy Vimoto, the son of the brigade's sergeant major, was killed in the Korengal. Within weeks, a second soldier in Battle Company-Pfc. Juan Restrepo-died in the Korengal.
The American outposts on the valley slopes were supplied mainly by helicopter, with journalists constantly dropping in because the Korengal was where the ghting never ended. Alissa Rubin of The New York Times described a "new counterinsurgency doctrine." Capt. Dan Kearney, commanding Battle Company, planned "turning one village at a time."

The people lived in square houses of stone supported by timbers two feet in diameter; the ghting positions and shepherd camps on the high slopes were even more imposing, built of solid rock. The insurgents moved from house to house, settlement to settlement. When the ghts broke out, they took refuge behind the stone or mud walls, impenetrable to small arms re. The Americans quickly learned not to rush at a pillbox. Instead, they poured in fire to pin down their enemy, while waiting for air to arrive.
The trouble was no one could tell who was inside a house, while a 500-pound bomb was indiscriminate. As the ghts went on day after day, the Americans became hardened. Usually, the insurgents fought from the slopes away from their villages. The bombs continued to fall. For the Americans, the war consisted of cramped, stinking living spaces, never-ending days of boredom, taut patrols, and incessant exchanges of gunfire with Korengalis hidden on rocky mountainsides a half mile away.
Some observers believed the Korengalis fought because they were xenophobic. Mike, the longtime interpreter, disagreed.
"The Korengal has some bad outsiders," he said. "They speak with Pakistani accent, like me. Over the radio, I hear them saying prayers before they attack. They think it gives them power before they die. They're crazy mothers."
In the Korengal and across the entire Pashtun belt in Afghanistan, the Taliban narrative wove together the Pashtun warrior spirit and a jihadist duty to drive out the in del invaders, with eternal reward for death as a martyr for Islam. In contrast, Afghan security forces usually fought for paychecks. They sco ed at the Taliban narrative, but their leaders didn't build a counternarrative. As for the Americans, their senior leaders told them to focus on the people, not on kinetics or shooting the enemy. The counterinsurgency doctrine resonated with phrases such as "focus on the population … and ght the enemy only when he gets in the way."

"We fought on regardless of exhaustion, hunger and thirst … walking the hundreds of kilometers," one Taliban ghter wrote. "Wearing the same clothes for months, surviving on a loaf of bread or a few dates each day … we su ered grievously, but it was the true path; if one died, it was meant to be. What a happy life we led! … We woke before sunrise to perform morning prayer.… May God be praised! … our intentions were pure and every one of us was ready to die as a martyr."

When his platoon collapsed from lack of water while chasing the Taliban at 7,000 feet, Moore and his platoon leader, Lt. Nick Black, staggered down to the nearest road, loaded their CamelBaks with water, and climbed back up to hydrate their fellow soldiers.
"One in ten soldiers is a born ghter," Moore said. "My job is to get the other nine to join him. A platoon sergeant can't let small cliques get away with bitching. That destroys morale. I call any troublemaker out in front of the entire platoon. We hunt muj. If a soldier doesn't want to do that, he doesn't belong."
It was in the Waigal Valley on the northern side of the Pech River, not in the Korengal to the south, that the outpost strategy began to unravel. Chosen Company was assigned the Waigal. With one platoon holding Blessing at the bottom of the valley and one platoon detached to another unit, Chosen had one platoon left to rotate between the Ranch House and Bella. Thus no Americans were at Wanat when the insurgents overran the town in June, a few days after the death of the son of the brigade sergeant major in the Korengal (Map 3).
Chosen Company, tense and keeping up its guard, was dissatis ed with the performance of the Afghan security guard commander at the Ranch House. Security guards had been hired by Cavoli partially as an outreach to the local tribe. When the commander of the guards was publicly red in August, the tribe took it as an insult. There was no prior warning when, a few days later, several dozen insurgents attacked the twenty-ve American soldiers at the Ranch House. Eleven were wounded before successive air bombings caused considerable damage and drove off the attackers.
From that day on, attacks continued episodically. On November 9, 2007, a Chosen platoon held a shura at Aranas to discuss grievances on both sides. As the platoon, accompanied by Afghan soldiers, left via the trail from the Ranch House to Bella, they were ambushed. In a sharp fight, six Americans and two askars (Afghan soldiers) were killed.
"They were shooting down from three sides," Spc. Shane Burton said. "It was a setup. There were over a hundred of them. They were screaming at us and we were screaming back. They didn't care if they died. It was them or us. We were slamming them with arty and air.
screaming at us and we were screaming back. They didn't care if they died. It was them or us. We were slamming them with arty and air. Later, we saw a muj video posted on the Internet of their attack. They had drawn sketches of the ambush better than I could have done. No way they got in all those positions without the villagers knowing. No one warned us, or the Afghan soldiers with us."
The survivors were enraged, accusing the Aranas elders of betraying the tribal code of honor that should protect invited guests. Relations between Chosen Company and the local tribes broke down.
"After this ambush, the Chosen Company soldiers no longer fully trusted the Afghan people of the Waigal Valley," concluded U.S. Army historian Douglas Cubbison. "The Chosen Company leadership no longer gave the Afghans the bene t of the doubt. From this moment on, Chosen Company's emphasis shifted to kinetic operations, rather than counterinsurgency."
It was now a straight gun ght. One soldier told Cubbison, "We didn't go o the FOB [Forward Operating Base] unless there was a patrol. … We didn't interact with them [Afghan civilians or security forces]. We just pulled security mostly and they didn't come near us and we didn't go near them."

The insurgents promptly shifted their attention to Outpost Bella, six kilometers farther south in the valley. In January of 2008, the respected platoon sergeant, Sgt. 1st Class Ryan Kahler, approached a guard bunker at night and was shot and killed by an Afghan security guard. An investigation concluded that the shooting was accidental, but the Chosen soldiers weren't convinced. Relations with the Afghans continued to deteriorate, and Chosen's responses to attacks grew more severe. The brigade decided to abandon Bella and pull back eight kilometers south to Wanat, where a rough road provided a link to forces at Blessing.
As the ghting ground on, the 2nd of the 503rd held numerous shuras in Wanat to persuade the elders to sell land and provide laborers to work on a new outpost. The elders understandably came up with excuse after excuse. On July 4, 2008, amidst some ghting, two pickup trucks drove away from the health clinic at Bella and were pounced on by two Apache helicopter gunships. The locals claimed that seventeen patients and medical staff were killed, resulting in open animosity between the Americans and the valley tribes.
On July 6 and again on July 9, the battalion sta met with the elders in Wanat, trying unsuccessfully to rent land for the planned outpost. It became common knowledge that Bella would be abandoned within a few days. When the small force from Bella of forty-nine Americans and twenty-four askars, mounted in a half dozen Humvees and trucks, rolled into town on July 12, 
19
Later that night, dozens of insurgents climbed into positions above the circle of Humvees in the town. Many ghters wore bandannas with inscriptions from the Koran, signifying they were ready to die. A remarkable Taliban video later shown by ABC News 20 captured the ght. A nighttime prayer was o ered for the mujahideen. The ghters diverted a stream so that water ran across rocks close to the mortar pit and Humvees, obscuring the noise of their approach. At the battalion operations center, a lieutenant, concerned by strange insurgent radio chatter, asked for an unmanned aerial vehicle, a UAV, to scan Wanat with thermal cameras. Senior officers told him the UAV wasn't necessary.
The assault began at rst light and persisted for several hours. The insurgents poured re upon every American position. The video captured the shouts of "Allahu Akbar" as RPG shells struck the Humvees and nearby buildings, setting several res. American soldiers could be seen running among the Humvees. The Taliban leaders were urging their ghters to close with the Americans, but the video showed hesitancy when the Americans returned fire with streams of red tracers.
When it was over, nine paratroopers were dead, and twenty-seven were wounded. It was the second largest loss of American lives in a single engagement.
Lt. Jonathan Brostrom died in the ght. His father, outraged by the leadership climate in the battalion, demanded an investigation, which was championed by Virginia senator Jim Webb. The investigation conducted by two combat leaders, Marine Lt. Gen. Richard Natonski and Army Maj. Gen. Michael Oates, concluded that the sequence of operations was poorly conceived and terribly executed. They recommended letters of reprimand, terminating several careers.
It seemed a credit to the American military ethic that mistakes resulting in losses were not tolerated or fobbed o as the fog of war. Then Gen. Charles Campbell, on the eve of his retirement, overturned the reprimands, arguing that second-guessing battle eld decisions would create an atmosphere of risk avoidance. 
21
At the operational rather than tactical level, military historian Douglas Cubbison concluded that the underlying cause of the series of attacks was the animosity between the American soldiers and the Nuristani tribesmen. 
22
The high command chose to highlight the problem of in ltration from Pakistan. Immediately after the Waigal Valley was abandoned, Gen. David McKiernan, who had recently taken command of the military coalition (called the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF), pointed at Pakistan. "It all goes back to the problem set that there are sanctuaries," he said, "in the [Pakistani] tribal areas that militant insurgent groups are able to operate from with impunity." 
23
In the States, the attack and McKiernan's accusation stirred scant interest. In Iraq, Gen. David Petraeus was winning what the Bush administration perceived as the central front on the war on terror. Iraqi prime minister Nouri al-Maliki was showing surprising rmness in dealing with his radical Shiite opponent, the zany Moqtada al-Sadr. In the presidential primaries, Senator Barack Obama was saying that the Iraq surge was a mistake and that Afghanistan was "the war that has to be won."
After the Waigal Valley on the northern ank of the Pech fell in early July of 2008, the ghting on the southern ank-inside the Korengalincreased in intensity. After Battalion 2-503 rotated home, Viper Company, Battalion 1-26, assumed the mission in the Korengal. When I ew into the valley in April of 2009, Viper was in its eleventh month of combat.
To a tourist, the valley looked like a Swiss postcard, pastoral in its springtime bloom (Picture 3). A large stream fed by melting snows rushed along the valley oor, nourishing emerald trellises of wheat and rice carved from the inty mountainsides by a thousand generations of tribesmen.
To an infantryman, it looked like a death trap, a tiny cleft between towering canyon walls with thousands of caves and crevices concealed among thousands of bushes and r trees. No sensible grunt would walk down that valley oor. On the far slopes, tall cedars stripped naked by artillery rounds looked like giant matchsticks, testimony to the incessant pounding of high explosives.
When I got o the helicopter, Capt. Jimmy Howell, the company commander, was holding a memorial service for Pfc. Richard Dewater, killed two days earlier. Dewater was the eighth soldier in Viper Company to die. One had been blown up, another shot in the head, two struck down by roadside bombs, one killed by a rocket-propelled grenade and another by a hand grenade, one burned to death in a helicopter crash, and one felled by friendly fire.
"You have time to look over our ghting positions," Howell told me. "The elders are waiting to ll their prescriptions. The ghting won't start until they leave."
Wearing a T-shirt instead of an armored vest, Howell had an aura of calm detachment similar to the actor Tom Hanks, who played a company commander in Saving Private Ryan. On his fth combat tour, Howell had commanded Rangers and soldiers for four years. He saved his energy for what he could control and kept his finger on the pulse of his men, worn down after months of constant combat.
At the memorial service, Howell told a funny story about Dewater, reminded his soldiers of their hard mission, and said a simple prayer. The soldiers quickly left the open ground. A sentry opened the barbed wire gate and a dozen bearded old men, most with canes or poles, slowly walked up the hill to the aid station. They carried themselves with dignity and waited patiently while the medic checked their records and filled prescriptions, just like at a drugstore in the States.
"Blood thinners, blood pressure, pills like that," the medic, Sgt. Martin Moreno, said. "I used to hold sick calls in the hamlets. Now the Talibs only let the elders come."
Moreno, who had graduated from the University of Texas, was studying for his master's degree as a physician's assistant. He had ample credentials. In the past year, he had saved nineteen limbs by applying tourniquets and injecting the wounded with saline while waiting hours for medevacs. He had sewn up dozens of cuts and plunged in long needles to decompress ve collapsed lungs, three from bullet wounds and two from shrapnel. He had performed a venous cut-down, slicing and peeling back the top layer of skin on a soldier who had lost too much blood, reaching in with a forceps to seize a vein and insert uid. Twice he had undertaken intubations, inserting tracheal tubes through the mouth and into the lungs of soldiers who had lost breathing. Handing out pills was the least of Moreno's services.
After the elders left the wire, several interpreters hovered around a captured handheld radio, listening to the tra c. The Taliban were bragging that they had moved a Russian grenade launcher into position to hit the Korengal Outpost. The terps laughed, exclaiming about the days spent hauling the gun and ammo up a mountain for a few minutes of shooting. The lanky company executive o cer, Lt. John Rodriguez, climbed onto the sandbagged roof of a bunker and lay down behind a spotting scope.
"We got thirty minutes," he said. "See that tall old guy walking back down the road? He hangs out in Pakistan. Just told us the Talibs said to take no contracts to work on the road. He's their go-between. They won't shoot until he's way out of here."
Twenty minutes later, Russian 30mm shells exploded along the ground in front of Rodriguez. Cpl. Marc Madding, a wiry Marine adviser to the thirty-ve Afghan soldiers on the base, immediately returned re. A red line of .50 caliber rounds arced across the valley and kicked up dust on a ridgeline 700 meters away. Madding whooped as an Afghan soldier scurried from the latrine with the 30mm shells bursting behind him.
Inside a concrete blockhouse next to the aid station, Howell hunched over a large table map, listening over the radio to his exec's reports as he adjusted 120mm mortars. "Roger-755, 628," Howell said. The blasts echoed up and down the six-mile valley. The hidden Russian gun gamely red back until an A-10 aircraft arrived on station and dropped two 250-pound bombs, followed by stra ng runs. The valley went quiet after half an hour of long-distance shooting.
In ten months, Viper Company had logged 990 such engagements. The Americans held ve tiny outposts on the hillsides in the valley, exchanging shots with the Taliban about six times a day. The odds of the Taliban hitting anyone in any single ght were less than one percent. Still, they persisted, and had gradually in icted eight killed and thirty wounded and evacuated. The odds of hitting a Taliban hiding behind rocks were similarly low. Both sides replaced their losses. The Korengal was a battle of wills to be decided by which side quit first.
Each side returned the blows of the other. A week before Dewater was killed, Viper Company had sent out a routine ambush. The 2nd Platoon, accompanied by seven scout-snipers, left the wire at the Korengal Outpost, walked east across the stream, and began the arduous climb up an 8,000-foot ridge called Sawtalo Sar. It was on that ridge that the SEAL team had been ambushed in 2005.
"Lt. Cli Pederson and I had done a hundred patrols," Sgt. 1st Class Thomas Wright, the platoon sergeant, said. "We came over with thirtyve and had lost four killed, seven wounded and evaced, and one sent home with a crushed vertebrae in the lower back. So twenty-three of us went out on that patrol."
No American patrol of any size moved anywhere without being tracked. Listening on the captured Icom handheld radios, the interpreters said the rst watcher, or dicker, had reported thirty-nine soldiers crossing the river. A second spotter took over, saying the Americans were taking the Kandalay trail toward the hamlet of Chichal. So far, all was normal.
taking the Kandalay trail toward the hamlet of Chichal. So far, all was normal.
The soldiers trudged through scrub growth amidst the stumps of majestic cedar trees cut down and smuggled to Pakistan. They expected to climb for a half mile, set in an ambush, see nothing, and be shot at as they returned the next morning. Eighteen months earlier, Battle Company of the 173rd Brigade lost a soldier in a bloody ambush here.
The interpreters expected to hear the third watcher's report as they walked across an open meadow below Chichal. Nothing came over the Icom. Strange. The platoon entered the tree line above the meadow. Still no Icom chatter. They continued to climb. As the sun was setting, the watchers near the stream said, "They must have turned back." It was approaching dinnertime, and the relaxed watchers had left their posts.
Undetected, 2nd Platoon climbed higher in the dimming light. At point, Sgt. Zachery Reese came to an intersection with another trail angling from the north. Seeing a few footprints in the mud, he poked around and found two triple-A batteries. Thinking they might bag a few watchers the next morning, Wright set in his soldiers. Lt. Justin Smith-the new platoon leader-and Wright had practiced the ambush setup five times back at the outpost, using the Ranger handbook.
The soldiers quietly took their assigned positions in three strongpoints, with the apex converging on a kill zone thirty meters away. When they were settled in and had checked their sectors of re, Wright walked out to the kill zone and looked back. He could see no silhouettes of the ambushers.
Just before full dark, Smith sent out Reese with three scouts to set up a forward observation post near the converging trails, o to one side from the kill zone. In the pitch black, Reese and Sgt. Philip Nightengale were kneeling beside a fallen tree when they saw a few quick ashes of light approaching along the northern trail. They alerted the main body that they could hear men talking casually. A few minutes later, Reese whispered into his mike, "I see five, no, eight. Wait … twenty-six!" Back at the main body, Sta Sgt. Christopher Little was listening to the count in his earpiece. Through his night vision goggles he saw men walking right toward him. Unsure when Smith would yell to open re, he switched on the infrared light on his M4, illuminating a man with an AK only a few feet away. Seeing the target, Pfc. Troy Pacini ipped his SAW machine gun to full automatic. The man heard the click and peered forward.
"Fire!" Smith yelled. Two dozen weapons opened up. Pfc. Arturo Molano, manning the 240 Golf machine gun, watched through his thermal sight as pieces of green heat-chunks of esh-ew o two bodies. Insurgents were running in all directions, plunging o the trail, screaming as streams of red tracers swept back and forth.
"Blow Claymore!" Smith shouted over the din.
The Claymore detonated with a sharp crack, followed by soldiers throwing a few grenades. "No grenades!" Wright yelled. "Stay in your sectors of fire!" Back at the outpost, Howell was walking to the chow tent when he heard the gun re roll across the valley. He ran back to the ops center and called for Apaches before Smith radioed in a situation report. The two dozen soldiers at the outpost were smiling. They hadn't heard a single enemy weapon fire.
The rst round was over in six seconds. The soldiers, most of whom had ripped o two magazines, held their positions. It was too early to approach the kill zone, but there were few groans among the enemy. Most had died immediately, some badly ripped apart or ayed by the streams of bullets. Screaming could be heard over the ve Icom radios scattered among the dead. The terps said most was panicky nonsense -"The Americans are killing everyone!" "Main yahan hoon!" "Be brave, mujahideen! I feel bad for you!"
The second round started thirty minutes later when two Apaches hovered overhead and through thermals saw ve men hiding in a draw next to the ambush site. Spc. Jordan Custer and three other soldiers volunteered to go down after them. The drop was so steep they had to lie on their backs, slipping downward, hoping the enemies were too disoriented to fire at the noise.
Over an Icom came a shaky voice, "The end is near. Tell my wife I love her." Tell my wife I love her. Back at base, the interpreters didn't laugh. It was a normal sentiment, even in war. The dying man and his colleagues saw the American soldiers every day. They lined up for their prescriptions. The elders referred to Howell as "Captain Jimmy." They discussed what jobs the Taliban would and wouldn't permit. Yet they hacked to death their neighbors from the Pech and sauntered into the hills to shoot and to die. Nothing about the Korengal was normal.
The Apache pilots guided in Custer's team. "Go fifteen feet straight ahead.… Now turn to left ten feet. See that cave in front of you?" Custer peered through his night vision goggles. In the overhang of a boulder, three men sat huddled together, balaclavas wrapped around their heads in a failed e ort to prevent their body heat from being seen. Clutching AKs, they were mumbling "Allahu Akbar." Custer and the others opened fire from a few feet away, killing the three.
Fifteen Taliban were killed; none was captured. The success was not an accident. Viper Company had done everything right. The platoon leader and platoon sergeant had held repeated rehearsals that left nothing to chance. The soldiers had maintained strict silence and re discipline. There were no friendly casualties and the enemy was shattered. It was the most successful ambush in the war.
2nd Platoon returned with numerous documents, ve radios, two RPGs, and a dozen commonplace AKs. Chris Chivers, a New York Times combat correspondent, was at the outpost and examined the captured bullets. Many came from Afghan army and police stocks, most likely sold in the local markets.
The next day, the elders asked Howell for a cease-re while funeral parties climbed Sawtalo to bring the bodies back for burial. Four were strangers, but eleven lived in three hamlets near the Korengal outpost. The elders explained that a girl had eloped and the dead men were part of a posse that went to another village to bring her back. When Howell burst out laughing at the lie, they good-naturedly laughed back.
At the same time, the Taliban promised revenge. Their local leader, Haji Matin, had lost several cousins and nephews in the ambush. Over the Icoms, the jihadists talked about how angry he was. Mike Jones, the interpreter who had been in the Korengal for three years, was not surprised.
"I listen to those guys every day," he said. "Younger kids grow up, go to mosque, and join their older brothers in the hills. In 2006, Battalion 1-32 didn't know the area and shot, shot, shot. In 2008, 2-503 tried to shoot and talk. Now it's the same with Captain Howell and Viper, shoot, talk, shoot, talk. This is the best ambush I've seen. It changes nothing. The Korengalis say they ght for Islam, but they ght for revenge, too. That's why the Pech people are afraid of the Korengalis."
Four days later, a routine patrol left the outpost and headed south. Lt. John Rodriguez, the exec (company executive o cer), decided to go along because the platoon leader was new. When they got to the river, the water was running too swiftly to ford. So they went single le across a beam they had used before. They had no choice. There were only a few crossings and a few trails, with rocks worn smooth by centuries of farmers trudging back and forth.
Pfc. Dewater was seventh in line as they crossed and headed up the far embankment. Suddenly there was the tremendous roar of a roadside bomb, highly unusual because the insurgents rarely set o a device on paths used by their own families. Amidst the smoke, small arms re struck the patrol from both anks. Rodriguez called in A-10 strikes on two stone houses, while popping white and yellow smoke to conceal the withdrawal of the soldiers from the far side of the river.
When the ring died down at dusk, a muster was held and Dewater couldn't be found. Howell took everyone except the guards out from the outpost for a huge search in the dark. Dewater's shattered body was found far o the trail, so great had been the force of the blast. The Americans had struck, and the Taliban had struck back.
Howell responded by sending higher headquarters a detailed op plan. He would take two platoons, climb to the top of the 9,300-foot Abbas Ghar, search a hamlet on the high eastern slopes that intercepts indicated was a command center for Haji Matin, and then climb down the western slope back to the Korengal Outpost. It was a thirty-six-hour trek that would challenge the endurance of a mule.
Having received permission, Howell launched his search-and-attack patrol. But when the exhausted soldiers nally reached the crest of the Abbas Ghar, brigade headquarters decided not to allow the search of the hamlet, believing it was unlikely the soldiers would nd anything. Instead, angry locals might follow the patrol, sniping from a distance.
It happened time and again. Whenever it chose, higher headquarters could reach out and reel back in a Jimmy Howell. Of course, secondguessing the commander on the ground went against counterinsurgency doctrine that stated, "Higher commanders empower subordinates to make decisions within the commander's intent. They leave the details of execution to their subordinates and expect them to use initiative." Nevertheless, there were too many computers showing the location of every patrol, and too many smart sta o cers with ample spare time to second-guess the details.
Howell and his men trudged back, utterly spent. He wasn't pleased. "If we back o ," Howell said, "they're coming after us. The Korengal is the stopper in the bottle for the Pech. We have to keep pressure on the high ground. We must kill to change this war."
Seeing that Howell's soldiers were beat, Capt. John Farris, the senior Marine adviser at the KOP, volunteered to take out the next patrol with only Afghan soldiers.
"If we don't go out," he explained, "the dushmen [insurgents or bandits] will come in. It's like a boxing match-you got to keep jabbing." Farris, who had the un appable air of a senior adviser who logged a hundred patrols with his skin intact, commanded Embedded Training Team 5-4 in the Korengal Valley. The ETT consisted of seven Marines advising between ninety and 110 askars spread out over three outposts. While a new batch of Afghan soldiers rotated through every three months, the ETT stayed in place.
"We teach the basics," Farris said, "like how to stay alive. The askars will stick in a ght, but their aim is piss-poor and they maneuver by running straight ahead."
When the patrol left the outpost at rst light, Farris and Cpl. Madding were the only advisers accompanying a dozen Afghan soldiers. Madding tapped his radio.
"The muj always hold the high ground," he said to me. "They stand off and shoot, and I call in arty and air. Standard stuff." Viper Company was averaging a half dozen incidents a day of incoming re, generally from several hundred meters away in a random fashion called "spraying and praying." The enemy weaponry was as poor as the marksmanship. Of thirteen AK ri es recovered in Smith's ambush, only four had sturdy stocks adequate for long-range shooting. Several were junk weapons with the stocks sawed o , useful only for intimidating. Still, eight American soldiers had been killed. Sooner or later, the odds catch up.
The patrol strode at a fast clip downhill next to green trellises of wheat. On the valley oor, the pace quickened, each of us scooting quickly across a cedar timber that straddled the fast-running stream. Chris Chivers and Tyler Hicks of The New York Times were walking behind Farris. Hicks had been trapped in a ght on the far side of the stream in the ambush that took the life of Dewater. With a icker of a smile, Farris suggested that Hicks, famous for taking risks, take point to get the best pictures.
"Captain Farris is really in charge," Mike Jones, the interpreter, said. "The askars don't respect their sergeants, and the sergeants don't respect their officers. Many are scared of the Taliban. They won't patrol without their Marines."
Once on the east side of the valley, the patrol climbed with increasing vigilance up a steep inty path amidst the slippery moss and rock ledges. The sun was high enough now to throw a spotlight on the brilliant shades of green and gray slate-stone huts unchanged in architecture or materials for 3,000 years (Picture 4). Two women hurried down the path, wielding switches to herd a few scrawny cows and covering their faces. Farris visibly relaxed as they passed by.
"The muj don't mine the trails their families use," he said. "They took a risk when they killed Dewater to get revenge because we had just killed so many of them."
Sucking wind at 6,800 feet, we scrambled up a path of smoothed rocks into the hamlet of Donga. Clusters of stone dwellings, many dug into the slope a few feet above the one below, seemed to defy gravity (Picture 4). You'd think one house would come tumbling down and cascade into the next and the one below that, until all that was left was a great mound of square stones in the valley. By clinging to the sides of the mountains, these inbred sub-tribes avoid the spring oods and leave the most desirable at grounds for planting. Plus, it's harder to run upslope to attack your neighbors. Everyone developed sturdy lungs and hardy legs, and could easily out-walk the American or Afghan soldiers from the flatlands.
"When I was here in early '06," Farris said, "the people weren't sullen. They wanted the projects we o ered. There weren't many dushmen then. Now this is an infantry training range. Muj come from Pakistan for the summer hunting season. And every few months, I get another ANA [Afghan National Army] company to train."
We stood among the stone houses, looking up at cows and goats munching on hay on the balconies they shared with the humans. No children came out to gawk or beg for pens. Amidst the crowing of the roosters, there were no murmurs of voices. The soldiers dispersed into nooks that provided shelter from snipers, while Farris sat down behind a stone wall and lit up a cigarette.
Eventually two elders, one with few teeth and the other with a short beard and a glum expression, wandered down the path and squatted next to him. No greetings, no smiles, no offerings of chai in this hamlet of perhaps 400 people.
Sta Sgt. Mahamed, a Tajik who spoke a smattering of Korengali, politely greeted the elders, accepted a cigarette from Farris, and warily studied the surrounding hills.
"Mahamed pulled the duty today," Farris said. "The company's first sergeant took the day off. He's down on the Pech running some scam. If the Afghan army put as much effort into fighting as they do into earning money mafia-style, we'd have won by now."
An elder squatted down next to Farris. "We have schoolbooks for you," Farris said. "No, I don't think so," one of the glum elders, Mak Mazaya, said. "We welcome you at the health clinic." "The fighters say no." "They were here last night?" The elder shrugged as Farris joined the Afghan staff sergeant in looking carefully at the high ground to the south. "A sniper on Honcho Hill?" No answer. "Nipple Rock?" A slight nod from Mazaya. Farris drew back against the wall and languidly blew smoke. Occasionally he glanced at his map, with dozens of small crosses indicating artillery registration points. He had shown me an e-mail that he had sent to his higher headquarters a week ago.
"We conduct our KLEs [Key Leader Engagements] by going into villages to talk to the head elder," he had written. "We sit there until all hell breaks loose, an effective if dangerous and uncreative way to locate the enemy."
Farris smiled slightly and patiently drew on his cigarette. He had long ago given up winning hearts and minds. He and the elder both knew he was waiting to get shot at, so that he could shoot back. Ten minutes passed with not a word spoken (Picture 5). Then the laughter of children at play carried up to the hamlet.
"The muj won't shoot around those kids," Farris said. "We can pack it in." At a leisurely pace, the patrol returned to the KOP. "The elders are powerless," Farris said. "We talk to them, and they check with the muj. We leave blankets and stu for them outside the vill. Sometimes they burn it, or give it to the muj. We o ered to build a road and the villagers sent a delegation to Pakistan to petition Abdul Rahmin, a Taliban head honcho. Rahmin said no. So, no road."
Mike estimated there were about ninety Korengali ghters who belonged to six separate gangs, squad-sized units from separate kahols, or clans. They bickered among themselves over the Icoms about who was to attack where, who was hoarding ammunition, and who was too lazy to ght or climb some mountain. Mike heard Pakistani accents and men who were obviously outsiders giving orders at various times during the summer ghting season. These were the "Tier 1" dedicated jihadists from Pakistan who moved around and generally showed up when a large attack was planned.
After two years in the Korengal, Mike wasn't overly impressed with their fighting skills. "They think they're better than they are," Mike said. "Because I speak Korengali, they think they can brag to me and mouth o . I take no shit from these people. Captain Farris and Captain Howell, they back me up."
In the afternoon, Sgt. 1st Class Wright led a patrol of twenty askars and American soldiers to Babeyal, a hamlet on the same side of the valley as the KOP. The spring air was crisp and the foliage shone brilliantly under the bright sun as the soldiers hopped across numerous streams fed by the melting snowpack. The patrol reached the largest mosque in the valley just as the Friday sermon was ending.
As a hundred males led out, Wright herded the younger men into a single line. A soldier began to take pictures and ngerprints with a large device called a HIDE. He was supposed to enter sixteen lines of data with each photo-name, father's name, occupation, and so forth. Completing a single entry took twenty minutes.
The Korengalis were distant, disciplined, and neutral in demeanor. Not one smiled nor scowled. They talked among themselves in low voices and did as they were told, ignoring the few attempts of the askars to strike up a conversation.
"You're looking at our enemies," Wright said to me (Picture 6). "And we can't do a damn thing."
After an hour, Wright gave up collecting the data, took some pictures, and dispersed the worshippers. "Too much work for nothing," Mike Jones said. "We don't know who to arrest. Anyway, Americans aren't permitted to make arrests and no police ever come to this valley. So why bother taking their pictures?"
A few months earlier, ve masked men with AKs had entered a nearby mosque, dragged an elder outside to a corn eld, declared him to be an informant, and hacked off his head.
"The charge was bullshit," Howell said. "We got nothing from him. The dushmen cut off his head to keep control by scaring everyone." Three of the insurgents killed in the recent ambush had attended the mosque and were buried nearby. Yet Afghan soldiers prayed there alongside their enemies. Capt. Jimmy Howell had been leading soldiers for ve years before his current tour. From Beaumont, Texas, he had played defensive back on the West Point football team, graduating in 2002.
"Academically, my marks made everyone else look brilliant," he said. "But I loved the field stuff." After Ranger School, he commanded a platoon in Afghanistan. On one raid, his soldiers surrounded a compound where a midlevel Taliban leader lived. The rst American to approach the door was shot dead. All day, the ght raged, as the insurgents hidden behind the compound's thick stone walls drove back every e ort to assault the building. On the second day, Howell called in air support. It took three 250-pound bombs before the ring from the house ceased. Inside were the bodies of seven ghters, three women, and two children. In one corner, an unhurt year-old baby girl was crying. Howell, the father of two little girls, left Afghanistan struck by the fact that every compound was a hardened fort and that war required agonizing decisions between protecting your own soldiers and placing civilians at risk. He then did another tour in Afghanistan and two tours in Iraq with a Ranger battalion before deploying into the Korengal in May of 2008 with Viper Company.
In a kabuki dance ritual, every Thursday about a dozen elders attended a shura at the KOP. Hamlet elders presented claims for battle damage and Howell doled out funds ranging from $2,000 for a civilian death to $100 for a goat. Some elders took advantage; others were too proud and hostile to ask for anything.
"We're not making any progress with these people," he said. "The insurgents we ght every day are their brothers, sons, uncles. We have to kill enough bad guys and remove their leaders before things will change."
A combat leader needs three qualities. The rst is competence. Howell made sure that those on every patrol knew they were never alone. He covered every route with on-call artillery, and ensured helicopter gunships and medevac birds were available. The soldiers knew they would not be left on their own or outmatched. Howell was the calm voice on the radio net, assuring those in contact that he was bringing in supporting arms.
The second quality is caring for your people. Understanding how the odds of being hit weighed on soldiers' minds, Howell varied the tempo and duration of patrols. On average, each grunt walked up the hills or through the villages ve days a week, but Howell kept his finger on the pulse of the platoons and varied the routine with the circumstances.
The third quality is courage and conviction in the mission. No one questioned Howell's valor. Either he or his executive o cer, Lt. John Rodriguez, accompanied many combat patrols. (Rodriguez, who had commanded a ri e platoon, had assured his wife that his new job as exec was to push paper.)
When Viper first relieved Bravo Company of the 173rd in July of 2008, the insurgents concentrated upon Outpost Vegas, a few miles north in the valley.
"Every time we lined up for hot food, "Rodriguez said, "we'd attract snipers. As a platoon leader, I ate last and went hungry a lot of nights. One sniper we called Fast Freddie shot at us every time we went to the shitter. He was a real sicko."
When insurgent casualties became too heavy around Vegas, other gangs to the south attacked the undersized platoon at Outpost Restrepo and the larger platoon and company headquarters at the KOP.
"We'd listen to them on the radio," Howell said, "arguing who has to attack next."
The tricky challenge for Howell was de ning the mission. Without any Afghan o cials in the Korengal, the counterinsurgency axiom of linking the local population to the government made no sense. Howell decided that his company's task was to prevent the insurgents from setting up a safe haven.
"We're the cork in the bottle," he said. "If we weren't here, the muj would be attacking along the Pech. We have to patrol to keep them o balance."
Everyone in the valley knew Jimmy. In superb physical condition, he treated all villagers with formal politeness, made no entreaties, and left the clear impression that he intended to kill all insurgents who shot at his soldiers.
Howell loved the physical challenge and the sheer adventure of climbing in the forests. The screeching monkeys, as ubiquitous as squirrels, and the sheep in the upper meadows attracted an assortment of predators. Curious coyotes shadowed patrols, while massive wild dogs occasionally sneaked inside the wire. Wolves were sometimes sighted and two tawny mountain lions took to pawing through the garbage pit at isolated Outpost #1 behind the KOP.
Winter in the Korengal brought boredom, loneliness, and the misery of a subsistence routine. Fighting ebbed. If foliage was nature's blessing for guerrillas, then snow was their curse. The muj were too smart to trudge across the snow to take a few potshots, and then leave a trail behind them.
"First platoon holding Restrepo had it the hardest in the winter," Howell said. "The sleeping bags were warm enough, but they went fortyve days without a shower. Morale dropped. I told my soldiers they had the hardest ght. Iraq had Fallujah; Afghanistan had Korengal. They'd be remembered."
After ten months of daily ghting, by the spring of 2009 the soldiers were a tight-knit group that judged a man by whether he stuck when the going was rough. No supplies came in by vehicle. After two helicopters were shot down, the pilots switched to night missions. Soldiers wore dog flea collars on their belts and around their necks, and still flea bites covered their bodies.
"Very few in this company are on their second tour," Howell said. "Even before combat, you get a sense for who's a real soldier. We rejected fifteen soldiers back in the States. I should have left back another fifteen. I don't look for the physical stud or the kid with the highest IQ. I watch for the new soldier who's not selfish, takes initiative, and thinks positively. He'll do well in combat."
Every soldier was given two weeks of home leave during the year. Nine chose not to return, claiming severe posttraumatic stress disorder. One soldier was on his second tour in the Korengal and had barely escaped from a helicopter that had crashed, with another soldier burned to death. When he didn't return from leave due to PTSD, throughout the ranks of Viper there was sympathy for him. The eight other cases met with cold skepticism. There was hard bark on the grunts in Viper.
Howell projected a somber, slightly detached mien. He knew he would lose men, no matter the level of skill. The death of Sgt. John Penich in October had remained with him. Penich, a husky young man from Illinois, was a company mainstay. He fussed over his men, greeted everyone with a warm smile, and reacted un inchingly in ght after ght. Caught in cross re inside a hamlet, he was giving instructions over the radio while 155mm artillery shells were adjusted on one azimuth and 120mm heavy mortar rounds on another. A re observer confused an adjustment between the artillery and the mortars, and an errant shell killed Penich. In close combat, it is impossible to prevent all friendly fire mistakes. Penich was a terrific soldier, and Howell carried the pain of his loss.
"If I had to do it again," Howell said, "I'd patrol more in the mountains, using air assaults and ground insertion. I'd insist on good intel to attack known enemy locations. A company with good intel could wreak havoc on the Korengal insurgency. You would have casualties-but I wouldn't put a unit out that couldn't win any fight they got into."
Howell wasn't playing for a tie, and he didn't believe the Korengali tribe could be converted to the government side. In 2007, Sgt. Maj. Jimmy Carabello with Battalion 1-32 had recommended pulling out, or nishing the ght by putting in two companies, pushing all the way through the valley, and sealing both ends. Howell favored attacking from the top down, with helicopter squads along the ridgelines to clear draw after draw, setting up observation posts as they advanced-a technique used in the mountains of Vietnam. The tactic required helicopter support and risked the near certainty that some small team would be overmatched and mauled.
"You fast-rope down onto a ridge," Col. John Spiszer, the brigade commander, said, "and sooner or later someone breaks an ankle. Now you need a helicopter to extract the injured. Getting dedicated helicopter support is unrealistic. There are too many demands for helicopters."
Year after year, the senior command placed a lone ri e company inside the Korengal, with power hard enough to antagonize the villagers but not overwhelming enough to break their will to fight. I asked three-star and four-star generals why they allowed the Korengal to drag on. Invariably they replied that the deployment of one ri e company was a tactical decision left to the brigade or battalion level.
Yet the writing in The New York Times and other national papers was so vivid that the Korengal became a symbol of the war. By describing real, concrete frustrations and struggles, journalists like Rubin and Chivers illustrated universal truths about the nature of tribes, cultures, and battles. The generals were oblivious that the Korengal illustrated the war's strategic drift. If the generals couldn't solve a frontpage problem, what issues were they solving?
In May of 2009, a company from the 4th Infantry Division replaced Capt. Jimmy Howell and Viper Company. At the headquarters level, the decision had been made to close the Korengal Outpost, along with other outposts in the mountains. In what Rudyard Kipling called "the arithmetic of the frontier," Islamic fundamentalism had combined with growing tribal hostility to fuel unending attacks against isolated American positions.
"Repositioning forces from the Korengal to more populated areas," Col. Randy George, the brigade commander, said, "will allow us to have greater flexibility."

However, twenty-rst-century attitudes about war made forcible relocation unthinkable. But that does not explain why it took the high command six years of frustration and forty-two American lives to decide to leave the valley. As the American soldiers pulled out of the Korengal in April of 2010, Gen. Stanley McChrystal offered an explanation.
"American soldiers were an irritant to the people," he said. "There was probably much more ghting than there would have been [if U.S. troops had never come]." 
2
"Everybody hates them [the Americans]," Haji Nizamuddin, a Korengali elder, said. "They shoot at people, they raid our houses and kill our women and children … our tribes can protect us against the insurgents." 
3
"In this place, with all its violent history," the company commander said, "that is our proudest achievement." When avoiding casualties is the achievement, it is time to leave. The loss of one soldier in a company was far below the average in Afghanistan. There comes that moment, though, when you don't want to fight anymore. The troop-to-population ratio and the logistics for air support in the Korengal were too onerous. The operational plan-small units in outposts-did not t the terrain. The enemies from the local tribes always held the high ground and proved too tough to dislodge. The Taliban claimed victory on the global stage, triumphantly leading an Al Jazeera television crew on a tour of the abandoned Korengal outpost.
In 2010, the writer Sebastian Junger coproduced a lm called Restrepo, featuring a platoon defending a Korengal outpost. The lm was acclaimed as an apolitical depiction of soldiers. The lack of a strategic rationale for defending the outpost added poignancy to the film.
Film critic Andrew O'Hehir wrote a scathing critique: "The only way to defend the entirely pointless and destructive campaign these men waged in the Korengal is to say that sending young men around the world to experience that drug high-the high of shooting, and killing, and possibly dying, as about 50 Americans did in that valley-in the name of vague notions about honor and patriotism and sacri ce is a good thing in itself. Because they sure as hell didn't accomplish anything else."

Yes, soldiers ght for their comrades. In isolated outposts like the Korengal, as the historian Gerald Linderman had noted about the Civil War, "fellowship becomes almost a religion … in the camaraderie of misery." 
6
Guarding the mountain anks in order to provide security for the population in the valley was not a drug high. It was a logical operation. The flaw lay in hoping that the tribes would stand up against the fierce jihadists.
By the time the Korengal was abandoned in 2010, the press had lost interest in the war as old news. According to a Gallup poll, the war did not rank among the top ten problems listed by the public.

In 2008, presidential candidate Obama had decried Iraq, while declaring that Afghanistan was "the war that has to be won." Within months of taking o ce, he announced a strategy that de ned the con ict as regional, urged Pakistan to clamp down on its Islamic radicals, endorsed counterinsurgency nation building in Afghanistan, and increased the U.S. force from 50,000 to 63,000. 
1
Obama called his strategy Af-Pak, meaning Afghanistan and Pakistan were intertwined. Pakistan, with dozens of nuclear weapons, toleration of terrorists, and enmity toward India, was more important than the backward tribes of Afghanistan. It was daunting to deal with 31 million unruly Afghan tribesmen. The challenge became much greater when 300 million Pakistanis were thrown into the equation.
In his Af-Pak speech in March of 2009, the president promised to defeat the cephalous Afghan fundamentalists and to aid Pakistan in gaining control over its western frontiers. Afghanistan, Obama said, "will see no end to violence if insurgents move freely back and forth across the border." The border is a 1,500-mile-long trace on a map that followed the natural contours of massive ridgelines from the Hindu Kush in the north down through the fabled Khyber Pass and into the deserts of the south.
At the same time that Capt. Jimmy Howell was struggling in the Korengal, the military high command was trying to prevent the movement of the insurgents back and forth across the border with Pakistan. Regional Command, or RC East, was charged with controlling 150 districts in seven provinces encompassing 300 miles of mountains and valleys stretching from Kabul northeast along the Pakistan border.

The east was the wild thing that had fascinated Rudyard Kipling and Winston Churchill, a setting for romance and slaughter. It was in the blood of those Pashtuns to ght. When there were no outsiders to ght, they turned against each other. Each decade witnessed at least one local war. In 1933, the Mohmand tribe on the Pakistani side of the Durand Line attacked the Afghan side to gain grazing lands. In 1937, the Mohmand and Ghilzai tribes revolted. In 1945, the tribes in the Konar Valley retaliated against the Mohmands. In 1947, the Sa rebellion brie y united all the tribes against the king in Kabul. In 1959, the Konar Valley tribes again rioted against Kabul decrees. In 1968, the Ja tribe attacked the Mangwal tribe on the east side of the Konar River. In 1970, the Shinwaris lashed out against the nomadic Kuchi tribe. Had the Soviets studied those blood feuds, they may have thought twice before they invaded the Konar in 1979 and united the tribes against them.
BATTALION 1-32 RETURNS For Gen. Schloesser, the art of command lay in applying su cient power to prevent sanctuaries inside the capillary valleys, without diverting too much manpower from the populated areas. When Battalion 1-32 returned in February of 2009, Schloesser placed it on the east side of the Konar River to interdict the infiltrators from Pakistan.
1-32's new commander, Lt. Col. Mark O'Donnell, was a two-tour Ranger operative who liked to play with the local kids. Sgt. Maj. Jimmy Carabello, who struck fear into every salty soldier, was back for his second tour with the battalion. A veteran of the Korengal ghts in 2006-2007, Carabello knew his soldiers were in for a long year. On the base called Camp Joyce, he built a basketball court to pull the soldiers away from their iPods and to learn how to play as teams.
"In college, I fell in love with the English language," Carabello said. "Essays build mental discipline. Do you know how hard it is for a smartass Pfc. to write a 2,000-word essay on 'Why I Must Not Roll My Eyes When My Sergeant Speaks'?" ALL TAKE, NO GIVE O'Donnell took responsibility for a forty-kilometer stretch of the Konar River Valley that ran north-south, with the mountains marking the Pakistan border a few miles to the east (Picture 7). Rather than set up a picket line on the isolated mountaintops (Picture 8), O'Donnell decided to station his soldiers among the people. The idea was they would provide projects and jobs, encourage the local o cials, and receive information in return. The people would provide the early warning system allowing U.S. and Afghan soldiers to hunt down the infiltrators.
1-32 built four outposts ten kilometers apart (Map 4). The outpost in Pash-shad village ve miles south of 1-32's main base was typical. It consisted of a stout house made from bricks and heavy timbers, a well with good water, an inner courtyard with grass, small trees, and a mortar tube, and an outer wall of dried mud several feet thick, pockmarked with bullet holes. For years, the Taliban had driven into town when they wished, shot a few AK rounds into the walls to frighten the police hiding inside, and went about their business. Twenty American soldiers slept on cots adjacent to their sentry positions. Occasionally they caught a scorpion or a huge camel spider that oozed green pus when squashed. They swatted ies away from the hot meal trucked in once a day, played soccer in the courtyard, sent emails when the Internet connection was working, stood guard duty, and ran patrols. The smallest patrol was squad-sized, about a dozen soldiers, with another squad standing by as a QRF, Quick Reaction Force. About one patrol a day left the fort.
The platoon patrolled twenty kilometers of valley holding about 50,000 people. Any patrol venturing into the foothills to the east was shot at. So going east required helicopter gunships on standby alert, limiting such patrols to one a week. The other patrols walked through the villages along the river, stopping to watch volleyball games and chat with farmers who were polite but distant.
Along the river valley, there was no shooting. One night through their night vision goggles a patrol watched as men tugged boxes from a dozen donkeys and placed them on a raft. Not knowing if they were insurgents or smugglers, brigade headquarters decided not to shoot and the men on the raft waved at the frustrated patrol.
Ten Afghan police lounged around inside the fort, answering to the local chief, Pacha Sheragar. For three months, the platoon leader at the fort, Lt. Gabriel Lamois, had closely watched Pacha, but hadn't gured him out. Pacha volubly protested his hatred of the Taliban, yet his police never made an arrest.
Taped to the wall of the operations bunker at Pash-shad was a chart that diagrammed the hierarchy of the local insurgent organizations, including names and photos. Lamois had memorized many of the bearded faces. In March of 2009, he had visited the hamlet of Tangu, a dozen mud houses set among acres of wheat. Not one man from Tangu had accepted a job o er to build a road. Lamois stood in a crowd, asking why.
An elderly schoolteacher, who kept scratching his left leg, said it was di cult to nd time to work, the contractor was rude, and so on. Lamois thought he recalled the man's face from a wanted poster. He called back to Pash-shad and was told the wanted man had been shot in the left leg. Lamois o ered ointment from his rst-aid pouch. When the man pulled up his pant leg, revealing a bullet wound, Lamois arrested him. Back to base, the detainee exchanged greetings with the police.
"The attitude is live and let live," Lamois told me. "We watch guys in the hills watching us. We'll ask the cops, is that a bad guy? They shrug their shoulders. How sick is that?"
The same was true of the local people. In the scru y town of Pash-shad, the U.S. Agency for International Development had built a sizable school for 700 boys and girls in grades one through four. On a warm spring day, Lt. Graham Rockwell, twenty-four, of Spring eld, Massachusetts, led a small patrol to the school to give out supplies donated by grammar schools back in the States. On a previous trip, the teachers-stern, erect old men who wore the traditional abaya of the Pashtun tribe-had handed the gifts to the boys. This time, Rockwell insisted the gifts go to the girls, who shyly lined up to receive pencils, notebooks, kites, balloons, and yo-yos (Picture 9).
As they dashed away shrieking with delight, Rockwell sipped green tea with the teachers. Kho na, the a able principal, asked for Army engineers to bulldoze a soccer field.
"A dozen farmers can clear that eld," Rockwell said. "We built the school and brought you textbooks. What have you done for yourself? Two rockets hit near here yesterday. One killed a beggar in a wheat field. You know that."

The platoon leaders knew anyone who answered their questions was signing his own death warrant. Only a few interrogators in the battalion were authorized to recruit informers. The daily patrols elicited little information.
The attitude of the population also bothered Maj. Jason Dempsey, 1-32's operations o cer. While on the faculty at West Point, Dempsey had written a book about politics. He had conducted polls showing that 10 percent of the population approved of the Taliban, while 67 percent approved of the Americans. Yet he handed me a picture of young teenagers piling rocks on a path behind a U.S. armored vehicle so that it could be ambushed. Minutes before he had snapped the picture, the boys had been waving at the soldiers.
"Americans have been in Konar for seven years," Dempsey said, "and we haven't broken through with these people. I don't know what to make of the government officials either. Some are crooks and some are straight. They all cover their tracks." Battalion 1-32 shared Camp Joyce with Lt. Col. Esoc and his battalion of 400 askars, mostly Tajiks. Esoc had fought the Soviets and had served as a bodyguard for Ahmad Shah Masoud, the anti-Taliban Tajik warlord assassinated just before 9/11.
"Konar people like Americans," Esoc told me. "You bring money and build roads. But the police rob them. So the people don't say anything when Taliban pass through."
Ten miles south, Attack Company of 1-32 had built their outpost in the district town of Khas Konar. The company commander, Capt. Mike Harrison, twenty-seven, came from a military family. His grandfather had graduated from the Naval Academy, his father had served in the Marines in Vietnam and later ew helicopters in the Army, and both Mike and his two brothers were West Point graduates. In 2006, he had served as a platoon leader on the Pech. He had been in command billets for six straight years, including twenty-six months in combat.
"The best soldiers," he said, "display initiative, self-con dence, and intelligence. Same is true of o cers. I've had to relieve three platoon leaders. And we have captains in command simply because they had time in grade, not competence."
Each day, he drove around the district. stopping to chat with everyone. He was so well known that swarms of children shouted "Michael! Michael!" when he drove past. With 120,000 people in his area, he had a budget of $2 million. He met with the elders from eighteen villages and solicited proposals, receiving surprisingly detailed and sensible bids. His goal was to award two visible projects to each village. Among the projects were two small (40kW) hydropower generators, three mosques, four paved roads, ve schools, a compound for the district government, and dozens of stone walls to provide ood control along the river. Harrison, who had been accepted at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, kept a careful log. While some argued that dollars were ammunition to win hearts and minds, money meant he was an accountant as well as company commander.
In return, he hoped the villagers would provide information. There were frequent radio intercepts of ghters moving through, stopping to buy food and rest. Strangers shopped in the district market, and no one pointed them out.
Frustrated, Harrison called for a shura. Two dozen village leaders showed up. They sat along the walls in a large air-conditioned room, sipping tea and gossiping. Harrison spoke from his notes.
"I am building a girls' school at the Barzai refugee camp," he said. "The refugees are your fellow Afghans. You won't let them shop at the market, but you allow strangers to buy food there. I paid you four months ago for a school in Sarbani. It has not been built."
Dressed in short-sleeve waistcoats and untucked long shirts worn over their trousers, the village leaders shifted uncomfortably in their plastic chairs. Some looked down at the list of projects Harrison had circulated, while others checked their cell phones for messages. When no one responded, Maj. Shah Jahan, representing the local Afghan army detachment, spoke up.
"You know they killed our intelligence o cer last week," Jahan said. "They killed his six-year-old son rst, to make him cry before he died. All that yelling, crying, and shooting. And none of you reported hearing a thing. Who told the assassins where he lived? Who hid them during the day? Who showed them how to leave? You report bad people to me, and I will take care of them. But without your help, I can't protect you."
After the elders left, Harrison met with the district sub-governor, Shajahan Ashaqzi, a former law professor who had been posted to the district without a budget or even a car. He relied on the Americans for all his supplies. His ministry in Kabul was like a distant planet.
"My government should build from the bottom," he said, "not the top. Only Michael [Harrison] cares about this district." Harrison's medic, Sgt. Ed Welch, was also on his second tour. "An Afghan looks at democracy," he said to me, "the way a drug addict looks at rehab. Both want the results but won't go through the pain of getting there."
Harrison smiled and shook his head. He had heard Welch's line before.
Every day, dozens of American and a few hundred Afghan vehicles drove along the road on the east side of the Konar River between Harrison's southern position and Battalion 1-32's base at Camp Joyce. The American presence was certainly reassuring to the farmers, although they knew the Taliban could sneak in whenever they chose. Away from the main road, 1-32 relied upon armored mounted patrols. Whenever possible, foot patrols were covered by a heavy machine gun in a nearby vehicle. While patrols occasionally encountered gangs of Taliban ghters, the insurgents saw the Americans coming and moved aside. That didn't mean they were safe. Inside the battalion operations center, a at screen showed the video from overhead platforms-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), helicopter, and aircraft, including B-1 bombers. An Air Force master sergeant studied hours of video, straining to distinguish between a hiker with a cane or a ri e. Whenever Camp Joyce was hit by rockets, the sergeant would focus the cameras on suspected launch sites near the Pakistan border. If radar or another source con rmed a site, the sergeant ordered artillery or air strike within three minutes. By then, the attackers had usually ducked into caves.
Another operator monitored enemy radio chatter and provided signals intelligence, SIGINT, on likely locations. The really juicy targets, one to five miles inside Pakistan, were off-limits.
About once a week, though, the video feeds and intercepts provided a rm location. The watch o cer in the ops center would then call Brigade and plead his case for an artillery or air strike. Two out of three times, Brigade would approve.
The Taliban ghters adapted by not carrying weapons. Their secret caches were in place and as long as they weren't betrayed, they were safe even when the Americans drove right past them. By 2009, there were 200 miles of paved roads in Konar. As tra c increased on the roads, trade also picked up, with roadside stands o ering tire repair, clothes, kabobs, tea, wheat, and vegetables. In place of handouts, a free market was emerging. Some referred to the roads as "ink lines," a word play on the counterinsurgency concept of security spreading out like an inkblot. Certainly the hardtop roads did make it more di cult to plant IEDs. But capitalism didn't translate into control by the Afghan government.
The insurgents protected themselves by a veil of secrecy, hiding in plain view as civilians. The Afghan soldiers living on the bases were outsiders from Kabul and the north, as blind as the Americans. The local cops drove around in shiny new Toyota Hiluxes, with no bullet holes. Live and let live. At the governor's weekly meeting, the police chief and Lt. Col. Esoc, the army battalion commander, rarely acknowledged each other.
If a farmer wanted to join the jihad, he knew someone who knew someone who was connected. At the mosques, contacting the mujahideen was easy. In a kahol or extended family, if one son joined the Taliban or the HIG, the chances were high that several others followed and fought in the same small gang. Every stone farmhouse was its own fortress where the relatives shielded one another. If you wanted to stay out of the ght, as most did, that was all right. You knew or suspected which men in other compounds were insurgents. But you were left alone, as long as you kept your mouth shut. Once a secret Taliban cadre rose in the hierarchy, he attracted the attention of the Special Operations Forces and became a marked man. But the lower-level cadres remained relatively safe, because conventional coalition battalions like 1-32 had limited detective skills. And once a suspect was detained, the Afghan and coalition systems facilitated his release.
Battalion 1-32 had a small intelligence cell called the Human Collection Team. In mid-2009, the HCT identi ed a man named Ajimal as the chief bomb maker in the valley. Two CIA sources, who didn't know each other, had separately ngered him. But there were twenty Ajimals in that area. So O'Donnell sent out patrols to keep asking questions. Eventually an interpreter bribed a shopkeeper to point the man out. A UAV then followed him back to his compound. SIGINT and video feeds concentrated on the house for a week, con rming conversations with the HIG network in Pakistan and watching a truck leave the compound at three in the morning. O'Donnell sent the results to higher headquarters, where a general o cer could approve what was called a Deliberate Detention. A week later, Ajimal was placed on the Detain List, meaning he could be picked up without bomb-making material in his possession.
To protect their sources and methods, 1-32 decided to grab him up as part of a general sweep through the market outside A-Bad. U.S. or NATO soldiers, however, cannot arrest Afghan citizens. So Lt. Col. Esoc sent ten Afghan soldiers with Capt. Scott Horrigan and his scout platoon.
When the soldiers piled out of their vehicles on the bustling market street on a sunny afternoon, hundreds of Afghan males gathered to watch. Horrigan sauntered casually around, seeming to select at random several onlookers, including Ajimal. Horrigan had them stand in a row as the crowd watched dispassionately. Some men folded their arms and glowered, a few muttered "feringhee" (foreigners). Most weren't friendly.
"This is my second tour in Konar doing this stu ," Master Sgt. Jason Rivas, an intelligence specialist, said to me. "I don't know what these Afghans are thinking. I do know some Taliban will go door-to-door tonight, asking what the Americans were doing."
I watched as Ajimal stood in line, laughing with the others as if he didn't have a care in the world (Picture 10). Then he casually slipped out his cell phone and handed it to the next man in line, who handed it to the next, and so on. A boy at the edge of the crowd slipped forward, took the phone, and edged away.
Rivas yelled "HEY!," grabbed the boy, and took back the phone. Dozens of onlookers, who had watched the sleight-of-hand, had muttered no warning. Ajimal was handcuffed and placed in a vehicle, while Horrigan's platoon headed for his house.
Rivas had a photo showing the location of the house and two Apache helicopters ew over the platoon, scouting for an ambush. An unfriendly crowd trailed behind, threatening to throw rocks when a soldier stopped to urinate behind a tree without squatting. Ajimal's house-the largest in the village-was surrounded by a high wall and the courtyard was carpeted with freshly trimmed grass and rows of flowers. An old couple surrounded by a dozen children stood on the patio.
When the askars politely entered the house, the family began screaming. The children panicked, crying and running in circles. Some of the Afghan soldiers turned on Horrigan, yelling that they were violating tribal culture. Other askars yelled back that the family was acting. A st ght nearly ensued. Her face awash in tears, the old woman wailed that her younger son had been murdered and now Ajimal, her older son, was falsely accused by men who wanted to steal their land.
"I was born and raised in Kabul," J.R., an interpreter from Dallas, said to me as we watched the tumult. "See how good these people are at telling lies? I'd buy that old lady's act if I didn't know Ajimal talks to his handlers in Pakistan every week."
At the base, the Afghan soldiers duly signed forms declaring they wanted the prisoner transferred to American authority. This gave the battalion the legal right to send him for questioning to the American prison at Bagram Air Force Base, north of Kabul.
"I have seven intercepts of Ajimal," O'Donnell said, "talking with HIG in Bajaur [Pakistan]. I can't enter electronic surveillance as evidence. It's up to the interrogators to break him."
I later inquired about Ajimal at the Bagram prison. "If we pull a raid and catch ve guys," an interrogator at Bagram said, "the odds are one will talk. Unless we get a detainee to open up right away, it'll be a year before he tells us anything, if then. Most prisoners walk before they talk. Ajimal gave us bullshit."
The interrogators explained that Ajimal had claimed the Taliban had stored supplies in his hurza, the small house wealthy Pashtuns maintain inside their compounds for guests. He had cooperated because they threatened to kill his family. He claimed not to remember any names. Someone else had used his cell phone. Four months later, he was set free and took up residence in Pakistan.
Both the Afghan government and the coalition failed to imprison insurgents.
The Afghan system was inherently corrupt. The judiciary could not e ciently process those few that were held for trial. There were few quali ed applicants to serve as judges. The pay was poor, the danger of assassination was high, and it was hard to make steady money even as a dishonest judge, given an erratic market. The Americans didn't turn over the plum prisoners-the top-tier terrorists with deep pockets and contacts in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states. Tribes preferred to judge their own rather than hand them over to the government. Most local Taliban paid the police to release them before they ever made it to a courtroom. A judge had to nd someone guilty occasionally, and the families of those convicted wanted revenge.
Given these factors, the police were inclined to release rather than to hold a suspect for trial, and neither honest nor dishonest o cials wanted to serve as judges. Less than 10 percent of those detained as insurgents were tried, found guilty, and imprisoned for more than a year. In most insurgencies, at least one guerrilla would be imprisoned for the long term for every four or ve reported killed. Yet despite the constant fighting, on a per capita basis there was the same number of prisoners in jail in Sweden as in Afghanistan.
The coalition also avoided holding prisoners. To de ect political criticism, NATO's policy was not to arrest insurgents. If a European unit did capture an insurgent, he was quickly handed over to Afghan forces. Especially dangerous terrorists captured by American (usually SOF) forces were held in the American prison at Bagram. But that number remained below a thousand, twenty times less than the number that the United States had held in Iraq.
Our enemies in the twenty-rst century do not wear uniforms, and the Supreme Court has proved unable to provide guidelines for dealing with unlawful combatants. President Obama issued no understandable policy, the Congress dodged responsibility, and Attorney General Eric Holder vacillated, saying that the U.S. government may detain combatants until the end of a war, although some might be tried in federal courts and others in military tribunals.

Given no intelligible policy guidance, the U.S. military offered rationalizations. "You can't kill or detain your way out of an insurgency," said Brig. Gen. Mark Martins, deputy commander of U.S. detainment operations in Afghanistan. "For us, reintegration is the new center of gravity."

In America, a youth who acts as the lookout in a crime where a killing occurs is tried for murder, even if his involvement was "accidental." If imprisonment is based on the motivation for joining a group, then we have to change our domestic laws. And surely it makes sense for every Taliban, once convicted, to plead that his service in the insurgency was accidental.
The counterinsurgency ideal of the rule of law failed because the Afghan government was systemically corrupt and the coalition system politically neutered. There was no severe prison term for an insurgent. Instead, the opposite was true; faced with growing political pressure, the coalition did not want to hold prisoners. Rather than leveling with the troops about the political reality, too many generals resorted to a metaphysical evasion-"you can't kill or detain your way out of an insurgency." This legerdemain ducked the issue of inadequate imprisonment and caused cynicism in the ranks.
Ajimal had been sent to Bagram because he knew the bombers who were killing Americans. The Afghans in Konar had their own means of deciding whom to send to jail. Americans had scant knowledge of how that process actually worked. Weeks after Ajimal had been released, O'Donnell was driving past the cracked high stone walls of the provincial prison and decided to pop in for an unannounced visit.
The portly warden was befuddled but pleased by the presence of a powerful American. O'Donnell explained genially that he'd like to look around, nothing o cial. The warden shouted some sharp orders, dusted o a few chairs, regally sent out for chai, and stalled with strained small talk for twenty minutes. Then he invited us to follow him inside the prison.
"Where do we check our weapons?" O'Donnell asked. "No," the warden said, "you're safer with them."
The wall held one tiny entrance that required twisting and ducking head rst. Inside the cramped enclosure, a long wooden barracks took up half the space. Ninety-two somber prisoners stood erect in long les against the back wall. All wore beards, most looked rough, and many were chunky. More than a few looked like they'd welcome a go at the Americans. Their leader, a hulking man with a attened face, stood slightly to the front, glowering. I stayed behind O'Donnell.
The warden ignored the prisoners and proudly showed o the double row of bunks, each with blankets and clothes neatly folded. A small separate room held six double-deck bunks. In the open space between the two rooms next to a re pit were a few wooden tables with at irons, pots, propane tanks, iron rods, and other cooking utensils. One guard kept watch on the wall.
When it was suggested a jailbreak seemed easy, the warden tapped his chest and pointed at the guard. In the tiny courtyard enclosed by stone walls, a few grenades would result in a bloody slaughter. These prisoners guarded each other.
O'Donnell asked how the warden kept the extremists from converting the other inmates. The six extremists sleep together in the small room, the warden said. He gestured at the massive prisoner. That one killed his neighbor with an axe and chopped up the body. That other, he pointed to a thin man, robbed a family on the road. He fled, thought about it for a while, returned and shot everyone.
No, no, O'Donnell explained, I mean insurgents. The warden seemed genuinely confused, asking if O'Donnell meant other murderers. O'Donnell dropped the subject.
"Sorry we're so crowded," the warden said. "I'm hanging those two next week. That will free up space." "This," O'Donnell murmured to me, "is where I should have sent Ajimal."
Counterinsurgency is war by franchise. The generals at corporate headquarters provide guidelines, like protecting the population. Each battalion operates as an individual store, responsible for its own pro t and loss. This leads to considerable di erences from one battalion to the next. In 2009, when Capt. Jimmy Howell was holding the Korengal, the high command was quietly preparing to close down the outpost. Ten miles to the east, O'Donnell had spread his companies out in the atlands of the Konar Valley. While there wasn't much ghting, it was hard to measure what constituted progress. The farmers accepted the Americans, appreciated the paved roads, and minded their own business.
Working alongside O'Donnell were Lt. Col. Esoc with a 350-man Afghan army battalion and Col. Ayoub with a border police battalion of three hundred poorly trained men.
"Your soldiers are wasting their time in the valley," they told O'Donnell. "The war will continue until we control the border. The mujahideen learned from fighting the Russians to keep control of the passes into Pakistan."
Treks up to the border with Ayoub yielded no information from the Pakistani border guards (Picture 11). On each climb, O'Donnell's soldiers discovered and blew up Taliban camps nestled in steep ravines (Picture 12).
About twelve miles north of Camp Joyce lay the Asmar Valley, an eight-mile stretch of road between towering cli s. The road ended at the forgotten district town of Dangam, which consisted of one shot-up government building and a few dozen scru y stone houses and animal stalls. Two miles east of Dangam towered the ridgeline marking the Durand Line. Dangam was a funnel for Taliban crossing over from Pakistan (Map 4).
The Afghan colonels wanted to control Dangam, and O'Donnell was willing to do so if it didn't require too many resources. He chose a "Sergeant Devine and I were on our own," Kerr said. "I couldn't go up to the border, but I gured sooner or later Zamar would make a mistake. I was living the platoon leader's dream, far from headquarters bullshit." Brave Son's dream came crashing down on May 1, 2009, when a strong Taliban force attacked a weak American outpost, throwing RC East onto the defense. Outpost Bari Alai, twenty-ve kilometers to the north of Kerr's location, overlooked a district center. A collection of brick and wooden huts surrounded by a few strands of barbed wire, OP Bari Alai was occupied by thirty askars, four Latvian advisers, and four U.S. soldiers. It sat on a at outcropping, approachable from the high ground to the east via a large slope dotted with scrub growth. The Latvians had not made the defensive improvements recommended weeks earlier by a Marine gunnery sergeant who had inspected the outpost. The Afghan soldiers were told by their commander to take it easy, meaning very few patrols and no manual labor, such as filling sandbags.
Insurgent videos taken on the eve of the attack showed groups of Taliban climbing up a trail. Dressed in assorted pieces of military uniforms, several wore the bandannas with inscriptions from the Koran tied around their foreheads.
The attack came at dawn, with a hundred Taliban ring rockets, a recoilless ri e, automatic weapons, and rocket-propelled grenades from a dozen locations. The outpost's heavy machine gun-a Russian DSKA, which sounds like a jackhammer-was knocked out and the defenders pushed back, unable to set up a perimeter of interlocking re. The attackers scrambled over walls and rushed from building to building. Before he died, Sta Sgt. William Vile, a veteran from 1-32's prior tour, called for artillery re on his own position. When it was over, the insurgents had seized the outpost.
The outpost was twenty kilometers from its parent battalion, which had no unit available to come to the rescue. Two platoons, led by Lts. Kerr and Jake Miraldi from 1-32, were own in by helicopter two hours after the attack had begun. In broiling heat, the two platoons, plus another platoon from 3-71 Cavalry Regiment, exchanged re with rearguard parties of insurgents. Five soldiers had to be evacuated with heat exhaustion.
One of the insurgents killed by Kerr's platoon had been photographed four days earlier outside a mosque in the Korengal. A hardy man with a headband with Koran markings (Picture 13), he had trekked over twelve miles through the mountains to take part in the attack on Bari Alai.
The platoons pushed through the district town and searched through the burning outpost. Miraldi was rst on the scene. In the wreckage, the rescue force found two wounded Latvian soldiers. The other two Latvians and three American soldiers were dead, as were three Afghan soldiers. Another eleven askars and the Pashtun interpreter had been captured. A few days later, the insurgents, under pressure from a search party led by Special Forces Capt. Matt Golsteyn, released all the captives unharmed.
The captured Afghan soldiers were locals, sparking a rumor that they had betrayed the outpost and in return had been spared. In a video later played by CBS, a rotund Taliban leader matter-of-factly claimed that villagers had given a detailed layout of the outpost. Whatever the truth, Bari Alai was poorly sited, poorly manned, and poorly defended.
The consequences were out of all proportion to the engagement. The Taliban distributed a video played on YouTube that showed their triumph. A U.S. military spokesman countered by telling the press that the outpost remained in coalition hands. At the same time, other outposts were quietly shuttered.
Kerr was told to pull out of the Dangam outpost. He protested that he had dug deep bunkers on top of a mountain peak with sheer sides and set in triple rows of barbed wire defended by five heavy machine guns and a mortar, with artillery registered on the avenues of approach and a network of locals whose livelihoods depended on keeping Kerr and his money alive. To Kerr, the more jihadists who attacked him, the more who would meet God for a final judgment.
"Bari Alai had the big-picture e ect showing an American defeat," Kerr said. "It was a black eye for the U.S. Army and a morale boost for the enemy. Because of Bari Alai, we were pulled out of Dangam."
Kerr thought the pullbacks were an overreaction. Senior commanders had authorized each outpost. To pull back in several locations due to a poor defense somewhere else seemed to be unnecessarily cautious. But as American military technologies had improved, the American body politic had become more risk-averse. Americans were not supposed to be killed or defeated in battle. Beginning with Desert Storm in 1991, when the Iraqi army ed Kuwait, the American public came to expect that wars would be fought with few casualties. The war in the Balkans in the mid-1990s was concluded when the United States bombed Belgrade with no loss of American life. The victories in Afghanistan in 2001 and in Baghdad in 2003 were quickly stamped as "missions accomplished."
When both those wars dragged on, the public became restive about casualties without the prospect of victory. Casualties led to congressional demands for investigations. In reaction, military headquarters set restrictive rules that turned protecting the force into a primary mission. This opened a gap in attitudes between aggressive small unit leaders like Kerr and cautious senior commanders.
When the brigade order remained unchanged, Kerr and his platoon left the Dangam outpost, as did soldiers at several other outposts. Over their clandestine radio in the Konar Valley, the insurgents broadcast their story of Bari Alai and Dangam: The mujahideen had killed Americans as they had killed Russians, forcing the occupiers to flee from the mountains.
The currency in A-Bad was the Pakistani rupee. The goods in the stores were from Pakistan. Travel across the border, by families and traders as well as insurgents, was constant. In the absence of armed support from the Pakistani side, the mountains along the Durand Line could not be patrolled on foot by Afghan border police who lacked training, equipment, or motivation. There was no security in Konar from external attacks. 
In June of 2009, the owner of the New England Patriots football team, Robert Kraft, quietly paid for a trip by the team's cheerleaders to Afghanistan. When they insisted on going forward from the rear areas, Camp Joyce was chosen.
"The cheerleaders landed in early afternoon," Sgt. Maj. Carabello said, "and spent two hours chatting with my soldiers. They were terri c. Then our intel section intercepted radio chatter about rockets being set up. You can't imagine how I felt. We got those choppers back, put the women on board, waved goodbye, cleared the area, and WHAM!, we were hit by three rockets. We were fteen minutes from catastrophe. Imagine the impact in the States!"
In June of 2009, a supply truck from 1-32 blew a tire on the main road running through A-Bad. With nothing better to do, a few hundred loiterers clustered around to watch the soldiers change the tire. One passerby was lming the event. Suddenly, an explosion bu eted the crowd, killing and maiming scores.
Within hours, A-Bad resonated with accusations that the Americans had lured innocent Afghans to gather into a crowd, and then set o a bomb. Cries of "Kill the Americans! Protect Islam!" rang out across the bazaar. Fortunately, the video clearly showed a man at the back of the crowd lobbing a grenade toward the truck, and after a few days the ruckus subsided.
The insurgents were pervasive. The Taliban provincial radio mocked the governor, who was a decent sort, as a gaudagai, or puppet. Taliban radio broadcasts referred to O'Donnell as "the Christian occupier." In the A-Bad bazaar, farmers sought out Taliban agents to settle land disputes, because the Taliban decided quickly, while the government procrastinated. Without making arrests for sedition, the Afghan government could not achieve internal stability.
For three years, the Provincial Reconstruction Team had lived in a compound a few blocks from the scene of the tragedy. The PRT had paid over $10 million to hire locals, who smiled in appreciation. Every time a platoon from 1-32 patrolled through town, they stopped to chat with storekeepers and to buy trinkets and candy to give to the street urchins. Yet the locals had turned on the soldiers in an instant. That the townspeople in A-Bad who pro ted from American protection and projects would believe the worst of O'Donnell's soldiers-whom they knew personally-suggested that the Americans were tolerated but not supported, regardless of their good works and money.
Chapter 4
Being a grunt is a hard business. It's not like being a lawyer, manager, plumber, reman, or teacher. It's esh and blood against steel and parasites. Sooner or later, the odds catch up and the grunt breaks down.
In July of 2009, Lt. Col. O'Donnell led his soldiers into the wilds for a hard ght on bad terrain. A guerrilla band had seized the town of Barge Matal, 100 miles north of Camp Joyce. Video from UAVs showed several dozen insurgents roaming around the small town in the Hindu Kush. They had seized two police pickup trucks and were handing out souvenirs or tiny supplies to small clusters of townspeople.
For the disparate insurgent groups, Barge Matal was a logical command and control niche, far from the direct reach of Kabul or Islamabad, yet convenient to a mountain pass to duck from one country to the other. Unheard of in the States, in Afghanistan, Barge Matal had the panache of Nantucket, a faraway place where the rich escaped the summer heat. The panicked provincial governor, safe in another town, was calling Karzai once an hour, pleading for a rescue force. Karzai put pressure on Gen. McChrystal.
A reluctant American high command chose Battalion 1-32 to retake the Kalash tribal town consisting of 100 wood and stone houses. O'Donnell wasn't much for public speaking. He didn't try for theatrics; he trained his subordinate leaders and let them do their jobs. At Camp Joyce, he gathered Mike Harrison's company at the helo pad and told them simply, "There's a hundred muj in Barge Matal. Retaking the town will be tough, so our battalion's been chosen to do the job."
Helicopters would land the soldiers at the bottom of a punch bowl, surrounded by peaks a mile high. The danger of plunging re from the mountainsides was acute. The soldiers knew it was a political mission in a perilous place.
Chaplain George Mulcher gave a brief prayer. The soldiers stood with helmets o and heads slightly bowed, listening to a man they respected talk about a God many didn't think existed. It was the age of unbelief in a country with deep Christian roots. President Obama had said America was not a Christian nation, a quixotic denial in light of America's history. Theology-the a rmation of faith without proofwas not a subject soldiers discussed. Most didn't think much about God or eternity. Some believed, and many doubted. As they headed for Barge Matal, it was time to suspend disbelief. Some were sure to die.
Flying north up the valley from Camp Joyce past the Korengal on the left, we passed denuded mountains-inty slopes of stunted pine and scraggly underbrush stripped of the soaring cedar forests. Poor mountain folk are no di erent from the commercial shermen of New England-hardheaded types that will harvest every last cod from the sea or cedar from the forest, and then blame the government for their plight. Not just in the Korengal but wherever there was a dollar to be made exporting to Iran or Pakistan, Afghanistan's patrimony of trees was crashing down.
North of the Konar, the slopes showed more greenery. The peaks of the Hindu Kush rose to 14,000 feet, with cli s that make even a mountain goat dizzy. This was Nuristan Province-the wilderness. Nuristan's fteen minutes of fame occurred 2,300 years ago, when Alexander the Great, struck by the beauty of the soaring forests, forbore slaughtering the local tribes who begged for mercy. Twenty-two centuries later, Nuristan-still inaccessible and shrouded in mystery-provided the setting for Kipling's classic tale "The Man Who Would Be King."
The people weren't Pashtuns; they were a mix of light-complexioned Indo-Aryan tribes that spoke six mutually unintelligible languages and lived in clusters of mud, wood, and stone huts set days apart from one another. Some sub-tribes were friendly and some thieves, depending on some ancient DNA. For centuries, the province was called Ka ristan-Land of Unbelievers-home to war-prone tribes who preyed upon the Muslims living in the lower valleys. After British forces agreed at the end of the nineteenth century not to intervene in tribal wars west of the Durand Line, the amir of Afghanistan dispatched an army that crushed the ka r tribesmen, forcibly converted the survivors to Islam, and called the province Nuristan, or Country of the Enlightened.
In the century since, tensions simmered between the maleks, or village leaders, and the Islamic mullahs who considered themselves the enforcers of the true religion. In the 1980s, during the war against the invading Soviet forces, Arab mujahideen who preached Wahabbi radicalism took control of the small town of Barge Matal and the adjacent pass leading to the city of Chitral in Pakistan's Northwest Frontier. By 2002, both the Taliban Afghans and al Qaeda Arabs had ed Barge Matal for the sanctuary of Chitral. For about a year, responding to human intelligence and electronic intercepts, Special Operations Forces were rumored to have launched raids from Nuristan across the border.
"That's called Delta Pass," Lt. Col. Mark O'Donnell said to me, pointing to a snowcapped pass. "A couple of years ago, the CIA got a sniff of bin Laden near Chitral and asked for Army helicopters to airlift in horses. They planned to ride across the border. We wouldn't bring the horses. They'd never have made it out of the pass."
O'Donnell's job was to take back Barge Matal and reinstall the police who had scattered to even more obscure villages. The Konar River ran through the center of Barge Matal, surrounded by four steep hills that led upward into 10,000-foot mountains (Map 5). There was no radio contact with anyone in the town. Inside the town, the soldiers couldn't dig in; a pickaxe couldn't dent the dry, crusted soil.
It was tactical insanity to ght at the bottom of that punch bowl. The insurgents could hide in the hills, rest their AKs and PKM machine guns on boulders, and lay their sights on any house or fighting position. They could see anyone in the open without exposing themselves.
At Outpost Bostick, O'Donnell and Mike Harrison, who was leading the assault force, warily studied the problem. I watched as his soldiers built a sand table to rehearse the helo landing at the base of three mountains. For a few days, I'd had a sore throat, an unquenchable thirst, and a nagging headache. Now it felt like I had been hit square in the back by a sledgehammer. I excused myself, vomited outside, and wobbled to the closest tent. Staff Sgt. Eric Lindstrom, a squad leader in the weapons platoon, removed some gear from the cot next to his.
"Camp out with you until we lift off?" I said. "Gotcha covered," Eric said, handing me a bottle of cold water. At the rear of the tent, his soldiers were shouting and laughing, keyed up by the prospect of certain combat. Eric was quiet and, as the leader, kept his distance. I asked him where he was from. "Cholera," Dr. Peter Saur, a prominent internist, later explained, "will kill you in thirty-six hours. Once your uids empty out, your body is a limp rag of skin. Those Army medics saved your life."
That evening, the medics brought in Lt. Jacob Miraldi, a ri e platoon leader in Mike Harrison's company. I had been on a few patrols with Jake (Picture 14). Broad and powerful, he had played fullback at West Point and easily climbed the steep hills. Yet when any of his soldiers wore down under a heavy load, it was Jake who somehow needed a break. The patrol would catch its breath and then resume, with Jake never saying a reproving word.
He hobbled through the door into the ward, sat on his bed, and unwrapped the bandages from the inside of his left leg. It looked like he had been hit with a staple gun from the ankle to the groin. Blood oozed from a half dozen holes.
"Ugly, Jake," I said. "Mortar or RPG?" "RPG, sir," he said. "Eric told me you'd been medevaced. We landed without a fight. We didn't think you were missing much." Jake dabbed at his wounds with a piece of cotton while an orderly mopped the blood that dripped onto the floor. "Sorry about that," Jake said. "Anyway, in the afternoon, the women and children left the village. The Taliban weren't chatting over the Icoms like they usually do. An hour before dark, the shooting started from the cli to our south. It didn't seem like much at rst, but it got heavier and heavier. We couldn't see them-only lines of green tracers. From that cli , they damn sure could see us. Then we took re from the hills to the east and west. The Afghan soldiers manning the two Dishkas [machine guns] were driven o the roofs. My mortars got o only a couple of rounds before everyone had to duck for cover."
Plunging re is an infantryman's worst nightmare. Looking down straight at you, machine gunners walk arcs of tracers right into your hole. Once you hug the dirt, you can't return re. That makes things worse. The shooters have nothing to worry about. They take their time, aim in, and wait for an opening.
"It was raining bullets," Jake said. "We weren't returning accurate re. We couldn't suppress them. I was running around, pulling my soldiers into buildings. Near the river, soldiers were crouching on the east side of the walls. My platoon was upslope, and we were ducking to the west. We were getting it from all sides."
The town was so far north it took thirty minutes for the A-10s to get there. Even then, the angle of the attack was so steep the pilots had to pull practice runs before dropping their bombs. The attack started an hour before sundown, and petered out after full dark.
"Eric didn't make it," he said. Jake stood up and raised his arms above his head in frustration. He wanted to strike out, to hit something.
"How?" I asked. "We were kneeling side by side," Jake said. "An RPG exploded. I got it in the leg. Sergeant Lindstrom took it in the stomach."
The rocket-propelled grenade that killed Eric was a endishly simple weapon. Any illiterate teenager speaking an unwritten language and living in a stone hut could load an RPG. As he pulled the trigger, the boy may have been thinking, "Allahu Akbar"-"God Is Great!" or "This pays better than herding goats." It made no difference what he was thinking; the grenade shot true.
"I got Eric into a house," Jake said, "and Doctor Smith got there right away. Eric said he couldn't breathe. We lost him." Eric Lindstrom was Jake's best squad leader. He joined the Army because of 9/11. Some say you don't ght for a cause; you ght for the soldiers around you. That's an incomplete thought. War is more than sound and fury, signifying nothing. Beyond loyalty to the small group, patriotism does play a role. After serving in Iraq, Eric had joined the police force in Arizona. But the tug of the camaraderie of the grunts was too strong, and he reenlisted in 2007. His goal was to qualify for the Delta Force, America's finest unit.
Jake knew there was nothing he could have done to save Eric. Still, it went against his nature to accept that death was beyond his control. He was the leader, the fullback who banged into the line. We talked about Eric's seven-month-old twin daughters and his wife, Tara. Jake tried to call his father to reach out to Tara, but the call didn't go through. So he sat there, dripping blood, dialing again and again.
While we were talking, the medics brought in an Afghan whose right hand had been amputated. He lay silently in bed, hugging the bandaged stump tight to his chest and staring with vacant eyes at the ceiling. The physician, Dr. John Campbell, visited a bit later. I was still vomiting, and Jake was still dripping.
"You're not going back north," Campbell said to me. "Without IVs, your body will go into convulsions." He turned to Jake. "You're staying put, too," he said, "until the shrapnel works its way out of your leg. You go back into the dirt, and you'll contract a massive infection." Jake and I looked away while the doctor changed the bandages on the stump of the Afghan man's arm. Flesh and blood. That's all the three of us were, lying in our beds and damned lucky at that. Death in battle is random. Knowing his squad was going into the bottom of a punch bowl, Eric had been quiet the night before he died. He had hauled my racked body to the aid tent, hopped on a helicopter, fought beside Jake, took a life-draining hit to his stomach, and was gone. "Death eludes explanation," the theologian Richard Neuhaus wrote. "Death is the death of explanation." 
1
Ten days after he died, Eric Lindstrom was interred in Flagsta . Thousands lined the streets and over 500 attended the service. As with the others who had fallen, America paid tribute, spontaneous and unbidden.
"O duty, soldiers tune out by listening to their iPods," Chaplain Mulcher told me, "or watching movies. With his buddies, it's all warrior talk. When they lose someone, then it hits them. They wonder about God."
Every grunt is twice a volunteer-once to join the armed forces and a second time to join the infantry. War-ghting in places not marked on a map is a volunteer profession. Every grunt wants to prove himself in battle. Warriors like Eric don't want our sympathy.
But that doesn't lessen the grief death imparts. A wife was now a widow, with two twin girls who would never know their father. Death is hardest on those who raise the children.
"It is not the young man who misses the days he does not know," the Roman general Marcus Aurelius wrote. "It is us, the living, who bear the pain of those missed days."
Few of us are as stoic as Aurelius. We seek a reason for sacri ce and sorrow. Toward enemy dead, you feel nothing. Some of their corpses balloon up, and the stink clings to your clothes. Others shrink to dwarf size when the uids spill out through the bullet wounds. You wonder, how did such a little prick fight so well? We only miss our own.
When you lose someone, you wonder about the mission. You need a faith or a cause to compensate for loss. Jake and I were pretty damned mad about the lack of cause. What made Barge Matal worthwhile? What were American soldiers doing in unnamed mountains, ghting tribes forgotten by time and history, while the bastards that murdered 3,000 Americans on 9/11 were protected in the country next door? What was accomplished in such a lost place? Why did Eric die where no sensible infantry should have been sent? How did the mission relate to the war objectives?
On the one hand, Joint Task Force 82, responsible for the provinces in eastern Afghanistan, planned to pull back from outposts in the mountains. On the other hand, Battalion 1-32 was thrown in to gain control of a tiny remote village that had been overrun. Karzai had insisted that Barge Matal, in the middle of nowhere, be in the hands of the Afghan government before the presidential election. As governor of Nuristan, Karzai had appointed his crony Jamaluddin Badar, who was later accused of stealing the salaries of his police. 
2
Karzai's objective contradicted the counterinsurgency strategy. There was no intent for 1-32 to clear and hold Barge Matal. Eric Lindstrom died in a troubling mission that raised an unresolved question: When should America's senior commanders refuse the request of the host government because it placed our troops in harm's way for no good gain? Chapter 5
After several days of pestering the doctors, Jake Miraldi talked his way out of the hospital and in mid-July rejoined his platoon in Barge Matal, where clear battle lines had been drawn. 1-32 held the mostly deserted town, with the nearest reinforcements fty miles away, and the insurgents held the high ground on all sides, with a trek over a 9,000-foot mountain pass for munitions.
The main village was on the east side of a freezing cold river too deep to wade across. The sixty-odd Afghan soldiers and police partnered with 1-32 settled into houses to the northeast. 1-32's sleeping and eating quarters were set up in wood and stone buildings to the southeast. On the western side of the river, there were a handful of houses, separated from the nearby hills by a dense eld of tall green corn. Because the jihadists had expended so much ammo on the rst evening when Lindstrom was killed, there were only daily harassing attacks, usually toward evening.
For a few weeks, both sides probed cautiously, like two experienced boxers jabbing at each other after an opening urry. 1-32 needed helicopter lifts daily to provide ammo, stretching a supply line that ran 200 miles back to the main depot at Jalalabad. The jihadists had it harder. They had to herd donkeys packing ammo twenty miles at 6,000 to 9,000 feet.
O'Donnell thought his mission was to convince the thousand-odd residents to return to their intact village, bulk up the imsy defenses with another platoon of Afghan police, and y away. He had no idea that Karzai, who had badgered Gen. McChrystal into sending Americans in the first place, had decided they would stay until after the presidential election in late August.
The Taliban leader was Abdul Rahman, a tribal leader with forces on both sides of the Pakistani border. His truce with the elders in Barge Matal had broken down over some tribal spat, so he had attacked. Rahman was a braggart linked to Maulana Fazalullah, a cunning man who led the rebellion in the Swat Province of Pakistan in 2008. The Afghan branch of the Taliban and the Pakistani branch had collaborated to seize remote Barge Matal and so control the pass that led to Chitral in Pakistan.
After a few days of negotiations in late June, Rahman had allowed the police to leave town, while his men ransacked the police station, seized three new Hiluxes, and drove up and down the main and only street, distributing their booty under the unblinking eye of a UAV. Once 1-32 had set up a small ops center in town, Capt. Raymond Kaplan, the intelligence o cer, continued to track insurgent movements via UAV video feeds.
In the soft, cool summer evenings, he watched groups of ve and ten men cluster, smoking cigarettes and chatting, a few miles down the road at a large compound called Pop Rock. About four each morning, they'd crowd inside small vans and drive north to within a kilometer of Barge Matal. They then hopped out and disappeared into the woods where their weapons were stored. An hour later, they were shooting at 1-32's fighting positions Under the Rules of Engagement, the insurgents were free to commute to work safely, often bringing women and children in the van. Some ghters, while talking on Icoms, stood in the open surrounded by women, knowing the Americans wouldn't shoot. To attack a vehicle required two independent sources-say, a visual sighting of a weapon and a voice intercept from inside the van. This was practically impossible. When Kaplan did see insurgents with weapons entering a vehicle, he had to keep continuous eyes on that vehicle until the attack aircraft arrived, usually twenty minutes later. Given the foliage along the road, usually Kaplan could not swear to the pilots that it was the same vehicle.
1-32 did try to attack Pop Rock on the ground, sending Kerr out on a raid party after midnight. But not two hundred meters from their own lines, the soldiers bumped into the enemy picket line. An enemy sentry was snoring, his head slumped against his chest, twenty-ve feet in front of the point man, Sgt. Sam Alibrando. Kerr crept up to take a look. Behind the snorer, three men were sleeping restlessly on the rocky ground. Kerr signaled up the rest of his team. Eight red dots from infrared lasers danced over the sleeping man's chest. Deciding that eight was a bit of an overkill, Kerr gave the green light to Spcs. Ryan Skelton, Radael Beaver, and Randy Moore. The snorer and his companions were riddled.
"Those three made short work of the sleepers," Kerr said. Upslope, a PKM machine gun opened up, spraying bullets wildly. Within minutes, dozens of jihadists were swarming up the sides of the road. To avoid being outflanked, Kerr pulled his party back and called in mortars.
O'Donnell decided not to launch any more night attacks. It was ve kilometers to Pop Rock. A raid required at least twenty grunts, plus a Quick Reaction Force. If the ght was still going on at dawn, the jihadists would surround the raiders. O'Donnell saw no reason to get into a war of attrition when he wasn't going to stay in the village.
The enemy tried using mortars to attack the American base. Tech. Sgt. Guy Lamb, the battalion's artillery ops chief, plotted hundreds of ring points. In fty-six days, Lamb expended 110,000 pounds of artillery munitions, including all the red phosphorous shells in country. He had discovered that red smoke during the day obscured the vision of enemy gunners and set brushfires, creating yet more smoke.
To no one's surprise, Sta Sgt. David Metcalf, the Mad Mooner, had set his two 81mm mortars in a deep circular pit so that they could re in any direction. He was obsessed with the hundred technical details that comprise a dead-on mortar shot-setting the base plate, planting the aim stakes, leveling the bubbles, checking the computer calculations, envisioning the escape route of the enemy, and ensuring his communications channel was clear. When the rst mortar shells ripped in at Barge Matal, he screamed, "Those fuckers think they can kill us! Fuck them!" He was outraged that any enemy mortar crew dared to challenge him. He rushed to the smoking crater caused by each detonation, cocked an eye, raised his arm to gauge the back azimuth, and ran back to his mortar crews, pointing where to return re. Once he was knocked o his feet, only to pop up, swearing at his crews to get o more rounds. His fellow soldiers were convinced he would be killed; he was convinced he would knock out every Taliban mortar. Given his twenty-ve years on the gun line, no one argued with him. The enemy looked directly down on the encampment. They could see the pu s of their shells exploding and a crazy man shaking his st. Undoubtedly, in the evenings they told their own Metcalf stories.
"I was in the Korengal for fteen months. That truly sucked," Metcalf said to me. "Barge Matal was the Korengal on steroids. We had no high ground, none. It was great shooting, man. The fuckers kept coming, giving me all those targets." high ground, none. It was great shooting, man. The fuckers kept coming, giving me all those targets."
Day after day, Metcalf squatted in his bunker, squinting through binoculars at the crevices on the surrounding mountains, ring volley after volley at one possible hiding place after another. In forty-five days, his mortar section fired 4,500 rounds, a record in the Afghan war.
Rahman's warriors were loath to lug mortar shells across mountain passes, day after day. They complained openly over the Icoms. They wanted to ght, not trudge back and forth like pack mules. Gradually, all the Taliban mortars fell silent rather than continue a duel with a madman who never ran out of ammunition.
By the end of July, Rahman had reverted back to the grunt war that was in his blood. Using Apache-style tactics, his warriors skulked forward with their trusty AKs and RPGs, shooting at the defenses near the corn eld on the western bank of the river, trying to force the Americans back into a shrinking circle.
O'Donnell was rotating his units in and out of Barge Matal, both to avoid a permanent gap back in his own battlespace and to give all his soldiers a chance to ght. Every grunt covets the Combat Infantryman's Badge, which shows he has engaged the enemy, and Barge Matal was a grunt's battle, far away from higher headquarters.
The battle was in full swing when Lt. Kerr-Brave Son-and his platoon arrived in late July, together with scout-snipers and a small Special Operations unit called Omega. Day after day, the insurgents sneaked forward in the corn elds to snipe at Kerr's soldiers hunkered among the houses. The river fed dozens of irrigation ditches that had turned the ground into mud. The wet green corn refused to catch re despite repeated e orts with incendiary grenades and gasoline. Kerr refused to use machetes to chop the corn down, certain that some of his soldiers would be shot.
One female pilot in an F-15 combined a sexy, irtatious voice with dead-on accuracy. After each bomb run, the lieutenants in 1-32 speculated on how gorgeous she must be, and how a grunt could meet her. Kerr swore he had seen her in a dining facility, and that she had blond hair and sensational looks. No one believed him.
By August, the smell from the decomposing bodies in the corn eld was gagging. The soldiers o ered payment to the few remaining villagers-who knew the attackers-to bury the corpses. Kerr o ered a cease-re to bury the dead. When that failed, the soldiers simply slackened their fire for two nights to allow the enemy to take away their fallen comrades.
The soldiers kept a chalkboard of their kills, with the tally reaching 200 in early August, after ve weeks of ghting. Every grunt can tell you how many enemy he is fairly sure he hit. The high command refuses to divulge tallies, and frowns on units keeping score. Still, every unit does it. The tradition is millennia old. Homer gave us an account of Achilles's triumphs. The Comanches collected scalps, as did the early American settlers. Every sniper records his kills. We reward fighter pilots with the title of "ace" if they shoot down five enemy aircraft.
"We're not vampires," Kerr said to me. "Counting kills was a morale thing. Something to bullshit about over MREs. You know that." Most mornings, the jihadists blazed away from among the cornstalks, unable to see the soldiers hidden in the rock foundations of the houses along the river. The soldiers returned re, screaming "Bitches! Motherfuckers!" and other terms of soldierly endearment. Chatter over the Icoms was incessant, as the Afghan soldiers and jihadists exchanged insults. Occasionally there was a plea over an Icom for Rahman to send men to help a comrade, meaning someone had been killed or wounded. The interpreters passed the word and the American soldiers would cheer.
When the jihadists changed tactics and sneaked into the corn eld at night, Kerr trained lasers on where he heard the sounds. Then soldiers on the east side of the river fired at the red laser spots so Kerr didn't expose his position.
"Those dudes were watching us day and night," Sgt. Tony Case, a platoon member, said. Together with Lt. Micah Chapman's platoon, Kerr's soldiers held the west ank of the river. A maze of footpaths and alleys connected the houses, most with animal stalls and corn pens underneath the living quarters. The Taliban tried sneaking into the pens at night. By loosening the slats, an infiltrator could crawl underground from one house to the next.
On one patrol, Kerr saw a villager across the river looking at him while talking on an Icom. Handheld radios were common, and not a reason for shooting someone. A few minutes later, Kerr heard the cows snorting in a pen behind him and turned in time to shoot a jihadist who was taking aim at his back. Spc. Daniel Roach ran to help, looked up, and shot two more on the porch above Kerr.
The soldiers hated the corn eld more than the houses. They lost Spc. Justin Coleman when they were ordered to police up the gear of two jihadists killed in a morning ght. A third jihadist, kneeling among the stalks next to the bodies, shot Coleman at point-blank range. Within seconds, the jihadist, who was wearing a black bandanna with Koran inscriptions, was riddled.
"Coleman was a quiet, friendly troop," Gunny Kevin Devine said. "He never bitched or got on anyone's case. That asshole with the bandanna came into the cornfield to kill an American and die."
A week later the platoon lost Spc. Alexander Miller in another ght at the corn eld. A three-round AK burst struck him in the pelvis below his armored vest. When Miller was hit, his best friend, Spc. Tony Case, sprinted 300 meters across open space to be at his side. But he arrived too late.
"He was a South Florida, Miami Vice, Don Johnson-type," Case said. "He wore an Armani suit and rode business class. When he turned twenty-one before we deployed, he bought a $300 bottle of champagne. He was hit after he walked by me carrying a 60 (machine gun) and his M4, joking that he was the Terminator."
That was the end of the corn eld. With grenades and en lade re, plus 81s and a 500-pound bomb on the periphery, Kerr's platoon gradually ripped apart the cornfield, leaving the jihadists with no easy approach to the village.
Unable to push in from the west, in mid-August Rahman brought in his most deadly weapon-snipers. Immediately surrounding Barge Matal were four hills. At rst, the accurate, single shots came from the southeast, and later from all directions. Americans carrying eighty pounds of armor and weapons couldn't patrol the 9,000-foot mountain and the snipers fired from dozens of concealed positions.
There were perhaps thirty farmers still in the village. The snipers left them alone. But any Afghan soldier or policeman, or an American, was under the gun. No one walked from one building to another; trotting while bobbing and weaving was smarter. Blue tarpaulins were strung outside strongpoints like the schoolhouse so the snipers couldn't see who was moving around. The soldiers called them bulletproof tarps. Three of the Omega commandos, dressed in lighter uniforms, were shot in the legs. It seemed the snipers aimed mostly below the armored vests. But a newly arrived lieutenant looking over a parapet was shot in the neck, with the bullet also striking an Omega soldier in the chest as he stood behind the lieutenant. Both were evacuated.
Some Afghan police took to wearing black T-shirts, raising suspicions that they were signaling the snipers not to shoot them. Kerr scoffed at the rumor. "If you take the Afghans into your trust," he said, "they stand with you."
The snipers, though, were taking forty to fty shots a day. Eventually the toll reached three Afghans killed and twenty-ve Americans and Afghans wounded. Apache helicopters searched among the crags and crevices with their thermal devices. The snipers countered by hiding under blankets to weaken the signal from their body heat. The Americans responded by bringing in a sound detection device that tracked the azimuth of a ri e shot. They then inserted the data in a computer program that showed the most likely hiding places along that azimuth and called in aircraft with 500-pound bombs. One sniper was blown out of the ground literally wrapped in his green blanket.
The best sniper was Badar, who liked to taunt the Americans. "Badar was an excitable young kid," Devine said. "He'd scream and laugh over his Icom after he took a shot. The Afghans listening to him thought he was seventeen years old, or younger. But when he yelled, someone was down."
"We had four Latvian advisers with an Afghan company," Master Sgt. Jason Rivas said. "Badar zeroed in on their sector. He wounded three of them."
Badar went o the net after two F-18s dropped three GBUs-Guided Bomb Units-on his suspected location. He had bragged once too often over his Icom.
It might seem that an understrength ri e company at the bottom of a bowl of hills would be decimated by a few accurate snipers, until you consider the sniper's point of view. At three in the morning, he has a cup of sugared tea and a hunk of bread. Then he picks up his telescopic ri e, ties a water bottle around his neck, strides a mile down a trail, and climbs around the side of a mountain to a favored site. He pushes aside some inty rocks and pebbles and squirms around until he has an uncomfortable nest behind some rocks and shrubs, his ri e barrel well concealed.
In the dawn light, he scans the enemy ghting positions 600 meters away and far downhill. The American soldiers pop up and down, scurrying like beetles, knowing he is watching. After a few hours, a soldier gets careless and walks in a straight line across the encampment. The sniper squeezes o a shot and the soldier falls, hit in the leg. The sniper pulls back behind the rocks, lying on his back, sipping water, smiling.
Down at the camp, soldiers carry the groaning soldier inside, wrap a tourniquet around his thigh, and call for a medevac. Sound-tracking microphones give a compass azimuth tracing the direction of the shot. Soldiers manning .50 caliber machine guns scan along the azimuth with telescopes so powerful they can see individual leaves half a mile away. Meter by meter they scan the mountain, writing down each possible hidden firing point.
The sniper lies in his lair, dozing, unable to move without being seen, waiting for night. An hour goes by. The medevac helo comes and goes. The sniper hears the rst aircraft seconds before the earth shakes and a sound wave bu ets him. A 500-pound bomb has struck a few hundred meters downslope. The sniper tucks low. He knows another is coming, and another. One bomb hits so near that he is bounced o the ground. He grabs his ri e and checks the scope, worried that it has been knocked out of alignment. At dusk, he crawls around the side of the slope until his silhouette cannot be seen from below. Then he stands erect and begins the two-hour trek back to Pop Rock and a cup of hot, sugared tea.
Day after day, the duel goes on. The sniper shoots one-ounce bullets; the Americans respond with ve thousand times the force. Gradually, each hide site is pummeled. Sooner or later, an American sniper spots the position, or a bomb drops in. The sniper might be looking at the sky when he is blasted and mangled, or he may be crouching in a cave when boulders crush him. In the weeks before his death, he may have hit one, two, or three infidels. But sooner or later, the sheer volume and accuracy of the return fires will find him.
In mid-August, Capt. Justin Sax arrived as head of the scout snipers. On his previous tour, he had led a platoon in Khost Province. While there, he was visiting a refurbished school when a gray Toyota came speeding down the dirt road. Sax had dug a ditch around the school to prevent entrance by vehicles. The shabby Toyota barreled headlong into the ditch, bounced three feet in the air, and came down inside the schoolyard. The driver detonated an explosion that paralyzed Sax's driver and slaughtered fteen children. Sax was felled as if hit by a baseball bat. It took a year for him to recover. He arrived at Barge Matal determined that no soldier would die under his command.
While he was the senior o cer out on the lines with Lts. Kerr and Chapman, a major inside the operations center was the senior commander on base. As in any extended battle, the soldiers learned who was incompetent. The major couldn't cut it, and Sax and Kerr chafed under orders they deemed tactically unsound. So they cut the major out of the radio pattern, making decisions on the company-level frequency net. In the rst ve or ten re ghts, new platoon leaders, overwhelmed by the chaos and noise, follow the lead of combat veterans. After that, they start anticipating the next ght. That's what makes them leaders; they plan ahead and blot out the counsel of those who know only how to react.
The enemy snipers were dug in along the slopes of Hill 3 to the northeast and Hill 4 to the southeast (Map 5).
Each time the soldiers tried to climb either hill, they were peppered with AK rounds from skirmishers on the west side of the corn eld. By triangulating his fires, Rahman held the initiative and kept the Americans hemmed in.
Between 1-32 and the commandos, Sax had twelve snipers under his command. He assigned six to clear each hill, while Kerr went after the skirmishers to the west. In a week, Rahman lost twenty-seven ghters. Kerr encountered less re each time he probed the jihadist lines to the west. He and Sax agreed that Rahman had pulled back to rest and re t. Usually, there were about a hundred defenders and 150 attackers in the battle.
The enemy were a strange assortment. Many spoke Nuristani dialects rather than Pashto. The mortar crews and the snipers seemed to be Pakistani, or had lived across the border for so long that they spoke over the Icoms with Pakistani accents. Rahman was actively recruiting as far away as Chitral, fty miles on the other side of the border. His pitch was that he had trapped an American unit. All true jihadists could come and kill an infidel. His sales pitch was drawing fewer volunteers, though, since so many did not return from the jaunt into Afghanistan.
Kerr gured Rahman was trying to keep the Americans ringed in with fewer than fty ghters. It was time to attack. Gunny Devine took twenty volunteers and made a ve-hour night climb up Hill 3. Once perched 8,000 feet above the valley and peering through binoculars 100 times more powerful than the human eye, he had a perfect line of sight looking south at open spaces Rahman's men had to cross. The snipers and skirmishers couldn't remain hidden.
Devine set up spotting telescopes on tripods with night vision devices for twenty-four-hour coverage. On the rst day, he called in six re missions; on the second day, ve more. Metcalf, the Mad Mooner, and his mortar crew were delighted. After about a week, pressure from the enemy snipers fell off.
"On the 17th [of August]," Sax said, "our morale was low after a month of those freaking snipers. As soon as Sergeant Devine took Hill 3, we all perked up. For the first time, we had the high ground." Down in the ops center, Kaplan, the intel o cer, concentrated on the Taliban leadership. One morning, he saw Abdul Rahman climbing into a white truck at Pop Rock. He called for an attack by a Predator UAV with a Hell re missile that was on station nearby. The request had to go through three layers of bureaucracy. When it was approved twenty-ve minutes later, Kaplan admitted that he had lost the truck under foliage at one point for about ten minutes. Higher decided not to fire the missiles.
"My successful missions," Kaplan said, "depended 30 percent upon sound tactical detective work and 70 percent upon persuading higher to permit a fire mission. There were echelons of staffs sitting above me, like owls in trees."
In mid-September, over the protests of the Nuristani governor, 1-32 handed a dispirited band of Afghan police an additional heavy machine gun, boarded helicopters, and ew away after fty-six days in the punch bowl. On paper they had "trained" local police to take their place. That was a fig leaf. Barge Matal reverted to some mysterious tribal feuding, a spot on the globe unknown to the rest of mankind.
When it was over, the soldiers expressed contradictory thoughts. They were proud of their performance. At a loss of four soldiers, they had killed so many enemy that the fight had petered out.
"Every grunt wanted to get in on the action," Jake Miraldi said. "That's why we joined." At the same time, they weren't proud of the strategic rationale. Karzai had wanted control of the town so that he could garner votes in a rigged election.
"I counted fewer than a hundred voters in Barge Matal," Kerr said. "Yet the tally gave more than 4,000 votes to Karzai. Some say the number was 25,000."

Chapter 6
The eight-week siege at Barge Matal in the summer of 2009 threw Battalion 1-32 o its game plan. At any given time, a third of the battalion's combat power was diverted north, and the constant rotation of platoons and companies left gaps in coverage in the Konar River Valley. Since arriving in January of 2009, O'Donnell had de ned the battalion's role as counterinsurgency. Instead of patrolling forty kilometers of mountainous border, he had spread his companies within the populated valley.
His goal had been to set up sixteen U.S.-Afghan bases, each responsible for patrolling a dozen square kilometers. But when his higher headquarters reacted to enemy attacks upon outposts by retrenching, O'Donnell cut back to eight patrol bases. This included pulling Lt. Kerr out of his base near the border.
No new operation order from the top came down to Battalion 1-32's level. Even while ghting at Barge Matal, O'Donnell persisted in his primary mission of patrolling among dozens of villages in the Konar River Valley.
On the east side of his base, O'Donnell was host to a 300-man Afghan battalion and a dozen Marine advisers called Embedded Training Team, or ETT, 2-8. O'Donnell's battalion was called Task Force Chosin, because it had served alongside the Marines in the fabled retreat from the frozen Chosin Reservoir in 1950 during the Korean War. O'Donnell treated the Marine advisers as part of his family. As a Ranger, he had a nonrigid command style, was relaxed in conversation, and open to ideas.
Lt. Col. Esoc, the mujahideen warrior, commanded the Afghan battalion. His political clout with Kabul was scant. His uncle and Karzai disliked one another. Esoc bonded with the Americans, and in return O'Donnell made it clear to his sta that Esoc was to be treated as his equal. On paper, O'Donnell did not have control over Afghan operations. American and Afghan battalions shared the same battlespace, while reporting up different chains of command. In practice, O'Donnell had the resources, and Esoc followed his lead.
Directly across the road from Task Force Chosin was a battalion of Afghan Border Police that wouldn't last a week if they ventured near the border. BP battalions hung back along the main roads, and many were as apt as the local police to prey upon the people. The BP battalion at Chosin had two advisers, Capt. Will Swenson and Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook. Swenson joked that they were "An Army of Two," a play on the Army's slogan, "An Army of One."
O'Donnell didn't think it was funny. He fretted about their survival. Westbrook's older brother, also an infantryman, had been killed in the streets of Baghdad.
"I know they have to do their jobs," O'Donnell said. "I'm proud they're always out alone with the Afghans. But I don't like the odds." Swenson, who was leaving the Army to become a lawyer, was mature and measured in his outlook. "Sergeant Westbrook and I have to risk it," he said. "We don't have anyone else. Do we make a long-term difference? I doubt it."
The rst BP battalion commander he had advised had been red on corruption charges; Swenson suspected the real reason was that he hadn't delivered enough kickbacks. The new commander, Col. Ayoub, was a t, no-nonsense military professional from Laghman Province, where the tribes took pride in joining the military. Like Esoc, Ayoub worked closely with O'Donnell. The three watched out for each other. Prior to meetings with the Afghan governor or senior American officers, they agreed to what they would say, backing up one another.
Esoc and Ayoub looked upon the district police chief as a predator and liar, and were suspicious of the civilian o cials appointed by Karzai. Those o cials had to cut deals to consolidate power with the locals. As far as Esoc and Ayoub were concerned, any deal they knew nothing about placed them in danger.
O'Donnell, Carabello, and the company commanders were less skeptical. They brought trailer-loads of supplies and treats to the schools; they graded and hardtopped roads; they o ered small projects ($10,000 to $30,000) to every village; their soldiers patronized local shops and paid top prices. But there wasn't any tipping point indicating that the local tribes were turning against the Taliban.
Esoc and Ayoub insisted they knew which villages were hostile, providing safe houses and access routes for the Taliban. Ganjigal was a habitual o ender. A motley collection of ve scattered hamlets consisting of a few hundred stone houses and mud and wooden huts, Ganjigal lay a few kilometers northeast of O'Donnell's base at Camp Joyce (Map 6).
Located inside a narrow valley in the shadow of the Durand Line, the Ganjigal farm terraces were clearly visible from the main hardtop road used daily by American convoys and civilian vehicles. During the Soviet occupation, Ganjigal had been a support base for the mujahideen. In 2002, a Ganjigal elder with Taliban ties, Ahmed Wali, was arrested and executed by Afghan soldiers, resulting in a are-up across the district. In the winter of 2009, when soldiers from 1-32 rst drove up the rutted path into the valley, they were met with ri e re, while young teenagers brazenly ran behind the Humvees, dragging large rocks across the path to prevent a withdrawal (Picture 15).
The Americans pulled out and after that ventured near Ganjigal only in large formations, regarding the valley as more xenophobic than hostile. Every day farmers from Ganjigal walked down to the main road, crossed a bridge guarded by local police, and shopped in the market. Unarmed Afghan soldiers daily walked by the entrance to the Ganjigal Valley without a shot being red. American convoys, though, occasionally received harassing fire from the valley. There were local understandings that did not include the Americans.
During the spring of 2009, O'Donnell persuaded a reluctant Ayoub to host several shuras with the Ganjigal elders. The elders politely came, asked for jobs, and refused to allow any forces to enter the valley, arguing they could not control their young men who would shoot at outsiders. The elders asked for projects without offering the slightest reciprocity.
In mid-July, two days before the Barge Matal mission, the Taliban hit Camp Joyce at midnight with a urry of rockets and recoilless ri e re. One shell struck an enormous fuel bladder that erupted in a swirling orange ball of ame (Picture 16). The attack was launched from a ridge outside Ganjigal. Inside three minutes, O'Donnell was standing in the tactical operations center (TOC) scrutinizing the streaming video from a UAV circling overhead. The pictures showed gures running around an isolated stone house on the ridge. None was carrying a weapon, though, and O'Donnell did not fire artillery in response.
No one was injured at Joyce. Had the shells struck the canvas-topped sleeping quarters, casualties would have been signi cant. The next morning, with a pillar of black smoke in the sky, an enemy broadcast claimed the base had burned down. All it took for the enemy radio signal to reach across the valley was a wire strung for a hundred feet far up on any of the surrounding mountains. Staying ahead of the electronic tracking teams, the Taliban moved the transmitter after each broadcast. Dozens of shepherds saw them, and kept their mouths shut.
In early September of 2009, Battalion 1-32 conducted Operation Dancing Goat 1, walking into the valley and agreeing to repair a mosque. O'Donnell then left for a long overdue home leave. Ayoub responded to his departing instructions and hosted another shura with the Ganjigal elders. As on previous occasions, a dozen elders sat cross-legged on rugs, gulping down the watermelon and sugared tea. In exchange for jobs, they agreed to support the government. The intelligence o cer, Capt. Kaplan, was suspicious of two younger, heavily bearded men who said not a word during the shura. He later conferred with Ayoub, who agreed with a shrug that they were probably Taliban.
Surprisingly, the elders agreed to a radio interview and renounced the Taliban. Ayoub then agreed to send a survey team into the valley to estimate the cost of construction projects. Lt. Jake Miraldi was skeptical of the mission because the Taliban had badly beaten up a Ganjigal resident who worked on base, and several others had not shown up for work.
The scheme of maneuver for Dancing Goat 2 was simple. Maj. Kevin Williams pulled together ten Marine advisers from Joyce and a combat outpost to the north. The lead element consisted of forty askars and four advisers. Thirty Border Police were to follow after them, advised by Swenson and Westbrook. To collect intelligence, Kaplan was accompanying Swenson. 1-32 provided a backup platoon, plus scout-snipers and on-call artillery res. The 1-32 ops center added that helicopter gunships would be in the area and could provide support within five to ten minutes.
Thirteen Marine advisers, sixty Afghan soldiers, and twenty Border Police would walk into Ganjigal to hold the shura, while a platoon from 1-32 remained in reserve and three teams of scout-snipers took positions on a ridge. With O'Donnell on leave, Esoc out with a slipped disc, and Ayoub of the Border Police in Kabul, no senior officer coordinated the plan or accompanied the patrol.
From the start, two advisers-Lt. Michael Johnson and Cpl. Dakota Meyer-didn't like it. Meyer had worked with Jake Kerr out of Combat Outpost Monti, several miles north of Ganjigal. Like Kerr, Meyer had tactical sense and to him Dancing Goat 2 seemed haphazard, with too many loose parts and no single commander.
"We should go in expecting contact," Meyer argued to Williams, "not expecting to sip tea."
Meyer was a slim, intense grunt inclined to speak his mind. Williams listened, but the patrol order remained unchanged. "We're leaving our eastern flank open," Johnson chimed in, "and that's the direct route from Pakistan." No force, however, was assigned to refuse the east ank, and the units moved out shortly after midnight on September 8, 2009. Before dawn, the scout-snipers set up positions overlooking Ganjigal from the south. The main force of two Afghan and one American platoon drove up the valley road from the west. At the Operational Release Point two kilometers outside Ganjigal, the soldiers left their vehicles and walked forward in the dark another kilometer, bumping into a mound of white cement bags and boulders blocking the road. They marked that spot as the Casualty Collection Point, left behind the U.S. platoon from 1-32, and proceeded up a wash toward the village.
To the northwest of the village, an Afghan platoon and two advisers were climbing a high ridge to set up an observation post, or OP. At 5 A.M., the OP called all units to report ashlights signaling along a ridge east of the village. At the same time, the lead platoon stopped for morning prayer. Since it was Ramadan, none of the Afghans had brought water or food with them.
Meyer was driving a Humvee with a Mark 19 40mm gun in the turret. His job was to provide re support if the four advisers advancing with the lead platoon ran into trouble. As he stood beside his truck at the release point in the predawn light, women, children, and goats ocked past him, eeing out of the valley. He tried to question an old man with a long white beard, but the man refused to shake his hand and hurried past.
Ahead of Meyer, four advisers accompanied the Afghan platoon into the village. The terrain provided no cover. The stone houses lay upslope of the rocky dirt road. Lt. Johnson radioed that he was approaching the mullah's house. A long concrete schoolhouse lay o to the right, together with a series of terraces supported by stout, chest-high stone walls that prevented soil erosion.
Unseen, enemy ghters were crouched below the windows of the schoolhouse and inside the houses. They were hiding in the alleyways and, most critically, they were dug in behind the stone terrace walls to the east. They had concealment, bulletproof cover, surprise, and superior numbers. They opened re on the lead element at 0530, shooting machine guns and RPGs downhill with the rising sun at their backs.
Swenson was down in the draw behind the lead element when he heard the rst burst of re. It sounded like recrackers, ragged at rst, then expanding into a volume of pop-pop-pop that swelled to a crescendo. The ring died down while magazines were reloaded. Then it resumed, together with shouts in Pashto by excited Taliban who had targets in sight and were eager to nish them o . Swenson was shocked when askars from the lead platoon suddenly appeared in the thin light. About a dozen ran by him, many streaming blood, most shouting wildly, some without their helmets or rifles. Some pointed up toward the village, but none answered coherently.
Swenson ran up to the mouth of the wash and grabbed at two askars who were running away. As he yelled at them, bullets chipped the stones at his feet. All three opped down as rounds cracked overhead. In the houses a hundred meters to his front, Swenson saw bareheaded young men in traditional oppy shirts shooting AKs wildly from the hip, spraying away as women and boys scurried around behind them, lugging ammunition. From the school to his right, bursts of accurate re were stitching his position. To his north, he saw older ghters with black helmets and body armor popping up from trenches in the terraced elds, ring bursts and ducking back down. Altogether, over a hundred enemy were shooting from entrenched positions to the north and east.
Swenson was carrying a radio called an MBITR 148 with a long whip antenna. He called to the ops center. "This is Highlander 6," he screamed. "Heavy enemy re. Request immediate suppression. Fire KE 3354. Will adjust. And get that air in here!"
No one in the ght with line-of-sight radios was able to talk directly to the battalion ops center on the far side of the second ridge to the south. The sniper team on the rst ridge relayed the request, telling Swenson that the ops center promised air would arrive within fteen minutes.
Artillery series had been pre-registered on possible enemy positions. "This is Highlander," he yelled. "Give me smoke. Now!" Fifty meters behind Swenson, Capt. Ray Kaplan took up the call, yelling over his radio that KE 3365 was the proper target. Fire. Fire, goddamn it. Smoke. Smoke.
"KE 3365," Kaplan told the relay team. "Tell the TOC that's critical. I repeat-critical. We have advisers pinned down." Kaplan sent the message seven times. Everyone was trying to talk over the same frequency, cutting each other o in mid-sentence. Kaplan was sure his requests were heard loud and clear.
"The TOC won't clear a mission," Kaplan radioed to Swenson. "The fucks won't shoot the arty."
The ops center replied that smoke was not available, asking instead for information on all friendly positions. Maj. Peter Granger, the executive o cer in command of the battalion while O'Donnell was on leave, arrived at the TOC after the ght had started.
"They didn't know where all their soldiers were," Granger said later. "They didn't know if they'd be calling re on their own. They didn't have SA [situational awareness]."
An enraged Swenson screamed that he wanted rounds placed on the enemy. How the hell was he to know where everyone was? He was ducking machine gun fire, and he knew exactly where the enemy gunners were-on a knoll to his right front, trying to kill him. A few meters to Swenson's front, an askar was hit, screamed, and crawled away. To his right, another was shot. Behind him, a third yelled, dropped his M16, and limped down the draw. Fire was coming now from three directions. Bullets were kicking up spurts of dust near Swenson's head.
They're all over the place, Swenson thought. I may not make it out of here. His interpreter remained by his side, ring his pistol and calling fruitlessly over his cell phone to another interpreter who had been killed. Four dead askars lay in the ditch beside the draw. A few feet away, Lt. Ademola Fabayo was on the radio, trying to reach Lt. Johnson's party trapped somewhere inside the village. Next to Fabayo were Maj. Williams and 1st Sgt. Garza, as well as Jonathan Landay, a reporter for McClatchy Newspapers. Sgt. Montgomery was guarding the rear. The group was pinned down, returning re, unable to advance forward to find the four missing advisers.
Several hundred meters to the west, Cpl. Meyer and Sta Sgt. Juan Rodriguez-Chavez were standing next to their Humvees, listening to the heavy ring. They heard Lt. Johnson-Fox 3-1-talking on the radio, saying his group of four was trapped inside the village. Meyer called 1st Sgt. Garza, who was pinned down next to Fabayo, asking to go forward to rescue Johnson. Negative, came the reply.

On the ridge 500 feet above, Valadez watched the lone truck leave the rendezvous area and draped a plastic orange air panel on a boulder so that Meyer could track his directions. He told Meyer to take a sharp left and watched the Humvee disappear into the ravine.
As the Humvee crawled out of the ravine, Chavez could see the rst row of stone houses about a hundred meters uphill. When a mortar round crumped in to his right, he jerked the wheel to the left and the Humvee skidded sideways. As he rolled a few meters downhill to straighten out, three rocket-propelled grenades exploded in sharp succession, again to the right. He couldn't hear the radio over the racket of the Mark 19. Meyer was shooting at a rock wall right next to the truck.
"Stop, stop!" Meyer screamed. Chavez hit the brakes while Meyer climbed down from the gun turret and ran over to several askars huddled behind a boulder, also shooting to the right. Meyer pulled rst one Afghan and then another back to the truck. Inside ve minutes, he had packed three wounded soldiers in the backseat. He ran back and led another to the Humvee, opened up the trunk, and pushed him in. Another askar stumbled over. Meyer piled him in and climbed back into the turret. Several Taliban had run forward and were shooting from stone walls along a terrace about fty meters to the east, or right-hand side of the truck. When the Mark 19 jammed, Meyer switched to the backup gun, a 240 machine gun. When he shot one man with a heavy black beard, the others ducked behind the wall. Chavez turned the truck around and they jounced back into the ravine, with Meyer firing bursts in crazy directions.
About 150 meters southwest of the village, Chavez stopped behind a small hill that shielded them from direct re. As Chavez and Meyer unloaded the wounded, a Humvee from Dog 3, the Army platoon, drove up. Meyer asked for help in attacking the village. A soldier said they did not have permission from their command to enter the valley.
"I'll go," said Fazel, Meyer's interpreter.
Chavez, Meyer, and Fazel left the Army platoon and went back into the valley in a single truck. Again as the truck pulled out of the ravine, bullets pinged off the armor and Meyer went back to work with the 240 machine gun. And again he yelled, "Stop!" Four more Afghan soldiers were stumbling out of the village, including their rst sergeant, the right side of his trousers covered with blood. Meyer hopped down and pushed all four into the vehicle. Fazel climbed into the turret and manned the machine gun, firing burst after burst.
It 
They drove back to the rendezvous point and hopped into Chavez's truck with a .50 caliber in the turret. Again into the ravine and up the slope to the village houses. Watching from the ridge to the east, Valadez radioed a warning that ghters hiding in the irrigation ditches were sneaking up on the truck from the right. Meyer swung the gun around and pumped heavy slugs into a tall, full-bearded man in his thirties who was running behind the vehicle. Two more fighters rushed in from the right side. "I can't depress the gun," Meyer yelled, grabbing his M4 rifle. Chavez watched wide-eyed as a ghter approaching the front hood was shot in the head. As the truck swerved a bit sideways over the rocks, he yelled to Meyer that they might get stuck in the valley.
"Well," Meyer yelled down, "I guess we will die with them." Chavez drove straight ahead, bullets pinging o the doors, while Meyer red the .50 caliber. Chavez saw yellow smoke several meters to the right of the road. "Maybe we've found them," he shouted.
Swenson's party had been pinned down for about an hour. Three Border Police, too frightened to return re, had run away. Fabayo was watching groups of two and three enemy ghters darting from one terrace wall to another. A woman in a purple and red dress ran from one house to another with a belt of machine gun bullets dangling from her shoulders. Fabayo shot one man and yelled to Swenson to cover his back. Shooting over a wall, Williams had taken shards of rock in his elbow. 1st Sgt. Garza had been concussed by the near miss of an RPG and Williams had dragged him to cover.
Over a captured handheld radio, a Taliban leader was taunting them. Ahmad Shafi, Swenson's interpreter, provided a translation. "You came in," a mature voice said. "Now I decide how you leave. We killed the Russians here. Now we kill you, unless you surrender. Stop shooting and I will let you live."
These were front-line ghters from Pakistan, many in their thirties and some in their forties, veterans of dozens of skirmishes and several large battles. Unlike in the Korengal and at Barge Matal, their radio discipline was excellent. There hadn't been any intercepts of careless chatter before the attack, and no warnings from the residents of Ganjigal. The fighters had been digging in for over a day.
Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook was shot in the neck and Swenson was applying a dressing when three insurgents in army uniforms approached. When Fabayo waved at them to duck down, they lifted up AKs and started ring. Fabayo shot one in the chest, while Swenson rolled over, pulled a grenade, and blew up the other two. Shafi emptied an M16 clip into them.
Just as two Kiowa helicopters were coming on station, the artillery red several white phosphorus rounds. The party took advantage of a lull in the ring to stagger across open ground. When the enemy pursued them, they popped yellow smoke to mark their position for the Kiowas and hobbled farther down the ravine, away from the village.
As Chavez drove toward the yellow smoke, he saw Fabayo and Swenson supporting Montgomery, while the others lugged extra weapons and ammo. They all looked out on their feet.
"Get out in front of them!" Meyer yelled. When Fazel o ered to take a turn in the turret, Meyer told him to stay on the radio and tell him what the insurgents were saying. Chavez maneuvered the truck up the draw to act as a shield, while Meyer pounded the rock houses and the terrace walls with the .50 cal. After the wounded were safe in de lade, Chavez and Meyer headed up the slope to nd the missing four advisers. The truck was now the sole target in the open, quickly bracketed by rocket-propelled grenades. As the lone vehicle entered the kill zone, insurgents from the front and the right flank brought their AKs to bear. Meyer dropped down from the turret, blood pouring down his right arm.
"I'm okay," he said, grabbing an M4 rifle. "50. cal's empty." Chavez backed down into the gully and tried to sneak around the left side, but the slope was too steep and the Humvee slipped back into the draw. Seeing a wounded askar in a ditch, Meyer ran to the man and turned him over. Dead.
"We need more ammo," Meyer said as they headed back down the draw.
All that had saved Meyer on his third try was sheer luck and an absence of armor-piercing rounds in the enemy PKM machine gun.
Fabayo left Williams, Garza, and Landay at a Casualty Collection Point and stumbled back to the rendezvous spot. The askars and Border Police were slowly recovering from the shock of the ambush and moving down the ravine in small groups. Good for them, Swenson thought. A platoon leader from 1-32 had spread out his soldiers among the vehicles. "Mount up in a truck," he said. "You're no help back here. Move the fuck up." "I can't," the lieutenant said. "The TOC said to cover the vehicles and our rear." Through a radio relay team, Swenson reached the battle captain at the tactical operations center, who said, "Okay. Use him if you want." When the lieutenant still hesitated, Swenson turned away. "You're fucking useless," he said. Swenson, Sha , and Fabayo hopped into a Light Tactical Vehicle, which weighed 15,000 pounds with its armored sides. The LTV was heavy and clumsy, di cult to turn on the twisting path up to the village. They crossed a culvert and skidded uphill as rounds cracked by over their heads. To Swenson's front inside the village, teenagers were running back and forth among the stone houses, shooting AKs from the hip. They lumbered past where Meyer had left the dead Afghan soldier and found three wounded hiding farther forward in the ditch. Fabayo pulled them all into the LTV and they backed down the rutted path, bumping over the jihadist Meyer had killed in the road.
Swenson turned around as the enemy re again increased and drove back to the Casualty Collection Point. The two most seriously wounded, Westbrook and an askar, were immediately placed on board a medevac helicopter.
Meyer talked to Williams and Garza, then walked back to Chavez.
"They're getting medevaced," he said. "There are four still missing. We're going back in." They headed down the ravine in the gun truck, this time followed by Afghan soldiers in two trucks. Again they found more wounded. Again Meyer dismounted, ignoring the bullets cracking overhead, and pulled one and then another askar to the safety of the armored truck. Again they drove back to the Casualty Collection Point and dropped off the three askars.
It was approaching 1100, six hours into the ght. The temperature stood at 100 degrees. Apache attack helicopters and Air Force helicopters with Pararescue Jumpers, or PJs, from the Special Operations Forces were swooping in low from di erent directions, ring at various insurgent groups and looking everywhere for the missing four advisers. Swenson was on the radio, talking to the pilots as they swooped low across the village from different angles, looking in every backyard and alley.
Chavez turned the gun truck around. Swenson sat next to him, switching frequencies on his radio. Fabayo stood up in the gun turret. Fazel sat behind Swenson and Meyer sat behind Chavez. Again they bounced down the draw, accelerated, and skidded up the slope and along the main path next to the battered stone houses.
A Black Hawk pilot radioed that he saw bodies near a stone wall beside a terrace on the east side. The zone was too hot with incoming re to land. He ared the nose of the helicopter and pitched out a purple smoke grenade. Chavez gunned the truck forward and skidded to a stop. Meyer hopped out of the truck and ran forward, ignoring the bullets zipping by. He disappeared into the smoke. Fabayo remained on the gun, providing covering fire.
Meyer found Lt. Johnson lying against a low stone wall, handset in hand. To the right, Doc Layton lay next to him, near Gunny Johnson, whom he had been bandaging when he was shot. Sta Sgt. Aaron Kene ck lay nearby to the left, clutching a GPS. They had been trying to radio their location when insurgents had sneaked up behind them. Their weapons and radios had been taken. Looking at the terrain, Meyer guessed that the insurgents had crept around the corner of the wall and shot them from behind.
While Swenson collected the gear, Meyer brought out Johnson, and then the other three. Lt. Michael Johnson was a smiling outdoorsman who loved the Oregon mountains. Sta Sgt. Aaron Kene ck had been assigned to administration duties on Okinawa and had fought the bureaucracy for a year to be transferred to an adviser team. Gunny Edwin Johnson was a judo expert who led the advisers in their daily workouts. The team called him Mr. Cool because he was always even-keeled. The corpsman, James Layton, loved hard rock, wanted to be a music producer, and spiked his hair to annoy Maj. Williams. Sgt. 1st Class Kenneth Westbrook (Picture 17), evacuated to a hospital in Germany, died a week later. The Westbrooks had lost two sons in battle for their country.
Eight Afghan soldiers and five Americans died in the eight-hour firefight.
Back in the States, the Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation awarded scholarships to the families of the fallen Marines. Key members of the board-Punch Haynes, Dick Torykian, and Pete Haas-met after the ambush at Ganjigal. Two months earlier at Barge Matal, Sta Sgt. Eric Lindstrom had died after helping a very sick Marine and in appreciation they had sent a $30,000 education bond to each of his twin daughters. Now another Army soldier, Sgt. Westbrook, had died, again going to the aid of Marines. Again the foundation met to ensure that Sgt. Westbrook's three sons each received a $30,000 bond. As at the Chosin Reservoir in 1950, soldiers of U.S. Army Battalion 1-32 had fought and died alongside Marines.
It was tting that Chavez, Meyer, Swenson, Fabayo, Sha , and Fazel completed the mission together. Seven hours earlier, sixty Afghans and forty-ve Americans (counting the platoon that declined to go into the ravine) had entered the valley. Fire, fear, and fatigue had whittled the ranks. Thirteen died and twenty received incapacitating wounds. Some askars ran out of the ravine and to their credit later came back, and some stayed away. The interpreters had been unwavering. Some Americans and Afghans began strong and faltered. Other Americans refused to even enter the wretched ravine. Close battle against a determined foe entrenched in superior positions stripped men to their essence. Meyer, a twenty-one-year-old corporal, turned the battle. He and Chavez provided the shield for Fabayo's group to escape from a kill zone. Meyer repeatedly left the armored truck with bullets kicking up dust, rescuing twelve wounded Afghan soldiers. On the rst run, he killed two insurgents within touching distance of the truck, and four others in the ditches. On the second run, using a grenade launcher, he shot one jihadist ten feet away. The shell, instead of exploding, crumbled in the man's face. Meyer then dropped the launcher, grabbed a ri e, and shot another insurgent eight times. On the third run, Meyer leveled his 9mm pistol and shot an insurgent in the cheek. As the insurgent staggered back, Meyer red bullet after bullet into him. When the man hobbled o , Meyer threw away the pistol. Employing rst a Mark 19 that red explosive shells, then a .50 caliber machine gun, then a 7.62 caliber machine gun, and nally an M4 ri e, he broke the momentum of the jihadists who were scrambling down the slopes to surround Fabayo and the others.
For a man to charge into re once requires grit that is instinctive in few men; to do so a second time, now knowing what awaits you, requires inner resolve beyond instinct; to repeat a third time is courage above and beyond any call of duty; to go in a fourth time is to know you will die; to go in a fifth time is beyond comprehension.
Meyer's performance was the greatest act of courage in the war, because he repeated it, and repeated it, and repeated it.
Swenson, Kaplan, and the Marine advisers were enraged at the failure of the ops center to re artillery support. After the dead and wounded were evacuated from Ganjigal, Cpl. Meyer and Lt. Fabayo drove from the battle eld to the ops center. They were so boiling with anger that they were refused entrance, lest they hit someone and end their careers. Returning to his hooch that evening, Meyer learned that his dog had been shot by an admin chief carrying out a base order to get rid of all dogs on the base. Meyer went a little bonkers, and Lt. Kerr and Gunny Devine stepped in, telling others to stay out of Meyer's way. They watched over Meyer, making sure he didn't feel alone.
Visiting the outpost a few days later, I sat in the Marine hooch talking with Meyer and his comrades. Suddenly a few ri e shots cracked out. The outpost sat in the shadow of a steep hill and occasionally a Talib sniper would climb up the reverse slope, crank o a few rounds, and scurry back down the far side.
I tried to continue our conversation. Meyer, though, shouted "Fuckers!," leaped from his chair, and was out the door before I could speak. He hopped into a truck, roared around a bend into a firing position, grabbed the .50 caliber up-gun and sent a steam of red tracers the size of cigars toward an outcropping of rocks near the top of the hill (Picture 18). "That's the fuckers' nest," he shouted. "I can feel it."
The sound of the shells hitting the rocks echoed off the hill. You could feel Meyer's smoldering anger. "They'd be alive today if we got that fire support," Meyer told me. "There's no doubt in my mind." He was tense with anger. The next day, I had to break up a fight when he tangled with a few soldiers over a bumped fender (Picture 19). A few weeks later, Lt. Gen. Joseph Dunford, commander of the Marines in Afghanistan, visited Camp Joyce, ate lunch with a subdued Dakota Meyer, talked with the survivors of Ganjigal, and flew off, studying his notes.
Dunford was no man's fool. His troops called him Fighting Joe because he had led from the front in battles in Iraq. He was thoughtful and literate. He studied war, leadership, and courage. Meyer had him stumped. In twenty-eight months in command as a regimental and assistant division commander, he had never come across anything like this.
In 1942, Sgt. John Basilone had charged several Japanese machine gun nests on Guadalcanal and received the Medal of Honor. Dunford was looking at a similar feat. To rush forward ve times, knowing you were going to die … what kind of man did that? Dunford had talked with Capt. Swenson, the savvy adviser, who could only shake his head. The fury of the battle and the lack of support had infuriated Meyer. That four comrades were trapped was unacceptable to him. He wouldn't stop attacking.
In The Anatomy of Courage, Lord Moran described his rsthand experiences in observing bravery amidst the horrors of World War I. "When the death of a husband or son or brother has grown distant," he wrote, "and the world is free again to think without impiety that courage is not common, men will remember that all the ne things in war as in peace are the work of a few men; that the honour of our race is the keeping of but a fraction of her people."

While Cpl. Dakota Meyer's valor at Ganjigal stood in a class by itself, the ghting skill of so many others was remarkable. The battle at Barge Matal, for instance, demonstrated the superiority of our grunts, no matter how tough the enemy and bleak the terrain. It is not our equipment or repower; it is the coordination, teamwork, and resolve of the American grunts that win battles. A century ago, Theodore Roosevelt was concerned that America was losing the martial spirit necessary to defend itself.

Lt. Kerr and Gunny Devine were worried about Meyer and proud of his valor. That wasn't Meyer's point of view. He hadn't done anything. He had lost four comrades. Why did everyone on base walk around as if it were just another day? Where was the payback? Why had the muj beaten him back time after time? Screw them. Kill them all.
Okay, Kerr said, you can run missions with us-just keep a low pro le. That worked until Kerr's platoon rolled into the Dab Khwar Valley north of Monti. A convoy of eight tinny jingle trucks packing local supplies plus a few fuel trucks, escorted by armored vehicles from a U.S. Army logistical company, was ambushed and pinned down. Kerr's platoon arrived within half an hour. Panicked Afghan drivers were banging their sts on the Army armored trucks, begging to be let inside, as the Taliban red from a distant hillside. Kerr hopped out and aligned a compass azimuth to direct the attack aircraft circling overhead.
Meyer and Spc. Charles Tomeo hopped out behind Kerr and ran down the road under re, checking each jingle truck and pulling out wounded Afghans. Meyer carried one moaning driver back to Kerr's truck, then looked around for help. He ran up to the armored command truck of the logistical unit and pounded on the door, demanding that all medics dismount and follow him. The captain, too frightened to get into the fight, shouted through the bulletproof glass that her soldiers weren't infantry and it wasn't their job.
"Meyer being Meyer," Kerr said, "he told the captain to get fucked and went back to rendering aid with Tomeo." Some of the civilian drivers died, and some were saved by Meyer and Tomeo. But a corporal cannot curse at a captain, even in combat, without causing ripples.
"The only way to keep him out of the shit," Kerr said, "was to put a leash on him and tie him to the truck. That's what we loved about him."
His father, Mike Meyer, had a 300-acre farm in Greensboro, Kentucky. Following his divorce, Mike had had full custody of Dakota from the time he was ten.
"Dakota is a whiz at math," Mike said. "A ne running back, too. The thing about Dakota is his determination. He's just plain goaloriented. Once he gets something into his mind, he'll stick at it until he does it."
Kerr agreed with Meyer's father. There was no way to keep Dakota out of combat. The Marine chain of command decided it was time for Meyer to take a break. He was tightly wired, too ready to fight anyone. The Marine Corps gave him time and space to decompress, hoping he would reenlist. But he decided to leave the service. After a few months at home in Kentucky with his dad, he took a civilian job and bought a house, still protesting that he was not brave.
Those at Ganjigal were outraged that artillery support was not provided. But that anger should not absolve the real culprit. Five Americans and nine Afghans were killed on a sunny fall morning because of a betrayal caused by the opaque loyalties of the Afghan tribal society.
Swenson and Meyer reported seeing two di erent groups of ghters-armored, thick-bearded, zealous professionals from Pakistan, and men from the village, aided by women and boys.
There are several theories about COIN (counterinsurgency) viewed as a body of thought. One theory holds that Islamic extremists move into an isolated village and launch small attacks, prompting government retaliation that alienates the villagers, who then join the jihadists. The results are "accidental guerrillas." 
3
No Afghan or Western forces had intervened in Ganjigal, however. The Americans had engaged in no re ghts or raids that prompted revenge; instead, they had o ered aid. A few weeks after the ambush, the Ganjigal elders agreed to accept a road built by Americans, provided they supplied a home guard (the Taliban) to be paid by the Americans. In anticipation of the deal, two villagers had already bought taxis.
"Over the past year," Swenson said, "I've delivered 70,000 pounds of food and aid supplies to remote villages like Ganjigal. I've tried to win their hearts and minds. But some people need killing if we're to win. No road for Ganjigal."
A related theory argues that the isolated tribes are inherently xenophobic. They take up arms in order to be left alone to till their elds with hand plows, as they had since Alexander the Great. Yet the people of Ganjigal wanted the same material bene ts their neighbors enjoyed. They asked the Americans to repair their mosque and school. They didn't want to walk three miles to market.
"Ganjigal was tied directly to the insurgents in Pakistan," Capt. Harrison said. "Sure, they wanted material things. But like the Korengal, they wouldn't work with the Afghan government to improve their quality of life. It's extremely di cult to help people who don't want to help themselves."
Like the Korengal, Ganjigal had a decades-long history as a cauldron of rebellion against any central government or occupying power. The cluster of impoverished hamlets, only a short trek from the border with Pakistan, had provided a way stop for rebels against King Zahir Shah in the late 1940s, against the Soviets in the 1980s, and against Karzai since 2001. It was a mystery, even to the tribes themselves, how to design incentives to change their hostile behavior.
Col. Ayoub, the Border Police commander, offered his solution.
"Use B-52s," he said.
The deceit at Ganjigal demonstrated the limits of rational dialogue and friendly persuasion. Gen. McChrystal had insisted that "the con ict will be won by persuading the population, not by destroying the enemy." That perception incorrectly framed the con ict as an either-or proposition: persuade the civilians, or destroy the enemy. Battalion 1-32 had not responded with iron force to repeated sniping and harassment attacks, including a hit on 1-32's fuel dump, from the Ganjigal complex. The restraint by the Americans was met with escalation by the fighters in Ganjigal. The emphasis upon persuasion through empathy was illustrated by the high command's embrace of the author Greg Mortenson. Due to "the popularity of Three Cups of Tea among military wives," wrote Elisabeth Bumiller of The New York Times, "Mortenson has spoken on dozens of military bases, seen his book go on required reading lists for senior American military commanders, and had lunch with General David H. Petraeus."

Adm. Mullen held out Mortenson as a model for the military to emulate. Yet Mortenson refused any connection with the military, lest it undercut his credibility with village elders-signaling that the military qua military could not emulate a civilian model.
"Building relationships with elders were in the Army and Marine Corps' new counterinsurgency manual," Bumiller wrote, quoting a colonel. "But Three Cups of Tea brought the lessons to life."
The lesson was that the senior ranks were determined to sell counterinsurgency as benevolent nation building, an image that appealed to the mainstream press and de ated antiwar activism. While the generals accorded rock star status to Mortenson, no grunt such as Dakota Meyer received a glittering reception from the top ranks. Yet it was Meyer who exempli ed the military ethos, while Mortenson exempli ed the sel ess charity that required military security in order to succeed. We didn't have a war-ghting doctrine for defeating the Taliban. Instead, we had a counterinsurgency doctrine for nation building, much like the Peace Corps on a giant scale.
The new counterinsurgency dogma confused the soldiers because it confused roles. The high command, beginning with Adm. Mullen, had diminished the primacy of the military's core competency-violence. Eliding the killing needed to defeat a erce foe reinforced the growing instinct among senior commanders to eschew aggressiveness, due to fear of the political consequences of friendly or civilian casualties. Risk avoidance became the guiding light at the brigade level. Colonels insisted on detailed brie ngs before a single patrol could conduct a night ambush. This self-imposed restraint allowed the Taliban to control both its casualties and the pace and place of the fighting.
Afghanistan was a patchwork of Ganjigals; one isolated village was friendly, and the next was hostile. Our soldiers knew where they could and couldn't go without a ght. Yet in terms of COIN doctrine, each village was treated the same, as if the problem was a few fundamentalists whom the tribal elders could ostracize. In theory, once the true radicals were banished, the majority of the ghters-poor, misguided youths-would put aside their weapons and reject the joys of comradeship in arms, living the rough life, shooting at in dels, and striding manfully through any village in the mountains.
But that theory had scant proof. Our grunts knew it was foolish to hang around in the Korengal, losing men, or to tolerate a Ganjigal, next to their main base. The belief that most Taliban ghters would quit and return to their villages-"reintegrate" was the term-discounted the charismatic leadership of the ery fundamentalists who attracted thousands of recruits, year after year. The Islamists ferociously opposed COIN prescriptions about the rule of law, social services, and the government's legitimacy. Yet the U.S. military scrupulously avoided mentioning, let alone addressing, the magnetic power of radical Islam.
Some people believe in their causes and their religion, and cannot be dissuaded by supposedly superior secular reasoning. It was not unreasonable for Taliban ghters to believe they would win; instead, it was a conceit to believe Islamist fundamentalists could be converted by rational dialogue or by handing out projects. Ganjigal was one such place of entrenched beliefs.
"Ganjigal made a conscious decision to oppose us, like the Korengal and some other valleys along the Pech," Sgt. Maj. Carabello said. "We shouldn't give good things to reward bad behavior."
In invading both Afghanistan and Iraq, President Bush had proclaimed his messianic belief that all peoples desired freedom, regardless of the cultural context. "Freedom," Bush declared, "is the universal gift of Almighty God." 
5
Two centuries earlier, the renowned Orientalist Sir William Jones had devoted his life to designing a code of laws acceptable to the Indo-Afghan tribes. He reached a conclusion very different from the one reached by President Bush.
"A system of liberty," Jones argued, if "forced upon a people invincibly attached to opposite habits, would be a system of cruel tyranny."

Installing leaders in mansions in Kabul and handing them deeds of freedom and sovereignty while America paid the mortgage portended trouble. Eventually, both Afghans and Americans became resentful.
The American goal was to persuade Afghan tribes to support a centrally controlled, deeply corrupt democracy. Well meaning though our counterinsurgency doctrine was-provide security and services to the people and link them to a central government-we were unable to transpose it inside the habits of the mountain tribes. Tribal habits trumped the American offer of liberty.
Chapter 7 1,500-MILE SANCTUARY
The mountain frontier in the north of Afghanistan is a patchwork of tribal loyalties. Some tribes, like the Korengalis, allied with the Taliban; others, like the Sa s along the Pech, submitted passively. Some kahns or sub-tribes, though, refused to be intimidated. The village of Mangwal, for instance, was the opposite of Ganjigal.
Capt. Mike Harrison, the popular Harvard-bound company commander, was responsible for sixteen villages in Khas Konar district, several miles south of Ganjigal. "There's the real power in the district," he told me in October of 2009, pointing to a ruddy-faced, erect old man with round glasses and walking cane waiting outside the district office (Picture 20).
At eighty-one, Norafzal-like many Afghans, he had only one name-was the senior elder in the district. His tribal lands extended from the oor of the Konar Valley eastward into the highland pastures of Pakistan. He ruled his kahn with an iron hand and fought ercely. When the Soviets had invaded Konar in 1987, he pledged the support of his village to the mujahideen. In the nearby mountains, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar and his ghters, the Hisb-i-Islami Gulbuddin, or HIG, were favored by Pakistan and also received more aid from the CIA than any other mujahideen organization.
Norafzal provided Hekmatyar with recruits. As important, the 750 families in his village of Mangwal fed the 500 HIG ghters manning outposts on the Pakistani side of the border. In December of 1987, Soviet Lt. Col. Milili Ravevich decided to dislodge the mujahideen from their redoubt. In a frigid night march, one Soviet battalion climbed up the steep face of Sowto Pack, driving back the surprised mujahideen. Near Mangwal, a second battalion was supposed to climb up the slopes and attack from the rear.
Exhibiting a stunning lack of sanitary common sense, the Soviet army did not insist its cooks wash their hands after they defecated. Seventy percent of all Russians who served in Afghanistan over ve years-160,000 soldiers-su ered from dysentery, typhoid, or cholera. Charging up the slopes, several of Ravevich's platoon and company commanders collapsed with stomach cramps and dysentery and the attack faltered.
The mujahideen were ring downhill from behind stone forti cations. Lacking water and ammunition, Ravevich had to retreat, reporting eighteen dead and forty wounded. The actual gures were higher. The retreating Russians rampaged through Mangwal. According to Norafzal, eighty-six women and children were killed. When the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan, Hekmatyar returned to Konar and joined other warlords in seizing Kabul. Norafzal turned against him, embittered that Hekmatyar had provided no aid to Mangwal.
After the Taliban collapsed in 2001, Hekmatyar and his HIG retreated to Pakistan. In early 2003, American commandos ew into the Konar base at A-Bad. Norafzal soon heard that foreigners with beards were driving around the valley asking about the HIG and the Taliban. Wherever they stopped, the elders were noncommittal.
One day, the bearded strangers drove into Mangwal. They carried their weapons with casual expertise and talked in respectful tones. They were the rst "white men" Norafzal had seen in fteen years. He invited them inside the room where he slept with a half dozen other men. All the village elders pressed inside, while boys and even women pushed up to the doors to peek in.
Their leader said his name was Capt. Jim Gant, and his Special Forces team had come to kill all enemies. Norafzal laughed. Six Americans and one truck.
"You point them out," Gant said, "and we'll put them down." Norafzal laughed again. This was great fun. He invited them to stay for supper-pilau and nam, with dugh (yogurt and water) on the side. They sipped sugary green chai, sitting around a kerosene lantern until three in the morning. Gant, a twelve-year veteran, told Norafzal that he had fought the Iraqis and had jumped out of airplanes. Norafzal said he'd like to see that.
Norafzal inquired about the Greek symbol tattooed on Gant's left forearm. Every member of Gant's team-Operational Deployment Alpha, or ODA 316-had one. They called themselves the Spartans.
Norafzal ventured that the HIG had seized his tribe's high pastures and given them to a Mohmand border tribe. We'll walk up and settle this, Gant promised. "You are only six," Norafzal said. "We have Apaches," Gant said. Gant explained that the helicopter gunships were named in honor of a erce Indian tribe. Norafzal said he had once seen a movie where Indians on horseback were shooting white soldiers.
"You've killed white soldiers, too-Russians," Gant said. "You're like Sitting Bull." Norafzal loved his new name. A few days later, watched over by two Apache helicopters, ODA 316 accompanied Sitting Bull to the Pakistani outpost guarding the Karir Pass. Gant amiably explained that villagers from Mangwal would be moving their sheep across to the high pastures. And were there any al Qaeda nearby that he might kill? The Pakistani soldiers were astonished. Sitting Bull was delighted.
"Sitting Bull was a power in the province," Gant said. "He knew what was going on in Pakistan, in Konar, and up in the Korengal."
In May of 2003, while driving in the valley, Gant's convoy was hit by an IED. One soldier lost his leg and another, his arm. The next day, a visitor from Mangwal handed Gant a list of four names. Wearing Afghan clothes, the Spartans rented the local vehicles called jingle trucks and drove into Pash-shad market. The informer pointed out four men. Three died in a brief firefight. The fourth escaped to Pakistan.
After that, Sitting Bull was a marked man. At least twice, HIG raiding parties swept into Mangwal to kill him. On both occasions, Norafzal rushed to the mosque to sound the call to arms. Mangwal is a maze of narrow rocky paths among hundreds of square, stone homes that make ideal pillboxes. Hekmatyar's fighters were routed in both battles.
Gant set up an intelligence net, with drop points where villagers could hide letters for his team. The villagers became Gant's watchers, climbing into the hills with his ODA teams to point out the paths the Taliban used. The teams then hid and called in air strikes. In a dozen clandestine operations, not once was a hide site chosen by the Mangwali guides compromised.
Inside Mangwal, the ODA soldiers walked around without armor and played volleyball with the men. They built a well, brought in medical supplies, and wrote to their families to send books and writing materials. Eventually, they collected enough money to build a girls' school. Gant's father sent Norafzal a shotgun for bird hunting. When a whispering campaign began in the markets that the village was becoming "Christianized," Sitting Bull was unfazed.
becoming "Christianized," Sitting Bull was unfazed.
"He didn't care what the mullahs were saying," Gant said. "He only cared about his tribe and his village." Acting on tips, the ODA pulled a raid near the Korengal and killed a top leader. In his house, they found forty pounds of wet opium and $10,000. The compound lay in smoking ruins and the leader's extended family was left with nothing. Gant handed back some of the money.
"He was our enemy, so we killed him," Gant said. "But we're not going to leave women and children to starve."
The goodwill gesture almost got him killed. A week later, informed of a tribal feud in the Korengal, Gant and the ODA tried to play the role of mediator. It was a setup.
"We drove in local vehicles deep into the Korengal," he said, "and had lunch at the sawmill with forty or fty elders. We're trying to persuade them not to shoot each other. So by way of thanks, when we're driving out, we get hit with an IED and it took a forty-minute gunfight to get out of the damn place."
When the commandos arrived back at Asadabad, a delegation from Mangwal was waiting for them. They had heard the Spartans were going into the Korengal, and had driven twenty miles north to warn them not to do it.
Special Forces teams like Gant's hoped to form a network of tribes across Konar in order to provide informants and home guard units along the Pakistani border. Grant had visited fifty villages and had recruited only Sitting Bull, who intended to protect only his small tribe.
Over the next six years, other U.S. commando teams and conventional units kept friendly relations with Sitting Bull. He remained the exception.
In counterinsurgency, the premise was that government forces expand outward, spreading like an inkblot. That didn't happen in Konar. President Karzai opposed organizing armed village units. Militias, home guards, arbakai, or neighborhood watches-whatever one called them-had been key to local security in Vietnam and in Iraq. Karzai, however, feared militias would mutate into warlordism.
"Even for Sitting Bull," Harrison said, "we couldn't provide a mortar or a machine gun. The provincial governor refused. Who could be more loyal than Sitting Bull?" Whatever the motivation of the mountain tribes-religious, clannish xenophobic, or simply committed to medieval life-some folks will not buy what we are selling, no matter how hard we try. It may take another century for some mountain tribes to accept electricity, let alone rule by a Kabul government.
The porous border facilitated the infection of jihad. The madrasas in Pakistan, many funded by Saudis and wealthy Arabs in the Gulf states, provided a steady flow of fervent Islamists who trekked across the border to invigorate and reinforce the local insurgents.
The United States had committed forces for a longer period to Regional Command East than to any other region in Afghanistan. Yet no eastern province had been turned over to the Afghan forces. The sanctuary in Pakistan and the con icting allegiances of the mountain tribes meant continuous war.
After pulling out of Barge Matal, Kerr returned to his base near Camp Joyce. But within a few weeks, Brave Son and his platoon were called upon to go to the aid of yet another outpost, called Keating. Construction of outposts in the mountains had begun in 2003 after the Taliban had retreated into Pakistan. The posts provided patrol bases to prevent infiltration, while demonstrating a government presence.
The longer a competent sergeant remains in one post, the more he will scrounge materials to improve conditions for his soldiers. The less the combat action, the more attention can be paid to internal comfort. Combat Outpost Keating in Nuristan Province, midway between Barge Matal and 1-32's base at Camp Joyce, had considerable creature comforts. The 140 American and Afghan soldiers had their own contingent of contractors to install plumbing and electrical xtures. Inside a small compound, nine medium-sized buildings were built with plywood erected over concrete foundations. There were mattresses in the sleeping quarters, Formica tables and TVs in the chow hall, regular showers, a gym, a courtyard with picnic tables, ower gardens, several pet dogs, air-conditioning, a mosque for the Afghan soldiers, and golf clubs for hitting drives into the surrounding mountains.
Because they required helicopter and logistics support far disproportionate to the number of people they supposedly protected, such outposts were gradually closed in 2009. By early October of 2009, the number of small mountainous outposts in RC East had shrunk from twenty-two to fourteen. The ght at Barge Matal, though, had drawn away helicopter assets. So Keating hadn't yet been closed, and the Taliban had gathered to pounce.
Following their standard tactics, the insurgents had watched the base during September and saw that fewer patrols swept the surrounding hills on a regular basis. The insurgents spent weeks hauling ammunition into caches near ring sites. When they moved in, they told the villagers to leave because American bombers would respond to the assault. A few villagers did warn the Americans, who paid little attention because warnings were frequent.
When the Taliban attacked on the morning of October 3, they rained re down from three hillsides. The Taliban commander, Mullah Mumbullah, squatted on an overhang with an unimpeded view down into Keating, giving orders over his Icom. Insurgent video showed RPGs being red about once a minute, each followed by a loud shout of "Allahu Akbar" and cheers when large pu s of gray smoke marked where the rockets exploded. Within minutes, Keating's plywood buildings caught fire, with a strong wind spreading the flames.
The Taliban rushed down the hillsides and easily cut through the wire on the Afghan army side of the camp. Most of the local Afghans hired to stand tedious watches in guard towers around the base ran away. Some stayed to ght and three were quickly killed. Some of the Afghan soldiers escaped by running down into the ravines. Others fell back with the Americans. Ammunition hadn't been stored at dispersal points and the Americans were running low on bullets when the Apache helicopters came swooping in. Rarely had the pilots seen so many insurgents crouched behind rocks and hiding under trees, steadily creeping downhill. The defenders fell back to a stone building and called in successive waves of attack helicopters. During the day, four Apaches returned to base, taken out of commission by ground fire. From a tiny nearby outpost, a 120mm mortar also provided fire support.
Kerr's platoon was rushed into the ght as part of the relief force, landing shortly after noon. The soldiers headed toward the smoke at Keating. Toiling up and down the intervening hills and ravines in 100-degree heat, while laden with armor and ammunition, slowed down the rescue force. At one point, they bumped into an unwary Taliban machine gun crew and quickly killed them. After searching the bodies, Kerr pushed his soldiers forward.
It wasn't until late afternoon, after a four-hour march, that they reached Keating and linked up with the survivors. Of fty-four American soldiers, eighteen were wounded. One was missing and feared captured until Kerr's soldiers found his body. That brought the fatality total to eight. Every building except one was burning to the ground. Medics were transfusing blood from healthy soldiers into the wounded. Kerr found a Taliban flag that read, "Only one God and Mohamed is the prophet."
"It was obvious Keating couldn't be defended," Sta Sgt. Thomas Summers, one of Kerr's squad leaders, said. "I was disappointed in us for ever setting in there. And we couldn't keep contact after the fight with the enemy to pay them back."
Anxious to show they weren't involved in the attack, the villagers ignored the enemy bodies around the wire and on the slope leading to the burnt-out camp. After enduring the smell for three days, Master Sgt. Rivas ordered the villagers to bury them.
"The attackers were mostly outsiders," Rivas said, "including diehards from the Pak side of the border. The villagers wanted nothing to do with them, Muslim rules about quick burials or not." Supposedly one of the bodies was that of Abdul Rahman, the commander at Barge Matal. On the jihadist video, he was shown at Keating. Later, though, the Taliban denied he had been killed. Did he exist at all, or was he Keyser Söze, the mythical villain played by Kevin Spacey in The Usual Suspects? There were so many aliases, misspellings, and rumors surrounding insurgent leaders that it was hard to sort out fact from ction. Everyone knew each other. The Sa tribe of Konar had allied with the Mohmand tribe in Pakistan to twice rebel against the Afghan monarchy after World War II, with thousands forcibly resettled in remote northern Nuristan. The jihadists in Pakistan sent Sala mullahs back into Konar. It was hard to know which group launched which attacks, since all claimed credit and often merged forces.
After a few days, Kerr's platoon was pulled out and Keating was abandoned. Throughout Nuristan and Konar provinces, the Taliban were crowing over their clandestine AM radio station that the infidel invaders had been defeated and driven out.
Back in the States, Katie Couric, the anchor of the CBS Evening News, summarized the day-long battle. Appearing behind an impressive mock-up of Konar Province, she pointed out that Keating, located in rugged territory, was the deadliest attack on U.S. forces since the Taliban assault at Wanat. "The U.S. will abandon outposts too difficult to defend," she said. Later, Al Jazeera interviewed high-ranking Taliban commander Seif Galali. "The Americans withdrew from Nuristan," the interviewer said, referring to Outpost Keating and previous losses. "Do you think the Americans shall withdraw from the villages to towns?"
"Everyone heard about what happened in Nuristan," the Taliban commander replied. "When Americans su er casualties, they run away from the battle."
The Ranch House, Bella, Wanat, Bari Alai, Barge Matal, Keating, Dangam, Pash-shad, Ganjigal, the CIA post at Ghaki Pass … Valley by valley, outpost by outpost, year by year, the Americans were driven out of the mountains.
After leaving Keating in October of 2009, Kerr was told to return temporarily to his outpost at Dangam for a few days (Map 4). An Afghan soldier had been killed in the district by Mashwani tribesmen. Since Kerr had been adopted into the tribe, he was the logical choice to investigate.
"We left Dangam last May," Kerr said, "because other outposts like Bari Alai had been overrun. I've been back a few times, but it's not the same."
A dozen Afghan soldiers accompanied Kerr's platoon to the outpost, where they were greeted warmly by a squad of police. Although the barbed wire and bunker defenses were in good condition, some trash and human shit was scattered about and the brick barracks stood half finished.
"After we were pulled out, USAID cut off the funds," Kerr said. "The local people and the cops won't finish it without pay. So the cops will spend the winter inside the fighting bunkers. They'd rather be miserable when it's freezing than do some work in the good weather."
The Dangam outpost sat at the top of a steep cli , with clear elds of re in every direction. Kerr gestured at the small valleys and formidable ridgelines along the Pakistan border to the east.
"This outpost is a porcupine," he said. "If the Taliban push against it, they feel pain. So they walk around it, beyond ri e range. The outpost hasn't been certi ed for helicopter landings, so I can't stay here. That's crazy. I can land choppers here, and a Taliban brigade couldn't knock me off this cliff."
He pointed to a village about five kilometers away. "That's Zombai, the Taliban center. That tribe is Salarzi. They won't invite us to tea. We used to hang out around there until someone shot at us and then we'd nail one or two." Kerr sounded wistful. He gestured at the expanse of green terraces and stone hamlets (Picture 21). "This was mine," he said. "No one fucked with 1st Platoon. Then we were pulled out because Bari Alai didn't defend itself. Now we sit on our asses back at Company. I can't send a squad out without permission from Brigade. My platoon is fucking pissed o that we gave away the initiative."
Every adviser and coalition battalion commander faced the challenge of what constituted "tolerable" corruption. In Afghanistan, it was unknown whether the Karzai government was rotten beyond redemption and destined to fail, regardless of the e orts of the coalitionwhether, as Kerr put it, too many o cials at too many levels were hated for exceeding the tolerance of the population. The exodus of a billion dollars a year in cash from the country and the massive fraud in the presidential and the parliamentary elections were evidence of a stunning level of corruption that permeated the ruling class from top to bottom.
"The degree of theft is frustrating," Sta Sgt. J. A. Richards, an adviser to the Afghan army who was working with Kerr, added. "We spent months gathering evidence against one guy, Jam Dab. He was stealing big-time. We made the arrest and sent him to Kabul. The next night, he had dinner at Karzai's residence."
Corruption was an old story without a new ending.
Military doctrine states that corruption should not be tolerated. Yet it is silent about the methods to expunge it. Company-grade o cers aren't trained in procedures for bringing charges against host nation o cials; nor are the colonels and generals. The coalition has no systemic method for restraining grand or petty theft. "In my district," Kerr said, "I'm told when a guy crosses the line with the people. Can I arrest him? No. We'll never know all the scams. So for most guys, my rule is: If the Taliban try to kill you and you give me info about the insurgents, those are the two things I need to know about you. My concern is the fucks on the border."
It was an old refrain: Sooner or later, most conversations about security on the east side of the Konar River brought in Pakistan. In 1947, England terminated its three centuries of rule over the Indian subcontinent by creating the Hindu state of India and the smaller, geographically divided Muslim state of Pakistan. A spasm of ethnic bloodshed followed England's abrupt announcement of the new nations, with three million Hindus eeing from Pakistan to India, and ve million Muslims eeing from India to Pakistan. Five decades of enmity between the two nations followed, with India defeating Pakistan in three wars.

After the Russians occupied Afghanistan in 1979, Pakistan provided sanctuary for the mujahideen and the conduit for U.S. nances and equipment. When the Russians withdrew in 1989, the United States lost interest in Afghanistan, and the mujahideen deteriorated into warlords squabbling over spoils. Pakistan, having developed nuclear weapons to o set India, threw its support behind the nascent Taliban in order to create a client state on its western border.
The United States and Pakistan had good reason to distrust each other. In the 1980s, Pakistan had developed nuclear weapons and sold components to North Korea and Libya. In response in the 1990s, the U.S. Congress switched aid on and o , while the executive branch alternately embraced and rebuffed Pakistan's leaders, whose motivations were as erratic as America's responses.
Under pressure from the United States after 9/11, Pakistan agreed to cut its ties with the Taliban and to condemn al Qaeda. But when the United States allowed Pakistani aircraft to y into Afghanistan to evacuate its advisers to the Taliban in November of 2001, the suspicion was that key terrorists also escaped.
What happened next illustrated how much American society and values had changed. Seven months after 2,800 Americans were killed at Pearl Harbor in 1941, Adm. Chester Nimitz sailed west to Midway Island, where his carrier destroyed the Japanese eet and changed the course of the war. Now imagine if Nimitz, when he reached the International Dateline, had decided to turn back, thereby granting the Japanese a sanctuary in the Western Pacific. Such a decision would have been preposterous.
Sixty years later, nearly three thousand Americans were murdered in New York City. A few months later, the American military was poised to destroy Osama bin Laden's force. The al Qaeda Arabs were running for their lives in sneakers, unprepared for the harsh winter, while the local Pashtun tribes were in deathly fear of the enraged juggernaut in pursuit. Fearful of America's wrath, the Pakistani army was scrambling to distance itself from the Islamist fighters.
But when al Qaeda crossed the Durand Line-a scratch on a map ignored by all the local tribes-into Pakistan, the U.S. military, the U.S. Congress, the U.S. president, and the U.S. press stopped as if shocked by an electric current. There was never a serious policy discussion about pursuing and destroying the enemy. By halting on a ridge in the middle of nowhere, we legitimized Pakistan as a sanctuary.
Encouraged by our fastidiousness, the Pakistani army regained its con dence and issued dire warnings that the border was inviolate to American ground attack. At the same time, the Pashtun border tribes, due to intimidation, Islamic solidarity, and blood ties, acceded to Taliban rule. Since 2001, Pakistan has played both sides, sheltering Taliban and terrorists while permitting American strikes by unmanned aircraft and accepting American aid.
Obsessed with India, the Pakistani army deployed most of its forces along its eastern border and supported terrorist groups in Kashmir. A popular saying was "Every country has an army; in Pakistan, the army has a country." Inside the army, though, o cers were wary of each other's loyalties. Having encouraged Islamism in the 1980s to divide civilian political parties, the generals weren't certain which fellow officers rendered loyalty to Islamic parties above loyalty to the army. U.S. aid subsidized the ruling elite in Islamabad. Since 2001, the United States has given Pakistan over $15 billion.

Police Chief Zada pointed again at a mountain on the edge of the FATA, about two miles to the east. He again asked Kerr to launch a raid, offering to go along and point out the Taliban camp near Bajaur.
Kerr responded amiably, Why don't you shoot the Taliban when they walk past here, and save yourself a hike? Zada smiled tightly. Both knew the police and the local Taliban were mainly from the same tribes. In a ght, there would be casualties on both sides, and revenge afterward. Zada wouldn't last a week. Better to live and let live.
"The Taliban pay $300 a month," Zada said. The askars shut up. Kerr ranted at the lieutenant for a few more minutes, and then stormed out of the bunker. Devine stopped him near the mortar pit.
"Guess what?" he said. "A dozen loaves appeared in a Humvee while you were chewing ass." Few Americans could have carried it o . Kerr was so direct with everyone, and worked so hard, that Sawahar was overmatched arguing with him. When Kerr called out someone for wrong behavior, the Afghans knew it would have been the same had it been his own soldiers.
Still, the American soldiers weren't staying to ght with the Afghans shoulder to shoulder. They started projects, built an outpost, patrolled the villages-and left in May after Bari Alai was overrun. The relationship was not what it had once been. The Afghans knew Kerr's platoon would fight. They also knew Kerr took his orders from a different military command.
At breakfast the next morning-green tea and biscuits-Devine walked over to Kerr.
"We've got four dickers on the mountain face to our south," he said. Through binoculars, four armed men dressed in black could be seen sitting at the edge of a tree line on a hillside over a kilometer away, looking down at the outpost (Picture 22).
"Too far for our snipers to hit them," Kerr said. "Call a fire mission." Devine called the coordinates back to the 105mm guns at the company outpost eight kilometers to the west. The rst two shells exploded a football field away from the insurgents, who immediately ran into the tree line.
"Piss-poor registration," Kerr said. "Use our 60 in the tree line. Drop an arty volley on the ridge. Might scare the piss out of them." Devine gestured for the mortar crew to re using an immediate direct lay, aiming upslope. He called back to the 105s, and a minute later two rounds struck the top of the ridge, followed by a sharp crack! and a spire of black smoke.
"Secondary explosion," Devine said, laughing. "Better to be lucky than accurate. The muj probably spent a week lugging some recoilless rounds up there. Now they have another week of humping ahead of them."
Kerr pointed to a distant mountain pass. During the night, we had seen a string of lights from vehicles crossing from Pakistan into the district. The Taliban were driving rather than walking across the border.
"Chief Zada's right, you know," he said. "We have to patrol those ridges, ambush the fuckers, use our Ranger training. We have to put a hurting on them, not sit back and watch them drive in. Zada says the word is we ran away."
Sixty-eight percent of company-grade U.S. Army o cers with combat experience like Kerr believed they were not encouraged to take risks on the battlefield.

On the return to Charlie Company headquarters, Sgt. Joseph Scappace, a squad leader, sat in the truck with Kerr. Scappace had served in the Marine Corps during the Iraq War, then transferred to the Army, where he'd soon qualify for the helicopter pilot program.
"When a re ght starts," Scappace said, "Big Army studies the ground, then moves forward. Marines attack to seize the ground. That's the difference."
"Bullshit," Kerr said. "Marine grunts do seven months. We do a year. Any grunt wears down after eight months. The higher-ups worry about PTSD. Hell, we have higher morale during the ghts. It's the friction and hassle that gets to us. We're ghting this war by PowerPoint slides. Marines can't read. That's their advantage."
In early 2010, Battalion 1-32 turned over their battlespace and returned to the States. The battalion had followed the key counterinsurgency principles. Lt. Col. O'Donnell and Sgt. Maj. Carabello had set the example, traveling constantly, talking to everyone, working hand in hand with the o cials. The local police were stando sh, but the askars and Border Police willingly worked with the Americans. Captains like Mike Harrison had spent endless hours sipping tea in shuras, supervising millions of dollars in projects, and supporting local o cials. At the end of his second tour, he wasn't sure what had been accomplished.
"If I had it to do over again," Harrison said, "I'd work to uncover the secret agents. We never broke the shadow government. Some people were on our side, and some weren't. Everyone liked our money, but that didn't change attitudes."
Lt. Jake Miraldi voiced similar ambiguity. "My platoon was proud of fighting at Barge Matal," he said. "When we returned to Camp Joyce, I got back to visiting my seventeen villages at least once every two weeks. I know COIN means development to win over the people. I'm not convinced. One visit to a village every two weeks-how much difference did we make?"
In 2006, Regional Command East had deployed the outposts in the mountains to provide a security bubble for the populated areas. In 2010, the generals conceded the mountains and pulled back to the populated areas. Capt. Ray Kaplan, the intelligence chief, was downright skeptical about the change. "The Talibs are not content to stay in the hills," he said. "They're sniping at the Konar road from the capillary valleys. If you leave them alone, they come at you. It's that simple."
The last battalion to defend inside the Korengal red 2,000 artillery and mortar shells a month. The next battalion to defend outside the Korengal along the Pech River red 3,000 shells a month. Several months after the Korengal outpost was abandoned, the Stars and Stripes newspaper sent a reporter to check on things along the Pech Valley.
"Insurgents command the high ground [in the Pech]," reporter Dianna Cahn wrote. "American commanders are struggling to assess the value of trying to hold this isolated valley in the hostile Kunar [Konar] province. Many wonder if it wouldn't be better to pull out of the Pech, too."
In ten years of warfare, the U.S. military had not designed a set of o ensive tactics to keep the insurgents in the mountains o balance. Nor had the U.S. senior sta s come up with a counter to Taliban attacks from its sanctuary. Partial barriers to channelize the in ltrators had not even been tried, while hoping for more cooperation by the Pakistani army had proved fruitless. The U.S. logistic supplies for Afghanistan owed primarily through Pakistan. The Pakistani army occasionally stopped the logistics ow in order to make a point about its independence. You cannot win a war when a determined enemy has a sanctuary next door.
A PROFESSION, NOT A CREED
In March of 2009, President Obama approved the deployment of an additional 22,000 troops. They weren't earmarked for RC East and the Konar region, however. While the north was shaky, southern Afghanistan was falling to the Taliban. So ISAF shifted its main e ort, and assigned the incoming Marine brigade to the south (Map 1).
When I arrived at the airfield in Kabul, an Air Force dispatcher checked my destination. "You're cleared to go to Camp Leatherneck," he said. "As senior man, you're in charge of the passenger evacuation in an emergency." He neglected to tell me I was the only passenger. I ew to southern Afghanistan in the back of a gargantuan C-17 aircraft, authorized to give orders to 40,000 pounds of ammunition.
The Marines needed a lot of ammunition to take control of Helmand Province, the opium capital of the world. The province was mostly desert, bisected by the Helmand River, which ran north to south, providing the water for a narrow fertile valley-the Green Zone-one hundred miles in length and home to a million farmers. The terrain bore an eerie resemblance to Vietnam, at elds of corn, wheat, and poppy enclosed by tree lines and dense undergrowth, interlaced with thousands of irrigation ditches and back roads known only to the locals.
Since 2006, England had carried the ght in Helmand. After America was attacked on 9/11, all the nations of NATO were supposed to come to its aid; an attack upon one was an attack upon all. Lt. Gen. David Barno, the commander in Afghanistan early in the war, later quipped, "NATO and other countries contributed less than the sum of their parts," meaning most of the forty-two nations involved contributed forces as political symbolism. NATO Europe wanted to keep a hand on the wheel and a foot on the brake of American power.
While Canada, the Netherlands, France, and Australia did send ghting units, Great Britain contributed the largest force. In 2006, the Brits sent 2,000 ri emen into Helmand, a landmass half the size of England and larger than the state of Nevada. Sharing an open border with Pakistan, Helmand accounted for 50 to 70 percent of the world's opium and its derivative, heroin. The livelihoods of poppy farmers, drug dealers, and insurgents were all threatened by the British presence.
Led to believe there were few Taliban, the British plan envisioned a peacekeeping mission. Initially the Brits accommodated Afghan o cials who insisted upon a British token presence in district towns. This resulted in deploying "platoon houses"-tiny outposts in district centers-that were quickly besieged. While British generals were loath to admit that taming Helmand exceeded their resources, the British press described in graphic terms the lack of equipment and manpower.
In 2007, the British fell back from the platoon houses, shifting to armored columns.

Each of the Marine brigade's four battalions was assigned a farming and poppy area of about 800 square kilometers. The mission was to clear out the insurgents. Because Marine grunts did tours of seven months, they could mark their date for returning home when they arrived. This meant they could patrol at an intense pace without burning out, while living in primitive conditions.
Outpost Jakar was typical (Map 7). Located 300 miles south of Kabul in the obscure district of Nawa, Jakar was a half-nished concrete building with a roo ess second oor. Jakar was the headquarters for 1st Battalion, 5th Marine Regiment. The operations center (Picture 23) consisted of two large maps and a few laptops powered by a cable attached to a truck. A schoolhouse next door housed sixty askars. Daily rations consisted of bottles of warm water and two MREs in plastic bags. At Jakar, there were no lights, no refrigerators, no air-conditioning, no cooked meals, no ice-and no escape from the smothering heat and dust.
A small picture on his plywood desk showed that the battalion commander, Lt. Col. William McCollough, his handsome wife, and their two children had the classic blond hair, blue-eyed Minnesotan features seen in Norman Rockwell illustrations. An omnivorous reader who labored over the monthly newsletter he sent to the families in the States, it was assumed when he was growing up that he would take over management of his family's newspaper business.
Instead, he became a grunt who cherished military traditions. When his unit arrived in Nawa in May of 2009, the American and British ags were unfurled and a John Philip Sousa march was played as McCollough assumed command from a small British contingent. With Marine battle streamers waving in a hot breeze, McCollough and a British colonel stood at attention outside the bullet-scarred, half-nished outpost that was regularly attacked by Pashtun zealots whose forefathers had vanquished the British in the 1880 Battle of Maiwand, a dusty village twenty miles up the road.
"Today Nawa district stands devastated," McCollough said in late May of 2009. "The elders have ed, no wheat gets to market, and no shops are open. It won't be that way when we leave."
Strong words. The few scru y police outposts on the main road had o ered no threat to the Taliban. Nawa's governor, a retired schoolteacher, stayed alive by staying away. The district market was deserted.
Each day, McCollough walked through the market past dozens of empty shacks, some padlocked, and others with sagging doors and crumbling roofs. A few destitute shopkeepers chatted with Joe, the middle-aged interpreter who winked to indicate that he had to ask stupid questions to please the Americans. Joe was an Afghan-American from San Francisco who cheered in the crazies' section at Oakland Raiders football games. Born in Kandahar, he spoke perfect Pashto and posed as a local hire who slyly mocked the Americans paying his salary. His real job was to recruit informants. He was a spymaster.
The Taliban were strangers, the bearded shopkeepers said, looking at each other for support. Joe asked how the shopkeepers avoided roadside bombs. The Taliban put rocks on the road to warn us, the shopkeepers nervously responded, knowing the Taliban would later demand a report. Taliban rarely come to the market, the shopkeepers went on, so please do not shoot around here. But someone is shooting at the base, Joe replied. Shrugs all around.
McCollough gestured for the patrol to move on. They passed the police chief, a tall man with a thick beard dressed in the traditional untucked shirt and baggy pants. With a nod, he stepped inside a run-down police station protected by a sturdy thicket of bright green marijuana plants.
"He tells us some things," McCollough said, "and hopes we won't find out others."
The 
The next patrol went out in late afternoon, after the temperature dropped below 100 degrees. Capt. Gus Biggio, a reservist who had left his law practice to serve as the civil a airs o cer, wanted to visit a farm north of Jakar where a teenager had been shot. After his father drove him on a tractor to Jakar, a helicopter had own the boy to a military hospital, where he had died. The body was own back to Jakar, where Afghan soldiers held a candle-lit vigil for the grieving family. Not knowing whether Marines or the Taliban had red the fatal bullet, McCollough gave the father a solatium of $2,500 in cash.
"Three days later, he refused to talk with us," Biggio said. "The Taliban had paid him a visit and broken up his farm tools. Maybe I can slip him some cash under the table."
The Taliban had put out the word that no farmer was to accept work at the American base. Any Marine payments for damages were to be shared 50-50 with the Taliban. The tax for moving wheat to market was 15 percent.
"The local cops and the farmers know who the Taliban are," Russ Juren, a retired cop who was the battalion's police adviser, said. "We're the ones in the dark."
Once clear of the market, the Marines trudged along, while farmers on tractors gave them a wide berth. None of the farmers wanted to chat.
"The Talibs are watching us," Joe said, glancing at the farms. The patrol leader, Lt. Shawn Connor, kept his men spread out. The wheat and poppy crops had been harvested, replaced by sprouts of corn providing no concealment. To reach the farm, they had to walk across open elds. The sun was at their backs, tilted at such a low angle before sunset that it shone on them like a spotlight, with no wind. Perfect sniper conditions.
The rst shots came from the west, cracking high. The Marines took cover in ditches and in a grove of trees. Looking back toward the blazing sun, they saw no targets.
"Seven men moving to our east," 1st Sgt. David Wilson said, glassing the fields with his binoculars. "Two have AKs." Perhaps they were farmers hastening home. No order came to open fire. A teenage boy poked his head about above a canal bank 200 meters away. "He's dicking us," Joe said. "I need a slingshot to put a ball bearing in that kid's ass."
The boy popped up a few more times, ignoring the Marines waving at him to go away. Once Biggio and his civil a airs group had reached the shelter of some trees, Lt. Connor directed a squad to close on the shooters. As Sgt. Robert Kightlinger led his squad up an irrigation ditch, a few more rounds clipped overhead, and the squad went at, blindly snapping o a few rounds in response.
Kightlinger looked around. "There!" he shouted, pointing to a pu of dust from the doorway of a farmhouse 400 meters to the north across open fields.
To his left lay a tall compound wall. "Let's go," he said to me, taking a running start, grabbing the top of the wall, and vaulting over. Several Marines made it with him, while others couldn't haul themselves up with all their gear. Kightlinger didn't wait. Followed by four Marines, he ran up a faint path, intent on anking the sniper. We ran across a eld, hopped a ditch, and turned left at a long compound wall. Kightlinger slowed down to a fast walk, sweating profusely and breathing hoarsely.
"We're going to nail that fucker's ass," he muttered. Kightlinger had transferred to the infantry after completing a tour in Iraq with the motor transport section. Now he commanded a thirteenman squad, facing his rst combat. He was intense, leaving no doubt who was in charge, keeping a distance from his men and issuing crisp orders.
Reaching another open eld, he bounded across at a full run. Once on the other side, two of his men sank down and took a knee, trying to catch their breath, exhausted. Kightlinger left them and pushed on. Another wall. More running until the wall ended at a fetid, oozing stream that served as the local sewer.
Holding his M16 above his head, Kightlinger hopped into the chest-high muck and waded to the other bank. Another sloshing sprint forward, with high walls on both sides and startled women and children scurrying to hide in side passageways. Nothing moved in the elds; the farmers had hurried inside the safety of their compound walls of mud baked steel-hard.
Spotting Kightlinger peered through the telescope on his ri e. He could see the doorway where the sniper had red. Twilight was falling. He looked at his two companions-one ri eman and an unarmed journalist. He weighed the risk of running across an open eld the size of a football field to close on the house the sniper was shooting from.
"You guys ready to sprint?" he said. Wham! A large-caliber round red from the west knocked a chip of concrete o the wall next to Kightlinger, raising a cloud of dust. The crouching Marines looked back. They could see nothing in the strong red glare of the setting sun.
"Bravo 2, are you under fire?" Connor radioed. "You're too exposed. Get back here."
In the falling light, Kightlinger didn't argue. The three quickly retraced their steps through the confusing compound walls and slid back into the shit water. They waded chest-high through the muck until they reached a trail on the other side, climbed out, and trotted back to the platoon.
"Damn, Kightlinger, you stink," Connor said. Kightlinger sucked in a lungful of air and shook his head. "Fucking hard to finish a fight," he said.
Barely was the patrol back at Jakar when an Afghan soldier walked in, supporting a pasty-faced teenage boy with blood oozing from a puncture wound in his back. With his Polaroid, Biggio had taken the boy's picture earlier that afternoon. The boy had rushed home and taunted his younger brother by waving the picture in his face. The angry brother had grabbed a screwdriver and stabbed him in the back. "Afghanistan specializes in punishing good deeds," Biggio said. The battalion's doctor feared the blade had nicked the boy's gallbladder. Without surgery, peritonitis would lead to a painful death. McCollough requested a helicopter to make a ninety-mile trip. Higher headquarters refused; helicopter hours were precious and the Marines hadn't caused the injury.
"If we were back home and came across an injured hiker, we'd help him," McCollough told his staff. "Make this happen." When a resupply helicopter landed around midnight, the boy was placed on board and flown to a hospital, where he recovered.
In Afghanistan, three di erent military units were attacking the insurgency. The rst was the Special Operations Forces, the SOF, which focused on the guerrilla leaders, financiers, IED makers, and safe house operators.
The second element was airpower-B-1 bombers, F-18 ghters, helicopters, and UAVs. Added together, SOF and airpower probably accounted for over 50 percent of the insurgents killed.
The third element was the foot soldier-the grunt, including advisers. The British referred to infantry work as "framework operations." Without the grunt, no insurgency could be defeated. But it was hard, monotonous work, patrolling every day, sweltering in the summer and shivering in the winter, all the time knowing the insurgents would get off the first shots.
After eight years of war and repeated tours, ghting was a profession, not a creed, for the grunts. Unlike the Taliban, there were no statements of beliefs, ideologies, or religion. Most coalition units were partnered with Afghan soldiers. When they pulled out of Jakar, the British had left behind an advisory team to introduce the Marines to a small Afghan army contingent. The team was due to pull out in a few days.
Few scenes provided a better send-up of Hollywood than watching British Capt. Edward Brown-badly in need of a haircut, his slender runner's body clad in only sandals and spandex shorts, pointer in hand-lecturing a platoon of rapt, heavily muscled Marines about his next patrol. Brown, twenty-six, had skipped college and been commissioned when he was twenty. Although he had served on battle elds in four countries, he looked absurdly young.
"Right, mates," Brown began in an upper-class accent that clipped each syllable. "The good colonel wants us to provoke a scrap tomorrow -divert the Talibs from our upcoming operation, that sort of thing. Right. So it's on. Here's how Amber does this sort of thing …" No Marine smirked. Brown's advisory team had recorded forty kills. In a display of British understatement, the team's radio call sign was Amber-a soft, subdued background color.
"They look like roller-skaters from Venice Beach," 1st Sgt. David Wilson said, "but Amber racks up kills." Months of skirmishes had whittled the ten Brits down to sinew and skin that the sun had baked into dark tans and rich reds. Warnings of skin cancer were brushed off.
"Won't happen, mate," Lance Cpl. Ben Woodhouse said. "The sun never shines in England."
Brown's team was called an OMLT-pronounced "omlet"-or Operational Mentor and Liaison Team. Since April, the OMLT had controlled only the deserted market of Nawa. Each time the advisers patrolled with their Afghan soldiers beyond the market, the Taliban attacked them. Instead of leaving on schedule, Amber had joined forces with Battalion 1-5 at the request of Lt. Col. McCollough, who had a soft spot for all things British. His grandparents had met and married in London during World War II. His grandfather had been a member of the Horse Guards, who protect the sovereign of England.
Within a few days, the Brits and Marines were sharing rations and duties. Brown was accepted as another captain in the battalion, even if he wore shorts under the remorseless sun. Brown was on his fth command tour, which included Northern Ireland, Borneo, Belize, and Kabul. His family had been landowners and farmers in middle England for two hundred years. In keeping with that peculiar British custom, he was sent away to boarding school-called public school in England-when he was eight.
"School was good fun. I climbed trees, shot my pellet gun, ran track, did a nip of study," Brown said. "After public schools, I went straight on to Sandhurst [the British military academy], and became a lieutenant. I missed knocking about in college. I've been in more jungles than pubs. Tomorrow will be no different. Another patrol, another scrap. Come along. We'll finish before noon."
In the dim dawn light in early June of 2009, nine British advisers waited patiently while Lt. Azulu sorted out his Afghan soldiers. Knowing they'd soon be in a fight, the mood was businesslike.
"On their own, the askars will patrol only as far as the market next door," Brown said. "Afghans are good killers, not good tacticians. My lot's a bit afraid of the Taliban. They're glad the Marines have shown up."
This morning, Brown was to advise twenty askars on a short patrol from Jakar. To avoid being surrounded, he had asked Maj. Rob Gallimore to follow with a backup squad. Gallimore had come to Jakar for a short visit with Brown, who was his junior commander. A burly rugby player who had attended the prestigious London School of Economics, Gallimore came from a family of doctors. He loved the brawl, though, and had chosen to join the infantry and go to Sandhurst. Outspoken and protective of his soldiers, he was on his third six-month combat tour.
"Most of my soldiers look forward to patrols like this," Gallimore said. "But these deployments end in too many divorces. It's a new and bitter world at home. The divorced soldier doesn't know how to bond with his kids. It may sound peculiar, but it's easier being out here."
In single le, the patrol left the wire and walked across a eld into a tree line that marked the entrance to the Green Zone. In the 1950s, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers had constructed a network of dams and hundreds of miles of canals in Helmand, enabling the farmers to dig thousands of irrigation ditches to hydrate fields of melons, wheat, pomegranate, and corn.
Each farm compound was enclosed by thick mud walls. Ditches were dug to carry away the waste from the humans and the cattle and sheep were herded inside at night. Trees and shrubbery sprouted up along the ditches. As in Vietnam, the guerrillas fought from trenches concealed in the trees and slid unseen through the ditches and heavy undergrowth.
The platoon walked south at a fast clip, skirting along the edges of furrowed elds, hopping over ditches, ducking in and out of the undergrowth. They passed large mounds of wheat grain, unprotected by tarpaulins or wooden bins. The wheat was going to waste; most farmers were unwilling to hitch trailers to their tractors and drive to market ve miles away. On the far side of a canal, a man on a motorcycle with a broken muffler puttered slowly by, looking at the patrol.
"Our first dicker," Brown said to me. "He'll round up the boys to give us a welcome." Brown took watchers for granted. During his tour in Northern Ireland, he had led a platoon assigned to a watchtower. Every movement out of doors was observed and reported to the IRA. No British vehicle could visit the tower without bumping into a roadside explosive. A helicopter brought in their supplies.
The platoon crossed several more elds before emerging on a dirt path that ran alongside a deep creek and was lined with the walls of farm compounds. Occasionally an askar would speak to a farmer. It was a ritual on both sides. Seen any Talibs? No. Any strangers? A shrug.
"Another dicker at 2," Brown said. The advisers had numbered every compound on a photomap. Farmhouse 2, at the junction of a dirt road and deep canal, had been empty for several weeks. Yet a man in a brown turban was peeking at them from inside the compound wall, about 200 meters away. Twice he had popped up for a quick look.
"Leivers, shoo him off," Brown said. Slight and boyish-faced, Pvt. Matthew Leivers looked like a distracted teenager who ddled for hours with his iPod. When he red two rounds over the watcher's head, the man ducked out of sight. Leivers didn't move on. Instead, he remained sighted in on the wall.
In 2007, Leivers had spent nine weeks in a two-room concrete outpost in the north of Helmand Province, one of the dozens of platoon houses scattered like boulders to break up the insurgent onslaught. With a dozen other soldiers, Leivers awoke each morning and trotted out to a ring position inside a long trench. After breakfast, the Taliban would dart out from a nearby village and commence sniping. The desultory battle would peter out by mid-afternoon. By dusk, Leivers and his mates would be back inside their prison fort, where they would eat a packaged meal before crawling into their dirty sleeping bags. His tour in the house was forty days, followed by a week at base with showers, clean clothes, and hot food. Then it was back to the fort for another forty days. After a while, he got used to the stink, heat, cold, rain, dust, wind, cracks of the AKs, and the sharp bangs of the RPGs. He caught only tiny glimpses of the crafty Talibs. Occasionally he fired at the shoulder or the hip of a man who thought he was hidden.
Leivers was on the line for 120 days on a tour that resembled World War I rather than counterinsurgency. He rarely saw a village elder, sipped no tea, attended no shuras, won over no heart or mind. Two of the thirty-ve men in his platoon were killed. Of ten injured and evacuated, one refused to come back and three others went absent without leave.
"We absolutely resented those four," Leivers said. "They were quitters." Over the course of six months, he was fairly certain that he had shot seven Talibs. He didn't think about whether they lived or died.
Leivers kept his sights on the wall. Then the man who had been dicking the patrol popped back up, holding an AK. Perhaps he was angry that Leivers had shot over his head. Whatever his reason, it was a stupid act. Leivers put two rounds into the man's chest, who staggered back and disappeared from view (Picture 24). A few askars laughed. One or two cheered. Brown smiled. Leivers, intent on re lling his magazine, showed no emotion. A half dozen Talibs opened re from a compound a hundred meters to the south, forcing Brown's squad into a shallow irrigation canal. "Bloody hell," Brown said to me. "That dicker probably had an Icom. Can't get it now." Gallimore's squad was one farm eld behind Brown's. Gallimore, unable to raise Brown over the headset, poked his head around a wall just as an RPG exploded. He hesitated a few seconds, then shouted at his squad and raced forward. He hadn't run twenty meters before the snap of bullets persuaded him to leap into the canal, where he waded forward until he found Brown. The Afghans followed right behind, and in a few seconds the ditch was crowded with a dozen bodies.
"Spread out!" Gallimore yelled. "Shalah-watch our right ank!" Sgt. Maj. Shalah, who hadn't shaved in a week and wore a nondescript uniform, was the calm Afghan commander. As he tried to push his troops up the canal, re picked up from his left ank, green tracers arcing in and red tracers streaking out. Some askars opped down along the canal bank and returned re with scant aim, while others clustered about, awaiting orders.
"Shalah," Gallimore shouted angrily, pointing to the west, "get your men over there!" Shalah nodded and pushed his soldiers forward, while a few refused to budge until they had red their RPG rounds, each giving o a resounding blast and swirl of dense dust that attracted more AK fire.
"Get the hell out of here with that RPG!" Gallimore bellowed. "Guard the flank! The flank!" The Taliban tactic was simple: Shoot from straight ahead to pin askars down, while other Talibs ran around the ank to shoot from the rear. Sure enough, minutes later a few rounds snapped by us from the right, persuading the RPG crew to follow Shalah and refuse their right flank.
Brown spread out Leivers and the other British troops to provide return fire and splashed down the canal to join Gallimore. "Bit of a cluster fuck," he shouted to me over the din. It wasn't clear whether he was referring to Shalah for the raggedy response of his askars or to Gallimore for having taken command.
"I'll handle our front," Gallimore said. "You take care of the right flank." Soaking wet, Brown sloshed back up the canal to the right, while Gallimore radioed to battalion. "We're in contact with a dozen Talibs," he shouted into the handset. "They're in Compounds 1 and 2, and I think in Compound 12 to the west."
An RPG burst just behind the patrol, followed by machine gun re. The men opped down (Picture 25). Gallimore crawled forward for a better look just as a Talib popped up fty meters to his front and launched a snapshot with a second RPG. The rocket sped toward us, a dead-on shot. No time to duck. One hundred shards of molten iron about to burst. As the rocket tore through the foliage in front of us, one of its ns scraped against a branch. The rocket careened skyward, a streaking black object that quickly lost momentum, stalled out at apogee, and plummeted down, exploding harmlessly in an open field. Robust Rob Gallimore sat quietly as a few bright green leaves fluttered down.
The back-blast from the RPG had raised a burst of dust, drawing a fusillade from the British soldiers along the canal bank. When Gallimore again glanced to his front, the RPG gunner lay crumbled on the ground, looking like a sack of discarded clothes.
"Cheeky bastard!" Gallimore yelled, gathering himself. "Sergeant Bartczak, what's on station?" Out of direct re a few meters away, Bartczak was hunched over a bulky radio. A member of the Marine 1st Anglico Company, he and Pfc. Khanh Le were assigned to the British team. They loved their assignment. They were on their own, with B-1s, B-52s, F-18s, and all the other birds of war at their beck and call.
"Two Cobras on station," Sgt. Bartczak shouted back. "Have them strafe Compounds 1 and 2," Gallimore yelled. "Careful to the right. We have a squad out there somewhere." A few minutes later, as the clatter of helicopter blades became distinct, the AK re dropped o , soon replaced by the chainsaw grinding sound of the Cobra 30mm guns.
"The pilots are firing at three they saw leaving Compound 1," Bartczak yelled to Gallimore. Brown splashed back down the creek. "The askars have burned through four clips each," Brown said to me. "Best pull back while air's on station."
The Afghan soldiers had gone out on patrol with six magazines, each holding thirty rounds. In the typical forty-ve-minute ght, they had red too exuberantly. Heavily armed and clad in helmets and armored vests, they couldn't match the mobility and maneuver of the Taliban. The enemy had not backed off; instead, they were darting around the tree lines, looking for an opening.
To the west of Gallimore and Brown, Sgt. Maj. Robert Gardner's squad was pulling back in a running gun battle. Then several white phosphorus rounds burst amidst a thatch of dry poppy stalks, erupting into a sheet of ame between Gardner and the insurgents harrying his flank.
"I set fire to the field to give us smoke," Gardner radioed Gallimore. "We're coming in now."
The soldiers trotted quickly back down the path next to the canal line, not stopping until they were deep within a thick tree line. No one was injured seriously, only a few scrapes and bruises.
The Afghan and British leaders clustered around Shamy, a slight, wide-eyed Afghan terp. Shamy was listening to a handheld Taliban radio captured in a recent ambush.
"The Talib commander," Shamy said, "he send men back to get four bodies." Leivers had killed a dicker, and the RPG gunner who had red at Gallimore had gone down hard, thoroughly riddled. The Cobras had red on three others, and the sergeant major was certain his squad had hit two.
When he arrived back at Jakar, Gallimore reported in the same sentence the burning of a eld and the deaths of four or more Taliban. Like all infantry, 4-4 Amber liked a one-sided scrap. Grunts don't think of the enemy as human. It makes no di erence if the grunt is Afghan, British, Pakistani, American, or Chinese. In battle, some become enraged when they see the blood of their comrades. Practically none picture an enemy as having a family, or laughing, or stretching a helping hand toward someone. You rarely see a live enemy, and in those few seconds you are trying to kill him. The chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Adm. Michael Mullen, was fond of saying "we can't kill our way to victory." 
2
When generals bemoaned killing, they were trying to make themselves seem morally and intellectually enlightened, while indicating their shallow understanding of what their own grunts were doing day after day. Shalah led his thirty askars back to their barracks. The Afghan soldiers lived in the schoolhouse, bought their food in the local market, and attended to their administrative duties by themselves. Their senior o cer at-out avoided combat, so they relied on Brown and Gallimore to assign combat duties.
The British advisers went their separate way back to their rooms inside Jakar's half-nished concrete house. There they stripped o their sopping gear, cleaned their weapons, and washed down under a hose connected to a water barrel on the roof. The British army had no school for advisers, assuming instead that any qualified infantry could advise. After all, they had two centuries of experience in Afghanistan.
That experience cut two ways, though. The Brits carried the baggage of having fought two wars against the Pashtuns, whose oral traditions condensed decades and complexities into a simple tale of two parts. First, the Brits had invaded Helmand and were soundly defeated in 1880 at Maiwand. Second, they had returned in 2005 and applied heavy repower that was bitterly resented. In 2007, besieged at a town called Musa Qala, the British had cut an unfortunate deal to pull out. Later, the town had to be retaken from the Taliban, leading to rumors about serpentine British motives. Many locals resented the British and circulated derogatory gossip. As a result, the British carried a heavy political as well as military load in Helmand.
"I was in Helmand in '07," Gallimore said. "We didn't have many men, so in the ghts we called in too much air. That tainted us. The U.S. Marines are a welcome addition. We both like to ght, and now neither of us will have to use heavy repower. In the U.S., the military is admired. In the U.K., we get sympathy-the 'poor you' treatment. Our press portrays us as puppets ghting America's war. Rubbish. We British are fighters and proud of it."
During the re ghts at Jakar, the Brits as advisers had acted as the key shooters and the commanders. That was the case also in many U.S. units. The word "partner" was used in a universal sense to indicate that coalition and Afghan soldiers worked together. In practice there were a hundred variations of partnering. A habit takes about twelve weeks to set in. After three or four months, the tactical habits of askars improved simply by moving with American soldiers in the field. When the Taliban engaged, the Americans took the lead.
Placing the askars in the lead meant counseling and coaching the Afghan o cers. This was a job for a professional adviser who was tactically sound, brave, tactful, patient, and skilled in communicating. Finding all those characteristics in warriors who are Type A personalities is tough. The Army and Marine Special Forces were by far the best advisers, but there were few of them. The Army Special Forces course was twenty-four months and the Marine fourteen months. The acceptance rate into both forces was low.
Thus the British, the Marines, and the Army all tapped soldiers like Gallimore and Brown and said, "For the next several months, you are advisers. Go forth and do a good job." Depending more upon personality than anything else, some did a better job than others. The fundamental aw lay deeper. Success in combat depends more upon leadership than any other factor. And the coalition had conceded any institutional role in selecting or removing Afghan military leaders when it gave total sovereignty to Hamid Karzai and his government in 2002.
In the afternoon, the half-built brick building called Jakar came under machine gun re from a cluster of homes to the southwest. As the Marines scattered to their posts, a British soldier ran to the roof and began firing. McCollough raced up the half-finished stairs after him.
"Hey," he yelled over the banging of the gun, "Cease fire! Cease fire! Do you have a clear target?" "No, sir." "I didn't think so," McCollough said. "Knock it off! There are civilians out there. Don't be so damn stupid."
In seconds, McCollough's anger subsided and he was again the calm, reserved lieutenant colonel, walking back to his cramped operations center (Picture 25), thinking about something else. The Brits were as much his soldiers as were the Marines.
Later, I asked British Sgt. Maj. Robert Gardner and Marine Sgt. Maj. Tom Sowers to talk about their troops. "I'll tell you this," Gardner said. "Four-Four Amber wants to stay with the Marines for the rest of their tour-provided we're allowed our sunbathing."
The request wasn't a matter of comfort; everyone was sleeping in the dirt. It was testament to the bonds at the ghting level, and to the re support the Marines had on hand. At the national level, it re ected poorly upon the British politicians who were cutting their admirable military to the bone.
"Glad to have you," Marine Sgt. Maj. Sowers said. They compared notes. "The lads have no discipline when they arrive at the training depot," Gardner said. "They don't like to accept blame." "They do question authority more than we did," Sowers said. "Once out here, though, they come around, though." "Absolutely," Gardner said. "Everyone knows his job, and there's no fuss. That's why my lads want to stay with you Marines here at Jakar." "You mean you want to avoid your own bureaucracy." Sowers laughed. "Fair point," Gardner said. "This is real soldiering. We're not defending. Colonel McCollough sends us out every day. Plus, the soldiers have gotten to know me. I'm not just the sergeant major in some remote office. I counsel them about things they'd never bring to the officers." "I have to say my Marines are well paid," Sowers said. "We give financial classes on how to manage money, and not spend it all." "That's a big di erence between us. My lads aren't paid enough and credit's too easy," Gardner said. "They get in debt. When a wife has trouble paying the bills back on the patch [family housing on base], it a ects a soldier's performance out here. It's my worst problem. I'm afraid our politicians don't understand that a soldier must be paid. Can we swap?" "How do you rate the Afghan army?" "No consistency. Good and bad, all mixed in," Gardner replied. "Same for their o cers. Some were appointed due to tribal connections or because they fought against the Russians. This particular company commander won't go on patrol. Says he's too old to get killed. If he retires, he gets no pension. So he's retired in place. The system is clogged. The askars get along with the people, but they won't do much if we didn't kick them in the arse. Most are from the north and don't speak Pashto."
The sergeant major had identi ed the crux of the problem. The British and Marines were professionals; the Taliban were ideologues. The Afghan army was neither. It was not professional, and thus able to prevail by superior skill. And it was not ideological, and thus able to prevail by dedication to cause.
The next afternoon, 4-4 Amber led a patrol north. Brown left the wire about three, when the sun had lost a bit of its sear. After twisting for several kilometers through farm fields and ditches, the askars suddenly stiffened, a sign that dushmen (enemy) were near.
Lance Cpl. Ben Woodhouse was at point. A veteran of hard ghting in 2007, Woody liked the action and took too many chances. Rushing into the courtyard of a large farmhouse, he grabbed a rickety ladder and climbed onto the roof for a better look. Leivers followed after him.
Crack! Crack! AK rounds passed between the two. Both knelt to return re. Down in the courtyard, Sgt. Scott Roxborough looked up in anger. A large man with a ready quip, he had a no-nonsense approach to soldiering.
"Get off that roof!" Roxy screamed. "You're not fucking bulletproof!" Woody rolled o , grabbing a drainpipe to break his fall. As Leivers scrambled down the ladder, a round snapped by his head and he tumbled o in a heap, dodging past the irate sergeant. When a large, snarling farm dog lunged forward, an askar pumped three bullets into its side.
"Up the ditch!" Brown shouted, hopping into a deep, weed-clogged drainage ditch that led toward the enemy shooting from the next farm. It was the smart tactical route, safe from en lade re. The Marine air controllers plunged in after him, but not the askars. They avoided the squalid water with its venomous tiny chiggers, preferring the risk of bullets to intestinal disease. Seeing the Afghans hadn't followed his plunge, Brown turned to the sopping Marines.
"Bring in the Cobras, boys!"
On their own, the British advisory teams were limited. They had no Quick Reaction Forces standing by, no helicopter evacuation of casualties, and no fire support. Battalion 1-5 provided those capabilities. Brown was delighted to have an air control team. No need to hu and pu over 200 meters of furrowed elds under constant re. Inside ten minutes, two Cobras were raking the tree line to the front, while radioing Brown that three men were running to the west.
As the patrol prepared to pursue, Brown noticed a small boy bent over the dead dog. Brown asked the farmer how much a puppy would cost. I'll give the boy $10. The dog cost $200, the farmer said.
"Bloody hell," Brown said. "We're not wealthy Americans, chum. Twenty dollars, and you sign for it." Although he was a captain and a graduate of Sandhurst, Brown had to provide a receipt for every expense over $10. Farm dogs were a constant menace, settled with a low payment; a dead cow cost $200, a written explanation to headquarters, and no free steaks.
After the farmer's wife grabbed the money and ran back inside, 4-4 Amber struck out to the west, soon closing on a small farm tucked beneath a high bank next to an irrigation canal. Empty AK cartridges were scattered on the bank. Several camels milled around inside the compound. The askars rushed inside and dragged out a farmer amidst the shrieks of women and children. The frightened farmer pointed to a thick copse of trees on the far side of the canal. Dushmen! Dushmen!
The askars had the wind up, as if they could smell their enemy. They wanted to charge ahead. Brown knew they would all rush to the nearest footbridge, rather than wade across.
"Not worth the risk," Brown said to me. "I'll lose an askar if there's a bomb on that bridge. We're not crossing that canal. Let's go back to Jakar."
HOW TO CLEAR A DISTRICT Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson arrived by helicopter at Jakar after dark on July 1, 2009. A commander intolerant of pretense, on his rst tour in Fallujah in 2004, an enemy rocket had plunged through the tiny window in his o ce, killing the popular Maj. Kevin Shea and severing Nicholson's neck muscles. Tourniquets and rapid transfusions saved his life. In 2006 he returned to command the regiment in the Fallujah area, gaining control of the city from al Qaeda. Informed that he was taking a brigade of 8,000 Marines into Helmand, he acquired the nickname The Poacher by wrestling with a dozen commands to recruit those who had served in battle with him before.
At Jakar, Nicholson pulled the commanders and advisers into the broom closet that served as McCollough's sti ing sleeping quarters. Under a ickering candle, he laid it out for them. Operation River Liberty-4,000 Marines and fewer than 400 askars-would begin in a few hours.
"Our mission is to clear and hold the districts," he said. "Until we get more Afghan soldiers, you're the homesteaders. You'll spread out, set up outposts, hold shuras, and drink green tea and bottled water that's as warm as piss. You'll run every fucker who shoots at you out of the district. You'll love it."
Patrolling demonstrates dominance. A patrol is an a ront that challenges the manhood of the local insurgents, who will strike back. To respond with only IEDs indicates that the local gang is small and weak, or that outsiders are setting the bombs and driving away. In contrast, a local gang feels compelled to shoot at a patrol. It seems silly, a testosterone thing, but it happens time and again. It makes no di erence whether you are in Vietnam in 1965, or Iraq in 2005, or Afghanistan in 2009; patrols will be red upon if local insurgents believe they are stronger.
There is only one way for American troops to clear insurgents from a district: patrol alongside Afghan soldiers until they're exhausted, and then patrol some more. One of two outcomes follows. Either the patrols persist until the insurgent shooters are killed or forced to flee. Or the patrols cease going to those areas where they are persistently shot at. Every coalition battalion could point out areas where they would be shot at. Those were the areas some battalions avoided and others attacked.
After Nicholson left, the captains reviewed their plans.
"I can't believe your brigadier," Brown said. "He talks like we're all equals, including us Brits. He even knew my name." "You're a bullet magnet," McCollough said. "Makes life safer for the rest of us. Get back to work." At four in the morning, Brown, six Brits, and two Marines were waiting in the dark outside the Afghan barracks. Several askars were pestering Sgt. Roxborough for water, armor, and socks.
"The Afghans are picking up bad habits," Roxy said. "We give them something, and they act like we owe it to them."
The Afghans enforced their own rules of conduct. After an askar named Tala, who wore a oppy bush hat, stole candy bars from the advisers, Lt. Azulu had forced him to crawl on his hands and knees across the compound. That put an end to stealing, although Tala responded sullenly after that to the advisers. Most of the askars, though, obeyed what Brown said because no soldier had been killed when Brown was at the lead.
Roxborough, who had served in Belize, Kenya, Botswana, and South Africa, was on his second tour in Afghanistan. While waiting for the Afghans to muster, he slid off to the side to call home on a satellite phone; each soldier was authorized one call a week. "Hello, darling," he said. "I'm a bit rushed. We're kicking off an op and the fucking askars are gobbing off." Silence for a moment. "Sorry, love. Yes … quite right." A few minutes later, Roxy rejoined the group. "The missus gave me hell," he said. "Chewed my ass, she did. I never say 'fuck' at home. Said she wasn't one of my mates. You fuckers are a bad influence. If the askars are ready, let's get going."
As a slight dawn light washed over the farmlands, twenty Afghan soldiers left the wire with 4-4 Amber. After ghting and sweating together for three months, the askars from 3rd Company, 6th Battalion, 205th Brigade were a salty, cocky group. Though brash, they weren't skilled. They bunched up at the wrong times, argued with their lieutenants in the midst of a re ght, expended too much ammunition, and red without aiming. For fear of friendly casualties, Brown dared not integrate them yet with the Marines. So McCollough assigned them a separate sector for Operation River Liberty.
While the Marines were landing in helicopter zones, Brown was walking up a canal road in the early light. The soldiers momentarily stopped when they heard a sharp Bang! of an IED. Pushing forward a few hundred meters, they passed the hulk of a large armored vehicle with its front tires blown off and the engine crushed in (Picture 26). The driver was sitting in the dirt, gulping water and repeating his tale.
"There was this big white light," he said. "I was sucked half out the windshield. I thought a terrorist had grabbed me. I was scared shitless." Brown walked around the vehicle, scuffing at the ground. "Get back!" he yelled, pointing to a red wire. As engineers moved up to disarm the second bomb, Brown hastily led his men away in a long single le that snaked back and forth across the road as the soldiers guessed which side was less likely to hold the next bomb. IEDs accounted for 65 percent of all coalition casualties in Afghanistan. Nothing sapped morale more than being hit and not being able to strike back.
"Bit of a shock," Brown said to me, "seeing a big vehicle ripped apart like that. Had the other bomb gone o , we'd be picking metal out of our teeth."
Once Brown turned o the road and struck out over the elds, the askars relaxed and moved at a fast clip. On their anks, the Marine platoons were searching each compound. The askars, however, ignored most farms, poking cursorily around only a few. How they decided where to look for dushmen was a mystery to Brown, but he trusted their instincts. After a hasty search of one compound, the askars emerged with a long-barreled bolt-action rifle.
"It's a bloody .303, circa 1890," Brown said, stroking the faded wooden stock. "Hasn't been red in a century. Probably taken o the body of a distant relation of mine. Give it back." By eight in the morning, Brown's unit was two kilometers in front of the nearest Marine platoon when the askars began shouting and pointing. Two farmers had strolled out of a distant compound and were casually starting up a tractor for a day of plowing, ignoring the soldiers.
"Dushmen," Lt. Azulu said, pointing at the compound. Nine out of ten times Afghan soldiers sensed the enemy presence before coalition soldiers did. "What's the Icom chatter, Shamy?" Brown asked the interpreter. Shamy was listening intently to a handheld radio. Knowing their chats were intercepted, the Taliban employed verbal ruses, taunts, and code words.
"Usual bullshit, sir," Shamy said. "They brag they're going to kick our asses. They say the flowers are in bloom." "Probably means they're falling back," Brown said. He called Woody over. "Right," he said, "I'll take the main body and act as if we're going straight ahead. Woody, you take a few men and cut across to that compound. The dushmen are probably on the other side."
While the platoon watched with ri es at the ready, Woody and several others sprinted a hundred meters straight across the eld and disappeared inside the compound wall. For about thirty seconds there was silence. No shots, but the two farmers were crouching on the far side of the tractor.
"Woody!" Brown shouted into his voice mike. "You're giving me the jitters. Speak up!" Once inside the outer wall, Woody had discovered not one but three compounds. He was standing on a well-worn trail surrounded by thick walls and narrow passageways, deciding which farm to search rst. Hearing a dim squawk in his headphone, Woody turned around to get better reception.
"Watch out!" Lance Cpl. Ashley Edwards yelled. Woody whirled back around to see two men dressed in black darting around a corner, not twenty feet away. He ran after them, turned the corner, and emerged on a wide trail bordering a canal on his left. The men were running across a narrow footbridge, the one in front carrying an RPG. The man in the rear fired his AK on full automatic. Woody fired his assault rifle from the hip. Both missed.
Across the field, Brown heard the explosion of bullets. "Bloody hell!" he shouted. "Get up there!" The platoon broke across the eld at a quick trot, equipment jangling, dust rising from the furrows, no yelling, no shooting, each man focused on getting across the open as fast as possible. No one could keep up with Brown. A seasoned cross-country runner, Brown knew how to balance his gear to keep a long, steady stride. He sprinted along the trail until he reached a disgusted Woody, who was staring at a tree line on the far side of the canal.
"Twenty feet!" Woody vented. "Twenty feet away and I missed." "So did they," Brown said.
A few rounds from the tree line cracked by as the platoon gathered around, unsure what to do next. Eddie warily eyed the footbridge. "It's a natural spot to place a command-detonated bomb," he said.
A few more AK rounds cracked by, joined by a PKM machine gun that sounded like a hammer striking metal. Most of the platoon opped down in a ditch or vaulted a waist-high wall and crouched down. A few Afghans defiantly strolled around.
"Foolish fuckers," Roxy muttered. Tala, his bush hat at a jaunty angle, made a show of walking in front of Roxy. A second later, a burst from a PKM stitched the ground and a startled Tala made a sprawling dive into the ditch.
"Serves you right," Roxy yelled. An RPG sailed in and smacked against the wall on the far side of the courtyard, a red flash that kicked up a black swirl of dust, followed by the smoke from burning grass and small bushes. Everyone opped down. Some lay on the inside of the canal bank and others huddled with Brown behind the low courtyard wall.
Several Afghan soldiers were shooting, the barrels of their M16s pointed skyward as they pulled triggers without raising their heads above the wall. One after the other, the Brits stood up at different spots, braced their chests against the wall, sighted in on the tree line through their telescopic sights, and fired three-round bursts.
The enemy PKM machine gun answered every third or fourth burst. When two rounds barely missed Woody's head and smacked into the house behind him, Kuba-a Tajik with the exaggerated macho swagger of Sylvester Stallone (Picture 27)-rammed a rocket into his RPG launcher, elevated it slightly, and pulled the trigger. The back-blast pelted the house with rock chips and deafened everyone behind the wall.
"Rambo!" Brown shouted. "No more. No more!" He pointed at the two Marines sitting with their backs against the wall. "Sergeant Bartczak, get air on that tree line," Brown said. "Don't hit the compound. Don't know if there's civvies inside." Once Pfc. Le set up the heavy radio, Bartczak picked up the handset to call in two Cobras hovering several miles to the south. A few feet away, Pvt. Salaman plopped the bipod of his PKM on top of the wall and red a few rounds before the gun jammed. Not bothering to duck down, he furiously worked the bolt back and forth until a high-powered round from an enemy sniper clipped a tree branch near his elbow. Instead of seeking cover, Salaman laughed and waved the branch above his head, goading the sniper. The Brits shook their heads.
"Stop the fucking foolishness," Roxy yelled.
The enemy machine gun and a few AKs persisted in ring from a long tree line set back a few hundred meters from the canal. The dushmen were clever, shooting and scurrying away to pop up at di erent spots. To the left of the tree line were a small, yellow-colored mosque and a large, square brick building, with AK fire coming from the east end.
"I see one over here," Cpl. Gareth Robson yelled from a side wall. Le ran over and peered through his M4 scope at a man dressed in black who was running bent over to the west end of the building, presenting an easy target.
" The conversation was bizarre. Amidst bullets crackling and RPGs exploding, the Brits and Marines were discussing legalities. They understood that a civilian casualty would lead to an investigation and perhaps a court-martial. They were also deciding between life and death. In Iraq, I had seen a car crammed with civilians turn toward a tank in the midst of a battle. Fearing a suicide bomber, the tank gunner had red. I had watched a bus drive in front of a shocked platoon engaged in a re ght. The driver thought soldiers could distinguish between civilians and enemy dressed in civilian clothes. He didn't grasp that a nineteen-year-old was itching to shoot his ri e, or that swaths of lacerating re were sprayed blindly. Civilians didn't know when to get out of the rain. The man could be hauling ammo, or he could be a farmer, dumb as nails. They decided not to shoot him.
The platoon had an excellent defensive position inside the compound walls. To assault the Taliban, though, they had to run in single le across a log bridge that might be mined. Neither side tried to close on the other. The ght was a stando , a thousand bullets exchanged with no apparent damage.
The volume of ring ebbed and owed. The shooting would die down, and then for some unknown reason one side or the other would start up again. A cell phone jingled inside the farmhouse, and a few minutes later the farmer left with his family by the back gate.
"Either his neighbors or the Taliban told him to get out," Brown said. "It's good he's leaving. No worries now about families." A rocket-propelled grenade sailed over the farmhouse and exploded in a corn eld. Woody scrambled onto the roof to take a look around and was quickly driven o by AK re. Everyone crouched behind the thick compound walls when the two Cobras swept in from the east. Sgt. Bartczak cleared them for a gun run, avoiding the mosque. The enemy fire dribbled off when the gunships began hammering away.
Bartczak and Le were happy. Here they were, far removed from their rst sergeant and routine duties, attached to Amber-the team with the red-hot contact rate-and entrusted with directing aircraft worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
"We volunteered to work for the Brits," Bartczak said. "This is shit hot." When the helicopters left, the Brits set up defenses while the askars scattered to claim the best rooms to avoid the scorching sun. By ten in the morning, the temperature had reached 112 degrees. Fighting wouldn't resume until late afternoon.
To check for any de les leading to the farmhouse, Brown took a walk around the outside of the compound, his boots crunching over dried poppy stalks. In May, thousands of men had converged on Helmand for the poppy harvest season, when wages rose from $5 to $15 a day. Each of the millions of purple bulbs was sliced by hand to allow the sap to spill out into the scorching sunlight that burned it black. Once the sap had hardened, the farmers collected each dollop on the outside of each bulb. Wrapped in burlap, wet opium could be stored for a year. It was common for farmers to take a thousand dollars for half their stash when the Taliban or drug dealers came calling, and bury the other half, betting that the futures market would rise.
"The farmers are rich enough to own motorcycles, tractors, and cell phones," Brown said. "They're the dickers who warn the Taliban. To us, it's war. To them, it's business."
Around noon, a motorcycle puttered by the compound on the far side of the canal. A few askars searching for watermelons popped out of a ditch and motioned the driver to accompany them back to the compound. The neatly dressed driver calmly explained that he was visiting relatives. When he couldn't give their names, the askars dragged him into a side room, muttering "Khatawat" (liar).
"Whoa! Whoa!" Roxy yelled. "No rough stu . We have a journalist here. Woody, don't let him out of your sight. And for God's sake, don't kill him."
Rules governing the conduct of Western nations in dealing with insurgencies have changed dramatically over time. 
1
To be sure, enlightened counterinsurgents forbade actions that would cause the population to give more aid to the guerrillas. There were limits to such forbearance, however, and Western armies generally employed a combination of carrots and sticks, some of which were quite severe. Throughout the 1800s, the U.S. government dealt with the Indians using deportation and reservations (which during the Boer War were called concentration camps).

In Malaya in the 1950s, the British high commissioner, Gerald Templer, applied carrots and sticks to quell the insurgency of the local Chinese. The Chinese farmers were forced into guarded villages where food was strictly rationed. At the same time, to gain "hearts and minds," he o ered the 2 million ethnic Malays freedom from the United Kingdom, while o ering the million Chinese citizenship under Malayan rule.

Afghanistan was singularly di erent from any prior insurgency. Far from employing sticks of coercion of any sort, the Western coalition o ered only aid and sympathy to hostile villagers. The United States possessed precision repower, with sensors that tracked any individual out of doors. Yet in 2010, less than 5 percent of aircraft sorties dropped a single bomb, despite over one hundred reports of troops in contact daily. This forbearance was without historical precedent. The coalition imposed upon itself the strictest rules in the history of insurgent warfare.
However, coalition and Afghan rules covering crime and punishment lacked purpose, consistency, and reliability. A few kilometers south of Jakar, an eleven-year-old boy often waved at passing patrols. The Marines took to chatting with the boy, who pointed out a trail the Taliban occasionally used. A few weeks later, the Taliban executed him and his brothers, sisters, mother, and father. Although shocked neighbors knew the identities of the gang that had gone to the farm in the middle of the day, no one would testify.
The tragedy illustrated a disquieting truth: American military doctrine didn't know how to confront evil. On the one hand, the Taliban were portrayed as extremists who stoned women to death, burned schools, and whipped men. On the other hand, the generals indicated that most Taliban were misguided youths.
"In the Taliban ranks," Gen. McChrystal said, "there's a tremendous number of ghters and commanders who would like to come back in." 
12
Worse, Afghans as a society denied that fellow Afghans were capable of evil. The locals knew the killers. But there was no penalty for murder if committed in the name of Islam.
Afghan newspaper articles, for instance, claimed that south of Jakar the Marines were burning Korans. Actually, the Marines had found burned Korans scattered close to coalition outposts. Claiming an obvious setup, the Marines ew in a panel of mullahs from Kabul. After examining the evidence and hearing from witnesses, the mullahs exonerated the Americans and instead blamed Pakistani agents. No mullah could acknowledge that local Islamists had committed a sacrilege. In keeping with Afghan ction, the Taliban were not mentioned publicly. So any atrocity had to be the fault of the Pakistanis or the Western coalition.
In theory, the U.S. military claimed that "rule of law" was a guiding principle in combating any insurgency. In practice, the U.S. military applied no systemic rules of law. Nor did the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan.
After Roxborough had yelled at the askars, he grabbed hold of the detainee and dragged him into the courtyard. Afghan Pvt. Salaman roughly tied him up and stood guard to await a Hilux that would take him to the rear, where the National Directorate of Security-equivalent to a combination of the CIA and state police-would interrogate him.
"Brazen bugger," Brown said. "Drives by to dicker us without a decent cover story. His daddy's probably a tribal chief."
The heat brought an end to the ght; the Taliban had wandered away to seek shelter. As armies had done for thousands of years, the askars took over the farm, dragging out sleeping mats and rugs to lie down on, washing at the well by hand pump, grabbing bunches of white grapes and hacking open watermelons. In a shed they found the farmer's stash of porn, which they gleefully passed around. Otherwise, they left the farmer's possessions alone. Most askars dozed on the rugs in the shade, while a few sneaked off to smoke hash.
"Bloody hell," Woody said, "the room next to the stable smells like a marijuana eld. I've never seen the likes. They fucky-fucky under the blankets at night and smoke hash in the day."
"No teryak," Lt. Azulu said, referring to opium. "Tshar" (hash). "Azulu, hash is a high," Brown said. "We've been over this. Control your men, or I'm going to empty every rucksack here on the ground." "Teryak very bad," Shamy the interpreter intervened. "Hash okay." "No, hash is not fucking okay," Roxy said. "And you're a terp, Shamy, not a malek. You're not a leader. So shut the fuck up." At twenty-one, Shamy had the mannerisms of a pesky but precocious eighth-grader. He had painstakingly taught himself English and came from a middle-class family that believed he was working for an Indian cell phone company. Like most interpreters, he showed more loyalty to the coalition soldiers than to the askars, who considered him spoiled and overpaid.
The askars had a high opinion of themselves. But Brown wondered whether deep in their hearts they weren't afraid of the Taliban. It had taken weeks for him to coax one patrol a day out of a sixty-man company. Once on patrol, the same pattern emerged. The unit pressed forward at whatever pace Brown set. Sooner or later, the askars stiffened and unstrapped their weapons, pointing and gesturing.
"Superb bird dogs," Brown said. The Brits had their own adviser leadership style, moving to the fore at the start of any re ght and shouting at the askars to spread out as rounds snapped in. Brown's rst order was for the askars to cover the angles so that dushmen could not sneak up on their anks. Soon everyone would be blazing away. The Brits applied aimed re, while the askars happily ripped through magazines, some taking aim and others shooting blindly. The Taliban responded with equally wild fire, dashing quickly from one spot to another.
After studying his map, Brown would shout to his Marine team to call in air. The Afghan lieutenants couldn't read maps, and weren't permitted to call for indirect res. They followed Brown's orders until the fracas died down. The Afghan lieutenants then assumed command of their men. Afghan o cers were strict at times, but generally let the soldiers display individual stubbornness or independence. The askars were opinionated, tough, illiterate, emotional, and loyal.
Inside the compound, the askars couldn't smoke their hash under the watchful eyes of the Brits. So they dozed on rugs in the shade, brewing tea and chatting occasionally as the hours slipped by. The advisers stood o to one side, organizing the night watch and redistributing the ammo. No one suggested leaving, or allowing the farmer and his family to return. "This is routine," Brown said to me. "The askars say they're fighting for the farmers, who can at least give them a place to rest." Out in the elds, the exhausted Marines were still plodding from compound to compound. Finally, done in under their ninety-pound packs, they opped down along the tree line and munched on MREs and tepid bottled water, leaving untouched the melons and grapes. The villagers had turned down their requests to rent compounds for the night. So they scooped out shallow holes that looked like graves and lay down with scant shade, keeping their armor on (Picture 28).
Azulu was willing to throw out a few farmers so the Marines could rest inside compounds. Brown told him to stay put, knowing the Marines would refuse. In the corner of their compound, the Brits and Afghans had a well with cool water. By sunset, everyone had rinsed the dirt and sweat o his face and chest and was feeling refreshed (Picture 29). The askars cooked their rice, which they preferred to MREs. After much haggling, they bought a chicken from a farm boy for $6 and cut half its neck, laughing as the chicken ran around spurting blood.
"You fucking do that again," Roxy yelled, "and I'll break your heads." Surly at being upbraided, the askars glared at the advisers. Azulu complained to Brown that Roxy, as a sergeant, shouldn't yell at his men. "Roxy is right, Azulu," Brown said, "and you know it." One askar demanded $10 from me as I pumped water from the well. When I ignored him, he blocked my way, holding his ri e in front of his chest. He had punched holes in a pair of black socks that he wore on his forearms as protection against a hot ri e barrel. When I pushed against the socks and he stumbled out of my way, the other soldiers laughed at him.
"That askar will brood like a thirteen-year-old," Brown said. "They try to take advantage, because their lieutenants aren't consistent. One minute they're buddies with their soldiers, and the next they put the boot to them." Demanding money and resources was a habit. The military was the cleanest Afghan institution, yet each rank took from those below them. Uniform standards, particularly in selecting leaders, were lacking in the Afghan army and police. The system lacked a uniform set of rewards and penalties. The Afghan security system paid low wages, a trivial pension, and poor care of the families of those who were killed or severely wounded. There was no incentive to run risks today in order to be rewarded later. Some incompetent o cers were promoted due to tribal connections or payo s, while others were selected based on proven courage and leadership. In contrast, the Taliban relieved leaders who performed poorly, and usually promoted replacements from within the same group to retain cohesion.
The coalition had done a good job in training the Western soldiers to be sensitive to the Afghan culture in terms of respecting elders, avoiding all contact with women, acting in a polite manner, and the rest. But the coalition couldn't correct the culture inside the Afghan security forces. 
13
The West had maintained military superiority for two millennia. The British and American militaries had strict standards of accountability formed over centuries. If a leader stole, lied, indulged in favoritism, or shirked, the group solidi ed against him. Some Afghan leaders admired these intangibles of fairness, initiative, and duty. Too many Afghans, though, tolerated the intangibles simply to gain the tangibles of re support and materials. Because the coalition lacked a standard means of in uencing Afghan promotions and command assignments, one unit performed well, while the next did not.
At four in the morning, the men arose, pissed, slapped water on their faces, gobbled down chunks of at bread, and put on their gear. By dawn, 4-4 Amber was cutting east to join up with the Marines. Each askar and adviser carried only a small rucksack, plus armor and weapons, about thirty-ve pounds per man. Brown had a maddening habit of bounding ahead at a cross-country gait, looking like he was out for a morning's jaunt around his family's country estate.
But the men were fresh and quickly reached the Marine lines, where they entered a di erent world. Lt. Col. McCollough had dropped his four companies into landing zones ve miles apart. They were to patrol until they found a spot to set up a base camp where they would stay for months.
Carrying all their gear on their backs, the Marines were exhausted. Powerful young men staggered forward at a creeping pace, their cammies streaked white with baked sweat.
"Pity the dushmen when these poor bastards get to them," Brown murmured. The Marines cast envious glances at the lightly equipped advisers. "This will even things up," Sgt. Bill Cahir said as I snapped a picture of him leading a donkey. I had known Cahir when he was a journalist in Washington. His wife was expecting twin girls, and at thirty-nine he was the oldest Marine in the company. So he took a lot of kidding about being a family man too old for combat.
Cahir had rented the donkey for $60. We watched as he lashed his gear to the donkey (Picture 30). The beast responded by kicking up its heels, spilling the load. Bill tried again, with the same result. He then turned back to the farmer.
"That donkey won't carry anything," he said. "That's why I rented him," the farmer replied. Cahir's good-natured acceptance of the trickery thawed relations with the villagers. Soon Cahir was bombarded with demands that he arrest the police. The complaints had the small details of truth. They took my tractor and gave me only $15, one complained. We have to pay to use the canal road, another said. The Taliban come by car, they said. They shoot one bullet and the police shoot back with machine guns. They shot Ibrahim. As Cahir scribbled down the allegations, Brown signaled his team to slip away.
"The police chief's a killer and robber," Brown said. "Good luck getting him removed, though. I've tried with no success." Unlike the American federal system, Karzai appointed all thirty-three provincial governors, and all 324 district sub-governors and district police chiefs. The opinion of Capt. Brown or any other adviser was as meaningful as a drop of water.
Having left Cahir with his donkey, Brown and the Afghans walked east through the elds in search of the dushmen. July was the fertile season, with the broad Helmand River spilling into thousands of ditches irrigating elds of corn, cucumbers, wheat, tomatoes, grapes, green beans, and bright owers. The elds abounded with green vines of watermelons. The askars helped themselves to the cool fruit, savoring the sugary taste.
Azulu pointed at two sliced melons lying in a ditch. Some Taliban had seen them coming and run away. "Pick up the pace," Brown said. "They're not far away." Within minutes, the patrol came to a road alongside a wide canal with concrete banks. A faded metal plate showed the military symbol of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, dated 1957. Brown signaled the platoon to fall back into the undergrowth. Seconds later, AK rounds snapped overhead from the far side of the canal. "The canal marks our limit of advance," Brown said. "Our part of the operation is over." ACCEPTANCE, SORT OF Sgt. Roxborough spent the night vomiting and wiping up his diarrhea. In the morning, he was pasty-faced as he shrugged into his gear. "Occupational hazard," he said. "You get the runs on every deployment. At least I smell better than the boss [Brown]. He had the shits for ten days. Kept an ammo can between his cot and mine. I deserve a medal for putting up with that, I do."
The platoon linked up with Sgt. Cahir and Lt. Connor to hold a shura in the impoverished village of Gourogan, which sat on a hill with no trees to block out the sun. About twenty elders gathered to meet with the Marines and the advisers in the shade of a whitewashed mosque. The elders were friendly, o ering tea and opinions about their crops, Karzai, and USAID. Like many Afghans, they mentioned the PRT, Provincial Reconstruction Team-an immensely popular program that disbursed aid at the district and village level. The elders' needs were simple, a small clinic and a school. The jovial mullah asked for batteries for his loudspeakers, so that the farmers didn't have an excuse for not coming to prayer.
When Cahir asked if they would evict any local Taliban, the mullah laughed. If you can't do it, he joked, how can we? The elders happily delivered a contradictory message. We want security, they said. Either Taliban or askars are okay with us, but not both because they ght each other and we get hurt. We're a religious country and don't want outsiders. The Marines have chased out the Taliban, though, so they can stay. Now, how about building us a clinic? Lt. Col. Bill McCollough had been given the classic counterinsurgency mission of "clear, hold, build." In their book Freakonomics, economist Steven Levitt and journalist Stephen Dubner cite data demonstrating that one sure way to reduce crime is to increase the presence of aggressive police.

The map, however, told a di erent tale. Nawa district was twenty kilometers wide and twenty-ve kilometers long. McCollough had scattered his companies across the district. Each of sixty-ve daily patrols covered two to four kilometers. If you threw three darts at the map, one would strike a patrol route.
When the action slowed, I asked for a ride back to Jakar to pursue another story. When I said goodbye to 4-4 Amber, they asked for me to intervene on their behalf with the high command. They felt that McCollough was now their boss, and they didn't want to leave. Both the Marine and the British generals later agreed that they would stay.
To fold the British advisers into the much larger American battalion was a sensible arrangement with a touch of poignancy. Prime Minister Tony Blair had declared that in Helmand, the British army beginning in 2006 was "engaged in long-term nation-building." 
16
For several years, each regiment assigned to the province for a six-month rotation tried a di erent approach. By 2009, the consensus was to clear and hold a few populated areas. Then in came 10,000 American Marines, with an aggressiveness that appealed to the British army, and with a knowledge of counterinsurgency. At the operational level, this relieved the pressure upon the Brits. At the strategic level, it fanned the perception that the United Kingdom had decided not to sustain a capable military.
National priorities were, of course, not a concern for Capt. Brown's advisers. They were happy to have the backing of a big American battalion. By August of 2009, shooting inside Nawa district had petered out. I thanked 4-4 Amber for their company and hopped a ride back to Jakar in a Hilux with the rst sergeant of the Afghan company. We barreled down the dirt roads as though our speed could exceed the electrical impulse touching o a roadside bomb. Along one stretch of farmlands, the truck suddenly skidded to a stop. The driver, the rst sergeant, and the turret gunner hopped out and looked in all directions, whispering "Marine, Marine?" For a brief moment, I thought I had made a foolish mistake. Then the askars darted into the farm eld and quickly climbed back into the truck, each cradling two watermelons. Off we sped.
They hadn't been afraid of being seen by a farmer. The askars had feared the wrath of the American grunts, who wouldn't touch a melon until the farmer was paid. Marine patrols were ghosts, perhaps nowhere, perhaps everywhere. The Taliban shared that sentiment. The "clear" phase of "clear, hold, and build" had been accomplished. Barrow once told me in his courtly Louisiana drawl, "Bing, I've never seen a crowded battle eld." He was right. On the lines, you keep bumping into the same people, because the infantry comprise less than 10 percent of the U.S. Army and Marines. Grunts are a small community.
So when I arrived at a remote, godforsaken outpost in Nawa in the fall of 2009, it didn't surprise me to be greeted by Sgt. Robert Kightlinger and Lt. Shawn Connor. I had last seen them on patrol during the summer.
Since then, Bill McCollough had extended his control over Nawa. Kightlinger and Connor were holding the westernmost outpost named Man Bear Pig-a fantastical monster from a Comedy Central episode that spoofed Al Gore's prophecy of the earth's collapse. Man Bear sat on a slight rise in the desert, surrounded by miles of dusty farmlands.
Fifteen Marines and a dozen Afghan soldiers lived inside a ring of HESCO barriers-giant burlap bags lled with rocks and dirt held in place by wire meshing. The outpost consisted of two machine guns, a mortar, a cache of water bottles, sleeping bags, and meals in plastic pouches.
"We're on the frontier, enjoying the great outdoors," Connor said. "We get hit about twice a day. The usual stuff." A short while later, AK rounds cracked over the sandbags. Kightlinger, twenty-three, from Jackson, California, muttered, "Insolent bastards," and led a dozen Marines and askars out the wire in pursuit. Bounding west across dry poppy elds, the patrol searched for sniper hides and found where a bush had been pared back, with empty cartridge shells in the dirt.
"We send them to some lab to trace who's selling to the muj," Kightlinger said.
The patrol headed west at a dogtrot, bounding by re teams across the elds, knowing the Taliban would have the rst shots. Kightlinger scanned the scattered compounds. A black kite popped up over one. Minutes later, a second kite was uttering farther in the distance, along the same line of sight.
"The dumb dickers are showing us their trail," Kightlinger said. "If they shoot, we'll have a chance to pin them. They're shitty shots."
The patrol was moving at a fast walk beside some scrawny r trees when AK rounds kicked up the dirt. Flopping down in a skirmish line, the Marines peered around.
" In nine years of war, the U.S. military had never collected systematic biometric and census data on the military-aged males. The acronym MAM was even forbidden because it seemed to demean the male population. The battalions did have clunky handheld devices that were infrequently used because it took fifteen minutes to enter data on one person.
A better system could have produced remarkable results. In New York City alone, for instance, 20,000 police patrolmen stopped 500,000 civilians a year for security checks. A foolproof identi cation of every Afghan male, who could be stopped at any time, was equivalent to putting a uniform on every insurgent.
Kightlinger's patrol was a typical low-level TIC-Troops in Contact-rating only a brief radio report to battalion. A few insurgents, full of youthful testosterone, had displayed their bravado by shooting at an isolated outpost. Across Afghanistan, there were a thousand such TICs each week. Coalition patrols would sally forth and eventually make contact. Many knew when the action would start by listening to the each week. Coalition patrols would sally forth and eventually make contact. Many knew when the action would start by listening to the enemy Icom. Talking openly showed the Taliban disdain for the foreigners.
Up north, if the soldiers stayed too long in a hamlet or returned to base by the same trail, bursts of AK and PKM re were likely. Down south in the Green Zone, the Taliban would re from the other side of a canal or from a distant tree line. Many random shootings were never reported. The bullets rarely hit anyone, but they did signal that the local Taliban were unafraid.
Obviously the gang that shot at the Man Bear outpost didn't expect the Marines to run after them. By seeking refuge in the mosque, they avoided a lethal fight.
"The farmers know our rules," Kightlinger said. "They see us as pussies, and they fear the Taliban." Lt. Connor's perspective was broader. He was concerned about violating the Rules of Engagement, which placed mosques o -limits. Although not on scene, he was also wary lest the gunfight attract more Taliban than Kightlinger's team could handle.
The grunts on the patrol disagreed. "Let us decide. With mortars on call, we're the kings out here," Rogers added. "We need to ght like the Taliban. Take o the armor, go out in small units, run them down."
Connor, though, faced the risk-reward dilemma that bedeviled commanders of all ranks. The anger to destroy the enemy that had burned so brightly in September of 2001 had faded over the intervening decade. Far from being a vital interest, the war was scarcely remembered back home. Connor ate, slept, and kidded with Kightlinger and his squad every day, month after month. So how much risk did he run with their lives in order to kill a few low-level fighters paid $5 a day? By this point in the ten-year war, small unit leaders looked out rst and foremost for their men. In many cases, protecting the force became a primary mission. This left the enemy intact, which extended the war, which decreased support in the States, which led to demands for faster progress that couldn't be achieved because the enemy was intact.
At a slow pace, the Marines headed back to Man Bear. As they crunched across dried poppy stalks, the farmers hollered at the Afghan soldiers, who shouted back encouragingly. The soldiers were from an anti-narcotics unit.
"The farmers ask if they are on our list to burn their fields," Cpl. Reyaz Ulla, a tough askar, told me. "We tell them no." "What farms are on the list?" I asked. "We don't know," Ulla said. "We lie to the farmers so they don't shoot at us."
No one knew what to do about the poppy. The prevailing view inside the U.S. military was to deal with the insurgency and leave the poppy farming to the Afghan government to address in later years. If someone was caught with more raw opium than an average farmer would grow, he was arrested. The Afghan anti-narcotics unit was interested only in the holdings of drug lords. The individual farmer in his poppy field had nothing to fear from a passing patrol.
Kightlinger's patrol report moved up a chain of computers, one data point added to ten others at battalion, thirty others at brigade, and 100 others by the time the day's summary reached McChrystal's top command, the ISAF, in Kabul.
A four-star general is swamped by data, reports, and a deluge of contradictory information. Acting on the basis of his experience, intuition, and trust in subordinates, he must make sense out of the chaos of war, glimpse patterns, and give orders. Past experience counted for little in directing the maddeningly complex wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and the reputations of top generals suffered accordingly.
The press wrote glowing reports about generals when they took command, and gradually soured on them over time. Gen. Tommy Franks received accolades for leading the invasions of both Afghanistan and Iraq. He retired without leaving any plan for dealing with Iraq. In 2003, Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez took command in Iraq, and demonstrated no leadership. He was replaced by Gen. George Casey, who was fully supported by Gen. John Abizaid, the commander of CentCom. Casey and Abizaid were caught at-footed by the escalating civil war in Baghdad. In 2007, both were replaced. Gen. David Petraeus took command in Iraq and turned the war around. Abizaid was replaced by Adm. William Fallon, who was fired a few months later. Of these six commanders, only Petraeus emerged with his reputation intact.
In Afghanistan, the carnage was the same. Lt. Gen. David Barno led the U.S. effort until mid-2005. He advocated counterinsurgency, but had woefully too few troops. He was replaced by Lt. Gen. Karl Eikenberry, who argued that the priority was to improve the terrible performance of the Karzai government. That e ort went nowhere. Nonetheless, Eikenberry told Congress, "the Government of Afghanistan today maintains broad popular support.… [With] NATO's multi-year commitment … the Afghan Government … has the clear potential to achieve victory."

The rst reason was obvious: The leaders in Washington let down the generals in the eld. The Bush administration did not have a coherent strategy and was riven by internal dissension. The Obama administration enjoyed a favorable press and employed lofty rhetoric. But beginning in 2007, Gates and Mullen shu ed through four generals and three strategies in Afghanistan, re ecting Washington's unwillingness to admit the enormity of the task. The coalition's force size was inadequate, given that Afghanistan's 31 million people spoke four di erent languages, were spread over a rugged land four times the size of Wyoming, and displayed the insularity of proud, uneducated tribes.
A second reason was the conventional thinking of the generals. Every general was a master bureaucrat who had received fifty fitness reports over twenty or more years without a single blemish. The generals had advanced inside a culture that rewarded command of conventional units and adherence to conventional war thinking. American armored columns had devastated the Iraqi army in Kuwait in 1991 and again in Baghdad in 2003, while American airpower had shattered the Taliban in 2001. This conventional approach of repower and raw force could not be applied in the ensuing insurgent warfare.
The resources provided by the Congress were fulsome, while not being an undue burden on the taxpayer. Defense in 2010 absorbed about 5 percent of GDP, including the costs of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Each soldier in Afghanistan cost about $1 million to pay and support. "Dining Facilities," or DIFACS, had replaced mess halls, with a cost of $28 per soldier per meal.

Technical gaps, however, were also glaring. Every army in history, faced with an insurgency, has understood the criticality of identifying the guerrillas. Hence, King Herod conducted a census for both general taxation and identi cation, as did most kings thereafter. Every manual on counterinsurgency has stressed the criticality of a census. The expert David Galula explained how it was done in Algeria in the 1950s: "Each household was provided with a family census booklet in which we noted the name, age, and sex of every member; the family head was made responsible for reporting any change. Every house in the village was numbered."

A similar blind spot existed with interpreters. As had been the case since World War I, the military deployed gifted linguists to intercept and record enemy radio conversations. Yet the units in the eld weren't linked with equally talented interpreters. Google claimed it could translate voice from one language into another in less than a second. Ho-hum, responded the Pentagon.
The possibility of the "virtual sta " was real, but not initiated. Thousands of Afghan-Americans uent in tribal dialects lived in the States. Via Skype or other means, prior to leaving the wire, a patrol leader could have linked up with a terp stateside who had a map and all prior data about the area. Every farmer could be greeted by a friendly Pashto voice over a headset, while the patrol leader on another headset asked questions. Within a few months, the stateside terps would know the key local players. Reach-back would enhance the depth of interaction by every patrol, contributing to an ever-growing database about every male in every district and providing continuity from one battalion to the next-without the translators ever leaving the States. The CIA discussed this in at least two meetings, and never followed up on the concept.
The interpreters were the funnel for all coalition interactions with Afghans at all levels. Yet the American military ignored its high-tech advantages and persisted in the eld with local hires, as had been done for centuries. What was good enough in World War II was good enough in Afghanistan.
Doctrine did change, at rst for the better as counterinsurgency and later for the worse as nation building. In 2006, the Army and Marines, under the direction of Gen. Petraeus as the commander of the Army Combined Arms Center, compiled an updated eld manual on counterinsurgency. 
7
8
The manual was intended to provide a framework for addressing counterinsurgency generically. The strength of the manual was its insistence that the people be treated with respect. However, it professed a theory of the social contract-give the people services and honest governance and the people would turn against the insurgents-that did not address the dynamics of Afghanistan. The guidance did not say what to do when the people remained neutral and the government remained dishonest. It was silent about Islamist religiosity as the ideology fueling the enemy, laid out no practical steps for restraining corruption, and ignored tribalism and the existence of a sanctuary next door. It accorded total sovereignty to the host government that had failed (hence the need for Americans to ght), thus rendering all American e orts captive to the whims of flawed foreign leaders.
Counterinsurgency doctrine was absolutely necessary to put an end to fruitless episodic raids against an elusive foe, often running roughshod over the people. That was plain wrong. Nation building, though, crept in and consumed resources, eventually causing a generation of senior leaders to neglect their core duties of war-fighting and training an indigenous army.
A third reason many general o cers failed was the rise of the BUA digital culture. Headquarters sta s convened daily for a Battle eld Update Assessment, or BUA. In operations centers across Afghanistan, rows upon rows of midlevel o cers sat in front of laptop computers looking, as though in a movie theater, at huge screens that displayed colored maps and spreadsheets of data. The center screen showed the gigantic image of the senior general chairing the meeting. He presided like a deity, while one after another, junior o cers walked to a microphone to gravely report statistics on personnel, operations, logistics, electric power, fuel, news, weather, and the latest engagements, from a few shots red in the north to a bomb explosion in the south. After each set of data was displayed, the sta awaited the general's oracular pronouncement.
The BUA conveyed a Wizard of Oz feeling. In that setting, generals become accustomed to obeisance and deference. It was common for data on fourteen subjects to be presented to the senior general. No one human being could make sense out of all that data. No general was that much brighter than everyone else. What was the point, besides placing the general on a pedestal? One division commander, for instance, developed the habit of sitting down and plucking his reading glasses from a tray held by an attentive aide, as though his glasses were too heavy to carry. Another shut himself behind a pane of glass, as if he might catch a germ from the masses below.
This wasn't the normal instinct of American generals. It was an adverse product of computer nets that vacuumed up thousands of data bits -the number of IED explosions, re ghts, and the like. This focused senior leadership on tactical, kinetic events, with no context. Like reporting on the speed of race cars at the Indianapolis 500, these data measured activity, not who was winning or what changes had to be made.
The massive sta s added little value. By their size and authority, they imposed heavy reporting burdens on the lower ranks that were fighting the war. The result was a tendency of the higher staffs and leadership to act more as the judges than as the coaches of those doing the ghting. This fueled resentment at the lower levels. In any war, every subordinate level of command believes its seniors are out of touch. In Afghanistan, the computer nets confirmed that belief.
Although few generals ever spent a night on the lines with a squad, the computer data gave them the impression that they understood the ghting. Many did not, and performed poorly as a result. The tactics at ash points like the Korengal remained depressingly repetitive. Generals lost touch spending too much time on data and not enough time taking the pulse of their grunts. Generals failed when they became judges, as if they were princes attended at court.
In Desert Storm in 1991 and in the march to Baghdad in 2003, generals stressed that success depended upon the intangibles of strategy, leadership, and training, arguing that the United States would have dominated, even had we swapped equipment with the enemy. No such declaration was made about Afghanistan in 2010, where our force was road-bound, mounted in vehicles, and clad in heavy armor, employing firepower rather than maneuver against a more mobile foe.
However, while many senior military leaders did not distinguish themselves in the rst decade of the twenty-rst century, their leadership is so strong that the military stands forth as the institution most admired by Americans. Lieutenant colonels, colonels, sergeants major, and generals live by standards of performance and character that establish the model for our country.
While the report of the brief ght at Man Bear Pig was making its way up the computer nets to the BUA, Siad, the long-su ering interpreter, was trailing after Kightlinger in the dusty tracks to nowhere. Siad was typical of the local interpreters. They all tried hard, and most worshipped the grunts they served loyally. Their thirst for absorbing American culture never ceased.
"Sergeant, Marines are good ghters," Siad said. "But you live in the dirt. You eat plastic food. The American Army live in tents with air conditioners. The askars want to know-why does your government punish you Marines?" "Shut the fuck up, Siad." "Do your women say 'fuck'?" Siad asked. "No, that shows a lack of class," Kightlinger said. "So why do you say it?" "Shut the fuck up, Siad." At the squad level, there were thousands of Siads, overachievers who had learned pidgin English memorizing old soaps playing on blackand-white television sets. Incredibly hardworking, inevitably they were adopted into the rough fraternity of the grunts. Their skills were marginal, no matter how hard they tried. Their hearts were huge. Anyone who doubted the magical image of America in the minds of millions of Afghans had only to spend a day under fire with a U.S. squad and the local terp.
With Siad trudging dutifully a few meters behind Sgt. Kightlinger, the patrol plodded up a hillock onto a grassy plateau where herds of camels were grazing, their front legs hobbled. Several large, open-sided tents were guarded by growling dogs the size of wolves. When the Marines raised their rifles, herdsmen threw rocks to chase away their dogs, while the women scurried inside the tents.
The headman approached, explaining that his tribe migrated each year across several provinces and had just arrived. The settled tribes called the herders of the Kuchi tribe "Gypsies" and thieves. But the Kuchi nomads were tough ghters who intimidated the local farmers and crossed Taliban territories unchallenged. The Marines wandered through the camp, using a battered digital camera to snap a picture of each male.
"We have your pictures now," Kightlinger told the chieftain. "You act as dickers for the Taliban while you're here, and I'll put you in the earth."
It was a blu . Later, Kightlinger might or might not take the time to download the pictures onto a computer at the operations center ten miles away. But no one would look at them, let alone track migratory camel drivers. Not knowing that, the chief smiled insincerely. So I seized the opportunity.
"Sergeant," I said. "I'd like a photo on a camel for my grandchildren." That amused Kightlinger, who gestured with his ri e at the chief. A minute later, I was sitting on the back of a big old camel, grinning like a tourist at the Pyramids (Picture 31). Then the chief, pissed at the absurdity, turned the beast loose to teach me a lesson. I held on for dear life as the snorting animal broke into a lurching gallop, causing the Marines to swing up their rifles.
"We'll lead our shots!" Kightlinger shouted. Great obituary: Foolish writer and runaway camel shot by Marines. Fortunately the chief, concerned about his beast, broke into a run and grabbed the bridle, jerking the braying animal to the ground. As I tried to regain my dignity, the chief angrily shooed me away from his caravan.
Kightlinger led his men into a hide sight where we hid until dark, hoping for a shot at some unwary Taliban (Picture 32). I heard enough camel jokes to last me a lifetime. There were twenty-two outposts like Man Bear scattered across Nawa, forlorn clusters of HESCO barriers with a few panels of plywood and camou age. Seven were named after Marines killed in my Combined Action Platoon in Vietnam, described in a book entitled The Village and not forgotten four decades later: Page, the youngest and the rst to die, Brannon, the good-natured sharpshooter from Texas, Sullivan, who shot coconuts out of the trees … It felt odd to look at a map with the names of comrades from a war long past. Grunts remember their own. They want to be like those who went before them. Tradition, heritage, pride. You bet.
The similarities across the four decades between the wars were striking. As in Vietnam, in each outpost Marines and Afghan soldiers lived together without showers or air-conditioning to relieve the broiling heat. It still took a month to get packages and letters from home. As in Vietnam, each combined platoon was on its own, knew the local leaders, sometimes heard when the Taliban were moving, and decided how much risk to take.
When the Marines settled into the outposts, the Taliban pulled out of Nawa and nibbled at the edges. The dushmen weren't going to ght to hold on to Nawa. The terrain was unfavorable; they could be cut o by the open desert to the east. More important, the poppy crop was small compared to that in Marja, fifteen kilometers to the west.
In May, Capt. Brown, the Brit adviser, could patrol less than a kilometer outside Jakar before being shot at. By October, the Marines were bored because they couldn't nd a re ght. While skirmishing was constant around the edge of the picket line at Man Bear Pig, inside the confines of Nawa, the other Marine platoons were engaged in civil affairs projects, while longing for a fight to break up the monotony.
NABO JAY Some villages, though, spurned all o ers of aid. Particularly nettlesome was Nabo Jay, on the main canal about ve kilometers north of the central market.
Capt. Drew Schoenmaker of Delta Company invited me to attend a shura at Nabo and see for myself. With a dozen Marines, we left the dirt outpost and walked down a dusty road. From the summer's baking heat, it had cooled to a tolerable 90 degrees. Acres and acres of corn stretched along both sides of the solitary road that ran alongside a shallow canal. "That's a bitch to patrol in," Schoenmaker said, gesturing at the tall corn. "The ground is gooey mud and those green stalks suck up all the oxygen. It's a 130-degree sauna."
He pointed at a side path on the far side of the canal. "Remember Sgt. Cahir and his donkey?" he asked. "Sure," I said. "His wife have those twins yet?" "He's dead," Schoenmaker said. "We were hit from the corn eld where we're standing now. Cahir waded across the canal to cover that path we're looking at. He was hit in the neck. The corpsman got to him right away, but he bled out."
At the village of Nabo Jay, a few dozen men dressed in the traditional shalwar kameez (baggy pants, long tunics, and vests) sat on wooden benches outside an empty school, awaiting the speeches. Lt. Col. McCollough stood o the side while the district governor, an amiable former schoolteacher, stood in front, urging the villagers to appoint a representative to the district council. In response, man after man stood to make the same declaration: Remove the Marine patrols. They're not needed. Instead, have the Americans dredge our canals.
Exasperated, the governor sat down on the soft grass and gestured to McCollough to speak. "Work together to clean out your own canal," he said. "Do not listen to the Taliban. Your children should be in this school."
McCollough was answered by complaints. The American patrols scared everyone. The children weren't safe in an unclean school. "I am tired of your bullshit," Capt. Schoenmaker interrupted. "Two weeks ago I gave you $500 to clean up the school. You did nothing."
We are giving you back the money, a villager said. "That's the point," Schoenmaker said. "You're too scared of the Taliban to stand up for your own kids." An elder handed the $500 back to Schoenmaker, and the meeting broke up in truculent silence.
Schoenmaker headed back to his outpost along the road next to the tall corn, ignoring groups of farmers who uttered no greeting or turned their backs as the Marines walked past. "Nabo Jay is a no-joy place," he said. "We haven't forgotten Cahir died here. Taliban agents are in the market right now as we walk by, and the police won't point them out."
By tracking cell phone calls over several weeks, Delta Company had located the compound that was making roadside bombs. Launching a night raid, the Marines had seized seven men in a building that contained explosives, blasting caps, and batteries. The detainees were handed over to the local police, who protested that the men were innocent. When the Marines persisted, the police transferred them to a squad from the National Directorate of Security. Over a radio intercept, the Marines heard an NDS major berating the squad for taking custody of the prisoners. Somehow between the NDS and the police, the seven men escaped while being transferred to the provincial jail.
The Nawa police chief, Nafez Khan, said he didn't know how that could happen. Yet he was the entire chain of command. No cop carried out any task without his personal permission. He entrusted no deputies to run different shifts. He approved every decision.
Nafez illustrated a basic problem. When the Marines arrived in Nawa, the farmers had complained of theft by the police. Yet Nafez had seemed to ght against the Taliban. With a handful of police, he had remained entrenched inside his shabby fort when all other o cials had ed Nawa in 2007. Nafez knew President Karzai's brother, Ahmed Wali Karzai, who lived and reigned in Kandahar, seventy miles to the east. Nafez offered McCollough tantalizing tips about local politics and Taliban meetings.
At rst, the Marines were willing to let bygones be bygones. Nafez had shown them on a photomap where the Taliban were holding a meeting. A Quick Reaction Force found no one at that farm, but maybe Nafez couldn't read a map. Still, stories about police misconduct persisted. Mohamed's tractor with two new tires had been seized by Nafez. After yelling at a cop, Nullah had been struck with a ri e butt, breaking his shoulder. At one checkpoint, the police charged 50 dinars ($1) for a truck carrying wheat. Etc.
One night, Nafez quietly drove up to the base warehouse on Jakar that held wheat for refugee families. As the cops were loading sacks into their pickup, Capt. Gus Biggio strolled over.
" Farther to the south, Lt. Clint Hall had caught four policemen extracting a toll from farmers passing on their tractors. Hall had disarmed the police, stripped them of their blue shirts, marched them bare-chested down the road, and told them never to come back.
McCollough laughed. The proposal was tempting, but beyond his authority. "Nafez has overstayed his welcome in Nawa," McCollough said. "But it's up to the province o cials to get Karzai to remove him. I'm not doing their job for them vigilante style."
Counterinsurgency doctrine stresses the creation of local government. The paradox was that the coalition sought to build a legitimate government inside a sovereign system made up of dysfunctional o cials. The consequence was that battalion commanders like McCollough spent half their time on civil matters, frequently trying to fire officials who were supported by President Karzai.
Every coalition battalion commander had a story similar to McCollough's. According to an investigative series in The Washington Post, "After nearly nine years of nation-building in Afghanistan, experts said, the U.S. government faces mounting evidence that it has helped to assemble one of the most corrupt governments in the world."

Gradually, the villagers learned that if they voiced a concern, McCollough took action.
He asked a farmer repairing a wheezing tractor why his children weren't in the new school. The teachers sent them home because I'm too poor to pay, the farmer said. Send them tomorrow, McCollough said, they'll be welcome. That night, he called the teachers to a meeting with Omar, the sub-governor.
"We built the schools," he said. "If you turn away one child, I will know and you will lose your job. If your pay is too low, tell Governor Omar and we will work it out together."
That was McCollough's way-doing everything together. Omar's self-con dence and status skyrocketed. As his district came back to life, he loved showing it off to officials from Kabul and America.
"Look at the goats," Omar would say, gesturing at the green elds. "No one steals them, now that the Marines are here. Sheep are back too, because no one shoots them. Colonel Bill is a good governor." "No, no," McCollough would protest. "Omar, you are the governor." "Okay, we're both the governor," Omar would reply, looking pleased. "I tell you, one or two families come to me every day," Omar would lecture, wagging a nger at guests, "asking me not to arrest someone returning to their farms. I say sure. I ask no questions where the young men have been. It's good here now."
The district market stood testimony to the words. In June, three or four stalls were open, tended by glum storekeepers with a few skimpy goods (Picture 33). In July farmers began to gather in the late afternoons to barter among themselves. By September, Friday attendance at the nearby mosque had increased sharply, and more farmers lingered to gossip. Dozens of shops opened. In October, thousands were ocking to the market for cattle and sheep auctions. The crowds became so large they sprawled into the elds beyond the market (Picture 34). Tractors towing trailers stuffed high with furniture were a common sight, as families returned to homesteads abandoned years earlier.
Battalion 1-5 and British advisory team 4-4 Amber had good reason to be proud. In June, 75 percent of 500 farmers interviewed cited security as their primary concern; by October, 65 percent identi ed the irrigation water supply as the primary concern, followed by schools, clinics, and roads. Security ran a distant fth. 
10
By November of 2009 as Battalion 1-5 was headed home, delegations from the U.S. Congress were trooping regularly through the Nawa market. Adm. Mullen went on nationwide television to extol what had been accomplished by Gen. McChrystal's "new" counterinsurgency strategy.
"Nawa is now an example of what we would like and what we expect the results of this surge to be," Mullen said.
Mullen had articulated the precise error. The result of the surge had to be Afghans-not Americans-in the lead. The talented McCollough had taken on the roles of police chief, judge, warrior, school principal, farmer, district governor, and counselor (Picture 35). The surge, though, would succeed only when U.S. congressional delegates walked through the market without American forces.
Nawa district emerged as the poster child of the high command. The farmers had certainly bene ted. Truckers did not have to pay o the Taliban at checkpoints, and the police chief had been removed. The Nawa market sprang back to life. Harassing small arms re and IEDs were rare. But patrols still reported pigeons being released, kites own, and dickers peering over compound walls. A secret Taliban network remained active.
As soon as McCollough left, the serpentine police chief, Nafez Khan, returned to the district. For a few months, he behaved. Then he slipped back into his old ways. The farmers complained about shakedowns to Lt. Col. Je Holt, the commander of the battalion that had replaced McCollough's. No farmer, though, was willing to testify.
Things came to a head when a Marine patrol, seeing a crowd outside a compound, wandered over. To their astonishment, three men in blue police shirts red at them. The Marines killed all three. Two were carrying police IDs; the third had no ID. Inside the compound, the Marines found RPGs, explosives, and blasting caps. The police chief said he had no idea two of his men were Taliban. That evening, the father of one of the dead policemen shot at a passing patrol and was killed. It was a tragic case of "suicide by Marine." The father felt honorbound to avenge his son, even knowing he was overmatched.
A few days later, two policemen were assassinated a few kilometers to the north. At roll call the next day, a policeman shouted angrily that Chief Khan was killing his own men because they suspected the chief was working both sides of the street. The policeman who made the accusation was murdered that night. A few weeks later, an unarmed policeman in civilian clothes was shot while hitchhiking back to his outpost.
In the span of ten weeks, six cops on a force of 100 had been killed. The police force split into hostile factions supporting and opposing the chief. The Nawa district council informed the governor they would not meet until Khan was removed. Lt. Col. Holt supported the council, but stayed in the background. The governor acquiesced and Khan left the district.
"A year ago, Billy [McCollough] wanted the council to take action," Holt told me. "Now the elders have made their own government work, instead of looking to us. That's a big step forward." While Nawa as one district was improving, the police and the army su ered from a systemic aw. Commanders at every level purchased their positions from the commander above them. Everyone was paying someone for something.
"I'm paid $250 a month," Aji Kham, a cop with nine years on the force, told me. "I pay $10 to the bank, and another $10 to the man who gives me my money. I want an ID card, but that will cost me another $10. Everything cost extra."
Personal safety was a concern as well. "Once the Taliban caught me on a bus," Abdul Badi, who had served in Nawa for eight years, said. "They put a hood over my face and said they would cut o my nose if they found out I worked for the Americans. Now I take taxis to go home, and the drivers overcharge. Police don't have enough money to live. Our families have to support us."
Police demanded "support" from the farmers below them, and accepted "support" from their enemies. Lawyers at Marine brigade headquarters estimated that monthly the battalions sent forward about sixty detainees for long-term imprisonment. By the time the detainees had passed through four levels of Afghan police, about six remained in custody to receive sentences of one or more years.
Everyone paid someone. Everyone.
The Taliban revolutionaries were ercer than the majority of Pashtuns who disliked them. But strong American battalion tribes can motivate weaker tribes to stand up. The stronger tribe can teach military techniques that infuse con dence, if the weaker tribe believes the techniques can be applied even after the stronger tribe has left.
In Nawa, that testing point had been reached. The district had a new kandak (battalion) commander who was willing to leave the wire, a new police chief, a decent governor who had grown in self-con dence, an assertive district council, and a bustling farmers market. Whether the structure would remain standing when the props of the American forces were withdrawn remained to be tested.
Lt. Col. George Nunez, the kandak adviser, was optimistic. Having advised an Iraqi battalion during the hard ghting in Anbar Province in 2006, he had a level eye.
"We're ready to turn Nawa over to the Afghans," he said. "Most Marines could be out of Nawa by the spring of 2011."
The U.S. battalion commander was more guarded. "We will place the Afghan forces in the lead by 2011," Holt said. "Beyond that, I can't predict."
A "NEW" STRATEGY (AGAIN)
It was not easy to understand the military strategy in Afghanistan. "The United States really has gotten its head into this conflict," Secretary of Defense Robert Gates declared in 2009, "only in the last year." 1 It had taken Gates three years, two administrations, and three commanding generals in Afghanistan to arrive at that conclusion, while Adm. Mullen, the master of incomprehensible syntax, continued to talk in circles that supported any position. Their leadership did not demonstrate a consistent, steadfast strategic vision. In dealing with Nawa, McCollough had applied what he had learned in Iraq. More than any other factor, McCollough's success was due to his prior tour as an adviser. Neither McKiernan nor McChrystal had written a recipe for the battalions to follow. Generals could provide only broad guidance. Each battalion ran its own franchise. One battalion might execute well, and another might not. Nawa did demonstrate that Afghanistan wasn't hopeless, though, and that was the message Gates was conveying in Washington.  In November of 2009, however, Ambassador Karl Eikenberry sent a cable to Secretary of State Clinton. Eikenberry, who had served as the three-star commander in Afghanistan, warned against sending additional troops. He wrote that "Karzai was not an adequate strategic partner … shuns responsibility for any strategic burden, whether defense, governance or development … there is no political ruling class that provides an overarching national identity."
The ambassador also held out little hope that Pakistan would cooperate. "Pakistan will remain the single greatest source of Afghan instability so long as the border sanctuaries remain, and Pakistan views its strategic interest as best served by a weak neighbor."

By sending more troops in while promising to begin withdrawing soon thereafter, Obama came down rmly on both sides of the critical issue: Was the United States determined to prevail in Afghanistan?
In September of 2009, McChrystal had de ned his mission as "Defeat the Taliban." Secretary of Defense Gates criticized that goal as a "forever commitment." So in December, the White House order changed "defeat" to "diminish" the Taliban. 
5
In his Inaugural Address, Obama had pledged, "You cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you." In March of 2009, he had declared, "the uncompromising core of the Taliban must be met with force, and they must be defeated." In his December 2009 speech, Obama purged the word "defeat," saying the goal was "to deny it [the Taliban] the ability to overthrow the government."
When asked about the change in mission, Defense Secretary Gates replied, "We are in this thing to win." Adm. Mullen added, "That's certainly where I am.… If we're not winning, we're losing. Having an intellectual debate about winning and losing … I don't think is very helpful.… I urge our troops to think carefully about how they will accomplish the mission they have been assigned." 
6
Obama said, "After eighteen months, our troops will begin to come home." Gates said "some handful or some small number" might withdraw, depending upon conditions. Vice President Biden disagreed, saying, "In July of 2011 you're going to see a whole lot of people moving out. Bet on it."

Eighteen months was an impossible deadline. An insurgency is a cancer, not a broken bone a ecting only one portion of the body politic. American troops were the serum injected into Afghanistan's bloodstream to enable the body's natural defenses to recover. Gradually, the number of injections would decrease. American soldiers could thin out in 2011. But no general could manage his battlespace based on a rm timeline, or instruct his troops to "diminish" the enemy.
Senator Dick Lugar, the thoughtful ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, expressed concern that the logic of the strategy seemed circular. We do and we do not have to nation-build; we do and we do not have to defeat the Taliban.
"At some moments, it appears as if we are trying to remake the economic, political and security culture of Afghanistan," Lugar said. "At other moments, it appears we are content with … preventing an implacable hostile Taliban regime from taking over.… We need to know what missions are absolutely indispensable for success, however it is defined." 
9
By declaring an ambiguous mission, the president had positioned himself brilliantly as a politician. His Delphic statements left open his options. That same uncertainty harmed the military mission. The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, later said the 2011 withdrawal pledge "is probably giving the enemy sustenance." 
11
12
As the strategy review dragged through the fall of 2009, leaks to the press supported McChrystal's approach. Obama allegedly responded by dressing down the generals "in a cold fury." 
13
Still, the military insisted he meant to say that the number of troops leaving depended upon conditions on the ground. Clearly, Afghans did not want to join the losing side. So Obama changed his tune. "The pace of our troop reductions will be determined by conditions on the ground," he said. "But make no mistake: This transition will begin." 
14
Obama and his advisers, con dent of the logic of their position, spoke at length to the journalist Bob Woodward and gave him the administrations's secret war plan, entitled "President Obama's Final Orders for Afghanistan Pakistan Strategy."
"Transition responsibility for security," the plan read, "to the Afghan government on a timeline that will permit us to begin to decrease our troop presence by July of 2011." 
15
In later addressing the cadets at West Point, Obama quoted Oliver Wendell Holmes, who wrote, "To ght out a war you must believe in something and want something with all your might." 
16
The December 2009 presidential strategy did not change operational plans on the ground. The military knew it had to seize populated territory controlled by the enemy. In February of 2010, the Taliban sanctuary of Marja in Helmand Province became the scene of the largest operation of the Afghan war. Hailed by the press as "a major test of the Obama surge," the battle was at rst a success, and then a failure, and lastly an indeterminate tie.
In the 1950s, the United States and Russia were vying for the a ections of Afghanistan as another tiny pawn on the global chessboard of the Cold War. In place of military forces, both superpowers o ered economic aid. When the Russians built some dams and roads, the United States countered with agricultural projects. The atlands of Marja had such rich soil that it promised to be the breadbasket of Afghanistan, provided it was properly irrigated.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers constructed a massive canal system connected to the Helmand River to the east. The Afghan king, Zahir Shah, enthusiastically allocated land tracts, called blocks, to di erent tribes to ensure that Marja was a national mixing pot not dominated by one tribe. He deported thousands of restive Pashtuns from Konar and settled them in diverse blocks. About 100,000 residents lived in a hundred blocks spread across 400 square kilometers. Marja was a vast expanse of farmlands intersected by canals and ditches (Map 8).
The community in each block maintained its portion of the canals, with o cials loyal to the king apportioning the ow of water. The wonder of its time, the Marja canal complex provided fertile crops while strengthening the king's power. Over the years, nikalins, or tribal migrants, spread into Nawa, further diffusing the power of any single tribe.
Amidst the chaos of the civil wars beginning in the 1970s, communal management of the canals fell apart. When the Taliban took power in the mid-1990s, opium had supplanted wheat as the main cash crop. The blocks along the main canals in the center received the most water and cut the best deals with the drug lords. Squatters had moved onto the government lands in the poorest blocks on the outskirts, especially toward the western desert. They embraced the Taliban, who promised that the government would never take back their lands. Mullahs, previously with scant power, emerged as the Taliban agents, gaining prestige. The Taliban were using a traditional insurgent technique for gaining loyalty. In the 1950s, Vietnamese Gen. Nguyen Giap promised "every soldier that he was ghting for the right to own a few acres." 
1
By 2009, the Taliban had been the government in Marja for over a decade. The canal complex was the insurgency's major stronghold inside Afghanistan, because no outside force had been powerful enough to attack across a hundred water barriers and because the poppy provided a major source of income.
"Helmand is the Taliban's Ruhr Valley-its industrial base," Col. Mike Killion, the operations o cer for the Marine brigade, said. "Marja is the refining and transportation hub for wet opium. Busting Marja takes a big bite out of Taliban finances."
At ISAF headquarters in Kabul, there was a surprising lack of data or consensus about the ow of drug money. Estimates ranged between 30 to 70 percent of insurgency funding. There was, however, consensus that Marja had to be seized if the Taliban were to be pushed back in the south.
When he arrived in Helmand in early 2009, brigade commander Brig. Gen. Larry Nicholson (Picture 36) decided to seize control of the southern portion of the Helmand River before swinging west against Marja. A year later, the four Marine battalions were deployed in sixty outposts covering 120 kilometers of farmlands along the river. What Lt. Col. McCollough was doing with his battalion at Nawa was duplicated by the other battalions.
Nicholson stressed combined Afghan-American foot patrolling. He suggested a minimum of four Americans and four Afghans per patrol, with no vehicle required to provide heavy machine gun re support. In some provinces, the battalion average was twenty-two patrols a day; in Helmand, the average was sixty-four. The difference was due to the degree of risk taken by sending out small foot patrols.
In December of 2009, having gained control of the southern Helmand River Valley, Nicholson called together hundreds of elders, promising to attack Marja. His intent was to frighten the insurgents and drug gangs into leaving in order to minimize destruction and civilian casualties.
At the same time, he moved his lines forward so that the Taliban would see what was coming. The Marines moved forward ten kilometers west from Man Bear Pig to the outskirts of Marja. The Taliban responded by sending out watchers. Both sides set up picket lines, separated by a few kilometers of no-man's-land.
Lt. Aaron McLean's platoon from Battalion 1-6 worked from Outpost Husker, three kilometers southeast of Marja. "On cold nights," McLean said, "we lit warming res at our watch posts. A mile away, we'd see the Taliban camp res opposite ours, like two armies in the field. It was Homeric."
Each morning, the Marines sent out patrols. Within minutes, the watchers inside compounds would light smoky res, or y kites and ags. Within an hour, the patrols received harassing re from long distances. Back inside Husker's small ops center, the sta watched through a high-powered telescope called GBOSS, mounted at agpole height. It wasn't unusual to see a farmer walk behind a low wall, poke a ri e muzzle over the top, shoot at a distant patrol, wait a few seconds, and then walk out unarmed to see if he had hit anyone.
In late January of 2010, Lt. McLean led a patrol from Husker in a dawn raid against a Taliban outpost. As the patrol closed on three walled compounds, excited bursts of Pashto came over a captured enemy Icom. Four unarmed men popped up on a nearby roof, brazenly pointed at them, and waved black flags. Smoke from signal fires was soon visible to the north, west, and south of the platoon.
"The juice wasn't worth the squeeze," McLean said. "We headed back east to Husker." With a few bullets snapping overhead, McLean reckoned that the Taliban were following to harass them. Sure enough, the incoming re slowly built. While one squad returned fire, another bounded back a few hundred meters to take up a covering position.
Lance Cpl. Zachary Smith rushed into an abandoned two-room farmhouse and aimed out a window. He stepped on a piece of slate that concealed two strands of metal. His weight pressed the strands together, completing an electrical circuit connecting a battery to a blasting cap wedged into a chunk of explosive hidden in the wall. The blast killed him instantly. Shrapnel whizzed around the room, injuring a second Marine.
The corpsman, Hospitalman James Hicks, rushed in to aid, followed by the squad leader, Sgt. Daniel Argus. As the enemy red from di erent angles, McLean raced across the eld and into the dust-lled room. Other Marines rushed in, trying to help. McLean told them to take up firing positions outside.
After writing down their location for Sgt. William Repsker to call in a medevac, McLean ran outside to direct the ght. He was talking on his radio when there was a BOOM! behind him.
Nine Marines were in the room when someone stepped on another pressure plate. The second explosion killed Sgt. Argus.
McLean rushed back inside. The surviving Marines were stunned by the blast, some standing, others crumbled. All were so caked in gray ash that McLean couldn't tell one from another. One was yelling, "We gotta medevac these guys." The Marine couldn't see. His left eye was streaming blood and the dust clotted his right eye.
McLean found Argus's body thrown into a small side room. While others helped the wounded, he stepped outside and completed his call for a medevac. "I have two KIA," he said. "Plus two urgents and one priority."
The tragic losses showed how the enemy had adapted, shooting so that the Marines fell back to use the booby-trapped house for cover. "I didn't call air to destroy that damn house," McLean said later. "I was too sick about our losses to argue Rules of Engagement."
The brigade had bumped up against the main defense line around Marja. It consisted of explosives and mines rather than ghters in trench lines.
Rather than assault through mine elds, Gen. Nicholson decided to launch a heliborne assault into the center of Marja and clear from the inside toward the outside. Once the Marines were in the center of the canal complex, one battalion would systematically clear the mine eld and enter from the northwest, while another would do the same from the east. Called Operation Moshtarak (Dari for "together"), the Marja attack began in February 2010. At three in the morning, helicopters landed hundreds of Marines and Afghans in the center of Marja.
Nicholson ran the overall operation that pitted 5,000 Marines and Afghan troops against about 500 Taliban ghters. The commander for the ground forces was Col. Randy Newman, who came from four generations of Indiana farmers. His ve brothers and sisters had stayed close to the land in Indiana, and his father, eighty-ve, still supervised the tilling of his 450-acre spread. When Newman looked at Marja, he didn't see markets teeming with drug traders and insurgents. He saw thousands of farmers tending 300,000 acres irrigated by 4,000 ditches. In February, the elds stretched bleakly to the horizon, millions of poppy plants looking like patches of crabgrass encroaching upon the narrow green blades of wheat fields planted in case the poppy crop suffered a disaster by nature or man.
Newman doubted the depth of local support to the Taliban. Although they had ruled for three years, they did nothing to aid the farmers chained to the earth by feudal absentee landowners. The drug lords paid the farmers less than one-fth of the roughly $3 billion in annual opium export. Politics was an abstraction to the extended farming families-each compound had fteen or more occupants-scratching to stay alive. Between harvest seasons, the Taliban rented hundreds of teenagers for $5 a day to sow mines or shoot bullets. Aside from that, the Taliban had done nothing for the farmers. Newman believed few of the youths subscribed to jihad zealotry. Allegiance went to the family and to the land.
"The farmers are serfs," Newman said. "This isn't an agrarian insurgency. Marja is drug money." Estimates of the Taliban share from drugs ranged in the hundreds of millions of dollars. "Without pro ts from the poppy trade," wrote Capt. Michael Erwin, an analyst at West Point, "the Taliban leadership could not a ord to continue recruiting, arming and paying thousands of fighters at the current rate."

On the rst day of the operation, Commando had advanced four kilometers inside Taliban territory. Newman invited me to join Commando. As we drove out to their position, the four vehicles in Newman's command element mired down in spongy muck created by incessant showers. A freezing wind quickly turned the muck into ice crystals. While the Marines were chipping out the wheels, a farmer in a flimsy coat trudged across the fields with a shovel over his shoulder. He stopped nearby and scooped foolishly at the frozen dirt.
"I saw you were stuck," he said to Ozzie, the interpreter. "I came to warn about mines."
The thin, shivering man was a bazgher (farm laborer) who said he tilled ve gerabs (acres) of wheat for $250 a year, paid by the owner who lived in Kabul. Ozzie shook his head a ably, pointing to nearby poppy plants. For a farmer, poppy yielded twice the pro t of wheat or corn harvests. A typical tenant farmer plowed an acre, and netted $900 for a year, if he divided his field between poppy and wheat.

The shivering laborer de ected Ozzie's queries about poppy by o ering to point out two mines. Handed $20, he agreed to place mounds of rocks at their locations after the Americans left.
" "When was that?" "This morning," the man said. "They went to fight over there." He pointed in the northerly direction of Commando, where the crackle of small arms could be heard.
As the weak sun faded in the dust, the wind picked up and blew strong from the west, driving temperatures down to a wind-chilled 14 degrees. Several miles to the north, the Marines and askars huddled in sleeping bags and blankets, shivering uncontrollably. The wind was too cutting for the Taliban to venture out. The sole friendly casualty to be evacuated from the front lines that frigid night came from Task Force Commando. Col. Newman dropped me o at the Casualty Collection Point to catch a ride out to the Special Forces base. Around midnight, two armored vehicles with their lights out drove in and a wounded Special Forces soldier gingerly climbed out. With an untrimmed beard, a tangle of hair wrapped in a grimy bandanna, and an armored vest bristling with ammo, he stood hunched over like a stumpy bear, glaring at the lights focused on him.
"Doc, take this thing out," he said to a corpsman, gesturing over his right shoulder. "Strip so I can see it," the corpsman said, accustomed to the gruffness of wounded grunts. Grumbling, the commando dumped his gear, layer by layer, the pungent smell from his sopping T-shirt driving back the onlookers. The doc shone a pencil light at an oozing hole in the back of the soldier's shoulder.
"Ugly wound. What happened?" "I caught a piece of shrapnel by being a dumbass. Now take it out." "That needs a surgeon," he said. "I'm medevacing you." ABC News correspondent Miguel Marquez eased his way forward. "Let me get a good shot," Miguel said. "I won't mention your last name." "No pic," the soldier growled. Staff Sgt. Tim Walsh had fought all over Afghanistan (Picture 37). A forty-one-year-old cop on extended leave from the Massachusetts State Police, he came from a close-knit Irish Catholic family in Boston. Prior to his current deployment, he had told a whopper to his mother and grandmother, claiming with a straight face that he was assigned to sunny Italy.
"My mother wants grandkids," he said. "She thinks I'm dating a girl in Rome." While Tim was bandaged, the senior Special Forces NCO, Master Sgt. Grady DeWitt, ducked inside a one-story house where the elderly Afghan battalion commander sat next to a warm stove. Tall and amiable-looking despite a black, dagger-shaped beard, Grady unrolled a photomap showing two Afghan companies and the Special Forces advisers two kilometers behind the Taliban lines.
"You're doing a good job with my companies," Lt. Col. Dash Ti-Gir, the battalion commander, said affably. "I'll visit you soon." His Iranian-born sergeant major asked in English a few sound questions. Grady suspected that the sergeant reported to the Iranian Republican Guard. Regardless, he was a capable soldier, and Grady listened to his advice.
Once Tim Walsh was on his way to a hospital, Grady invited me to hop into his MRAP, Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, armored vehicle. He headed north, steering by night vision goggles. When he turned left at a canal, there was a loud, crunching sound. The MRAP behind him had tumbled over, the cab hovering above the canal. Grady sprinted back and hauled out the driver, while the vehicle's machine gunner scrambled out the rear. Another two feet, and they would have pitched into frigid waters ten feet deep.
"It would suck," Grady said, "to drown by swallowing mud." They stripped the vehicle, piled into the surviving MRAP, and drove several kilometers north before entering a narrow gate, dismounting and walking into a dark, cavernous building. In the front hall, they ipped on the miner headlamps strapped to their foreheads, stripped o their outer gear, and wandered o into side rooms. They stepped over snoring bodies smelling of the unwashed and tucked inside their sleeping bags, savoring the dank, 40-degree warmth, more fortunate than the shivering Marines and askars on the lines farther to the north.
The Special Forces commander, Capt. Matt Golsteyn, nodded to me the next morning as he rushed by. During the next hour, he assigned the day's tasks to his team sections, reviewed the routes to be cleared of IEDs, paired up Afghan o cers and advisers for three combat patrols, briefed everyone on the frag order he had received from higher, set prices for buying a goat and chickens for dinner, approved payment for a schoolteacher, decided how much money to o er an informant, cleaned his M4, chatted over the radio with the regimental commander, pecked out an e-mail to his SOF commander, studied the photomap of his area, practiced a Pashto phrase with his terp, and rushed o to confer with the Afghan battalion commander. He was the Energizer Bunny with a scruffy beard.
A 2002 graduate from West Point, Matt was on his third combat tour. His wife and little boy were back at Fort Bragg in North Carolina. He had led his team for fourteen months, swapping out four members who were too rigid. Chores like hauling in supplies, manning the radios, and standing guard at three in the morning were shared without fuss.
"Our average age is thirty-one," he said. "No one yells or tells the other guy what his job is. We have to persuade Afghan o cers to change. That requires low-key, low-maintenance team players."
On the rst day of the operation, Special Operations Forces pulled a heliborne night raid deep inside southern Marja, targeting the Thunder Dome, the enormous mansion of a drug lord (Picture 38). When the sun came up, Matt had a lodgment deep inside Taliban territory. By noon, the engineers had cleared one narrow road from the rear to the T-Dome. By nightfall, Golsteyn's team and an Afghan platoon were sleeping indoors, while enemy snipers peppered the building.
The 15,000-square-foot concrete house contained eight bedrooms, six sitting rooms, an enormous center room, and four skylights. An orchard and vineyard adjoined the west side of the int-stone courtyard. To the south, the engineers had installed two piss tubes with large funnels for night aim, plus three commodes with plastic seats, a luxury on the front lines. Beyond a high wall to the east sprawled dozens of mud hovels occupied by laborers during poppy harvest season.
For years, Haji Majid, the landowner, had enjoyed an accommodating relationship with the Taliban. A week before the assault, though, an insurgent leader had banged on his door, demanding all ten trucks in his courtyard. Majid hastily complied and ed with his family to Nimroz Province, where he had other large landholdings, with title papers signed by the king in the 1950s. Poppy, of course, was grown on his lands.
About half of southern Marja operated along feudal lines. A dozen lords like Majid assigned their lands to vassals and tenant farmers. A few months before the semiannual poppy harvest, drug assessors would arrive to survey the crop and cut deals with the landowners and the Taliban protectors. Once the harvest was over, everyone in the chain was paid his cut.
"Think of it like Chicago during Prohibition," Matt said. "The bootleggers and the smugglers agreed to pay the muscle guys a percentage for protection. All part of the price of doing business. The farmers in Marja didn't resent the Taliban getting a slice. They didn't even know how much it was."
Majid's temporary eviction from T-Dome was not particularly worrisome; he owned eight other houses of even larger size. He demanded rent. He might have sued for damages as well, since the sniper fire chipped away at the facade. With its blue balustrades towering high above all other compounds, T-Dome o ered a clear point of aim from a mile away. Expecting to be attacked, Matt climbed up to the roof the morning after Tim Walsh was evacuated. He shrugged as a few rounds snapped by high overhead.
"They're shooting from half a mile," Matt said to me, "hoping to get lucky. I'll deal with them after I send out today's patrols."
The askars wouldn't move without their Special Forces advisers, while the Taliban hoped the Americans wouldn't advance if their headquarters was under constant fire.
The team had forti ed the roof with sandbags and a heavy gun on a tripod. Matt sat cross-legged behind a spotting scope, while Taylor, a weapons sergeant, squirmed into a comfortable position behind a 7.62mm sniper ri e with a ten-power scope, resting his reddish beard against the grooved rifle butt.
Although the top insurgents had ed, hard-nosed Pakistanis remained, mixed in with teenagers who were shooting to show it was their home turf. They applied pressure until they met a force that pushed back harder.
The rst shots came from the east at nine in the morning. The angle of the sun favored the shooters and Matt picked out no targets. After marking on his range card an azimuth of 38 degrees and sighting in a twenty-power spotting scope, he waited. A little after ten, a few more rounds cracked over the roof, and Matt saw his first targets.
"They're spraying and praying," Matt said. "See the green door at 40 degrees, Taylor?" "Yep. I got three with weapons along the left side of the wall," Taylor said. "Range?" "Ten-forty meters," Matt said, snapping a quick picture. "Shit, we need a Beretta." Even with the .50 caliber Beretta, hitting a man a mile away would be luck. "They'll come closer when they get bored," Matt said to me. The two men nibbled on honey and wheat bars from MRE packages and sipped Gatorade. Around noon, a mortar shell burst in a eld to their north, followed by another just outside the compound wall.
"Woody, can you help us out?" Matt said over his handheld radio. A minute later, Capt. Justin Woodru climbed the ladder and sat down. A graduate of the Naval Academy, where he captained the wrestling team, Woodru had one combat tour as the pilot of a Cobra attack helicopter. On his second tour, he was working as a Joint Tactical Air Controller and had called in over a hundred missions.
Woody didn't intend to make the military a career, and his wife and two daughters were waiting back in San Diego, where he was thinking of teaching and coaching. He and the other three Marine air controllers had grown beards and blended into the Special Forces team, sharing watches and patrols. They had become so close that Matt had designated Woody, who had a great sense of humor, as his executive officer.
"The mortar bursts were on line," Matt said. "I'll bet their FO [forward observer] is in Compound 2 or 7." Woody pointed to two numbered compounds on a photomap that showed every ditch, tree line, and structure within two miles (Picture 39). "Gruesome 56, how about a low pass east to west in Poppa Quebec Niner?" he said over a Harris radio. "We want to scare out some mortar observers."
"I'm on it," the pilot replied.
As the Cobra swept over the compounds, there was a burst of chatter over a captured Icom. "They're saying get the hell out of there," Amiri, the interpreter, shouted. Four crouched-over men ran from Compound 7 and dashed across a field. "Goddamn it, they're not carrying weapons!" Taylor said, holding fire. An hour later, another mortar shell exploded, far off line from the first two. "No spotters. They're firing blind now," Matt said. "Hope they don't kill some farmer."
In mid-afternoon, as Matt had predicted, the snipers to the east moved closer. The cracking AK rounds were no more accurate than the morning's bursts. It was a dumb move, though, because Taylor now had the low sun behind him, shining like a spotlight.
"I make three on the canal road," Matt said, looking through his scope. "Range eight-fifty." "I'm on them," Taylor said, firing three bolt-action shots in steady succession. "One staggered on your first shot," Matt said. Woody was all over the target, guiding in a fresh pair of Cobras. "Gruesome 56, check Compound 13 in Poppa Quebec," he said. "See those three guys near the blue door? Make them your rst run. Then go after the two in the canal. You are cleared hot outside the compound" (Picture 40).
"Chosin 69, we're coming around for another look." "Woody, tell them to stop dicking around," Matt said. "We have to kill someone. Two just took o on a motorcycle. The others will be gone in a minute."
We have to kill someone. A few days earlier, a missile had struck a compound in northern Marja, killing twelve women and children. After that, the Marine brigade had to ask permission from higher sta at Regional Command South, fty miles from the battle eld, before authorizing a bomb run. While Woody was talking with the pilot, Grady was on another radio explaining the situation to Col. Newman's regimental staff, which was relaying the request to Nicholson's brigade staff, which was arguing about the request with the staff at RC South.
Air support had entered a new phase. The pilot or the ground commander could be prosecuted if an audio or videotape pointed to a mistake in judgment. So pilots could and did refuse the ground commander's request. Often the enemy scurried away while the pilots and the ground commander discussed-or debated-the situation.
"My pilots can hear when the guy on the ground is rattled," a commander at Bagram Air Force Base explained. "My pilots won't drop ordnance if they don't think it's right."
The Taliban routinely red from behind the thick walls of compounds. In order to reduce civilian casualties, Gen. McChrystal ordered that ground commanders not employ indirect res unless they veri ed that no civilians were endangered-which was impossible to do in many cases.
"It's the wrong thing to do," McChrystal told me. "And we can't win a war by alienating the people."
There was an estimable moral aspect to the general's restraint. It brought to mind Prime Minister William Gladstone's reminder to the British army during the Second Afghan War in 1879: "The sanctity of human life in the hill villages of Afghanistan among the winter snows is as inviolable in the eye of Almighty God as can be your own."

The coalition, however, persisted in the belief that tighter and tighter restrictions on their own troops would cause the Afghan people to praise the coalition and condemn the Taliban. The British eld commander in Afghanistan, Maj. Gen. Nick Carter, proposed awarding medals for "courageous restraint" to troops who avoided using deadly force.
"The idea is consistent with our counterinsurgency strategy," a spokesperson explained. "Our young men and women refrain from using lethal force, even at risk to themselves, in order to prevent possible harm to civilians.… That restraint is an act of discipline and courage not much different than those seen in combat actions."

In persuading the pilots to attack a target, Matt Golsteyn had a huge advantage in the assignment of Justin Woodru as his senior air controller. As a Cobra pilot, Woody sized up the battle eld as though he were in the cockpit. He talked easily to the pilots, painting them a detailed picture of the Rules of Engagement and the target, checking the heading of the aircraft, and spelling out where he wanted what ordnance delivered, all the while explaining why his request was within the strict Rules of Engagement. "The ground commander is right here," Woody said. "He con rms we took re from those guys. We have eyes on them. Can you help us out? If you make your run on a heading of 270 degrees one click in front of my pos, o your nose you'll see the compound with the green door. The target are the ve guys under that big tree a hundred meters west of the green door. Use a short burst of 40 mike-mike after you're clear of the compound and you'll flush them out."
First one Cobra slid forward, emitting what sounded like a long burp as billows of dust swept up from the road, followed by the second Cobra.
"Chosin 69, one went down in the canal," a pilot said. "The others ducked inside the compound with the green door." "Then they've reached home plate, guys," Woody said. "That wraps it up. Appreciate your help."
The next day, Woody was sitting on the roof behind a 40mm machine gun when a single round struck the gun's sight. Being stalked by a trained sniper was bad news. Up to the north, Battalion 3-6 had run into a sniper who knew his business and had hit three Marines. While Woody focused his binoculars on the compound where the shot came from, Matt gathered a group of askars and ran across the elds. When they took re from the second compound, Matt responded with explosive rounds from a stumpy Gustav recoilless ri e. After the 84mm shells blew a small hole in the compound wall, ve Taliban tumbled out the rear, clearly visible on the pod of the F-18 circling overhead and to Woody, who was receiving the plane's video feed on a tiny handheld screen called a Rover.
When the ve took refuge among the bulrushes alongside a canal, the F-18 pounced, dropping two 250-pound bombs. It took a few minutes for the dust to settle, and a few more minutes before the F-18 reacquired a group of three crossing a eld. Through the eyepiece of the Rover, Woody watched two men carry hammock-style a body wrapped in a white cloth (Picture 41).
Reaching their fuel limit, the F-18s left, while the running ght went on for another hour, with the Taliban running from one compound to the next. The askars were certain they hit a few others, but the Taliban doggedly returned re, making it foolish for any pursuer to run across the open elds. Whether at gunpoint or not, the farmers at each compound helped the Taliban escape by providing blankets to carry the casualties and serving as porters. Eventually, the chase petered out among the ditches and tree lines.
"We call them the Body Snatchers," Matt said. "They take care of their dead. You have to respect that."
Stung by the quick pursuit, the next day the Taliban refused to approach too close, shooting from half a mile away. In such daily duels, snipers on both sides re two or three rounds, followed by a lull of hours, and then a few more rounds. Neither side o ers an easy target. After an incoming burst of re, occasionally you see the black smudges of tiny men popping up on canal banks or dodging around a compound wall.
An azimuth and range would be shouted out, the designated marksman would twist the dials on his scope and slowly squeeze the trigger. Rarely did anyone con rm a de nite hit. No target was blown o his feet, as in the movies. A few times a man crumpled in the road. Most times, a tiny figure flinched or stumbled before disappearing from sight, evidence of being struck or a near miss.
The long-distance fights had a disembodied, mechanistic character. Sniping resembled qualifying for record by shooting at a small black dot in the center of a cardboard target. Without seeing the twisted bodies and ies buzzing over blood-sopped dirt, it didn't seem like real killing. Still, reaching out and striking down one or two ghters a day did take a toll. After several days of losses, the Taliban left T-Dome alone.
Chapter 13 SETBACK Even during the rst week of the operation to clear Marja, Task Force Commando wasn't playing defense. T-Dome was only a stronghold to provide communications, food, and water. Matt urged the askars to advance from canal to canal, pushing the Taliban back. He had ruled out trying to encircle the enemy.
"No matter what tactics we use," he said, "we move too slowly. We'll never surround them, no matter what we do." Rather than employ indirect re, Gen. McChrystal's directive read that friendly forces should employ "small unit re and maneuver." Maneuver, though, was close to impossible for soldiers swathed in heavy armor.
"The Taliban ght from compounds where there are women and children," Matt said. "We can't push the Talibs out by mortar re without being blamed for civilian casualties." So when the Taliban red upon them, friendly troops opped down and unleashed a fusillade of bullets.
Since every American M4 and M16A2 ri e was equipped with a telescopic sight, the Taliban learned to stay at least 400 meters away and to shoot from behind thick walls of baked mud. The net result was that few Taliban were killed during most TICs, or Troops in Contact.
This did not mean the enemy could not be driven from an area. Matt's idea had been to leap forward to the T-Dome, then use the engineers to clear the canal roads and construct outposts in the forms of squares one kilometer on each side. He was playing the combat equivalent of checkers.
"If we establish outposts," he assured the kandak commander, "the Taliban will fall back."
The French had been successful in Tunisia and Algeria with this tactic, called arrondissement-controlling one sector, and then another and another. Although it worked in open ground, it had failed in Vietnam, where the Vietcong used the lush foliage to blow up one isolated outpost and then the next. Marja was at and already laid out like a checkerboard, with canals forming the lines between the squares on the board.
Every ghting force has its de ciencies. Afghans, while brave under re, loathed getting sopping wet in muddy canals and were overly impressed by a line of outposts. While the Taliban often walked about as unarmed farmers, they did so only at far range. They relinquished terrain rather than let the askars get close enough to question their clothes, beards, and accents.
Taliban gangs had sown a thousand mines. Matt's plan was to lead the askars through the elds, where there were few mines. Behind the askars, the engineers would sweep a road up to an intersection of two canals, where a bulldozer would throw up dirt walls to construct a hasty fort. Either the enemy retreated, or had to swim to escape. The Taliban reacted to this PacMan tactic by attacking every patrol that left T-Dome.
At dawn on February 15, 2010, Master Sgt. Grady DeWitt stood in a courtyard as sleepy askars formed into ranks. Their company commander, complaining that they were sick of eating American MREs, was demanding $200 to buy a goat for dinner.
"You get no money," Grady said. "Our job is to seize the intersection." Usually a better diplomat than Matt, Grady was angered because a goat cost $100. When the Afghan commander continued to argue, Grady signaled the three Special Forces soldiers to go on patrol alone. As the Americans left, one askar after another followed behind, including the comandante (company commander), trudging through the poppy elds. Several hundred meters to the west, a white ag waved above the Red Crescent medical center.
"Cory," Grady spoke into his helmet-mounted mouthpiece. "Talibs trying to suck us in at the clinic." Of imposing size, Sta Sgt. Cory Calkins, twenty-nine, had graduated from college with an engineering degree. He had won nine state dirt biking championships in Michigan, riding in the nationals four times. Due to deployments, he hadn't ridden his 450cc bike in two years.
"I hated working in an office," Cory said. "Now I'm paid to have fun." Hidden in the Red Crescent building and an adjoining market, the Taliban opened re when the askars were a quarter of a mile away. The askars flopped down in the soft fields, the pop-pop-pop of their fast-firing M16s mingling with the sharper cracks of Taliban AKs.
"Cory," Grady said over his radio, "work around the right flank. I'll hold here." Cory looked around. The rounds snapping by were coming from his front. About sixty meters to his right was a hardpacked dirt road, with a canal on the far side.
"Raasem mi!" he yelled. Together with about two dozen askars, he sprinted across the road, rounds cracking overhead, and slid down the canal bank (Picture 42). I stayed behind Cory, letting him have the fun.
"Whew!" He grinned, seeing that no one had been hit. The askars laughed, glad of their luck. All were kneeling under the lip of the canal bank, safe from the rounds zipping overhead. Cory signaled to Sgt. Manski to cover their rear. The full-bearded Ski, a Marine air controller, nodded back.
"Grady, I'm moving west to the market," Cory said over his radio. "I'll pop red smoke for you to shift fire." Cory scrambled forward, followed by the askars, with Ski scanning to their rear. He almost ran right past a dirt bunker on the far side of the canal. One shot from an AK inside the bunker unleashed a fusillade from the askars. As Cory slowed his pace, the shooting stopped. Seeing they were outflanked, the Taliban had pulled out.
Cory's platoon warily climbed up the canal bank, as Grady led the rest of the company forward. It wasn't much of a market-a clinic, a concrete building housing a dozen shops with their garage door fronts rolled down and padlocked, and an abandoned gas station.
Cory signaled to Amiri, an interpreter kidded for being the only human being who actually ate everything in an MRE package. His performance under re was impressive. Acting on a rumor that the Taliban had imprisoned a family somewhere in the market, Cory and Amiri walked over to the shop nearest to the clinic, smashed open the back door, and walked in. Finding no one, they headed toward the next shop.
An askar grabbed Cory's arm and pulled him back, gesturing that the market was mined. Another askar walked forward with a yellow stick attached to a battery pack, used by work crews in the States to locate underground pipes. When his metal detector sounded a high whistle, he backed away. backed away.
Most mines were detonated when weight was placed on a buried metal strand that touched another strand, sending a spark though a wire from a battery to the explosives.
"Pressure plate," Grady said. "I'll bring up the engineers to sweep the market. Cory, can you push forward to keep the snipers off us?" Invariably polite, Grady masked orders as questions. Cory's platoon turned north up the road, leaving the market on their left. When bullets whizzed past, they tumbled into a ditch in freezing water up to their waists. Cory plodded forward in the gooey mud, exhorting the Afghan company commander, who wore no beard and kept his hair carefully parted, to keep up. Some askars trailed behind him, while a dozen waded alongside Cory. After slogging for about a hundred meters, he peeked over the bank and signaled to the others. They scrambled up, ran across a narrow road, skidded heels-rst into another canal, again plunged in and waded across, emerging dripping wet on the far side.
As they gained the cover of a chest-high wall north of the gas station, there were excited bursts of Dari. Amiri was screaming, "Look! Look!," gesturing to the west. Two hundred meters away, two men in black were running toward a mosque with blue loudspeakers and three rounded entryways. Startled by targets so vulnerable, the askars looked at Cory as if he were a hunter in Africa, and they had done their job of herding the big game into the open. It was his job to shoot.
The two Taliban had ducked into the mosque. A third, with a black balaclava wrapped around his face and an AK in his left hand, hesitated alongside a wall, disconcerted by the yelling. Then he crouched over and ran for the mosque. Cory snapped o a burst and pu s of dirt leaped from the wall a foot behind the man.
"OOH!" the disappointed askars yelled. Cory, who had hit targets at 700 meters, cursed. I assured him my lips were sealed (Picture 43).
In seconds, all the askars were ring, bullets chipping the mosque, raising pockets of dust, red tracers ricocheting in crazy directions (Picture 44). The Taliban responded with a few AKs and a PKM machine gun. Rounds smacking the wall persuaded a few askars to duck. Most, excited to see the enemy so close, red back furiously. The black pu s of several RPG shells exploded in the air above the market, fty meters to the south.
"Shit," Cory muttered. "I can't see one head." His right eye was glued to his scope, barrel pointed at the mosque. He held that position for almost a minute. But no heads popped up and the PKM kept firing short bursts, with no flicker of flame giving away its position.
"They're nested deep in there," Ski said as he worked his radio.
For the next ten minutes, there was spirited conversation between Ski and Matt back at T-Dome. Although Cory was the on-scene ground commander, he did not have the nal say. When he told Ski to strike the mosque, Battalion asked if he could retreat. So Cory had said no. One of us was sure to be hit wading across the canal. Battalion then called Brigade, who called a two-star general a hundred miles from the battle eld. In the meantime, Ski was assuring the pilots that they could strike. There were only a few streaky clouds in the vivid blue sky, and no whine of a jet engine or thump of an attack helicopter was heard. Then there was a quick ripping sound that caused the hair on the back of your neck to leap as death zipped by. The earth jumped at the ash. Black chunks of earth and dust ew into the air behind the mosque as the shock wave from the explosion bu eted Cory and Ski. From 20,000 feet, far beyond the vision of the human eye, an unmanned Predator aerial vehicle controlled by a pilot in Nevada had launched a 150-pound Hellfire missile.
"Phantom Niner, you hit 100 feet west of the mosque," Ski said. "Hard night at the MGM Grand?" "You wish," the pilot replied. "They climbed out a back window. Two motorcycles now headed northeast."
The askars looked back at Cory, awaiting orders. Their company commander had remained on the far side of the canal. Cory yelled and threatened to relieve him, but he didn't budge. Amiri chimed in, shouting "Kuru! Kuru!" as if shouting at a donkey. The askars laughed, but the Afghan commander didn't budge. Cory took command and assigned firing sectors to each askar. Seeing this, a tough Tajik platoon leader took Amiri aside. "Cory, the lieutenant say the Afghans will handle it," Amiri said, "after the fight." "Fine," Cory said. "But we protect the market." From the mosque, the PKM had a direct eld of re at the engineers sweeping the market. Cory climbed onto a sagging mud rooftop with Ski to adjust re, followed by a thin, elderly askar machine gunner who never left Cory's side. Soon, the askar was ring long bursts at a motorcycle with two men in black scooting to the north.
"Can't see a weapon," Cory said, not telling the askar to cease firing. On the ground, the Afghan commander finally crossed the canal and began yelling loudly. "Amiri," Cory shouted down, "what's going on?" "They found a Talib Icom at the mosque," Amiri yelled back, "and he is arguing with the Talibs about who is a true Muslim." "Tell him to shut up! He's compromising all the frequencies we could listen to!"
Then came a sharp blast behind them. Cory grabbed the radio as a tall smoke plume rose over the market. "Five Marines down," he said. "Two are KIA." An hour earlier, the engineers had started their sweep, beginning at the clinic. As they approached the shop Cory had entered by the back door, the askars found two men huddling by a ditch. Nearby were two artillery shells. Shouting that the men were Talibs, the askars pushed them in front of the Marines. When they pulled up the shutter to the shop, it exploded in a huge blast that shot molten metal through the Afghans and the Marines behind them.
Knocked o his feet, the engineer platoon commander, Lt. Michael Barry, scrambled up and called for a medevac. Two Army Black Hawks were on their way within minutes. At T-Dome, the Special Forces soldiers in T-shirts grabbed their ri es and aid packs and sprinted to the scene.
The explosion had ripped apart the two Afghans and mortally wounded the two Marines behind them-carefree, funny Lance Cpl. Larry
Johnson and generous, diligent Sgt. Jeremy McQueary, who left behind a wife and a ve-month-old boy. Working quickly, the SF soldiers staunched the bleeding of three others, while red smoke was popped and the helicopters landed. When a photographer hopped out of a medevac chopper, Special Forces Sgt. Michael Taylor handled him roughly, angry at his presence. "I think I'm in trouble for pushing that guy around," Taylor said, referring to the photographer. "Forget it," I said. "He won't mention it." With a soft evening sun at their backs, the tired Marines, the SF soldiers in T-shirts smeared with blood, and the askars walked through the poppy fields back to base. When a few rounds snapped close by overhead, no one stopped to return fire. "We've been at this too long," Taylor said, "when we start ignoring them." At that moment, the soldiers didn't care. They were quiet, sensing war's capriciousness. Cory and Amiri had entered by a back door, and survived. Johnson and McQueary had entered from the front, and were gone. Once back inside the T-Dome, no one had much to say.
"We got a list of twenty-one mullahs from that mosque," Bob, the intelligence sergeant, said as the team stripped o their soggy gear. "Seventeen have rupees entered after their names. They're on the Talib payroll."
Matt nodded in a distracted way. "Send the list to higher," he said. "Make some room in here." It was pitch black when the engineers walked in and sat on cots arranged in a square. Some absently smacked the wall. Losing ve out of thirty in one platoon was a hard hit. A few turned on miner lights while the Special Forces soldiers pulled up cots and boxes in an outer circle.
" For the next hour, Krist led the group in a round of profane, disrespectful, absurd, lthy, zany jokes about whites, blacks, Hispanics, homosexuals, o cers, soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. Ten years older than the Marines, the Special Forces soldiers shook their heads at the absurd teenage jokes. The common theme of the humor was life's harshness, with indignity heaped upon the gentle, the kind, and each other.
Humor was a shell, not a lack of sensitivity. The platoon had written letters about Johnson and McQueary. (See Appendix A.) But on the lines, they didn't dwell on losses, or mutter that they might be next. Matt brought out a bottle of Jack Daniel's.
"I kept this for a special occasion," he said. "A toast to our lost brothers." Each took a swallow and passed the bottle to the next Marine or soldier.
Six miles to the north of Task Force Commando, the two Marine battalions were ghting the same sort of war, battling snipers, freezing nights, occasional machine guns, sopping mud, and the evil mines. For the Taliban, it was like facing a steamroller. You could see it slowly coming, and you couldn't stop it.
On the fourth day, Gen. Nicholson and Sgt. Maj. Ernest Hoopi went to a market where the new district governor was holding a shura. "We are all Taliban here," an elder said. "You represent a corrupt and murderous government. I'll give you a chance. But if you betray me, I'll kill you and your entire family."
The meeting quickly broke up and Nicholson stayed to talk with his Marines when Taliban in a nearby tree line opened re. As rounds pinged into the dirt, the sergeant major rushed forward, shouting and thrusting Marines into ring positions. Suddenly, a hand grabbed him by the shoulder and pulled him back.
"Dad," Lance Cpl. Sean Hoopi said, "I got it." Something like that happened every time a Taliban gang made a stand to ght. Marines jostled each other to get to the best ring positions, while others ran around the anks, anxious to shoot someone. Within a few days, Taliban commanders in Pakistan were calling over satellite phones, urging their fighters to disperse. As more patrols spread out, fewer made contact.
On the seventh day of the operation, few shots were red. The Marines had semi-cleared Marja at a cost of eight Americans and six askars. About a hundred Taliban had died, and several hundred had escaped. Some cached their weapons and picked up hoes, while others drove off into the desert. They could resume fighting, provided the farmers did not betray them to the incoming Afghan government.
Once the ghts petered out, Afghan o cials chosen months earlier-what Gen. McChrystal called "a government in a box"-moved in to manage Marja. Shuras were held with elders and mullahs. A civilian District Support Team arrived, offering millions in projects.
"We reached out to everyone," Nicholson said.
In early March of 2010, Karzai visited Marja, promising honest government. Karzai made little impression upon farmers distrustful of any police. The new district governor spent most of his time behind a desk that sagged under a stack of unread reports and unsigned papers. After a few months of ctitious management, he was red because he was illiterate. Why he had been appointed in the rst place remained a mystery.
Marja was the tenth major operation in four years in Helmand. The Taliban had regained their footing after the rst nine operations. Regeneration via sleeper cells had proven impossible to prevent in the past. Two months after the operation in early 2010, IEDs continued to explode in Marja and anyone accepting a job from the government was threatened, with occasional assassinations.
When the poppy harvest arrived in late April, the Marines ignored the farmers with blackened hands who were collecting the sunburnt opium pitch. Eradication would turn the farmers against them. Yet drugs were a main source of income for the Taliban. In 2008, 7,500 metric tons of wet, unre ned opium pitch came from areas controlled by the Taliban.

Based on phone intercepts, the Marines believed the Taliban had su ered severe nancial losses. Others disagreed, claiming that drug money was not critical to Taliban nances. Whatever the sophisticated digital systems for tracking monetary transfers, the headquarters of the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul was unable to resolve the disagreement.
Task Force Commando, combining 400 Afghans with forty Americans, was a quasi-colonial organization. The Special Forces led the operations (Picture 45), while Marines provided engineers, re support, and secure roads to logistics bases. The commando team didn't o er suggestions; it expected to be obeyed. In a tight spot, air was the weapon of choice. Without the Americans, the Afghan battalion would have foundered.
"We're the insurgents here," Matt said, "and we're selling a poor product called the Kabul government. The district has been Taliban for years. The people believe Kabul's the enemy. Now we're here with askars who are Tajiks and Uzbeks-outsiders like us."
Once there was less ghting, Matt called several shuras in the nine villages-called blocks-in his area, o ering projects to the elders. Twice a huge man in his late forties showed up, but didn't say a word. Matt assumed he was a small-time Taliban enforcer. After a third shura, he lingered to talk. You're talking to the wrong people, he said. We want to know what you're offering us.
After that, Matt met regularly with Tahik Thah (false name). His picture was sent to SOF. He's connected, came the reply. Thah, who had seven known aliases, had been previously mentioned as a go-between in eight separate target packages. Trained by the Pakistani ISI in the 1980s, he was linked to the shura that coordinated Taliban activities from the Pakistani city of Quetta. SOF had a picture of him standing next to a child suicide bomber in a propaganda clip lmed in Quetta, and he was part of the shura that cut a deal with the British forces at Musa Qala in 2005.
"He wanted to know what our angle was," Matt said. "We were sounding each other out. I had no proof to arrest him, and I didn't want to. It was more valuable to talk to an emissary from the enemy."
When Thah o ered safe conduct to meet with people in Quetta, Matt laughed and countered by suggesting Guantánamo. Absurdities aside, Thah did call Matt one day, sternly warning that a suicide bomber had slipped into the area, focused on T-Dome. Thah said he had called Quetta, urging the recall of the bomber, who was killed by a sniper a few days later.
The warning convinced Matt that Thah liked him on a personal level. War was war, though, and they were enemies. Matt arranged a meeting between Thah and Col. Newman with the same results-personal cordiality and political concrete. Both sides were reporting to their superiors. But there was little to say. Task Force Commando was there to win, and so was the Taliban. Hey, Matt said, you're welcome to come over to our side anytime you want.
One day, Matt called Thah on his cell phone and there was no answer. He had gone back to Pakistan. The Taliban had watched the Americans doling out projects and the Kabul government taking edgling steps toward governance. The drug dealers had seen poppy pickers turned back at checkpoints. That was all the information the Quetta shura in Pakistan needed to learn. There would be no deal in Marja.
At the ISAF level, the generals read dozens of reports about men like Thah. They were genuine Taliban, and yet many were outraged by the corruption of the Kabul government. They reached out in odd ways to Karzai even more than to the Americans. These back channels and feelers went on during every war. Most never led anywhere.
For a few months in the early spring of 2010, Marja replaced Nawa as the success story of the surge. In late March, Obama ew to Afghanistan. To an audience of cheering American soldiers, he said, "Our troops have pushed the Taliban out of their stronghold in Marja."

The Taliban had launched a Murder & Intimidation campaign. M&I wasn't di cult for thugs who knew everyone and moved around with impunity, carrying only shovels like other farmers. They needed nothing else for their work. Stories abounded of night letters and beatings. In an eight-week span, eight elders were beheaded. Finding dollar bills in the pocket of an eight-year-old boy, the Talibs hanged him.
The enforcers sped on their cycles from one end of Marja to the other in forty minutes. Even a few seemed to be many when they could pop up anywhere with the same message: The Americans are leaving and we're staying.
When Adm. Mullen dropped in, he encountered a rock-throwing mob. After he left, Newman strode into the mob, demanding an explanation. It seemed a Marine lance corporal had taken religious lessons from a mullah and converted to Islam. The next day, the Taliban claimed the corporal had been sent back to the States in chains. Newman summoned the corporal to reassure the mob. Newman then asked why, after the Marines had fixed up their market, they had thrown rocks.
"Well," one man replied, "we didn't hit you." When Gen. McChrystal visited, he bought bread in the market and asked the district governor whether he liked the bakery. The governor said he had never before been in the market. In a testy mood, McChrystal took the Marines aside and asked why the ghting was still going on, referring to Marja as "a bleeding ulcer."
McChrystal told Newman that he didn't have all the time in the world to get the job done. "I can give you a slow win, General," Newman said, "or a fast loss. A fast win isn't possible. The people won't cooperate." Unfortunately, the Marine enthusiasm for the operation, and how the press portrayed it, left the false impression that a fast win was possible.
The Taliban had governed Marja o and on for the past fteen years. Most farm compounds boasted several motorcycles and a tractor, purchased from poppy sales. Throughout Marja, there were small minarets with loudspeakers on at roofs. A mullah had no reliable source of wealth. In terms of status, he was like an itinerant preacher in nineteenth-century America who made his own way based on his oratorical skills. When the Taliban o ered to pay the mullahs to preach radical Islam, most accepted. Both the pro t motive and religious populism were working against winning hearts and minds.
Matt Golsteyn was initially enthusiastic; the negotiations with Thah hadn't gone anywhere, but at least the Taliban seemed willing to talk. In February, one local Taliban leader, Asif, had asked for amnesty for his eight ghters. By mid-April, though, Asif acted as if Grady DeWitt-his primary contact-were a stranger. What do you want? Asif mumbled. No, Grady replied, the question is what do you want to bring over your men. I have no men, Asif said; I want nothing.
Grady met individually with his informers. They gave him worthless gossip. The IEDs were back, and the people were sullen and noncommunicative. The crops were withering and Brig. Gen. Nicholson was o ering jobs to everyone to clean out the canals. Few were willing to work. He was paying $400 to every farmer willing to renounce poppy growing. Many accepted the stipend, but the results wouldn't be known for a year, if then.
"Some of the farmers," Matt said, "were squatters, especially on the outskirts, like in Block 10. I couldn't persuade the squatters to defend lands the government might take away from them. That was a minority, though. The majority had no excuse for not guarding their own blocks."
Armed forces can control a population without winning its allegiance. In Northern Ireland, for instance, the British army controlled the Catholic population. Polls showed that the Catholics did not want to be ruled by the IRA. But the Catholics never sided with the British army against the IRA. Similarly, the farmers of Marja might not elect the Taliban, but they weren't standing against them either.
Only one of the thirteen blocks in Matt's area had organized a self-protection watch. That block had a tight-knit sub-tribe, but they wouldn't accept the coalition's offer to pay $90 a month to each watch stander who would obey the orders of the district police chief.
"The Marja people think we're poor negotiators," Matt said. "We take the risks, and give them something for nothing. We haven't found a way to tap into their incentive system. They play by Taliban rules and stay safe at night."
Beating the Taliban wasn't part of the American lexicon for the war. In a lecture at the National Defense University, Secretary of Defense Gates emphasized, "Where possible, kinetic operations should be subordinate to measures to promote better governance, economic programs to spur development, and e orts to address the grievances among the discontented."

In contrast to the 2006 manual, the post-Vietnam manual on counterinsurgency written in 1980 had a hard core: "Concentrate on destruction or neutralization of the enemy force, not on terrain."
The two manuals stressed di erent approaches. In 1980, the focus was upon destroying the insurgents in order to protect the population. In 2006, the focus was upon protecting the population in order to render the insurgents impotent.
The premise that billions of dollars in aid would turn the tribes against the Taliban had not been validated. The necessity to ght had. The Taliban were tough, and the Pashtun tribes admired toughness. Time and again, company-grade o cers, confronting the tribal realities in their areas of operations, urged an aggressive approach.
In the Korengal, Capt. Jimmy Phillips, awarded the MacArthur Medal for Leadership, said, "We must kill to change this war." Lt. Jake Kerr, adopted into a Pashtun tribe as "Brave Son," said, "We have to get out in the hills and hunt them down, like Ranger School teaches." Tech Sgt. Andy Moore, veteran of a hundred ghts in Konar and Nuristan, said, "We're too road-bound. We can't just return re. We have to get after them." Capt. Mike Harrison, Harvard-bound and popular throughout the Konar, said, "I should have been tougher, getting after the Taliban secret cadres." At Man Bear Pig in Nawa, Marine Sgt. Robert Kightlinger said, "The fuckers know our rules better than we do." In Marja, Special Forces Capt. Matt Golsteyn said, "We have to kill someone." These grunts weren't callous or ignorant. None was advocating irresponsible tactics like large, blundering sweeps. But for them, nonkinetic counterinsurgency as a war-winning approach had overpromised and underdelivered. The Taliban were erce ghters. The tribes on the battle elds lived hard lives. They did not weigh political factors as if they were in a classroom. They saw that both sides had guns. They were watching to see which side would win. The company commanders understood that. Chapter 14
Since the invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, the civilian-military relationships inside the coalition had remained muddled, year after year. The United States welcomed the involvement of NATO as a rming Western solidarity-an attack on one was an attack on all twenty-eight member states. At the same time, for years the United States kept most of its forces separate from the NATO command structure.
On the civilian side, all the a ected parties-Afghan o cials, NATO, the United Nations, the United States-could not agree on an ambassador accorded plenipotentiary powers equivalent on the civilian side to those of the four-star American commander (called COMISAF, or Commander, International Security Assistance Force).
In 2009, Obama appointed Ambassador Holbrooke as his top envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan, while Eikenberry served as the ambassador in Afghanistan. Both had a chilly relationship with Karzai. Obama himself had initially ignored Karzai, and then lectured him, before settling into a tolerant but distant relationship. Of the top Americans, Karzai heeded most the counsel of Gen. McChrystal, a straightforward man in charge of the military activities of forty-three contributing nations.
Then in late June of 2010, Rolling Stone magazine ran an article entitled "The Runaway General" that featured behind-the-scenes remarks by McChrystal and his sta . The NSC adviser, retired Gen. Jim Jones, was depicted as a "clown," Holbrooke as overbearing, Biden as foolish, and Eikenberry as cunning and self-centered.
It was unclear what aide supposedly said what. McChrystal's sta said the remarks were in a social setting o the record. They had a strong case. Established journalists in similar settings-a hotel room, a bar, a gym-routinely hear senior o cials and their sta s blow o steam by ranting about other high o cials. Most reporters do not print such "locker room" talk. If they believe some remarks are pertinent to a story, they will ask for comments on the record. The reporter for Rolling Stone had breached the bond of trust that must be preserved between the military and the press. If the military distrusts reporters, the public will not understand the battles in which their daughters and sons fight.
Secretary of Defense Gates was cautious about overreacting by ring McChrystal. After all, Gen. McKiernan had been red a year earlier in order to bring in McChrystal. Obama, though, had been having a rough spring. His job approval rating had dropped below 50 percent. Most ominously for his political fortunes, his rating as a leader had plummeted from 63 percent to 44 percent over the past eighteen months.

A HERO RETURNS TO STAGGERING CHALLENGES Obama asked Gen. David Petraeus to leave Central Command and take over in Afghanistan. No general was better quali ed. Petraeus had a track record of success in Iraq, a coterie of brilliant sta o cers, and rsthand experience in dealing with foreign governments, the U.S. Congress, and the White House. He projected candor while being diplomatic, a rare combination. Petraeus was a great asset to the president. The press and the Congress were smitten by the smart, political general. He could not be red, which gave him some breathing room in confronting three staggering challenges.
The rst was time. In late 2009, according to White House sources, Obama said to Petraeus, "If you can't do the things you say you can in 18 months [summer of 2011], then no one is going to suggest we stay, right?" Petraeus responded: "Yes, sir, in agreement."

Karzai complained that the rm date had given a "morale boost" to the Taliban.

The second challenge was stopping the momentum of the Taliban. In addition to corruption and increasing violence, an assessment sent to the NATO ministers in Brussels classified 122 districts as under government control, and 137 as not under control. 
5
"The briefers are con dent we're nailing the Taliban," he said. "Taliban commanders shouldn't invest in 401(k)s. A few months after they take command, our SOF [Special Operations Forces] take them out."
In the summer of 2010, columnist David Ignatius revealed speci c data about the e ects of SOF. "The Special Forces campaign involves 125 to 150 operations each month," he reported. "In the past four months, 525 insurgents had been detained or killed, including 130 who are district commanders or higher." 
6
The third challenge was to continue the nation-building strategy based on protecting and winning over the Pashtun population, while coaxing Karzai to perform better. President Bush had routinely called him and treated him with deference. Naturally, Karzai then ignored coaxing Karzai to perform better. President Bush had routinely called him and treated him with deference. Naturally, Karzai then ignored pressure from all other U.S. officials.
So President Obama was initially stando sh. When Karzai persisted in ignoring the thievery of his cronies, Obama changed his method, ying to Kabul to urge Karzai to shape up. Karzai responded by childish public outbursts, even threatening to join the Taliban. The Obama administration then adopted a diplomatic approach in public.
When Petraeus took over, he ordered a clampdown on corruption. No reliable ruling class had emerged. The practical core of democracynamely, the development of more than one political party with patronage-was missing. The approach of the Western coalition had enabled Karzai to consolidate one-man rule and to reward those who supported him and stole on a massive scale.

The Afghan forces were years away from standing on their own. Despite $14 billion in aid, only forty of 150 battalions could operate without coalition forces, and only 12 percent of the district police forces were considered adequately trained and reliable in combat. 
10
The goal was to increase the Afghan army and police, which in 2010 numbered 200,000, to more than 300,00 by October 2011. 
11
12
As he had done in Iraq, throughout the summer of 2010 Petraeus invited to Afghanistan the press, intellectuals, and members of Congress. He provided the context and let them see the enormity of the e ort. Most supported his strategy, which relied on his model of protecting the population. Since the Pashtun tribes were not turning against the Taliban, as the Iraqi Sunnis had turned against their insurgency, not much was gained. The Afghan forces weren't capable of stopping the enemy's momentum. The U.S. military was, but would not stay inde nitely. Skillful though Petraeus was as a political general-in the complimentary sense of that term-as long as the president and the U.S. Congress remained uncommitted for the long haul, the future of the war remained in doubt.
Chapter 15
According to Vice President Biden, "the president has made something exquisitely clear to each of the generals: He said, 'Do not occupy any portion of that country that you are not con dent within 18 months you're going to be able to turn over to the Afghans.' "

So what is good enough for us to leave? To answer this question, I went back to Marja, and then on to another district, Garmsir.
Marja illustrated the problem. In February of 2010, the Marines had pushed out the overt Taliban force. The secret cadre, passively supported by many farmers, remained in place. Drug dealers fought back. IEDs and harassing attacks continued. So the Marines had to stay. Battalion 2-6, commanded by Lt. Col. Kyle Ellison, took responsibility for southern Marja in the summer of 2010. On his third combat tour, Ellison knew the challenges he faced.
"The insurgents use motorcycles," he said to me, "to move around the interior canal roads. They hide their weapons in the weeds along the canals. The people won't dime them out. I'll show you."
On a brutally hot day in early August, we drove in two MRAPs several kilometers to the Kuru Bazaar, which had served as a Taliban headquarters for a decade. As Ellison strolled through the bazaar, merchants scarcely looked up. About forty stalls and shops, many with living quarters on the second oor, were open. About a hundred men, and no women, were browsing among the modest wares and vegetables, filling a few plastic bags with sundry items. "How's business?" Ellison asked a solemn-looking merchant sitting cross-legged on a blue prayer rug. "Terrible," said Ibrahim, who was selling bags of rice and an array of spices. "Before, business was good. Two hundred shops were open here."
Ibrahim, who had the Afghan air for exaggeration, pointed at a row of about fty shuttered shops (Picture 46). "Before" meant when the Taliban had been in charge.
"Our lives are over now," Ibrahim said.
A crowd gathered to listen as Ibrahim defended the good old days and Ellison argued that without the Taliban, the children would be educated and enjoy a better life.
"When will you open the school?" Ibrahim asked. "By September," Ellison said. Because Kabul paid teachers only $70 a month, Ellison had signed up only four teachers. His sta was studying congressional regulations, hoping to supplement the pay by buying every teacher a motorcycle as a "necessary conveyance for Afghan o cials." The regulations allowed that.
Another man shouted from the crowd that he wanted to be paid for damages to his house. Haroom, Ellison's interpreter from San Francisco, ignored him.
"Most of these people support the Taliban and the drug trade," Haroom said. "They want things for nothing." Several shopkeepers turned away as the small Marine patrol passed. One man in a brown dishdasha came up, holding the hand of a sevenyear-old girl with a white bandage around her head. Several days earlier, she had fallen and cracked her head. Her father had frantically waved at a passing patrol. The corpsman had staunched the bleeding and medevaced her. Now she was home, beaming under the attention, surrounded by children envious of her new pink sunglasses (Picture 47). The farmer sincerely shook Ellison's hand.
There wasn't any doubt everyone in that market knew the Americans intended no harm. No one acted afraid, or even stepped out of the way. With the exception of the farmer, though, no one was friendly either. As Ellison wandered farther down the street, a man in a white dishdasha stepped forward and spoke loudly, attracting a crowd.
"He says the Marines beat up his friends," Haroom said.
As the crowd pressed in to listen, Ellison patiently backed the man down, sentence by sentence. Well, yes, Taliban had red on a Marine patrol from his friend's house. The Taliban then ran away. The Marines called for the Afghan police, who beat the owner after the Marines had left. So why were the Marines at fault? Because, said the man, if the Marines had stayed out of Marja, the Taliban would not have entered his friend's house.
Ellison gestured at the narrow dirt road leading through the market. While motorcycles were common, perhaps three cars passed the market in a day. Yesterday, a white van had driven through the market. An hour later, a Marine patrol engaged a sniper farther down the road. The white van stopped and two men hopped out with AKs. A Marine shot the driver and the other two surrendered.
"You all knew that white van didn't belong here," Ellison rebuked the crowd. "You did not warn us. Instead, you complain, telling a silly story that was all mixed up."
Told later about the argument, Lt. Col. Hezbollah, a kandak commander who had served in Marja, burst out laughing. "The Taliban were listening to every word," he said. "Until the storekeepers see we are winning, they will not support us. What's wrong with that?" Ellison left the skeptics at the bazaar and drove along the bumpy path toward the western boundary of his zone. Along the way, he requested a situation report.
"
The AO [area of operations] is quiet," the ops o cer replied over the radio. "Three incidents of SAF [small arms re], one PID [positive identi cation] resulting in two EKIA [enemy killed in action], and one IED [improvised explosive device] found, plus a DFC [Directional Fragmentation Charge] detonation on Route Elephant. One canal in Block 4 is overflowing and the road is closed. That's all."
That's all? For any police department in the States, three shootings, two criminals shot down in the streets, two bombs on a highway, and a
That's all? For any police department in the States, three shootings, two criminals shot down in the streets, two bombs on a highway, and a local flooding would not be considered a quiet morning.
"The ood was caused by weeds choking the canal," Haroom said. "The elds are drying up, and the people don't organize to clean out the weeds."
The decay of the canal system symbolized the inability to work together for the common good. "My father was the director of agriculture here in Marja," Haroom said. "All my family left this country. Know why? In Kabul, if you don't have money or political connections, no one cares about your quali cations. I swear, a graduate of MIT who had no connections would not be hired to fix canals in Marja."
"Three blocks in south Marja solidly support the Taliban," Ellison said. "One block opposes the Taliban, and nine refuse to do anything. We're heading to Block 10, my biggest headache."
At Outpost One Zulu on the western edge of Block 10, Cpl. Chris DiBiase was in charge of ve Marines and six askars. The OP consisted of a circle of HESCO barriers topped with a row of double sandbags and three sentry towers, each with a machine gun.
"We get shot at about every other day," DiBiase said, "from that strip of houses to the west. We know they're coming because the children disappear. We try to pretend we're not prepared, but they're not stupid. All they do is stick an AK over a wall, spray and pray, hop on their cycles, and take off."
Ellison walked down the road a few hundred meters to the sister outpost called Justice, set up in mutual support with One Zulu. Sgt. Christopher Austin gave a similar report.
"We need a platoon to clear the next block, sir," he said. "The Talibs are getting bolder. They drive up on their cycles without weapons, so we can't shoot. Twenty minutes later, they hit us from across the canal with AKs and a few RPGs. The other day, we dropped one fucker. An hour later, sixteen bikers escort a co n up to that cemetery on the hill to the west, like they're Hell's Angels or something. No weapons, so we couldn't shoot. Pissed us off. We going out on an ambush tonight."
The tiny outposts with a few cots, piles of sandbags, and stacks of MREs, manned by Americans and Afghans, bore a striking resemblance to the Combined Action Platoons in Vietnam. The di erence was equally striking, though. In Vietnam, the villagers chose sides. Farmers stood guard watches and learned how to patrol. In the afternoons, the Americans wandered through the hamlets, joking with families and eating peanuts and duck eggs, plus Cokes and an occasional beer chilled on an ice block.
When Sgt. White, a CAP squad leader, rotated home from one village in 1967, the elders wrote a letter to his family: In Marja, no village elder ever wrote a letter of thanks. Instead, the opposite was true; 99 percent of Marja residents in a survey said that U.S. military operations were bad for the people. 
3
After chatting with Sgt. Austin about his ambush plan, Ellison headed back to the open road. Austin looked warily from side to side while pretending to adjust his ri e strap. They were waiting for a local ghter to take a potshot. Sometimes the technique of trolling rewarded an alert grunt with a PID (positive identification), but not often.
Seeing several men squatting in the shade of a small mosque, Ellison crossed a canal and walked toward them. One man with a green shawl wrapped around his face stood up and walked forward. After the usual greetings, Ellison asked why the men were hanging around (Picture 48 Brigade was partnered at T-Dome with the Special Forces and a Marine platoon. "I am Pashtun, so Marja people invite me to tea," he said. "They've been for years with the Talibs. They say we need to beat the Talibs. They won't do it for us."
But who had to beat the Talibs? U.S. Marines, or Afghans with U.S. advisers? It was a safer bet to leave Ellison and his battalion. Every American battalion in country argued that its mission was not yet complete, and moving entailed tactical risk. At the strategic level, the larger risk was presidential impatience leading to a larger cut in the overall force. There had to be progress somewhere.
Between the secret Taliban cadres and drug dealers with links to government o cials, Marja would be a mess for years. The four sequenced phases of counterinsurgency were clear, hold, build, transition. Marja had been cleared, leaving the choice of transitioning to hold and build, or holding and building with a U.S. battalion before transitioning. With the full complement of Task Force Commando-meaning Marine engineers, a ri e platoon, road-clearing teams, and re support-Golsteyn's Special Forces team had held southern Marja with a ratio of one American to nine Afghan soldiers. Such adviser task forces o ered the means of transitioning the war at a faster pace, albeit with a higher tactical risk.
Clear, hold, build, transition. While Marja remained a tough nut because the farmers, drug dealers, and Taliban had common interests in resisting government control, American combat power in other districts had cleared large areas of armed Taliban. Garmsir provided the classic example of the choice that would confront the U.S. high command in mid-2011: What to do if security improves in local areas, while government remains a mess? Is it enough to clear, hold, and leave the build phase entirely to the Afghans? I had heard that in Garmsir-at the very bottom of Afghanistan-the clear-and-hold phase was progressing well. So I hopped a ride south to take a look.
Viewed from the air, the twisting course of the Helmand River resembled a cobra about to strike. The Snakehead district of Garmsir, home to 100,000 conservative Pashtuns, was seventy kilometers long, with the Green Zone of farm elds extending ten kilometers on either side of the river.
Beginning in 2006, the British and Taliban had fought to a stando in Garmsir. The Brits held on to the district town, but weren't able to advance outside it. As in other districts in Helmand, they were under siege. In the summer of 2009, Gen. McChrystal assigned most of Helmand to the U.S. Marines. Ambassador Eikenberry quipped from Kabul, "It was bad enough dealing with 42 nations, without adding 'Marine-istan.' "

"The Talibs don't like the saman dirian [Marines]," said Kites, an Afghan-American interpreter from Las Vegas on his second rotation. "They hit Lt. Col. McDonough [the commander of 2-2] with an IED. He was medevaced to the States and returned to ght. The Talibs say saman dirian have too much enthusiasm."
When 2-2 rotated home, Battalion 3-1 came in and gradually deployed combined American and Afghan squads in an interlocking series of outposts. On a map, the patrol areas looked like a string of pearls extending south from the Snakehead.
"Each squad leader is on his own," the battalion commander, Lt. Col. Ben Watson, said. "My guidance is sixteen-hour days, with two or more patrols a day. We can hold that pace for our seven months."
The battalion averaged over ninety patrols a day-the highest number of patrols by one battalion in Afghanistan. The combined platoons lived in tents and mud shelters, without air-conditioning as temperatures soared above 110 degrees. Living with nothing in the heat, friction was inevitable between the young Marines and young Afghans.
"I told every squad leader to stop being a macho Marine," Sgt. Maj. Scott Samuels said, "just when he had his rst combat command. That's not what a corporal wants to hear."
To a twenty-one-year-old corporal who had su ered the indignities of Marine boot camp, sensitivity to human feelings was an unnatural act. But pride and honor meant more than reason or justice to young askars, who were quick to take o ense. After one corporal engaged in repeated shoving matches with his Afghan partner, Watson threatened to relieve him. The worried corporal seemed to amend his ways, but a week later the askar went into a dark sulk.
While on patrol, he had snatched a melon from a vegetable stand. When the corporal suggested he pay for it, the askar had laughed. So the corporal gave the vendor a dollar and walked on. Feeling publicly humiliated, the askar wanted to desert, despite the fact that he had no idea how to get back to Kabul.
"Then it hit me," Watson said. "With all that testosterone, those guys wanted to ght. So I started rotating every combined platoon to the south, where the fighting was constant. Everyone got a chance to get into a scrap. That bonded them."
Afghans were far rougher in dealing with one another. Capt. Jim Kenneley of Lima Company was partnered with Lt. Amir, a thirty-year-old Tajik. Amir claimed to be a mullah, which impressed the Garmsir elders until they noticed he never visited a mosque. Skinny as a rod and wearing fatigues two sizes too large, he was forever crowing that he was a battle chief. Kenneley too was down to skin and bones after four combat tours. His lean face was deeply creased and he shrugged o pretensions. He initially wrote o Amir as a harmless braggart, only to learn to keep him on a very short leash.
Shortly after Amir arrived, the elders complained to Kenneley that Amir had threatened to lash them in public unless they cut down the corn elds where the Taliban were hiding their weapons. No, no, Kenneley protested; the Afghan army respected the tribes. No Afghan o cer would mistreat them. Just then, Amir stormed into the room, shrieking and looking like the skeleton of death, whip in hand. Surprised to see Kenneley, he stopped, shook the whip at the cringing elders, and strode out.
Kenneley followed him, asking what the hell he was doing. "The battles have made me mad," Amir calmly explained. "When I see Pashtuns, my mind play tricks. I have your PTSD. Perhaps you Americans can give me a pension."
Sooner rather than later, money intrudes into most conversations in Afghanistan. Putting aside his whip, Amir opened up a store near the outpost. A week later, he whispered to Kenneley that he had located two Taliban informants; they just happened to own stores that o ered lower prices.
Amir believed that the more he struck fear into people, the more they cooperated. Nomad Kuchi tribes, which knew quite a bit about the Taliban, moved through Garmsir. So when Kenneley suggested holding a shura with them, Amir drove out to their camp and returned with ve elders handcu ed and under guard. Kenneley released them and counseled Amir, who agreed to send a written invitation. Unbeknown to the Marines, it read: Show up or my Marines will throw you in jail. When the Kuchis didn't show up, Amir drove to the market in a Hilux, pistol in hand, banging on the horn. He darted hither and fro through the startled shoppers, grabbing those who had Kuchi features. He threw six men into jail and hid out from Kenneley. When the Kuchi elders agreed to attend a shura, Amir released his hostages.
Trust Tajiks, Amir told a bemused Kenneley, not Kuchis, Pashtuns, or Uzbeks. "I now have an Amir watch," Kenneley said. "A Marine watches Amir wherever he goes." Hostage taking was common on both sides. Kenneley learned that if he detained a suspect for questioning and only one elder came to ask for his release, then most likely the suspect was innocent or a very small sh. If a dozen elders swore he was innocent and demanded his release, the detainee was a Taliban leader who wielded serious leverage over the tribe.
Kenneley worked out a deal with Haji Ramjir, the head elder in the area. Every time Ramjir came to ask for a prisoner's release, he went through the same posturing, yelling, stomping his feet, stroking his beard, and waving his hands. Kenneley remained unmoved. But if Ramjir at some point tapped his knee slightly, that meant that the Taliban had taken hostages. In those cases, Kenneley argued back, but gradually relented and in the end handed the prisoner over.
"Am I being played by Ramjir?" Kenneley said. "Maybe sometimes. But I have to trust some local leader. I don't want hostages beheaded because I didn't listen. There are acts within acts that no American will ever figure out, including whether the tribes can work together."
Every villager bumped into at least one patrol every day. Because the outposts were about two kilometers apart, the Taliban couldn't nd many seams to slip in, shoot, and get away.
"Still, right outside the town of Garmsir," Lt. Col. Watson said, "the elders complained that a Taliban had threatened them. One man, unarmed, pushed them around. That passive attitude drives me crazy. The people have an inordinate fear of the Taliban; they won't stand up for themselves."
That was the crux of the matter. In the States or in Afghanistan, people are not protected by a few security patrols a day. Protection lies in informing security forces that respond by pursuing the criminals. The complete combination of informants, pursuit, arrest, and punishment provides the umbrella of security.
As the insurgents fell back to the south, they responded by murdering two elders and threatening to kill more. The district police chief, Omar Jan, retaliated by picking up his cell phone and calling around his informant network. Afghanistan is one of the world's poorest countries, yet one in eight Afghans has a cell phone. The Taliban let the phone companies operate, as long as they shut down service at night so the insurgents can move around without being reported.
Omar Jan carried three cell phones. The Americans had one number, his family and tribal relatives had another, and informants had the third. A few days after the murder of the second elder, Omar Jan drove thirty kilometers south with four Nissan pickups lled with cops. Hours later, he drove back with six prisoners. Two were high-priority targets listed on the JPEL (Joint Prioritized E ects List). Omar Jan released the other four to their village elders. He then drove to the Helmand River, tongue-lashed two ferrymen for taking the murderers across the river, and threw their outboard motors into the water.
In Garmsir, the Marines and Afghan soldiers provided the deterrent to the incursion of large armed insurgent gangs. The police chief provided some assurance of pursuit and the swift administration of rough justice. Of course, if the tough police chief were removed from the equation, intimidation of the people by the displaced Islamists would resume. Conversely, Omar Jan demonstrated the di erence one informed, determined man made when he had solid military backing.
Garmsir was taking signi cant strides forward. Needing radios for the population and not wanting to ght red tape, Lt. Col. Watson requested a donation from a nonpro t U.S. company called Spirit of America. SOA responded by shipping several dozen radios. The Marines distributed them widely and rigged a tall antenna on the tallest hill in the district.
An enthusiastic local interpreter volunteered to be the announcer. Within a few weeks, "DJ Andy" was producing a four-hour show of local and national news, interspersed with his quips, interviews, and a medley of Western and Afghan pop and traditional tunes. Within a few months, he was deluged with fan letters and "several elaborately embroidered love letters."

Instead of pulling back, Watson attacked. In July, Battalion 3-1 assaulted the Taliban stronghold of the Safar Bazaar, a town square of 200 compounds and ramshackle shops dealing in drugs and weapons. At Safar, the Helmand River took an abrupt turn to the west, owing toward Zabul Province. Below Safar lay 100 miles of hardpacked desert, ending at the border with Pakistan. Insurgents drove from Pa-kistan across the desert, checked into their hotels at Safar, bartered wet opium or Pakistani rubles for supplies and munitions, contacted their guides, and relaxed for a few days before driving farther north to begin their jihad.
The bazaar was loaded with mines and booby traps. I suggested to Watson that he bulldoze the damn thing and pay each storekeeper ten thousand bucks. Pay two million dollars and be done with the problem. Watson shook his head.
"Kabul would have a cow," he said. "I have to seize it, not destroy it. Too much Taliban propaganda if we bulldoze houses."
In late July of 2010, Battalion 3-1 inserted a platoon by helicopter in the rear of the Safar Bazaar, while a ri e company assaulted from the front behind massive line charges that blew two lanes through the outer mine eld. It took thirty-ve days for the Marines to clear the bazaar, nding and detonating ninety-eight mines and caches of explosives. The monetary cost-the helicopter lift, the mine detection equipment, the explosive charges, and medical units on special alert-exceeded $10 million. Three outposts were named for fallen Marines-Sgt. Ralph Rankel, Cpl. John Greer, and Pfc. Hal Bury. Battalion 3-1 had expanded to sixty-two outposts, an extraordinary effort.
A note of caution, however. In Helmand Province alone, over a million and a half Pashtuns lived in about 8,000 settlements, most numbering around 200 residents. The math was daunting; there weren't enough American troops to put an outpost at every settlement. Garmsir was a success, but most rural Pashtuns could not be protected by a similar close-by presence of Americans. Vast swaths of rural Afghanistan had only a scant, ephemeral American presence.
The outposts at Safar were as far south as Watson intended to control. The bare wadis extending south into Pakistan had no economic value. It would be good enough to patrol them as a no-man's-land. Marine light armored vehicles, recon, and CIA CPTs (Counterterrorism Pursuit Teams) roved the back trails. The majority of in ltrators would get through, but the long journey across barren land would be tougher with the Safar Bazaar eliminated as the rest stop.
The next step in Garmsir was transitioning the security lead to the Afghan forces. Most likely the kandak would pull back into fewer than a dozen outposts. This would put a premium on the ability of the local police to receive tips about the in ltration of insurgents. The major danger would come from IEDs intended to prevent the Afghan forces from using the roads. Thus in Garmsir, the overall number of Americans could be reduced, but they would have to leave su cient forces for road clearing, re support, and quick reaction, meaning an adviser force like Matt Golsteyn's in Marja.
In the summer of 2010, Lt. Gen. Joseph Dunford, the Marine commander for the Mideast, visited Garmsir. Watson began his brie ng along standard counterinsurgency lines. He said his battalion was conducting the four lines of operation, or LOOs-security, development, governance, and rule of law. On a map, he showed the patrol zones of his sixty outposts. The lay-down resembled the distribution of Combined Action Platoons in Vietnam in 1968 and the combined squads in western Iraq in 2006. Col. Dale Alford, who commanded a combined battalion in Iraq and also fought in Konar and in southern Afghanistan, had analyzed how to convert conventional battalions into "adviser groups."

He swiftly installed a district council that agreed which roads should be paved and schools reopened. Within a year, the massive quarry near district town was lling gravel trucks twenty-four hours a day, bound north for U.S. outposts plagued by gooey mud in winter and suffocating dust in summer. Money flowed into the district.
In January of 2010, Special Operations Forces conducted a night raid on a compound outside town. A few days later, local mullahs, claiming they found a knife thrust into a Koran, led a mob to the district headquarters. Jan and the district police chief tried to reason with the mullahs, only to be driven back by a hail of rocks. The mob rampaged through the market, setting re to the wooden stalls. The mullahs had alerted local stringers for Kabul television, and that night the country saw a Koran impaled on a knife, followed by res, curses against infidel invaders, and Afghan soldiers shooting into the mob. The Karzai government blamed Haji Jan for losing control and fired him. He was replaced by the twenty-two-year-old son of a general who lived in Kabul.
After listening to the story, Gen. Dunford shook his head and looked at Carter Malkasian, the lead PRT o cial in Garmsir. The twenty-ve Provincial Reconstruction Teams reported to Kabul by a chain of command separate from the military. A rare combination of analyst and manager, Malkasian was a slim, soft-spoken civilian on his third combat tour.
Malkasian showed a chart with major development projects extending through 2014. "Carter, I love you like a brother-but Afghan o cials have to pick up the pace right now," Dunford said. "Projects that start four years from now are out of sync."
"Quali ed Afghans won't come here," Carter said. "They're paid more in Kabul, where the living is ten times better. The PRT wants security here first, and then development will follow. Colonel Watson is helping me."
If jihad was the unifying principle of the Taliban, then materialism was the unifying principle of liberal COIN. For years, development in Helmand had emerged as a source of contention between the U.S. Marines and the British civil servants who determined the objectives of the Provincial Reconstruction Team. Those objectives smacked of the British Empire in India a century ago, when districts were run by competent British civil servants assisted by bright Indian bureaucrats.
"That PRT view is wrongheaded," Dunford said. "I don't want you buying a condo and homesteading here. Security doesn't mean less violence. Security means the Afghans handle the violence, not us. Afghans have to manage their districts while the war is ongoing."
The U.S. military had not resolved whether its strategy was security or nation building. And given that the U.S. withdrawal would begin in mid-2011, there wasn't enough time remaining to fulfill either strategy.
The security strategy was illustrated by Dunford's message to hand the war o to Afghan forces. All the Marines wanted to do was hand over a cleared area to modestly capable Afghan forces and move on. Civilian governance, development, and rule of law would have to look after themselves; the Marines were not housekeepers. Their model envisioned the military patrolling the periphery of the populated areas, while police controlled the center. The key was local knowledge, and Garmsir police chief Omar Jan had shown he would use his connections to hunt down the Taliban rather than extort the farmers.
Major John Griffin, the battalion executive officer, handed Dunford a stack of applications to join the police force (Picture 49). "The war in Garmsir is eminently winnable," Gri n said. "The elders can recruit 1,000 police. That would crush the insurgency. But Kabul will permit only 200 police. If the Afghan government helps, we'll succeed." Three military tasks had been key to success in Garmsir: 1) conducting a huge number of patrols to push out the local Taliban; 2) bringing in a tough top cop to root out the secret cadres; and 3) sealing off the main infiltration point at the Safar Bazaar.
Underlying those three tasks was a small-unit aggressiveness that di ered from theories about defeating insurgents while minimizing firefights and emphasizing nonkinetics.
Living among the people, hearing the local rumors, and patrolling at two in the morning meant deploying coalition squads of a dozen soldiers with a like number of armed Afghans into several thousand Pashtun village complexes, each consisting of about a hundred walled compounds scattered alongside the rivers and in tiny valleys in the mountains.

In the 1960s in the northern part of South Vietnam, over one hundred such combined action platoons did deploy into separate villages. Every night was a brawl, settled by grenades and bullets exchanged at close range. Even when forts were overrun, the combined platoons stayed in the villages, moving constantly and sleeping in di erent houses. The combined action model worked; not one village was retaken by the guerrillas. Sixty percent of CAP troops volunteered to stay for eighteen months, despite no political support at home.
The historian John C. McManus wrote, "More than any other modern combatants, the Combined Action Platoon grunts experienced the crucial element of human will in war. By necessity, they morphed into rural warriors. In retrospect, the CAPs were the least glamorous but probably the most e ective aspect of the ill-fated American war e ort in Vietnam." 
8
Forty years later, Afghanistan was a di erent story because the cultures of Europe and America were intolerant of substantial casualties, especially friendly ones. The Taliban were more willing to risk being killed than was the coalition. Yes, in Nawa district there were thirty combined action outposts, and in Garmsir there were sixty. Those were the exceptions, however, that proved the rule of coalition risk aversion; it is questionable this late in the war whether Garmsir can be used as a model across the country. One cannot order all coalition battalions to conduct ninety foot patrols a day. Some units like to ght; other units need a mission to ght for and a doctrine to follow. The counterinsurgency doctrine had persuaded many commanders that they did not have to ght and kill a tough enemy. You can't suddenly turn doctrine upside down. Habits have been formed. Most battalions deployed fewer than fifteen outposts, with the askars segregated from the American soldiers.
The askars, in turn, were strangers in the Pashtun lands. President Karzai had been unable to persuade his fellow Pashtuns to join the Afghan army. In 2003, the coalition had set a quota of 40 percent Pashtuns and 25 percent Tajiks for the army. Instead, the Tajiks, along with Uzbeks and Hazaras, lled the ranks, with very few southern Pashtuns signing up.

In order for self-protection to rise from the bottom up, American squads could train local farmers. But given several thousand villages to protect, the "troop-to-task" arithmetic did not add up, because the average coalition battalion would not risk stationing dozens of squads in outposts, and there were few Special Forces detachments in country.
Garmsir and Nawa, though, did o er a feasible model. The Taliban had pushed out the local elders and taken control. Once the Americans, combined with the Afghan soldiers, had in turn pushed out the Taliban, the elders returned. They then o ered young men from their kahns to serve as police, whose greatest service was as informants. The key was a reliable police chief. That was Omar Jan.
"The critical issue and shortfall," Nicholson said, "is finding and retaining capable and qualified Afghans to lead." Not every battalion would follow the patrol pace set in Garmsir. Almost all battalions, though, were following the inkblot method. That left these questions: When do you pull out the coalition battalion, and what do you replace it with?
In 2009, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates had said, "If we set ourselves the objective of creating some sort of central Asian 'Valhalla' over there, we will lose, because nobody in the world has that kind of time, patience and money." Valhalla referred to a picturesque state without violence, along the lines of Switzerland. Gates thus seemed to be downplaying the notion of nation building. President Obama did the same, saying that Afghanistan would not be a "Jeffersonian democracy."
In 2010, Gates again addressed the military objective. "Doing things to improve governance," Gates said, "to improve development in Afghanistan, to the degree it contributes to our security mission and to the e ectiveness of the Afghan government in the security area, that's what we're going to do." That was obfuscation, not guidance. No commander can carry out a mission that the secretary of defense cannot define. "Our young military leaders," he said, "in Iraq and Afghanistan have to one degree or another found themselves dealing with development, governance, agriculture, health and diplomacy." 
11
The Army chief of staff, Gen. George Casey, was prescriptive about the mission. "We are not going to succeed by military means alone," he said. "You are only going to succeed when the people perceive there is a government represented by their interests, when there is an economy that can give them a job to support their families, when there are educational systems that can educate their family. All those things are essential to the long-term success of the military operation."
The chairman of the Joint Chiefs supported Casey's view that nation building was a basic mission. "Moving in a direction that provides security," Mullen said, "so then we can develop governance, so then we can develop an economy and they can take over their own destiny."
Mullen advocated the British view that Dunford had argued against. The sequential approach of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs meant that U.S. commanders had to fight, then govern, and then deliver services to the population.
The commandant of the Marine Corps, Gen. James Conway, disagreed fundamentally.
"We [Marines] can't fix the economy," Conway said. "We can't fix the government. What we can do is affect the security." This wasn't a debate about angels dancing on the head of a pin. Many American commanders were devoting more e ort to governance and development than to killing and arresting the enemy that held the offensive. While four-star generals aligned on opposing sides of the debate, no senior civilian o cial had addressed head-on whether the U.S. military should shed the missions of governance and economic development. Instead, the senior leadership evaded responsibility by saying the battalions would do only the amount of governance and development that was necessary.
The strategy in Afghanistan had been muddled since 2001. The U.S. military had painted itself into a corner by taking on too many roles, and did not have the time to wait until the paint dried. The American senior leadership had to decide as a fundamental principle whether security was good enough, or whether the development of civilian governance required U.S. battalions to stay and play an active role. In a few districts like Nawa, progress seemed su cient to pull most U.S. troops out; in districts like Marja, the secret Taliban cadre were so entrenched that it was imprudent to pull out without leaving an adviser task force.
Other districts were like Garmsir, where security had improved while governance, economics, and the rule of law lagged far behind. The people in Garmsir remained neutral but appreciative of security and slight economic improvement. Having gained power under the Islamic banner of the Taliban, the mullahs were more begrudging, while the elders were forthcoming. Carter Malkasian, whose expertise was legendary, foresaw "years of assistance from advisory teams and a District Support Team." 
12
Garmsir, the district farthest south from Kabul and abutting the Pakistan sanctuary, illustrates the dilemma Obama and the United States face in 2011. If you pull our troops out after they have achieved local security, the villagers are still not linked to an irresolute central government. If you leave our troops in place until the central government behaves responsibly, then our battalion commanders remain the district governors for years to come. Therefore, the question still remains: What's good enough to get out? * Land ownership was a vital leverage point exploited by the Taliban. See Appendix B for an example at Now Zad, in northern Helmand. Chapter 16   THE WAY OUT BACKGROUND The United States invaded Afghanistan in order to destroy the al Qaeda network. However, al Qaeda and the Taliban escaped over the border into Pakistan. Instead of pursuing them, America stayed in Afghanistan, vowing to build a strong democratic nation that would prevent the return of the terrorists.
To lead the new Afghanistan, the United States, acting in concert with the United Nations, in 2002 selected Hamid Karzai, a politician from a prominent Pashtun family. The United States also facilitated a revision of the Afghan constitution to give Karzai authority to appoint all provincial governors. Karzai in turn placed tribal relatives and cronies in those positions of power.
Worse, the United States gave Karzai absolute authority in selecting military and police leaders. So command positions were put up for sale, requiring payo s and political connections. The result was corrupt, unprofessional leadership that allowed the Taliban to reassert control in the countryside east and south of Kabul.
When President Obama took o ce, Afghanistan was lurching out of control. Obama stressed partnership with Pakistan, increased the number of American troops to 100,000, and promised to begin a withdrawal in mid-2011. During his rst two years in o ce, three di erent American generals took command in Afghanistan, the U.S. military strategy concentrated upon population protection, Pakistan continued to shelter the Taliban, and Karzai proved erratic and unreliable.
Let's start with the enemy. The Taliban move unchallenged across the 1,500-mile border with Pakistan, easily avoiding Americans encumbered by armor and heavy gear. In the north, the Taliban are supported by sub-tribes in the capillary valleys. In the south, they take a cut of the drug trade, while warning the poppy-growing farmers that the government will eradicate their livelihoods. Overall, some Pashtun villages are friendly, others hostile, and most are unwilling to partner with Americans because firefights and destruction are sure to follow.
Jihad against in dels emerged as a powerful war cry of the Taliban. Eighty-four percent of Afghans identify themselves foremost as Muslims. An ideology as much as a religion, Islamic beliefs are intended to form the basis of governance. But the Kabul government has failed to project itself as the true protector of Islam, while the Taliban have won disciples among the rural mullahs.
The strengths of the Taliban are their Islamist fervor and the sanctuary. Pakistan is determined to remain a supporter of some Taliban cliques in case the United States quits the war and the extremists again seize power. As long as Pakistani territory remains a sanctuary, the war will not end.
The vulnerabilities of the Taliban are threadbare logistics and popular disfavor. Having lived under Taliban control in the 1990s, most Pashtuns dislike rather than support the Islamist cause. While the Taliban add recruits every year, there has been no overwhelming groundswell of popular support. Neither side is winning. On the one side, the United States lacks the numbers to secure thousands of villages and the Afghan security forces lack con dence; on the other side, the Taliban cannot mass forces due to fear of U.S. repower. The Taliban do believe that after an American withdrawal, the rural districts will topple like dominoes.
Arrayed against the enemy are the forty-seven nations of the coalition. Most nations contribute only political symbolism. The French, Dutch, Canadians, Australians, and British have been in the fray, but at this stage, it's mostly an American e ort, with Afghan forces ghting alongside.
The coalition strategy is "to secure and serve the population"; 1 in return, the population are expected to reject the insurgents. This theoretical social contract was enshrined as doctrine in the 2006 U.S. Army and Marine Corps manual Counterinsurgency. 
2
Secretary of Defense Gates endorsed the nation-building mission. In 2008, he told the colonels at the National Defense University, "Where possible, kinetic operations should be subordinate to measures to promote better governance, economic programs to spur development, and e orts to address the grievances among the discontented." 
3
Advocacy of enlightened counterinsurgency sprouted into a social network that boosted the careers of military o cers comfortable with academic theories. Battalion commanders learned to brief as mantra four lines of operations-security, development, governance, and rule of law. It wasn't enough to ght the guerrillas; American commanders became de facto district governors, spending most of their time on nonmilitary tasks.
Nation building by the U.S. military featured three tasks: 1) protecting the population; 2) giving money and projects to stimulate patriotism; and 3) linking the population with competent government officials.
There were more than 7,000 Pashtun villages. The United States, however, lacked the manpower to patrol most of them. A patrol passing through a village once every two or three days did not constitute protection. And even when protected, the Pashtuns did not reciprocate by providing information against the Taliban or recruits for the Afghan army.
Arguments that the identical technique of population protection had worked in Iraq were misplaced. The Sunni tribes in Iraq had a distinct hierarchy and had come over to the side of the strongest tribe-the Americans-because they believed the Americans were winning. In Afghanistan, the Pashtun tribes were less hierarchical, and most were staying neutral until they saw who was going to win.
The coalition funded billions of dollars in projects so that the tribes would align with the government. The U.S. military coined the aphorism "Dollars are bullets." Battalion and company commanders doled out millions of dollars.
In response, Afghans from the top down grabbed the money. Like President Lyndon Johnson's "war on poverty," nation building created a culture of entitlement and dependency. Ironically, American liberals opposed the Afghanistan war because it diverted funds from domestic entitlement programs, while conservatives opposed to those programs at home supported a war based on the same entitlements. Both the Kabul government and the Pashtun tribes became accustomed to receiving something for nothing, and giving nothing in return. Afghanistan was the world's second-poorest nation, and the second-most corrupt. 
4
In the U.S. military, everyone was promoted based on performance, not connections. In Afghanistan, promotions were based on a mixture of payo s, family relationships, and ability. The government did not function under a set of rules that rewarded competence. Many capable Afghan o cials were assigned to districts, but it was on a catch-as-catch-can basis. Linkages between the villages and the government were friable.
The counterinsurgency theory of persuading the population to turn against the Taliban proved wrong in practice. The coalition lacked the massive numbers to protect thousands of villages, and many of the villagers had cousins who were Taliban. Pashtun elders accepted government services like schools and roads, but didn't urge their young men to join the government's army. The tribes survived by behaving, as Petraeus put it, as "professional chameleons." 
5
The Nobel Prize winner Roger Myerson put it this way: "A government is legitimate when everyone believes that everyone else in the nation will obey this government.… People everywhere will ultimately accept the rule of a faction that is able to win decisive battles, kill its enemies, and protect its friends, even if the faction lacks any other culturally accepted symbols of legitimacy." 
6
7
Reports about arrests and raids were issued daily from the military headquarters in Kabul. These reports included a standard paragraph stating, "The security force did not re their weapons and they protected the women and children for the duration of the search." 
8
Based on the past ten years, population protection and nation building as U.S. military missions have failed. Indeed, Obama has insisted that his strategy is "not fully resourced counterinsurgency or nation-building." 
9
Karzai has behaved as if the war is between the Americans and the Taliban, with the Afghan government a neutral party seeking a settlement. 
10
11
In the fall of 2010, Petraeus set out "to bleed the insurgency and pressure its leaders to negotiate." 
12
Negotiations ratify strength on the battle eld, not the other way around. Under the current circumstances, negotiations do not o er a reasonable solution or a safe way out of Afghanistan.
There are solid reasons to remain engaged. Our mortal enemy, al Qaeda, is con ned to Pakistan only due to our forces in Afghanistan. A full U.S. military pullout in the short term will result in a civil war likely to be won by the Taliban. This would invigorate al Qaeda, imperil a nuclear-armed Pakistan, and shake global confidence in America.
So a stable Afghanistan is helpful, although not critical, to our national security. But we can't a ord $100 billion a year. We have been waging war with an ATM that has run out of cash. We must implement a strategy that matches our reduced means. Being poorer, we have to fight smarter.
That means cutting back on the unsuccessful missions of population protection and democratic nation building. The Pashtun population has refused to turn against the Taliban, and the unreliable Karzai, with dictatorial powers and four more years in o ce, has no intention of building a democracy. Our conventional battalions are exerting too much effort for too little return. This war will be decided between the Afghan forces and the Taliban, not by a switch in sides on the part of the tribes. Afghan soldiers, however, lack the motivation to challenge the Taliban. "Afghan forces will never take a lead role in ghting," Special Forces Capt. Matt Golsteyn said, "as long as the coalition is willing to bear the brunt."
In the 2010 battle for Marja, Golsteyn was advising a battalion of 400 Afghan soldiers. But he only had ten mature Special Forces sergeants, too small a team for sustained combat. So the Marine brigade placed under his command a ri e platoon, engineers, and re support specialists. Thus, Capt. Golsteyn commanded his own adviser task force and the Afghan battalion performed credibly on its own.
That model deserves emulation. The primary U.S. mission should be to transition to a hundred such adviser task forces, while reducing our total force from 100,000 to 50,000. These advisers would go into combat with the Afghan forces, provide the link to re support, and have a voice in who gets promoted. The task force must be commanded by a three-star general, because advisers will be the centerpiece of the American effort.
It is highly likely that the American public will support the war inde nitely if fought at lower cost. This isn't a patriotic war. In 2010, the war did not rank among the top ten problems that concerned the public. But neither the public nor the press has turned against the war, as happened in Iraq.
In 2005, a Marine squad in the Iraqi city of Haditha killed women and children. Exhaustive investigations failed to substantiate acts of murder. Nonetheless, Haditha remained on the front pages for months because for many in the press and Congress it conveniently symbolized a disastrous war.
In 2010, a few U.S. soldiers were charged with randomly murdering Afghan civilians for sport. 
13
Although this alignment of domestic politics suggests that support for the war can be sustained, Obama has made no pretense of his discomfort with the war. "I'm not doing ten years," Obama said. "I'm not doing long-term nation-building.… There needs to be a plan about how we're going to hand it off. 
14
"If I get clipped, I don't want anyone feeling sorry for me," a sergeant going back for a second tour said. "I'm doing what I want to do. Let's get on with the damn job!"
The advisers cheered him for expressing their sentiment. In the Marines and Army, there are hardy, adventurous men who embrace the sweat, heat, cold, bruises, vomit, cordite smell, blasts, ri e cracks, screams, and camaraderie, knowing that some among them will lose limbs or bleed out. They don't need a patriotic war or sacri ces by the public. We cannot explain why they choose the rough life. They march to a different drummer. They like to fight and are highly skilled at it.
As the battles described in this book illustrate, our advisers are feared by the Taliban and inspire loyalty and spirit among the Afghan soldiers. This war will be decided by grit. The Taliban are hardy, erce ghters. Today, they have the spirit to beat the Afghan security forces. The mission of the advisers is to infuse a winning spirit into the askars. That, not population protection, must be the primary task.
The services will organize an adviser corps only if the Congress or the president orders it. The Army envisions irregular war as the likely form of future combat. Yet the core unit for the Army and the Marines remains the conventional battalion, as organized in World War II. Both services have been unwilling to change. We don't want to ght the wars of others. We also don't want to allow Islamists to kill us. Therefore, the Army and Marines must o er incentives and reward advisers with recognition and promotions greater than those reserved for conventional command billets. They will not do that without powerful external impetus.
As a nation, we must commit to stay in Afghanistan for as long as it takes, while cutting back our conventional forces and building an adviser task force. In addition, Special Operations Forces must hunt down Islamist leaders, while helicopter assaults by Ranger-type units continue along the border with Pakistan. Neutralizing the enemy, not protecting the population, must be the main mission. The task of the advisers is to build and support Afghan security forces until they are as erce in battle as are the Taliban. This will take years. The Afghan soldiers will fight if American advisers are alongside them; the Afghans will crumble without them.
Our mistake in Afghanistan was to do the work of others for ten years, expecting reciprocity across a cultural and religious divide. Given the huge size of the country, the tribal traditions, and the vast sanctuary of Pakistan, protecting the Pashtun population and expecting them to reject the Taliban in favor of the Kabul government was a strategy too open-ended. The U.S. military must hand o nation building to the State Department and deemphasize population protection. It is self-defeating to cling to a theory that has enfeebled our warrior ethos and not led to victory. It is time to transition to an adviser corps that can invigorate the Afghan security forces and prevent an Islamist takeover.
We have fought the wrong war with the wrong strategy. Our troops are not a Peace Corps; they are ghters. Let them ght, and let the Taliban fear.
Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, one of the four trapped advisers, came up on the net. "They're all around us," Kenefick yelled. "They're in the house next door. If we leave this house, they'll shoot us down." Over the radio, Meyer intermittently heard Lt. Johnson trying to send his grid. The net was clogged with a dozen soldiers trying to talk over the din, stepping on each other's communications.
" Zada laughed. "They are buying at the market in Zombai. Paying very high prices." "Good," Kerr said. "That village and those assholes deserve each other." Zada drummed his fingers on the table, obviously unhappy. "So you have come to say goodbye," Zada said. "Brave Son won't fight with us anymore?" "You know I piss on those Talib assholes," Kerr said. "But I have my orders. Finish the outpost and you'll be fine." Zada did not reply.

"Request mortars on target," he said into his handheld radio. "Can you confirm no civilians?" Lt. Connor responded. "Negative," Kightlinger said. "I can't see through a goddamn wall." "We can't shoot blind," Connor said. "No mortars."
Six, we're in contact," Kightlinger radioed back to Connor. "Two or three assholes 200 meters to our west." An RPG exploded in the open field and a Marine fired back with a 40mm shell from his grenade launcher. "Don't shoot if you can't see anything," an exasperated Kightlinger yelled. "There's one in that mosque," Cpl. Rogers replied, pointing at a whitewashed structure with three arched windows. A man was peeking out the doorway. "He's praying," Kightlinger yelled. "Six, we got a man in a mosque." "Texas," Connor said over the radio, using the squad's call sign, "tell your Marines not to hit the mosque." "Hey! Don't spray the mosque! No firing without PID [positive identification]." "We're not fucking stupid, Sergeant!" Rogers yelled back. "What about the guy with the binos?" "Salty mothers," Kightlinger said to me. On a compound wall about 200 meters to the left a crouching man was watching them through binoculars. "He doesn't have a weapon, so don't shoot," Kightlinger said. "He's a dicker," Rogers said. "
We drove back to T-Dome, where a new Special Forces unit had replaced Matt Golsteyn's team. Capt. Naqubah of the newly formed 215th

Jeremy was a selfless person. Even if you needed the shirt off his back, he would give it to you. The thing he loved and talked about the most was his wife, Rae, and, as he would say "his little bad ass baby," Hadley. Jeremy talked about getting back home to his K5 Blazer and loading Hadley in the front seat and roaming through the woods of Indiana.
Jeremy's stories would keep us entertained for hours. When that man got going on a tangent, there was nothing that would stop him. If Jeremy put his mind to something, there was nothing in this world to tell him otherwise, and if you tried to, STAND … BY … Jeremy just received his dream orders to be a Marine Corps recruiter. He would say "to keep the turds out of our beloved corps."
The thing Jeremy worried about the most was the morale and welfare of the troops under his charge. The Marines and sailors of 3rd Route Clearance Platoon will always remember Sergeant Jeremy R. McQueary. SUBJ: LCpl Larry Johnson aka "Ish" Killed In Action, Marja, 17 Feb 2010 "Ish" was an amazing guy. He was the type of person everyone could get along with. I respected him as a man and a Marine. He had an open-minded and carefree nature, yet had the discipline and courage that was demanded of him. Everyone in our platoon has nothing but good memories about him.
Most people in our platoon consider him a laid-back person but also a hard worker. He was able to make all of us laugh even in stressful times. Whether saying something completely o the wall or trying to put a puppy in his drop pouch in the middle of a patrol. He was always eager to be put into the ght. Every morning, he would talk about going on another patrol, although back in the rear some would say his laid-back nature was due to a "Perma-high" from before he enlisted. Back home he has two sisters and his mother whom he deeply cared for and talked to as much as possible. Johnson will always remain in our hearts and minds.
Every locality has established leaders, and an insurgency has to win them over or replace them. Like all revolutionary political movements, the Taliban exploited local grievances to create a new set of winners and losers.
A traditional insurgent technique for gaining loyalty is land redistribution. In the 1950s, during the battle for Dien Bien Phu, the Vietminh rebels were exhausted. General Nguyen Giap rallied their spirits by reminding "every soldier that he was ghting for the right to own a few acres."
In the early 1960s, Fidel Castro rewarded his followers in Cuba with the lands of those who had ed. During the Vietnam War in the later 1960s, the loyalties of many villages were predictable by tracing whether they had been resettled from elsewhere.
While the coalition and the Karzai government would not move hostile tribes, the Taliban had no such scruples. A classic case was the large town of Now Zad, eighty miles north of Marja and Nawa. Fighting between the British and the Taliban in 2006-2007 had attened whole sections of Now Zad and sent 20,000 civilians eeing for their lives. When I visited Now Zad in early 2010, it looked like a tornado had passed through, ripping up houses and strewing debris on every street. Capt. Andy Terrell was holding the town with Lima Company of Battalion 3-4.
"I was here two years ago as an exchange o cer with the British Marines," Terrell said. "We'd walk outside the wire and be in a gun ght. So when I came back with my own company, we blocked o the passes outside town. If the Talibs come in, they can't get out. So now we've got a ghost town."
In the 2006 ghting against the British, the insurgents had hacked through the back walls of the houses to sneak close to the British outpost in the market square. In response, the outnumbered Brits had repeatedly resorted to bombing the houses, block by block, and the residents had fled.
"Maybe 600 residents have straggled back," Capt. Jason Brezler said. "There are thousands of others living somewhere with relatives, working as day laborers picking poppy. Once they have a grubstake, they'll come back."
Brezler was a civil a airs o cer with a $2 million budget, charged with stirring to life the embers of a dead town. Tall and raw-boned, he exuded a tough edge. On his previous tour, he had commanded a ri e platoon. A Naval Academy graduate, Brezler came from a family of firefighters. His dad was a fire chief in Baltimore, and Brezler served on the Emergency Response Unit of New York City's fire department.
"I had to beat out ten thousand other Irish Catholic guys," he said, "on the exams for the NYFD. I grew up wanting to ght res. I took a year's leave to do this tour. Now I have my own city. Needs a little repair, but we'll get there."
After an MRE dinner, Jason led Miguel Marquez of ABC and me through the mud and sleet down the backstreets of Now Zad. He rapped softly on a imsy iron gate, a door creaked open, and we walked down cold concrete steps into a tiny cellar heated by a small woodstove. A half dozen townsmen smiled as we pulled o our stinking boots and sank into cushions around the walls. The men had moved their families a dozen times in the past three years. They said their wives, exhausted and ashamed at living in the houses of others, were ecstatic to return to their own homes, wrecked though they were.
Our host, Sardar Mohamed, o ered slices of tomatoes and at bread before tugging out a hand drum and a harmonica-accordion, a 1930s contraption that groaned out a slightly musical tune. Sardar had risked his life to hide the harmonica during years under Taliban rule. The Afghans boisterously clapped and bonged songs, urging the bemused Americans to dance. It was a bizarre setting, in a cozy cellar lit by candles in a bombed-out city. You could imagine Marlene Dietrich slinking down the stairs or Humphrey Bogart sipping a scotch in a corner.
Once the levity wore down, the Afghans leaned forward solemnly. Jason readied himself for a pitch. "The police have my only son," Mohamed's brother Abdul said. "It is breaking his mother's heart." Abdul said his wife had lost thirteen children, most to disease before they were eight and others to the war. The Afghans nodded gravely at her su ering. A month ago, her only surviving son was paid by the Taliban to take a video on a cell phone of a roadside bombing. When he foolishly walked down a street talking on the phone, the police nabbed him and sent him away. Now the sixteen-year-old was back, wearing a blue shirt like a policeman and living in the police station, refusing to acknowledge his family.
"Chai boy," Raaz, the interpreter, whispered to Jason. Many Afghans in positions of power kept boys outside their doors to fetch tea, run errands, and surrender their bodies.
Abdul leaned forward, pleading. Could the Marines arrest his son and beat him for a week, accuse him of stealing, so the police would have to dismiss him? "I'll send him home tomorrow," Jason said. "No police will argue with me. But if he ghts again for the Talibs, we will kill him. You know that."
Abdul nodded gravely. Jason changed the subject. "So how are things?" Jason asked, trying to lighten the mood. "Excellent," Sardar, the eldest, said. "The new government is good." "Bullshit. You don't have to be afraid with me," Jason said. "You just complained about the police." Sardar considered the question. "No, I mean it," he finally said. "You samandari are good government." "Sardar, we're not the government. We're leaving." "No, you must come back every three months-and remove Sarwar Jan." "That fucker again," Jason murmured. Sarwar Jan had served as chief of police during the three years that Now Zad was besieged. On his rare visits to the town, the Taliban had never shot at him. He was a protégé of Sher Mohamed Akhuadzada, the former governor of Helmand. Loathed by the British, Akhuadzada left o ce after a stash of opium was found on his property. Karzai let him stay in Helmand, where he periodically threatened to align his drug army with the Taliban. In a political tug-of-war, the Marines were pushing to throw out the police chief, while Akhuadzada was working his Karzai connections to retain him.
working his Karzai connections to retain him.
"Sarwar Jan has political power," Jason said. "His Noorzai tribe work with the Talibs," Sardar said. "The Talibs gave our land deeds to the Alizai tribe." Sardar explained that their own Barakzai tribal elders had betrayed them, selling out to the Taliban and insisting farmers like Sardar leave once the ght against the British broke out in 2006. Once the farmers ed, the Taliban brought in relatives from their tribes to take over the farms.
"They came from the mountains to the west," Sardar said. "Ishaqzais-ignorant people. Team, here is my guidance for the conduct of counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan. In keeping with the admonition in this guidance to "learn and adapt," I will update this document periodically in the months ahead. Indeed, this edition is my rst update, as I received useful feedback on the initial draft from Afghan partners and also received advice from elders and Special Forces teams in Herat Province's Zericho Valley. I welcome further feedback.
As I noted during my assumption of command remarks, it is a privilege to serve with each of you in this hugely important endeavor. And I appreciate all that you will do in helping to turn this guidance into reality on the ground. Secure and serve the population. The decisive terrain is the human terrain. The people are the center of gravity. Only by providing them security and earning their trust and confidence can the Afghan government and ISAF prevail.
Live among the people. We can't commute to the ght. Position joint bases and combat outposts as close to those we're seeking to secure as is feasible. Decide on locations with input from our partners and after consultation with local citizens and informed by intelligence and security assessments.
Help confront the culture of impunity. The Taliban are not the only enemy of the people. The people are also threatened by inadequate governance, corruption, and abuse of power-recruiters for the Taliban. President Karzai has forthrightly committed to combat these threats. Work with our Afghan partners to help turn his words into reality and to help our partners protect the people from malign actors as well as from terrorists.
Help Afghans build accountable governance. Afghanistan has a long history of representative self-government at all levels, from the village shura to the government in Kabul. Help the government and the people revive those traditions and help them develop checks and balances to prevent abuses.
Pursue the enemy relentlessly. Together with our Afghan partners, get our teeth into the insurgents and don't let go. When the extremists ght, make them pay. Seek out and eliminate those who threaten the population. Don't let them intimidate the innocent. Target the whole network, not just individuals.
Fight hard and ght with discipline. Hunt the enemy aggressively, but use only the repower needed to win a ght. We can't win without ghting, but we also cannot kill or capture our way to victory. Moreover, if we kill civilians or damage their property in the course of our operations, we will create more enemies than our operations eliminate. That's exactly what the Taliban want. Don't fall into their trap. We must continue our efforts to reduce civilian casualties to an absolute minimum.
Identify corrupt o cials. President Karzai has said, "My government is committed to ghting corruption with all means possible." Help the government achieve that aim. Make sure the people we work with work for the people. If they don't, work with partners to enable action, or we will appear to be part of the problem. Bring networks of malign actors to the attention of trusted Afghan partners and your chain of command. Act with your Afghan partners to confront, isolate, pressure, and defund malign actors-and, where appropriate, to refer malign actors for prosecution.
Hold what we secure. Together with our Afghan partners, develop the plan to hold an area (and to build in it) before starting to clear or secure it. The people need to know that we will not abandon them. Prioritize population security over short-duration disruption operations. And when we begin to transition to Afghan lead, thin out rather than handing o and withdrawing, maintaining headquarters even as we reduce combat elements.
Foster lasting solutions. Help our Afghan partners create good governance and enduring security. Avoid compromises with malign actors that achieve short-term gains at the expense of long-term stability. Think hard before pursuing initiatives that may not be sustainable in the long run. When it comes to projects, small is often beautiful.
Money is ammunition; don't put it in the wrong hands. Institute "COIN contracting." Pay close attention to the impact of our spending and understand who benefits from it. And remember, we are who we fund. How we spend is often more important than how much we spend.
Be a good guest. Treat the Afghan people and their property with respect. Think about how we drive, how we patrol, how we relate to people, and how we help the community. View our actions through the eyes of the Afghans and, together with our partners, consult with elders before pursuing new initiatives and operations.
Consult and build relationships, but not just with those who seek us out. Earn the people's trust, talk to them, ask them questions, and learn about their lives. Inquire about social dynamics, frictions, local histories, and grievances. Hear what they say. Be aware of others in the room and how their presence may a ect the answers you get. Cross-check information and make sure you have the full story. Avoid knee-jerk responses based on first impressions. Don't be a pawn in someone else's game. Spend time, listen, consult, and drink lots of tea.
Walk. Stop by, don't drive by. Patrol on foot whenever possible and engage the population. Take o your sunglasses. Situational awareness can only be gained by interacting face-to-face, not separated by ballistic glass or Oakleys.
Act as one team. Work closely with our international and Afghan partners, civilian as well as military. Treat them as brothers-in-arms. Unity of effort and cooperation are not optional.
Partner with the ANSF [Afghan National Security Forces]. Live, eat, train, plan, and operate together. Depend on one another. Hold each other accountable at all echelons down to trooper level. Help our ANSF partners achieve excellence. Respect them and listen to them. Be a good role model. Promote local reintegration. Together with our Afghan partners, identify and separate the "reconcilables" from the "irreconcilables." Identify and report obstacles to reintegration. Help our partners address grievances and strive to make the reconcilables part of the local solution, even as we work with our partners to identify and kill, capture, drive out, or "turn" the irreconcilables.
Be rst with the truth. Beat the insurgents and malign actors to the headlines. Preempt rumors. Get accurate information to the chain of command, to Afghan leaders, to the people, and to the press as soon as possible. Integrity is critical to this ght. Avoid spinning, and don't try to "dress up" an ugly situation. Acknowledge setbacks and failures, including civilian casualties, and then state how we'll respond and what we've learned. Live our values. Stay true to the values we hold dear. This is what distinguishes us from our enemies. We are engaged in a tough endeavor. It is often brutal, physically demanding, and frustrating. All of us experience moments of anger, but we must not give in to dark impulses or tolerate unacceptable actions by others.
Maintain continuity through unit transitions. From day one, start building the information you'll provide to your successors. Share information and understanding in the months before transitions. Strive to maintain operational tempo and local relationships throughout transitions to avoid giving insurgents and malign actors a rest. Empower subordinates. Resource to enable decentralized action. Push assets and authorities down to those who most need them and can actually use them. Flatten reporting chains (while maintaining hierarchical decision chains). Remember that it is those at tactical levels-the so-called "strategic sergeants" and "strategic captains"-who turn big ideas in counterinsurgency operations into reality on the ground.
Win the battle of wits. Learn and adapt more quickly than the enemy. Be cunning. Outsmart
