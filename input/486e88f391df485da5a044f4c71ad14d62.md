Russia under President Putin has shown, both in Syria and Ukraine, that only small and tangential amounts of actual applied military force are needed to accomplish their political goals.
In Syria, the primary goal of preventing a U.S. military intervention and regime change was achieved by a mix of hard, persistent diplomatic efforts and support for the Asad regime with money, weapons, and political protection in the United Nations (UN).
In Ukraine, Moscow startled the world by moving mass amounts of its land forces quickly and effectively to the border with Ukraine.
But in the early stages of the conflict, the main role of those forces was then to sit on the border, augmenting and depleting as required in order to focus the attention of the West like a hypnotist's watch, while only small groups of Russian special operations forces actually conducted warfare inside Ukraine.
And yet, Putin is still accomplishing his goals: undermining the Petro Poroshenko government, keeping Ukraine within the Russian sphere of influence, portraying Russia to the domestic audience as a strong power successfully deterring U.S. ambition, and last but not least, sending a strong message to other states in Russia's vicinity not to step out of line.
