Russia: Russia's recent military intervention in Crimea and its continued attempts to destabilize Ukraine signal Moscow is prepared to use force and coercion to pursue its interests, including in ways that violate well-established international norms.
While Russia's recent aggression actually reflects both its strengths and weaknesses as a European power, it is nonetheless clear that Russia presents a more serious security threat than was the case a decade ago.
This is evidenced by the recent downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine and Russia's continued efforts to destabilize Eastern Ukraine.
Accordingly, the United States can no longer simply assume that Europe will be a net security provider.
Europe will require more attention and a higher sense of priority from U.S. defense planners.
