Russian military strategy posits that deterrence should be premised on shaping an opponent's perception of costs, and convincing them that the cost of aggression would exceed any desired gains.
In war the goal is to prevent a decisive victory in the initial period of war, and to convince the opponent that the contest will result in costly attrition.
In both cases, the military strategy accepts that Russia is the weaker party in a regional or large-scale war against a technologically superior adversary (US/NATO).
It is therefore a strategy that approaches the question from a position of military inferiority, seeking asymmetric counters to areas of US superiority, and ways to decisively shape the outcome without presuming the likelihood of victory in a sustained conflict.
