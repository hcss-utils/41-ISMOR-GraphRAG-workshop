More experts talked about the possible military interventions in the years that followed.
In 2018, colonel of the Security Reserve, Beso Aladashvili, said in an interview with a Georgian magazine Tbiliselebi that Russia is interested in Pankisi Gorge to move military operations from its territory to Georgia.
Therefore, the issue of terrorists and militants is a continuous topic of discussion for them.
Alasashvili thinks that it is important for Georgia to have close diplomatic ties with the United States and Turkey, to create defensive mechanisms for the prevention of Russia's intervention.
