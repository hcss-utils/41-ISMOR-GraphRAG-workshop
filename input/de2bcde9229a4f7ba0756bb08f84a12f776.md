In addition to the notional forces, WEDLOCK included a number of other deception events in support of the story.
WEDLOCK coopted the American press-ULTRA intercepts confirmed that Japanese intelligence used the press as a means of collection.
Rather than keeping the meeting between Buckner and Nimitz a secret, the press was encouraged to report the meeting and speculate on its meaning.
In addition, Joint Security Control fed disinformation directly to Japanese intelligence through double agents in the U.S.; via military attaches in neutral countries; and by incorporating disinformation into shared intelligence with Russia-expecting the disinformation to be collected by Japanese agents.
Furthermore, troops embarking for the tropics through Seattle were issued artic gear so as to appear that they were heading north.
Finally, an entire simulated airbase was constructed at Holtz Bay on the westernmost Aleutian island.
