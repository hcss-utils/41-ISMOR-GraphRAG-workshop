Ukraine will begin the next phase of its history with numerous disadvantages.
It will have been the setting for the most destructive, mechanized land war since 1945, with attendant grievous loss of infrastructure, housing, and manpower; it will forever border Russia, the aggressor power in the war, still probably ruled by a repressive regime and still occupying or claiming Ukrainian territory; and a third or more of Ukraine's prewar population-disproportionately women and children-will begin the reconstruction period internally displaced or as refugees outside the country, mainly in other European countries.
As a location for those allocating international assistance and in which private business would want to invest, Ukraine will also have to contend with its post-1991 record as the slowest-growing post-Soviet state with an unenviable record of corruption and state capture by oligarchs.
