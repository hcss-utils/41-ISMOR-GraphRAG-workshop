In this section's second article, "The Russian Understanding of Information Operations and Information Warfare," Timothy L. Thomas observes that even though there are numerous similarities between U.S. and Russian approaches to information operations, there are three distinct differences between Russian and U.S. views of information warfare.
First, Thomas, says, the fact that Russia is experiencing a massive transformation of all aspects of society influence Russian analysts to place a much greater emphasis than U.S. analysts on "informationpsychological processes" as components of information warfare.
Second, since Russian military thinking has been historically different than Western thinking, Russian military analysts naturally place different emphases on different aspects of information warfare than do Western analysts.
Finally, Thomas asserts, Russian views of information warfare are different than their Western counterparts because of the budgetary, technological, and infrastructure constraints under which Russia labors.
