Between the Wars -The Bomber Will Always Get Through.
The First World War experience had a profound effect on military theorists of all stripes, including the new theorists of airpower.
The latter published their ideas in various media and these ideas had an important impact on how people perceived war, which continues to this day.
The theorists observed that the war had ended not in the traditional fashion by the capture of the defeated nation's capital, but with the collapse of the German government due to civil unrest and a lack of will to continue the war.
They also observed that the Russia had left the war and made an armistice with Germany after its government had been overthrown by a revolution.
Furthermore, both the French and Italian armies had mutinied in 1917, causing political crises in both countries including public demands, as with Britain, that each nation make a separate peace with their adversaries.
