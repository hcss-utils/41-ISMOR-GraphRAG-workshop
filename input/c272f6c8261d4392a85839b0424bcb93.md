Army; allow for self-development; balance operational and educational experience; and be founded on sound training and leader development principles. The model should produce self-aware, adaptive leaders, and trained and ready units. By focusing institutional education, guiding field training and advocating self-development, the model will describe a lifelong learning paradigm. It should also promote a mature management process that continually addresses training and leader development issues and provides feedback for the CSA.
Training and leader development management process. The Army has no management system for training or leader development, and without one, we risk losing sight of the reasons for change. An iterative, collaborative and comprehensive management process is needed to measure progress, adjust priorities and apply resources. Initially, this process should provide a quarterly CSA decision forum to build momentum, interest and enthusiasm for these programs throughout the Army.
Lifelong learning. Army culture underwrites leaders commitment to lifelong learning through a balance of educational and operational experiences, complemented by self-development to fill knowledge gaps. To be a learning organization that supports this lifelong learning the Army must:
l Provide training, education, standards and products for leader development.
l Provide doctrine, tools and support to foster lifelong learning.
l Provide balanced educational and operational experiences supported by self-development.
l Develop and maintain a web-based Warrior Development Center that publishes standards, training and education publications, doctrinal manuals, assessment and feedback tools and provides dis-
Do you ever feel as if we have it backward as if were talking about missile defense before assessing threats, choosing weapon systems before nailing down a strategy, losing officers when we need them most? If you feel unnerved, this issue of Military Review might confirm your suspicions but, at the same time, remind you that good minds are taking on the challenges.
In the opening selection, Lieutenant General Mike Steele discusses findings from the Army Training and Leader Development Panels recent surveys of officer attitudes and concerns. A follow-on article in the September-October 2001 issue will discuss specific recommendations and directions that officers can expect to see in coming months, even as the noncommissioned officer panel is under way here at Fort Leavenworth and around the Army.
Whether the manifestation is suitcase nukes, computer network attacks or low-tech truck-bombs, the featured theme in this issue is contemporary and compelling: what do we do about terrorism and other forms of asymmetric warfare? Authors discuss asymmetric combat from different perspectives, ultimately offering solutions ranging from concepts to doctrine to training.
How the Army prepares to fight and win war is changing to deal with such emerging threats. Deployability is at the heart of many initiatives, and authors address that imperative from different angles as well. We need to be lighter to get overseas in time do we need forces and equipment even lighter than currently projected to assure mobility once in theater? What about fire support during the vulnerable entry phase? Battleships that can steam 500 miles in 24 hours and obliterate the landscape from 25 miles offshore now lounge around the pool at the Old Ships Home.
Organizations and systems aside, it will be Army leaders who assure victory, and the institution must support field commanders with both intellectual preparation and operational guidance. In particular, during peacekeeping they must understand social dynamics and clearly grasp the relationship between force protection and mission accomplishment all underwritten by effective decisionmaking procedures.
Its been a long, hard, rewarding ride. I retire at the end of June, and this is my last editorial for Military Review. Colonel Melanie Reeder comes aboard from I Corps and Fort Lewis, Washington, to take the reins. Keep the faith.
July-August 2001 l MILITARY REVIEW T HE 21ST CENTURY brings new challen- ges for Army leaders. Information is now a doctrinal element of combat power, and technologies associated with information offer the potential to change the way the Army wages war. Technology that provides real-time information throughout our combat formations is seen by many as our edge against industrial-age armies. But technology alone cannot provide the dominance required to win. The centerpiece of our formations remains quality leaders and their soldiers . . . not technology.
Technology is only a part of the equation. The more complex portion is leadership. The key to victory is the combination of information-age technology and capable leaders who enable the United States Army to dominate adversaries on full spectrum battlefields. Armed with better situational understanding, leaders can make bold, quick decisions to solve complex problems. Changing missions and increased urban and complex terrain call for selfaware leaders who can operate and adapt across the full spectrum of operations. In todays operational environment, tactical actions by lieutenants, sergeants, corporals and their commanders can have strategic consequences with lasting impact on National policy. These demands highlight the need to assess our current training and leader development doctrine and programs to determine whether they will provide the leaders required for increasingly complex battlefields that are anticipated over the next 25 years.
More than a decade after the Cold War ended, the unitary, exclusive focus on fighting the Soviet Union is gone. US strategy and interests mandate an Army trained and ready for major theater wars, smallerscale contingencies and peacetime military engage-ments. The foundation of this full spectrum credibility is our ability to dominate land combat. Our demonstrated warfighting ability enhances deterrence by allowing the National Command Authority to deter conflict and, when deterrence fails, to enter and dominate combat on our terms. Adversaries know they cannot win conventional, high intensity clashes with US forces, so the threat to Army forces is increasingly unconventional and asymmetric. Threats have ready access to off-the-shelf technologies that can confound our units and inflict casualties as much for political effect as for tactical advantage. Battles will migrate into urban and complex terrain where US standoff weapons offer few advantages and the proximity of noncombatants limits US firepower. The elusive threat in close, complex terrain will challenge our leaders and their soldiers as never before.
Technology continues to change the way the Army trains and operates. Increasingly lethal weapons and breakthroughs in command and control improve US forces effectiveness, but not uniformly. Legacy, digital and Interim forces operating in the same area challenge commanders and staffs to combine their capabilities effectively. US forces lack a technological monopoly; even adversaries without a research and development capability can purchase remarkably sophisticated systems. Army leaders in this technology-rich environment must be able to adopt emerging capabilities and adapt them to their rapidly changing operational environment.
Success in full spectrum operations depends on leaders who consistently make better and faster decisions than their opponents, which means battle command education and training must evolve and expand. Materiel approaches and technological advances are only tools that leaders leverage. Commanders must visualize an expanded battle space; describe it clearly; direct soldiers, units and systems to accomplish their missions; and lead from the front. Understanding, confidence and trust between commanders and subordinates enable everyone to exploit opportunities, even in the absence of orders. Battle command in this new operational environment requires relevant operational and educational experiences to train and develop leaders. The emerging question is whether current Army training and leader development systems are adequate to produce leaders for these information-age battlefields.
The Army established its current training doctrine in 1987 to meet Cold War needs and described it in Field Manual (FM) 7-0 (25-100), Training the Force, and FM 7-10 (25-101), Battle Focused Training. The doctrines training principles and training management process have served the Army well. Today, a primary criticism concerning training doctrine is simply that leaders are not following the principles or the training management process. Increased taskings, high personnel tempo, excessive operational pace and undermanned units seriously degrade unit efforts to apply the doctrine. Solid training based on mission essential task lists (METL) competes with requirements for installation and community support, nonmission training and last minute taskings. The Red, Amber, Green training management process blurs and collapses when units are tasked regardless of their cycle. Unit training is top driven, not determined at the lowest tactical level, and the quarterly training brief has deviated from its doctrinal intent as a training contract with higher headquarters.
Changes in the operational environment, the National Military Strategy and force structure require the Army to reevaluate training doctrine and techniques. Fundamentally sound principles from current doctrine, such as standards-based METL training, assessments and feedback for leaders, units and the Army, should continue to provide the foundation for the next generation of training doctrine.
Like current training doctrine, Army leadership doctrine has roots more than a decade old. In a leader development study directed by General (GEN) Carl E. Vuono and completed in April 1988, GEN Gordon R. Sullivan, then Deputy Commandant of the US Army Command and General Staff College, concluded that the Army has two primary leader development tasks. First, the Army must develop leaders who can prepare the force for war. Second, the Army must develop leaders who can apply doctrine to win battles and campaigns. A key recommendation of the Sullivan Study was a formal Army leader development system. This system now includes a leader development model that Threats have ready access to off-the-shelf technologies that can confound our units and inflict casualties as much for political effect as for tactical advantage. Battles will migrate into urban and complex terrain where US standoff weapons offer few advantages and the proximity of noncombatants limits US firepower.
TRAINING AND LEADER DEVELOPMENT An Army looking toward the future must determine the best ways to train and develop leaders for full spectrum operations. From peacekeeping to preparing for war, our Army asks a great deal of leaders. As missions demand more of leaders, our training and leader development challenges increase. How should we adapt to these challenges?
The Army has always adopted a forward-looking attitude, and periodically we have sought selfreflection and self-assessment to measure our capabilities against future requirements. This has occurred about once per decade over the past century. Examples include Elihu Roots reforms in 1902, the National Defense Act of 1920, Lieutenant General (LTG) Leonard T. Gerows and LTG Manton S. Eddys boards, GEN  
Changing missions and increased urban and complex terrain call for self-aware leaders who can operate and adapt across the full spectrum of operations. In todays operational environment, tactical actions by lieutenants, sergeants, corporals and their commanders can have strategic consequences with lasting impact on National policy.
warfighting concepts, doctrine, force structures and materiel solutions have received most attention to date, the panels review shifted our focus to leaders, soldiers and units as the centerpiece of our formations. As part of the Transformation process, the panel was asked to identify the characteristics and skills required for officer, noncommissioned officer (NCO) and warrant officer leaders of this transformed force. GEN Shinseki also tasked the panel to examine current systems for training and leader development to see what changes would provide the best leaders for our Army and the best Army for our nation.
For the commissioned officer portion of the study, the ATLDP task organized four study groups, an integration team and a Red Team. The study groups comprised senior NCOs and company and field grade officers serving throughout the Army. Three study groups assessed the unit, institution and selfdevelopment pillars of the Armys Leader Development Model. A fourth study group examined Army culture as it relates to officer development, service ethic and retention. Senior officers, NCOs, civilian experts from industry and academia, and GEN (Retired) Frederick M. Franksour senior mentorprovided the panel with advice and direction. The integration team provided analytic, planning and logistic support. The Red Team provided real-time, critical review of the panels process and findings. The panels analytic process was thorough, concentrating on the specified and implied tasks directed by the CSA and CG, TRADOC. Members used comprehensive surveys, focus groups, personal interviews and independent research to compile data for analysis. Study groups traveled around the world and interviewed more than 13,500 Army leaders and their spouses. Most of those surveyed were lieutenants, captains and majors.
The ATLDP used a disciplined process to determine issues, collect data, form conclusions and make recommendations. Detailed mission analysis and investigation of the issues became the basis of survey instruments and field interviews. The broad sample from soldiers across the Army lends ultimate credibility to the panels conclusions and recommendations. Input from the Army was informative, candid and heartfelt. As expected, leaders identified many strengths and weaknesses in our present

programs. Foremost among our strengths were the strong sense of service and commitment to the Nation and Army, the value of operational and educational experiences, the benefit of leadership opportunities and recognition that our combat training centers (CTCs) remain the crown jewels of Army training and leader development. The revealed weaknesses include an undisciplined operational pace; lack of senior-subordinate confidence and contact; micromanagement; personnel management; the Officer Efficiency Report (OER); validity of the current Officer Education System (OES); currency of training standards; resources for home station and CTC training; outdated training aids, devices, simulations and simulators (TADSS); and the lack of a sound training and leader development management system. The panel energetically discussed these and other issues and determined that several require immediate attention. They are so important and the need for change so significant, we considered them strategic imperatives. A brief synopsis of each follows.
Army culture. There is a strong relationship between Army culture and the quality of training and leader development programs. Army culture must operate routinely within an acceptable band of tolerance between what the Army expects of its leaders and what leaders expect from the Army. Any change that widens the gap between Army beliefs and practices threatens readiness, soldier and unit training, and leader growth. That widening gap between beliefs and practice leaves our Army culture out of balance. One pressure on the acceptable band of tolerance is micromanagement. Junior officers need opportunities to develop; they need commanders who trust them and are willing to underwrite mistakes. Additional tensions arise from the undisciplined operational pace and an OER system and application yet to be accepted by our officer corps. Further, lieutenants want to be platoon leaders and lead soldiers, not serve in captain staff positions for which they are not trained. They are disappointed because they are rushed through developmental leadership positions and often do not have the opportunity to master tactical and technical leadership skills. When junior officers are quickly processed through key developmental positions, their expectations of leading soldiers are cut short. Unmet expectations and insufficient contact with battalion and brigade commanders reduce job satisfaction. Without early, quality tours leading soldiers, junior officers seriously consider other career opportunitiesa retention concern for the Army.
Officer Education System. The OES does not train and educate officers in the skills they need for full spectrum operations. Schools should meet Army-directed accreditation and be staffed with our most professionally qualified intructors educating our least qualified officer students. The new operational environment emphasizes the need for joint operations. This translates to a necessity for joint education. Our OES provides Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) Phase I during the Com-

Training doctrine needs to be updated, home station training improved and CTCs recapitalized and modernized. Training doctrineFM 7-0 (25-100) and FM 7-10 (25-101)must adapt to account for the new operational environment. This training doctrine must also be nested with doctrine in FM 3-0 (100-5), Operations, and FM 6-22 (22-100), Army Leadership. In the meantime, commanders and units must adhere to existing training doctrine, principles and practices to help reduce operational pace and discipline training management. The Army must provide commanders with sufficient resources, including improved TADSS, to improve home station training. Finally, the Army must recapitalize, modernize, staff and resource the CTCs to provide full spectrum, multiechelon, combined arms training and leader development experiences.
Systems approach to training. We must return to standards-based training, the strength of Army readiness during post-Vietnam reforms. Standards served our Army well as we transformed from Vietnam to the Army of Excellence that fought Desert Storm. Standards-based training can do the same for our transforming Army today. While standards have been the basis for developing training, assessing performance and providing feedback, the systems approach designed to document and publish training standards has atrophied. The Army lacks training and education publications and standards for its Legacy and Interim forces. Without documented, accessible and digital standards, readiness among our soldiers, leaders and units will falter and endanger battlefield success.
Training and leader development model. The existing leader development model is outdated, and there is no training model. The Army needs a model that clearly shows leaders, staffs and outside agencies how training and leader development are interrelated and mutually supporting. This training and leader development model must emphasize Army culture; mandate standards for soldiers, leaders and units; provide feedback to leaders, units and the Using technology, our leaders can dominate full spectrum battlefields, and developing those leaders is the best preparation for an uncertain future. The ATLDP has taken a self-generated, introspective review of our training and leader development programs. The entire Army participated in the officer portion of the study to provide credible conclusions and recommendations. A similar process will review warrant officer and noncommissioned officer programs this summer.

Leaders and soldiers must be at the center of our Transformation efforts. Otherwise, we will focus on technology, platforms and weapon systems at the expense of Transformations center of gravity . . . our people. Using technology, our leaders can dominate full spectrum battlefields, and developing those leaders is the best preparation for an uncertain future. The ATLDP has taken a self-generated, introspective review of our training and leader development programs. The entire Army participated in the officer portion of the study to provide credible conclusions and recommendations. A similar process will review noncommissioned officer and warrant officer programs this summer. The officer study revealed the seven strategic imperatives outlined above. Detailed discussion, conclusions and recommendations regarding each imperative will be featured in the next issue of Military Review. 
Superior mobility must be achieved if we are to surprise our opponent, select the terrain on which we are to fight and gain the initiative. There is no alternative. If we are slow in movement, awkward in maneuver, clumsy in deploymentin a word, not mobilewe can expect to be forestalled, enveloped or constrained to launch costly frontal attacks against an enemy advantageously posted.
Infantry in Battle, The Infantry Journal, Washington DC, 1939 T RANSFORMATION IS A TIME for developing new concepts, organizations and capabilities for dealing with adversaries and maintaining relevance with our national security strategy. In concert with the other US Armed Forces, the Army should have rapid global reach for conducting major theater wars, smaller-scale contingencies and peacetime military engagements. The current geopolitical environment, effects of globalization, critical regional resources, vulnerable trade routes and continued economic growth require an Army that can access landmass interiors and resolve a situation quickly and decisively with tailored overmatch. All this must be done while operating from exterior lines, a requirement no other country has on the scale of the United States.
To be strategically deployable, the Transformed Army must maximize critical airlift to move heavy, medium and light force packages anywhere in the world rapidly. This transformed force must optimize the synergistic use of US Army and US Air Force (USAF) systems for immediate operational maneuver regardless of enemy strategies to deny use of airfields, seaports and forward bases. To have tactical mobility in all types of terrain, forces must have fast-moving, protected vehicles and a vertical lift capability. A force today must have multipurpose systems for versatility, organizational flexibility to act freely throughout the area of operations and adaptability to immediately move from peace support operations to combat. It is unadvisable to depend on only one method of operation, which the enemy has been studying to counter.
During the Cold War the US National Military Strategy (NMS) centered on a policy of containment, which required robust forces forwardly deployed in Europe and Asia. Extensive basing with welldeveloped interior lines and mature infrastructure characterized US force disposition. Mobilization and methodical phased deployment fo-

12 July-August 2001 l MILITARY REVIEW l A sustained, recapitalized Legacy Force. l An Interim Force using available technology. l An Objective Force equipped with technological breakthroughs. Army Transformation is focused on deploying a combat brigade via C-130 aircraft. Interim and Objective Forces will be lighter than legacy brigades but are equipped with combat vehicles that provide more mobility, lethality and protection than current Army light forces. However, as envisioned, they will rely on secured international airports, have no forcedentry capability and employ traditional two-dimensional maneuver warfare. This current Transformation model does not take advantage of the unrestricted use of space. It lacks local responsiveness, tactical flexibility and operational depth, and limits the commanders options. Transformation forces should be shaped not only for strategic deployability to international airports but also for night landing on austere airstrips or airdropping mechanized forces with protection. Ideally, this force should be capable of helicopter transport for speed and tactical flexibility. This capability takes advantage of the synergistic effects of maneuver, precision fires and force protection, capitalizing on the US lead in information superiority. A commander can rapidly seize the initiative and concentrate forces from different points against enemy vulnerabilities.
The Army selected the heavy-wheeled light armored vehicle (LAV)-III to equip the interim brigade combat team (IBCT). The LAV-III weighs about 38,000 pounds, combat equipped, which is at the extreme payload envelope of the C-130, limiting landings to long, improved runways. No US helicopter can sling load it. As with most wheeled armored vehicles, the LAV-III is very tall, barely clearing the roof of a C-130, which rules out airdrop. The LAV-III armored gun version is entirely too tall for the C-130. When the LAV-III add-on armor is mounted, the LAV-III weighs 43,000 pounds, which precludes C-130 transport altogether.
The extra weight of the LAV-III is a consequence of the typical arrangement of most wheeled armored cars. US Tank-Automotive and Armaments Command studies found that armored cars are about 28 percent heavier and larger than comparable tracked vehicles. Large wheel assemblies, multiple drive shafts and the numerous gearboxes involved in all-wheel-drive running gearnot additional armor protection account for the extra weight. The LAV-IIIs heavy weight is divided among eight wheels, resulting in high ground pressure and dramatically increased vulnerability to mines. Compared with heavy tracked M1 Abrams tanks and M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles (IFVs), the LAV-III is far easier to maintain, has much faster road speed, runs dramatically quieter and burns less than 25 percent of the fuel. However, these advantages are only marginal when compared to light tracked vehicles like the M113 family of vehicles. Finally, as an entirely new inventory item, the LAV-III is expensive at $2 million each and will require extended time for high-rate production, mechanics training and spare parts.
An alternative to the strategy constrained by the LAV-III, the air-mech-strike (AMS) concept achieves the strategic deployment, operational maneuver and tactical mobility necessary for a cost-effective,
MILITARY REVIEW l July-August 2001 progressive, joint-friendly, relevant Army Transformation. Other armies around the world have already developed this concept with far less funding than the US Armys.
AMS is the projection of protected mechanized forces by air-land, airdrop and helicopter insertion from both internal and external loads. This full-dimensional maneuver concept emphasizes air transportability to break friction with terrain and obstacles and insert maneuver forces quickly for positional advantage. Recent improvements in the lift capacity of helicopters and the performance of lightweight, armored vehicles have made vertical insertion of mechanized forces possible. Russian, British and German armies already have operational airmechanized forces. The French, Swiss, Swedish and Finnish armies have all recently purchased large numbers of airmechanized vehicles. The Peoples Republic of China has likewise purchased 200 airmech vehicles from Russia. In contrast, the US Army has the worlds largest helicopter fleet but no airmech capability.
Russias army has had an operational airmechanized force for more than 40 years. In fact, the term airmechanization comes from a Russian translation of early work Soviet Field Marshal Tuchechevsky did on this concept in the 1930s. At the height of the Soviet armys strength, there were eight airmechanized divisions equipped with motorcycles, light weapons carriers and the BMD-series armored fighting vehicles. These airborne divisions could parachute mechanized infantry units behind enemy lines or air assault these mechanized forces via Mi-6 and Mi-26 helicopters. Today the reduced Russian army has about three such divisions equipped with more than 2,000 BMD-2 airmech combat vehicles and several hundred new BMD-3s equipped with a tank-like 100millimeter (mm) cannon. These vehicles are airdrop-capable and helo-transportable, even by US Army CH-47 helicopters.
The British army built a rapidly deployable light armored force in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Its criteria called for a brigade-sized element whose vehicles could be transported by C-130 transports, I Corps soldiers training with LAV-IIIs at Fort Lewis, Washington.

The British army selected an 8-ton series of armored vehicles that eventually led to the Spartan troop carrier and the Scimitar fighting vehicle equipped with a shoot-on-the-move, high-velocity, 30mm automatic cannon. The 8-ton design allowed a C-130 to transport two vehicles and a CH-47 helicopter to sling one, making Great Britain the first NATO country with airmechanized capability. A British airmobile brigade conducted an AMS 25 years later over Serbian minefields in Kosovo following the July 1999 air campaignestablishing its sector in only 24 hours. With no such capability, the US Army took several days to occupy its sector fully.
In the 1980s the German army, influenced by the earlier Russian and British efforts, decided to reorganize its foot-mobile airborne (parachute) regiment into an airmechanized force. In 1992 the Germans fielded more than 300 Wiesel armored tracked vehicles, which are light enough to sling under a UH-60 Black Hawk. Optimized as a counter-Soviet antiarmored force, these vehicles were equipped with 20mm auto cannons and heavy tube-launched, optically tracked, wireguided missiles with all-around armor protection from 7.62mm small arms. To improve the brigades infantry carrying capability in the post-Cold War, the German army is purchasing the Swedish airmech vehicle, the 6-ton BV-206S. This armored, articulated vehicle carries a full 11-troop squad; is still light enough for the CH-47 Chinook to carry; and detaches into two separate cabs that Black Hawks can carry. The British royal marines and the French, Swiss, Swedish, Spanish and Finnish armies are purchasing the BV-206S to gain an airmechanized capability. The US Army operates an unarmored earlier version called the small-unit support vehicle in Alaska. The small sizes of the Wiesel and BV-206S allow the entire German airmechanized brigade to deploy using only 20 Boeing 747 jets, or it can be inserted via parachute from 100 to 150 C-130 sorties.
An improved European-based airmechanized model can work in the US Army. This proposal uses a combination of existing combat vehicles, along with a modest purchase of European airmech vehicles already in production, lift helicopters, USAF aircraft and civilian Boeing 747s. The airmechanized concept optimizes combat vehicles for aircraft transportability. When secure airports are available, Boeing 747s can move an airmechanized brigades entire combat power, releasing available C-17s and C-5s for transporting outsized force packages such as helicopters, tanks, artillery and multiple-launch rocket systems.
A Wiesel-2 slingloaded from a UH-60 Black Hawk. The following option focuses on the four active light divisions. Three classes of vehicles are introduced: airmechanized vehiclemedium (AMV-M) weighing 8 to 10 tons, airmechanized vehiclelight (AMV-L) weighing 3 to 7 tons and military all-terrain vehicles (MATVs) weighing 500 to 4,000 pounds. For simpler comparisons the four light divisions are centered on the three types of airmech vehicles. Actual organizations should consist of combinations in various percentages.
AMV-M design. The US Armys 10th and 25th light divisions are reorganized using a modified lightweight M113 armored personnel carrier employing band tracks and Kevlar hatches (M113LW) as the prime candidate for the AMV-M. Each division has three brigades of 300 M113LWs each. The M113LW weighs about 19,000 pounds (the M113A3 weighs 23,000) and can be sling-loaded by a CH-47 helicopter. Two M113LWs can be transported by C-130 as opposed to one LAV-III. Add-on armor carried in follow-on aircraft can increase protection up to the LAV-IIIs 14.5mm proof standard. The M113LW has about the same internal space as a LAV-III and, being tracked, superior cross-country and urban mobility. Both vehicles can mount the same weapon systems, including the 105mm cannon armored turret.
The band tracks for the M113LW increase the road speed over the stock M113 and make the ride smoother and quieter although the LAV-III has a slight advantage in both areas. The low-pressure footprint of the M113LW reduces mine vulnerability. The M113LW uses AMV-L design. The 101st Air Assault Division is reorganized around the purchase of 900 European 3-to 7-ton AMV-Ls, 300 per brigade combat team. The two leading candidates are the German Wiesel-2 and the Swedish BV-206S tracked armored vehicles. A squad would require two Wiesels, carrying six troops each, but could be sling-loaded by one UH-60 helicopter. The BV-206S is larger with room for full squads of H.L. Mencken, the famed sage of Baltimore, wrote that for every problem there is a nice, neat solution, which is inevitably wrong. The same might be said for critics who claim that the US Armys new heavy weapon systems, such as the Crusader self-propelled howitzer or the M1A2 system enhancement package (SEP), are not suitable for the Armys 21st-century transformation strategy, which seeks to make major Army weapons lighter and air deployable.

Smaller-scale contingencies will require US ground forces to be deployed overseas at unprecedented speeds: a combat brigade of up to 3,500 troops in four days and a division of 12,000 in five. The risk is simple: will future US Army forces, lacking heavy direct-and indirectfire weapons, be ready to take on a well-armed aggressor? Historically, deficiencies in heavy fire support do not become obvious until large ground forces are deeply embroiled in combat.

The United States does not face a high probability of major interstate war. However, the probability is not zero. It was only in 1994 that Saddam Hussein once again threatened to invade Kuwait, and a few months later, Pyongyang threatened to invade South Korea. 
3
In fact, criticism of the Armys deployment capabilities has entered the realm of the absurd. Because the Army has experienced problems deploying heavy ground combat power, such as the 1999 war over Kosovo, critics have illogically challenged the future relevance of major ground combat forces. More important, the Army itself has not ruled out the possibility of major combat operations. A case in point is the Armys positioning of bulky equipment. Today the Army has seven heavy-brigade sets of equipment pre-positioned: one in Italy, Kuwait, Qatar and South Korea; two in Central Europe; and one afloat.

Critics confuse the probability and number of future interstate wars with the likelihood of firepower-intense conflicts. It is not difficult to foresee future operations, short of a major interstate war, in which the firepower provided by Crusader and the M1A2 SEP would be necessary to counter our adversaries. States can easily obtain sophisticated weaponry. A recent study authorized by the National Intelligence Council noted that technology diffusion will accelerate as weapons and militarily relevant technologies are moved rapidly and routinely

Both vehicles offer all-around 7.62mm ball protection with add-on armor to stop 7.62 armor-piercing rounds. Light footprints make these two vehicles unlikely to set off pressure-detonated antitank mines; however, in a blast sequence, the vehicles are less survivable than the M113 or LAV-III. Low-recoil auto cannons up to 30mm can be carried along with every known antitank guided missile and the heavy 120mm mortar.
While the Wiesel and LAV-III have comparable road speeds, the BV-206S is slower. The BV-206S has superior terrain agility; its articulated track system allows it to negotiate large obstacles, swampland, wooded terrain and steep slopes. The two separate cabs of the BV-206S also across national borders in response to increasingly commercial rather than security calculations.

No one can be confident that the revolutions in warfare and the concomitant rush to transform US military forces allow greater reliance on air and naval standoff capabilities and less on ground forces. Using air power for nearly a decade after defeating Iraq during Operation Desert Storm has not removed Husseins threat. And, using air power in Operation Allied Force to force Serbia to withdraw from Kosovo was plagued with enough problems to cause the Clinton administration to contemplate using ground forces almost to the very end.
Our new tanks and cannon field artillery will provide increased and more accurate firepower from longer distances and the ability to share battlefield intelligence with ships and aircraft. Moreover, using tube artillery instead of missiles does not exclude precision fires. The latest howitzers are two-fers. In addition to firing inexpensive iron rounds, advanced cannons could deliver precision submunitions inside 30-foot circles. Considering that the standard 155-millimeter projectiles normal bursting radius is around 100 feet, the cannon critics single-minded preference for missiles seems all the more misplaced.
Finally, there is a remarkable lack of hard data backing up the presumption that US forces must be able to deploy immediately to fight successfully and defeat an opponent. Consider the cases in Iraq and Taiwan. Although air power has not unseated Hussein, it has quite capably contained him. US Central Commands ability to slow down an Iraqi attack has improved since Desert Storm, through regular exercises, pre-positioned materiel and the much lower readiness level of Iraqi military forces. US ground forces have more time to deploy to the theater to defeat Iraq decisively, should it attack anyone in the Middle East again.
In Taiwan, it is improbable that China could successfully mount a surprise amphibious assault against the main island because it is unlikely China can quickly achieve air superiority. While the long-term threat to Taiwan remains serious, it is doubtful the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) could achieve the maneuver, surprise and strength necessary to land troops where they would not be locally outnumbered and outgunned by defenders. It is unlikely that mainland China will acquire the logistic muscle to strengthen its invading forces faster than Taiwan can reinforce its defending forces. The protracted PLA campaign necessary to put Taiwan in real jeopardy would allow more than enough time for the United States to deploy or pre-position even its heaviest forces.
Major conflicts remain not only possible but probable. However, unlike Federal Express packages, US ground forces do not really have to get there overnight. To make US forces formidable when they do arrive, heavy weapon systems, such as Crusader, are still good investments both for the 21st-century Army and national security in an uncertain world.  Both vehicles cost about $500,000 and are small enough for about 20 Boeing 747 sorties to transport the entire brigades combat power. MATV design. The 82d Airborne Division is reorganized with 300 wheeled MATVs per brigade and 900 per division. The MATVs would be 4x4 or 6x6 wheeled vehicles, some with limited 5.56mm armor plate. The candidates are the British Supacat and the US-made Flyer 21 and Polaris RANGER. These vehicles would be easy to deploy with stacking capability; one Boeing 747 could transport about 50. The MATVs light weight and small size would also facilitate airdropping large numbers by relatively few T-tail USAF cargo aircraft. The light weight and compact size would facilitate long-range air assaults, employing UH-60 and CH-47 helicopters with auxiliary fuel tanks making insertions out to 400 km. The MATV can carry various weapons up to 40mm automatic grenade launchers, heavy antitank missiles and medium mortars. These vehicles cost about $100,000 and are very easy to maintain. While the MATV would not present a well-protected vehicle like the M113 or BV-206S, the ability to deploy so many in so few aircraft sorties would allow the 82d Airborne Division to be inserted rapidly with excellent ground mobility and more firepower than current foot-mobile brigades with hand-held weapons. The low cost per vehicle makes the option all the more attainable.
Air defense artillery affects helicopter flight as antitank defenses do armored maneuver. Both defenses must be suppressed and accounted for in risk-factor planning, but history has shown that the static nature of such defenses normally does not preclude armored or helicopter maneuver. Because AMS forces are mechanized, landing and drop zones can be displaced tens of km away from enemy concentrations and high-density air defenses. If enemy air defenses are too strong to permit helicopter operations, then the AMS brigade can maneuver at mechanized speeds. Sling-loading vehicles, which increases risk, can be replaced by streamlined external-load (SEL) technology already available in the civil helicopter market. Using SEL to carry large external loads close to the underbelly of helicopters greatly improves maneuverability, nearly doubles assault radius and reduces above-ground signatures.
Adopting the proposed airmech option provides a foundation for developing more advanced three-dimensional capabilities in the Objective Force. In addition to meeting Shinsekis strategic deployment standards, the concept allows the force to airdrop an entire mechanized brigade in one lift and the option to insert light armor via helicopters out to a combat radius of 200 kmall using 1980s airmech vehicles and 1970s helicopter technology. Recent technological advances in information warfare, combat vehicles, weaponry, signature management and rotary-and fixed-wing aircraft point to revolutionary expansion of three-dimensional maneuver warfare. Committing now to the first stage of airmechanized capability assures institutional conversion throughout the Army that will
drive leader training and doctrine development to keep pace with future technological maneuver advances.
The need for increased range. Army legacy aircraft have a relatively short range and require large cargo aircraft for timely deployment to a crisis theater. This limitation also increases risk in the short 200-km tactical sling-load radius of airmech vehicles. AMS proposes to remedy this shortfall by joining the Navys vectored thrust ducted propeller (VTDP) modification to the Sikorsky H-60 helicopter series. This technology replaces the tail rotor of the AH-64 and UH-60 with a ducted fan and short wings to nearly double the cruise speed from 120 to 220 knots. This increased speed changes a worldwide, self-deployed, sevento 10-day challenge to a four-day operation.
Adopting commercially available SEL configurations for the CH-47 and UH-60 would likewise extend the range even further, reducing the risk from enemy air defenses through closer terrain flight. The result of an aggressive 5-year VTDP and SEL program could achieve 4-day self-deployment for Army aviation and double the combat insertion radius from 200 to 400 km. The range increase greatly enhances surprise, flexibility and survivability while multiplying the area of influence of a deployed Army force. These programs would extend the viability of legacy aircraft until about 2015 to 2020 when a future transport rotorcraft (FTR) could be fielded as a CH-47 and UH-60 replacement. FTR would employ revolutionary rotor technologies such as retractable and tilt rotors to achieve 500-knot cruise speeds, same-day self-deployment and a 1,500-km insertion radius for a 20-ton armored vehicle.
Future combat system (FCS). Scheduled to arrive with the FTR in 2015, the FCS is the Armys replacement for the M1 Abrams tank and the M2 Bradley IFV. The FCSs common chassis will yield a carrier version weighing 10 tons and an attack version weighing 20 tons. The FTR will transport either two carriers or one attack FCS to mass for an operation. Instead of fielding heavy armor, advanced weapons will include hypervelocity rocket penetrators and advanced chemical energy warheads. FCS will use advanced signature-management technologies to hide from sensors and avoid being hit as the principal means of ballistic survivability. Different mission models of FCS will have the same external appearance to complicate enemy imagery calculations. Even fire support platforms, such as trailer-mounted artillery rockets, will appear to be logistic carriers.
Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) use. The lighter FCS and FTR force of the future will employ large numbers of UAVs and UGVs. Leaders down to platoon level will be able to launch these relatively inexpensive aerial and ground probes to greatly expand situational awareness and reduce risk to manned reconnaissance. Using ground robotics will also allow commanders to move weapons, ammunition and logistic materiel while reducing the drain on manpower and the risk on soldiers from ambush, land mines and contaminated areas. Organic flying and driving sensors will be tied into larger, more sophisticated platforms with data downlinks, further enhancing commanders battlefield awareness. By widely using UAVs and UGVs, a two-dimensional enemy force will be especially vulnerable to standoff joint and Army precision munitions, facilitating a better overmatch when the inevitable closure with the enemy and objectives occurs.
Strategic joint projection improvements. More sophisticated cargo aircraft, such as the C-17, will be needed to project Army combat power. The aging C-130 fleet will need to be replaced with new platforms that deliver Army forces to unimproved fields employing super-short takeoff
The and landing craft. A leading candidate is Lockheeds tilt-wing concept that promises to deliver up to three 20-ton FCSs. Another projecting and sustaining technology for Army land forces is the wing-in-ground (WIG) effect. Large Russian-built prototypes have demonstrated that surfaceskimming aircraft can carry four times the load of a current C-5 by using the extra lift associated with ground effect. WIG is a possible replacement for the aging C-5 fleet. The aircraft would be used only over water but could substantially improve early-entry forces projection and sustainment. Joint mobile offshore bases can also be substantially improved by linking 10 to 12 supertankers together, under a flat deck, projecting Army forces via USAF tilt-wing and FTR systems. Not intended for amphibious Marine-style assaults, these floating bases would be semipermanent as a partial solution to the lack of forward bases.
US Army relevance in the 21st century depends on the ability to deploy sizable forces rapidly from the Continental United States. Once deployed, they must quickly gain decisive, positional advantage over any adversary throughout the spectrum of conflict. The formula for such a force lies in the concept of airmechanization, which takes advantage of information superiority and provides strategic deployability, forcedentry capability, dominant maneuver, tactical agility, survivability, operations in depth and flexibility for the commander. Two-dimensional warfare will no longer give our forces the overmatch to win. Many of our European allies are already well down the airmech road. The US military already has airmechanizations most expensive element the most robust helicopter and fixed-wing force in the world. Transformation should capitalize on that capability and enable the Armys full-dimensional maneuverthe money saved can be reallocated to other NMS priorities.
S TRATEGIC ASYMMETRY uses some sort of difference to gain an advantage over an adversary. Many of historys greatest generals had an instinct for it. Like the US military in the Gulf War, Mongols under Genghis Khan and his successors often used superior mobility, operational speed, intelligence, synchronization, training and morale to crush enemies in lightning campaigns. When necessary, the Mongols used superior Chinese engineering for successful sieges. Other conquerors, such as the Romans, Europeans, Aztecs and Zulus, brought superior technology, discipline, training and leadership to the battlefield. Rebels in anticolonial wars also relied on asymmetry by weaving guerrilla operations, protracted warfare, political warfare and a willingness to sacrifice into Maoist Peoples War, the Intifada and the troubles of Northern Ireland.
Throughout the Cold War, asymmetry was important to US strategic thinking but was not labeled as such. Matching Soviet quantitative advantages in Europe with US and NATO qualitative superiority was integral to US strategy. Other concepts such as Massive Retaliation in the 1950s or the maritime strategy in the 1980s elevated asymmetry to an even higher plane.

Explicit mention of asymmetry first appeared in the 1995 Joint Publication 1, Joint Warfare of the Armed Forces of the United States, but the concept was used in a very simplistic, limited sense.

The intelligence community and the Joint Staff reacted to the panels report, and a flurry of activity
ensued to flesh out the meaning and implications of strategic asymmetry.

7
Clear thinking begins with simple, comprehensive, shared definitions. The 1999 Joint Strategy Review provided the broadest official treatment of asymmetry: Asymmetric approaches are attempts to circumvent or undermine US strengths while exploiting US weaknesses using methods that differ significantly from the United States expected method of operations. . . . [Asymmetric approaches] generally seek a major psychological impact, such as shock or confusion, that affects an opponents initiative, freedom of action or will. Asymmetric methods require an appreciation of an opponents vulnerabilities. Asymmetric approaches often employ innovative, nontraditional tactics, weapons or technologies and can be applied at all levels of warfare strategic, operational and tactical and across the spectrum of military operations. 
8
asymmetry is likely to make more adjustments and require a more flexible counterstrategy. A more general, complete definition of strategic asymmetry would be: In military affairs and national security, asymmetry is acting, organizing and thinking differently from opponents to maximize relative strengths, exploit opponents weaknesses or gain greater freedom of action. It can be politicalstrategic, military-strategic, operational or a combination, and entail different methods, technologies, values, organizations or time perspectives. It can be short-term, long-term, deliberate or by default. It also can be discrete or pursued in conjunction with symmetric approaches and have both psychological and physical dimensions. While the key idea is that significant differences exist, there are several elements of this definition that warrant elaboration.
Dimensions of asymmetry. Strategic asymmetry can be positive or negative. Positive asymmetry uses differences to gain an advantage. US military strategy places great value on superior training, leadership and technology to sustain and exploit superiority. Negative asymmetry involves an opponents threat to ones vulnerabilities. Most DOD thinking about asymmetry focuses on its negative form.
Strategic asymmetry can also be short-term or long-term. Military history shows that sooner or later the enemy adjusts to many types of short-term strategic asymmetry. During World War II, for instance, blitzkrieg succeeded for a year or two until the Soviets found ways to counter it. It took longer, but Third World governments and their militaries eventually found counters to the Maoist Peoples War. The 1999 air campaign against Serbia suggests that enemies may find ways to counter US advantages in air power by camouflage, dispersion and dense, but relatively unsophisticated, air defense systems. Long-term asymmetry is more rare. The United States will probably sustain its asymmetric advantage over certain types of enemies for a fairly long time, largely by devoting more resources to maintain military superiority than potential enemies. However, sustaining an asymmetric advantage requires constant effort; any military force that does not adapt to strategic change will decline in effectiveness.
Strategic asymmetry can be deliberate or by default. US strategists actively think about asymmetry and how best to use or control it. More often, antagonists in a conflict simply use what they have and do what they know. An asymmetric outcome is more accidental than planned. For instance, a combined French and Indian force defeated British General Edward Braddock near Fort Duquesne in 1775, and a group of colonial mountaineers defeated loyalists, commanded by Major Patrick Ferguson, at Kings Mountain in 1780. The Indians and moun-taineers were victorious because they fought in a way they understood, not because they analyzed the weakness of the more conventional loyalist forces and designed ways to take advantage of them. In most anticolonial wars or insurgencies, the less-advanced forces preferred to emulate the advanced ones.
Mao Zedong held that guerrilla warfare was seldom decisive but should be used as a preface for large-scale mobile war. 9 After all, it was not the Viet Cong who overthrew the government of South Vietnam but a conventional combined arms force from North Vietnam. Understanding whether the asymmetry is deliberate or by default is important since an enemy using deliberate asymmetry is likely to make more adjustments and require a more flexible counterstrategy.
Strategic asymmetry can be low-risk or high-risk. Some forms of asymmetry such as superior training or leadership are time-tested. They may be costly to develop and maintain but seldom increase strategic or operational risk. The high cost of having a fully trained, equipped, ready force reduces risk even though it may not fully protect against all asymmetric actions such as the attack in Aden, Yemen. In another sense the assault was a low-cost, high-risk action that may have had disproportionate consequencesremoving US naval presence from a key port and possibly others. Other forms of asymmetry are experimental and are risky. Terrorism, for instance, may be a low-cost, high-risk approach because it can generate a backlash against users or reinforce rather than erode the targets resolve. Just as most mutations in nature are dysfunctional or insignificant, many forms of strategic asymmetry are acts of desperation that do not work or only work temporarily.
Strategic asymmetry can be discrete or integrated with symmetric techniques. Generally, only the most desperate antagonists would rely solely on asymmetric methods. Those who are capable integrate asymmetric and symmetric methods. Joint Vision 2020 notes that our adversaries may pursue a combination of asymmetries, or the United States may face
ASYMMETRIC WARFARE a number of adversaries who, in combination, create an asymmetric threat. 
10
Finally, asymmetry can be material or psychological. The two concepts are interrelated: a material asymmetric advantage often generates psychological advantages. But there have been states and militaries throughout history that were particularly adept at manipulating psychological asymmetry, often by propagating an image of fierceness. The Mongols, Assyrians, Aztecs and Zulus are examples of great conquerors who effectively combined material and psychological asymmetry. Their fierce image augmented advantages in training, leadership and doctrine. Often psychological asymmetry is cheaper than the material variant but is harder to sustain.
Levels of asymmetry. The most common form of asymmetry resides at the operational level of war. Historical examples include the Germans use of submarine warfare to counterbalance the British advantage in capital ships; urban operations to counterbalance a military force with superior mobility; long-range fires in the battles for Stalingrad or Hue; guerrilla operations in an enemys rear area as an adjunct to conventional operations; Operation Bodyguard, the operational-level deception plan to support the Normandy invasion; and antiaccess or counterdeployment techniques using missiles, mines, terrorism and other weapons. Military-strategic asymmetry is an integrated military strategy based on asymmetry rather than using it as an adjunct to symmetric methods. Examples include the Maoist Peoples War, blitzkrieg and Massive Retaliation, the strategic concept that Warsaw Pact aggression would invite a US nuclear strike on the Soviet homeland.
Politico-strategic asymmetry is using nonmilitary means to gain a military advantage. For instance, recent attempts to ban forms of military technology, including information warfare, target the United States more than less-developed states. Similarly, one opponent in a conflict might be able to gain an advantage by claiming victim status. While the North Vietnamese were able to gain the moral high ground against the United States to some extent, Slobodan Milosevic and Saddam Hussein failed. In any case, politico-strategic asymmetry is likely to become increasingly significant as information and globalization make states more susceptible to external political pressure.

At least six forms of asymmetry are relevant in the realm of national security and warfare. Asymmetric methods involve using different operational concepts or tactical doctrines than the enemy. Examples include guerrilla war and other nonlinear concepts. Many of the operational concepts the US Army anticipates using in the future, such as advanced vertical envelopment with mobile, protected forces (as opposed to air assaults or airdrops using simple foot-mobile infantry), would entail operational asymmetry.
Asymmetric technologies have been common in military history, particularly in wars pitting an industrially advanced state against a backward one such as Europes imperial wars of the 19th and 20th centuries. While the Europeans brought a wide array of military advantages to bear in their colonial wars, Hillaire Belloc captured their enduring trust in technological asymmetry when he wrote, Whatever happens, we have got the Maxim gun and they have not. Advanced technology can be decisive in conflicts when the less-developed antagonist cannot adapt. Britains colonial forces first used the Maxim gun in the Matabele War in 1893-94. In one engagement, 50 soldiers fought off 5,000 Matabele warriors with just four Maxim guns. However, during protracted wars, clever enemies tend to find counters to asymmetric technology. Vietnam provides the clearest example.
Asymmetries of will are important when one antagonist sees its survival or vital interest at stake and the other is protecting or promoting less-than-vital interests. This type of asymmetry played a role during conflicts in Vietnam, Somalia and Iraq. An asymmetry of will leads the antagonist with the higher stake to bear greater costs, accept greater risk and undertake actions the less-committed antagonist might eschew on moral or legal grounds. Asymmetries of will are most relevant at the level of grand strategy. At the operational and tactical levels, the equivalent of an asymmetry of will is an asymmetry of morale, which can be crucial, even decisive. Napoleon Bonaparte held, In war the moral is to the material as three to one. Asymmetries of will are closely related to normative asymmetries between antagonists with different ethical or legal standards. The United States faces enemies willing to use terrorism, ethnic cleansing and human shields. In the long term such actions can be self-defeating if they alienate potential supporters, but they can generate desired results in the short term, particularly by highlighting an asymmetry of will.
Asymmetries of organization can provide great advantage to even a state without other advantages. Examples include the Macedonian phalanx, Swiss pike formations that dominated European battlefields during the Renaissance, the levee en masse which helped French revolutionaries stave off a number of professional European armies, the system of independent but mutually supporting corps Napoleon created and insurgent undergrounds. In the future, state militaries may face nonstate enemies organized as networks rather than hierarchies. 
11
Because of US global security commitments, involvement in a protracted conflict might encourage enemies to undertake aggression, believing US resources are spread too thin. US advantages in strategic mobility match the desire for a quick win the preferred operational style. Knowing this preference and knowing or suspecting the limited US stockpile of precision weapons, an adversary might seek to extend a conflict. In addition to straining the quick-win preference, if the weapons become more blunt, collateral casualties will rise, and the enemy might gain a moral advantage. Conversely, the shorter a conflict involving the US military, the greater the US advantage will be. Asymmetries of patience have a cultural component as well. Americans are instinctively impatient, seeking fast resolution of any problem. This attitude contrasted with Asian patience and willingness to prevail in a conflict that lasts for years or decades. While
sweeping cultural generalizations are fraught with danger, there is at least a kernel of truth in this one. Somewhere, the US military is likely to face an enemy attempting to take advantage of an asymmetry of patience.
The operational concepts that form the basis of Joint Vision 2020 full-spectrum dominance derived from dominant maneuver, precision engagement, focused logistics and full-dimensional protectionare designed to take advantage of positive asymmetry but are also relevant to countering negative asymmetry. To best meet asymmetric challenges, though, the US military should adopt and develop five strategic concepts that build on the joint vision operational concepts.
Maximum conceptual and organizational adaptability. Two characteristics of asymmetric threats are particularly important: US defense planners today cannot know precisely what asymmetric threats will emerge or prove effective; and the effectiveness of asymmetric threats sooner or later declines as the enemy adjusts. By maximizing conceptual and organizational adaptability and flexibility, the US military can assure that it will rapidly counter emerging asymmetric threats and speed the process that renders asymmetric threats insignificant or ineffective. The military that develops new concepts and organizations more quickly than its opponents has a decided advantage.
DOD must institutionalize ways to keep adaptation and transformation processes continuous and rapid. Part of the solution involves shifting attitudes. Innovation and creativity must be nurtured and valued throughout uniformed and DOD civilian ranks. While iconoclasts and nonconformists should not rule the military, they should be valued, preserved and heard. Experimentation and research should focus on strategic and operational adaptability. For instance, experiments should create new types of organizations to deal with new types of enemies. If networked nonstate enemies become a major threat to US security, how quickly could the nation organize to deal with them? In all likelihood, some future US military components must acquire network characteristics to counter networked enemies.
DOD experimentation should focus more on potential asymmetric challenges. Today, the enemy in most armed service and DOD experiments or war games remains a traditional, mechanized, state military that has invaded a neighboring state. Asymmetric war games should form a greater proportion of the total. Joint war games should be a robust test of transformation and modernization programs, not a confirmation or endorsement process. At the National Training Center, Fort Irwin, California, the Army has learned the value of ignominious defeat at the hands of a highly skilled Red team. For some reason, the same process is seldom applied to strategic war games. Both congressional and DOD leaders must recognize that a Blue war-game defeat does not invalidate a transformation or modernization program but simply provides a means of adjustment and refinement.
The process of focusing more analysis and ex-

perimentation on asymmetric challenges would be strengthened by an institutional focus. DOD should fund a center to study emerging threats that is closely linked to the joint community, the combatant commands and the armed services but independent enough to be creative and innovative. This center should be tied to the joint experimentation process at the US Joint Forces Command, the Pentagons Office of Net Assessment, the Defense Intelligence Agencys futures programs, service experimentation programs, concept development centers and battle labs. It should also have strong interagency and multinational connections.
At a somewhat different level, the US military should prepare for asymmetric challenges by making unit and system modularity a central criterion during force development. Versatility and agility are the touchstones. The armed services and joint community should experiment with ways to build taskspecific organizations rapidly. The US militarys experience forming joint task forces must expand to explore how future organizations would build interagency and multinational ties. Modularity should also be a criterion for developing and procuring systems. Future multipurpose systems like the Black Hawk helicopter and the high-mobility, multipurpose, wheeled vehicle (HMMWV) could perform an even wider array of tasks and be reconfigured according to the mission. This would give the Army an added degree of flexibility and better prepare it for asymmetric challenges. While multipurpose systems are seldom as effective as single-purpose ones, multipurpose systems make the most sense in an age of strategic uncertainty and could serve as a foundation for single-purpose systems if long-term needs become clear.
Focused intelligence. There is growing agreement in the defense and intelligence communities that US intelligence efforts need to refocus on nontraditional threats. Intelligence collection, analysis and dissemination should become increasingly interagency for maximum effectiveness. In addition, intelligence focused on asymmetric threats should make greater use of open sourcespublicly available information.

The Joint Strategy Review emphasizes the need for improved human intelligence (HUMINT) to counter asymmetric threats. 
14
Minimal vulnerability. The Joint Vision 2020 concept of full-dimensional protection applies to asymmetric threats. Current force-protection efforts, augmented by developments in robotics and nonlethal weapons, can help counter terrorism and other attempts to cause casualties and erode US will. Minimal vulnerability would also require resilience or nondependence on systems susceptible to attack. Single sources of anything invite asymmetric attacks, but with some systems, redundancy may be too expensive. All reasonable steps should be taken

to avoid dependence on any single operational method or system. For instance, if the US military becomes so dependent on information superiority that it cannot function without it, asymmetric attacks against information systems could be devastating or even decisive. Even as the US military increases its use of digital technology, it should sustain some skill at older, low-tech methods. Finding ways to project power against an enemy who employs an access-denial strategy and to sustain projected forces without forward bases would be an important part of minimizing vulnerability. Since the campaigns of Generals Ulysses S. Grant and William T. Sherman, the American way of war has called for stocking massive amounts of materiel and supplies in theater for decisive victory. This strategy is contingent on the enemys inability to strike rear bases effectively. But if future enemies have precision-guided munitions, weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems, in-theater sanctuaries may not exist. Even air superiority and theater missile defense would be inadequate against a nuclear-armed enemy, since they cannot assure 100percent effectiveness. The future US military could confront a counterdeployment strategy that uses sabotage or precision-guided munitions and ballistic missiles to attack bases and staging areas in the United States and in a theater of operations, and threaten states that provide support, bases, staging areas or overflight rights to the United States.
An enemy using a counterdeployment strategy could be blunted in several interrelated ways. One would be through greater intratheater mobility via lighter forces and systems such as high-speed, shallow-draft, sealift vessels. Another would be using theater reconfiguration areas located in remote areas of agreeable nations with a landing strip as the only fixed part of the base. All of the other things needed to prepare equipment and troops for combat could be mobile, concentrating just before an inbound aerial convoy arrived and dispersing as soon as it left. Inventorying supplies at a theater reconfiguration area would be kept to a minimum and replenished only when necessary. Repair and hospital facilities would also be mobile and dispersed.
Theater reconfiguration areas could be protected by conventional concealment methods, electronic masking, and a laser-based missile and air defense web combining ground-based fire platforms; longloiter and quick-launch, unmanned aerial vehicle fire platforms; and space-based sensor and fire platforms. Autonomous sentry systems somewhere between a full-fledged robot and a mobile, smart mine could provide local security. Host nation support would be minimum to protect operational security. To complicate targeting by enemies, several decoy theater reconfiguration areas could be set up in each country that allowed them. Such a shell game could provide effective deception and thus complicate attempts to strike theater reconfiguration areas with missiles.
Full-dimension precision. The US military will remain vulnerable to normative and political asymmetries. The more operations limit collateral damage and reach a speedy resolution, the less likely these challenges will prove important. One way of doing that is with greater full-dimension precision. One component of this is physical precisionthe ability to hit targets with great accuracy from great distances with precisely the desired physical effect. Physical precision derives from improved intelligence, guidance systems and, increasingly, from the ability to adjust weapon effects. A proposed electromagnetic gun, for instance, could be adjusted from a nonlethal setting to an extremely lethal one. 
15
Technology can help future militaries attain greater psychological precision. It is vital to have a very wide range of military optionsa rheostatic capability assures that an operation has the desired psychological effect. This suggests a growing need for effective nonlethal weapons, particularly when the psychological objective is to demonstrate the futility of opposition without killing so many of the enemy or noncombatants that the enemys will is steeled rather than broken or that public opposition is mobilized. Some advocates of nonlethal weapons go so far as to see them as the central element in future armed conflict. 
16
to develop a robust and integrated homeland security strategy and organization. Many homeland defense efforts are already under way, particularly in infrastructure protection and military roles. One important future task is sealing the seams between the agencies involved in homeland defense since gaps create vulnerabilities that an enemy might exploit.
Ultimately, negative asymmetry can be mitigated but not eliminated. That said, the United States is not on the verge of disaster. US military organizations, technology, strategy and doctrine can either deal with most asymmetric threats or be quickly modified to do so. The more adaptable, flexible and strategically agile the US military is, the better it will be prepared to deal with asymmetry. Positive asymmetry will continue to provide the US military with advantages over most enemies. Even so, DOD should continue to refine its understanding of asymmetric challenges. A more general and complete definition of asymmetry is needed as a foundation for doctrine and for integrating maximum adaptability and flexibility, focused intelligence, minimal vulnerability, full-dimension precision and integrated homeland security into US security strategy.  
Different forms of psychotechnology might allow greater psychological precision. Conceivably, technology could give militaries the ability to alter the perceptions of targets, perhaps causing intense fear or calm. But any state with the capability and inclination to develop such technology should be very careful because of the potential for violating basic human rights. In most cases, technology for psychological manipulation should be eschewed. Some state or organization without ethical and legal constraints may field an array of psychotechnology weapons. Then the United States will have to decide whether to respond in kind or seek other means of defense. The potential for a psychotechnology arms race is real.
Technology is only part of psychological precision. Much psychological analysis, particularly dealing with anxiety and fear, is not adequately integrated into military planning. When the goal is to create fear and anxiety or collapse the enemys will, the operation should be phased and shaped for maximum psychological impact. Successful militaries must assure that operational and strategic planning staffs are psychologically astute, whether by educating the planners themselves or using information technology to provide access to psychologists, cultural psychologists and members of other cultures. They should undertake cross-cultural psychological studies aimed at building databases and models that can help guide operational planning.
Integrated homeland security. Modern technology and globalization have changed strategic geography. The United States can no longer assume that conflict and warfare will only take place far from the homeland. Future enemies will have the means to strike at the US homeland with missiles, information attacks or terrorism. The United States needs T HE TERMS ASYMMETRY, asymmetric warfare, asymmetric approaches and asymmetric options are popular sound bites found in many military journals today. Asymmetric-related terms are commonly associated with a potential opponents operations or actions against US interests or forces. The attacks are commonly described as chemical, biological, nuclear, terrorist or information attacks, or attacks against weak points. Arguably, these attacks are not asymmetric. In fact, except for the terrorist example, these are symmetrical attacks. The United States has chemical, biological, nuclear and information means; therefore, such attacks cannot be asymmetric.
The asymmetric aspect of a chemical, nuclear, information or traditional attack actually relates to asymmetries in capabilities, reliance, vulnerabilities and values. The capabilities of certain forcessome information systems can shut down command and control systems and prevent nuclear systems from launchingconstitute one variable. A nations reliance on a particular system is another. For example, both sides can have information weapons, but one side may rely more on them than the other. The vulnerability of a system or platforms performance parameters, operating principles or situational context is another asymmetric opening, the one most often associated with weak spots. Finally, cultural values determine whether a nation will or will not use one of these methods.
The Russo-US relationship provides an example of such reasoning. Both countries have had biological and nuclear weapons for decades, yet no one has called this an asymmetric Russian threat. Neither side has used these weapons because of discussions that led to a common understanding and because of a value structure that placed national interests above other interests. However, if a country that conducts operations based on very different values obtains biological weapons, then we should worry. In some cultures, social and religious reasons may override national interests when choosing whether to use such weapons.
Judging by the multiple applications of the term in military journalsnot fighting fair, attacking a weak point, information or cyberwar, public relations war, weapons of mass destruction very few people understand asymmetrys formal definition. This is understandable since joint doctrine does not define the term.

responses would improve symmetry.
There is no distinct word for asymmetry in Chinese. To express this concept one would negate the word for to be symmetrical. This word for symmetry, duicheng, is also comprised of two characters. The word dui in ancient texts means to respond, to face or face off, to matchboth in the sense of complement but also in the sense of enemies matching in skill. The term cheng initially signified the concept of a balance and then evolved into a broader semantic sense of to accord with.

These definitions indicate that our understanding of asymmetry has strayed and become misused. None of the recognized definitions discusses weak points, unfair fighting or nontraditional means that many authors assert. The term apparently assumes whatever meaning military authors wish to portray and is thrown around like the grammatically incorrect term irregardless.
While it may be hard for US military leaders to recognize, the dictionary definition suggests that the United States is the worlds most asymmetric military force. While degrees of symmetry exist between other forces in developed countries, no one can symmetrically match up with US equipment and firepower. This was most evident in the after-action comments following the conflict over Kosovo. Department of Defense (DOD) officials admonished other NATO countries that their equipment was not compatible with or as capable as US equipment.
If the United States is the most asymmetric force in the world, why are potential threats to US security almost always labeled asymmetric? For example, the US National Defense University (NDU), in its 1998 strategic assessment, listed four asymmetric responses that other nations could take to counter US superiority: acquiring weapons of mass destruction; acquiring high-technology weapons; acquiring cyberweapons; and fighting in environments that degrade US capabilities. The logic of considering these approaches asymmetric escapes reason, for the first three responses would improve symmetry according to the dictionary definitions. The United States has all of these capabilities now; if someone else acquires them, then we are in a symmetric relationship. Threats are mislabeled asymmetric because we do not understand what asymmetry means.
Some highly respected publications stress that if an opponent does not fight the way we expect, then we automatically label his fighting technique asymmetric. The NDU study stated that asymmetric threats or techniques are a version of not fighting fair, which can include the use of surprise in all its operational and strategic dimensions and the use of weapons in ways unplanned by the U.S. If this definition were accurate, Serbs and Iraqis could claim that NATO and the multinational coalition did not fight fairface to facebut from afar with longrange, precision weapons. With such a broad application, any action can be considered asymmetric and further confuse the issue. The terms atypical or nontraditional better fit a situation in which an opponent uses an unexpected technique or exploits some factor better or faster than his opponent. The imprecise US terminology is faulty. An Australian officer, Major J.J. Frewen, offered a reason for this imprecision. He noted that globalization has expanded the definition of national security beyond physical security to include economic, environmental, informational and cultural security.

Some analysts have defined asymmetry with vision. Lloyd J. Matthews offers a strategic vision for his description of asymmetry. He defines it as any militarily significant disparity between contending parties that clearly fits the lack or want of symmetry idea expressed in Websters. He notes: The process of calculating the resultant of the various vectors of power wielded by two asymmetrically related opponentsin order to measure the dimen-sions of the threat that each poses to the othercan be quite problematic. But it is a process that must be undertaken if we are to give due weight to all the relevant elements of power.

Steven Metz and Douglas Johnson of the US Army War College offer another visionary definition of asymmetry: acting, organizing and thinking differently than opponents in order to maximize ones own advantages, exploit an opponents weaknesses, attain the initiative or gain greater freedom of action. It can be political-strategic, militarystrategic, operational or a combination of these. It can entail different methods, technologies, values, organizations, time perspectives or some combination of these. The authors add that asymmetry can be short-term or long-term, deliberate or by default, discrete or pursued in conjunction with symmetric approaches and can have both psychological and physical dimensions.

Many authors consider asymmetry to be the ability to exploit situations by attacking weak points or using nontraditional approaches in unexpected ways. These vulnerabilities can be uncovered by using a specific methodology to examine a situation. The methodology uses one of four means:
l Performance parameters. l Situational context.
MILITARY REVIEW l July-August 2001 l Operating principles and rules of engagement. l Will. Each mean uses nontraditional or intellectual methods to exploit a situation, degrading capabilities and inducing unpredictability and chaos into military operations. It limits advantages, capitalizes on weaknesses, and tests patience and will. The methodology is a thinking mans strategy that encourages out-of-the-box concepts that could be labeled asymmetric because they capitalize on asymmetries in capabilities and reliance.
Such moves would be innovative or bold actions that could apply equally to either high-or low-tech opponents. It might mean using low-tech options to counter high-tech equipmentthe rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) launcher versus a helicopter or using fuel-air explosives on an opponent. Or it could mean attempts to strike a peoples political will and patience. The United States lost the battle of wills at home but not on the Vietnam battlefield. Asymmetry can even express itself as a strategy of mass destruction or annihilation, prolonged attrition or creating large groups of refugees.
Performance parameters. Weapon parameters, whether signature, such as sound or image display, or performance characteristics, are susceptible to manipulation and are vulnerable. The Serbian military demonstrated its awareness of this principle during the recent conflict in Kosovo. The Serbs reportedly sent air defense crews to Iraq in February 1999 to study Iraqi procedures. The Iraqis have fought against these planes and tactics for 10 years. Who could better tell Serbian crews what a NATO or US air attack might look like? Every performance parameter was recorded on radar.
In another example, the Serbs reportedly used smoke to deflect NATO precision-guided weapons. When the pilot could no longer keep the cross hair on a smoked target, the weapons went off-course as the performance parameter was exploited. In Chechnya, the Chechens knew the elevation and depression limits of the Russian T-72 battle tanks
In January 2000, Russian forces stayed outside Grozny, nullifying Chechen terrain advantages by destroying the city asymmetrically with artillery and tank fire.
main gun. They hid below the depression level in basements and in windows above the maximum elevation while fighting in Grozny during 1994 and 1995 and used RPGs to immobilize tanks. When NATOs air forces engaged Serbias armed forces, Serbian deceptions fooled NATOs high-tech equipment. The Serbian military found a flaw in NATOs electronic-reconnaissance systemtargets could be seen but not clearly identified. Decoys and fake positions protected the real ones. When the Serbs wanted to block NATOs thermal-imaging systems, they used industrial heat sources to construct thermal-cover positions to protect tanks and artillery.
Another performance parameter is that of an actual force: tempo. Understanding an opponents concept of operational tempo gets one inside an important performance parameter of his force and provides an asymmetric option.
Situational context. Situational context includes an areas dominant historical, cultural, geographic and political factors and how an opponent might manipulate them. For example, what is the regime protecting and what does it want? Other factors include a countrys particular warrior culture, guerilla movements or use of time and geography. In most conflicts, both combatants have some elements that a thinking belligerent can exploit. Two unequal forces, such as a high-tech force confronting a lowtech force, fighting on similar terrain could use an asymmetric approach. If a low-tech force moves to the sanctuary a city offers, it can offset the high-tech forces superior firepower, maneuverability and intelligence capability. In the city environment, the high-tech force often finds that its force structure does not fit the terrain. The high-tech force may find itself opposed by an entire population, as the Russians were in Grozny in 1996. A high-tech force, on the other hand, could prevent the low-tech force from entering the city.
Operating principles and rules of engagement. Operating principles of presidents, parliaments and armed forces vary from nation to nation. International treaties bind most nations to some common principles, but this adherence varies with time and opponents. Warsaw Pact members allegiance to the Soviet Union waned and disappeared in the 1990s. The recent NATO operation over Kosovo offers a stark example. Breaking with traditions of time, opponent and principles, NATO acted out of area and may have placed human rights above sovereignty. If democratic nations bend their operating principles, what type of behavior and adherence to operating principles might we expect from totalitarian or rogue regimes?
Below the level of presidents and parliaments, combat involves operating principles. Combatants can estimate opposing leaders tolerance for loss and damage, and threshold for capitulation. Unlike nation-states, guerillas are not bound by international treaties, codes of conduct or operating principles. This difficulty is compounded by Western reliance on technology, a vulnerable operating principle in the age of off-the-shelf products. Sometimes underdeveloped countries can acquire high-tech equipment faster than developed countries because of research, development and acquisition time lines: In a world in which state-of-the-art is off-the-shelf, industry, and potentially our foes, can obtain better information systems and technology cheaper and faster than DOD because our current acquisition system buys computers in the same way we buy bullets. 
10
Operating principles also refer to the rules of engagement, strategy, tactics and organizational principles that guide a sides actions and decisions. NATO politicians decided that pilots could fly only above 15,000 feet in Kosovo, a rule of engagement that affected precision.

believe it is easier to attack the Western psyche or will to fight than to meet it on the battlefield in a contest between technologies, a truly asymmetric approach from the Western viewpoint. Many Russians believe that the United States did just that when it convinced Soviet Secretary General Mikhail Gorbachev to end the Cold War. His loss of will allowed the West to win the Cold War without firing a shot. This discussion offers several conclusions. First, the word asymmetry highlights the problem of using terms loosely or improperly. When this happens, words are not properly understood, confusion reigns, and endless time is spent in futile explanation. The international arena further exacerbates the situation because different cultures interpret words with slight nuances. Not using ones own language correctly only heightens misunderstanding. Second, a methodology that considers a situation asymmetrically offers a way to analyze and choose courses of action. Third, perspective is equally as important as methodology. The United States might be the most asymmetric force on Earth, but Americans do not see themselves that way. They view others as an asymmetric force or threat when, in fact, they are not. US citizens should be proud to be on the right side of the asymmetric ledger.
Asymmetries exist everywhere, of course. They can be found in market economies of varying degrees versus centrally planned economies and in political systems. There are also strategic, operational and tactical asymmetries. Strategically, theorists discuss asymmetries in the force structure of intercontinental ballistic missiles or information warfare forces, while tactical-level analysts try to calculate the correlation of forces between sides. In these cases, asymmetries refer to quantities, total numbers or different philosophies. Asymmetries also refer to approaches to attack vulnerabilities.
Asymmetry is a matter of two unlike systems interacting, each within its capabilities. Attacks can be swift (like an earthquake) or progressive (like termites or rust, silently undermining a formidable structure). Progressive attacks are usually associated with cultural strengths than can be maintained for long periods (sacrifice, resilience, deception, media sympathy). Unlike systems do not understand how to counter each other because of contradictory paradigms. Consider the term rasingingin. When the term is understood as singing in the rain, then deciphering other terms is easier. For example, the word insertion paradigm helps interpret the term beilld as sick in bed. Understanding the threat requires thinking in threat paradigms.
Agents using asymmetric analytic methodologiesperformance parameters, situational context, operating principles and willstart with an advantage. When striving to attack a vulnerability, having a template for action is the name of the game. Each methodology allows analysts to visualize better how to attack and defend enemy and friendly vulnerabilities. In the end, this is where the focus should be and not on the so-called asymmetric threats of weapons of mass destruction and chemical, biological and information attacks.
T HERE IS NOTHING NEW about asymme- try. Strategists and tacticians have always sought to pit their strength against opponents weaknesses. During the Cold War, Western allies adopted an offset strategy, relying on technological superiority to offset numerical inferiority. Both East and West found acceptable responses to the asymmetry. The nature of asymmetry has changed dramatically, and organizational processes developed and institutionalized in response to Cold War realities inhibit appropriate responses to the new. Some aspects of government behavior are best understood as outputs of large organizations functioning according to standard patterns of behavior. 1 These standard patterns develop over time and become routine and institutionalized. Habitual relations and practices become part of the unquestioned way of doing business. They are often honed and optimized for measures such as efficiency, effectiveness or safety. When tasked, an organizations response is generally limited to its existing patterns of behavior.
Planning, training and adapting are three complementary ways a country prepares for war. A strong, deliberate planning culture developed during the Cold War in large and important segments of the military, particularly in Europe, Korea and Washington. In addition to deliberate planning methods, equally strong processes were established to support intelligence preparation of the battlefield (IPB). A sophisticated training method was developed to complement the deliberate planning process. The deliberate planning process yielded decisions at the strategic and operational levels of war. The output of deliberate planning, the operation plan (OPLAN), was input to training events. Plan executionincluding daily, tactical planningwas the training focus.
Higher-level decisions typically caused no observable effect during a real-time, week-long exercise. Doctrine, organization and equipment remained constant for NATO and Warsaw Pact forces during a training event, but throughout the Cold War, equip-ment and doctrine changed, and US forces adapted. Adaptation to change centered in combat development organizations, part of the producer chain of command far removed from the operational chain of command. Separate organizational responses for plan development, plan execution and adaptation to change are pronounced Cold War legacies.
The Soviet Union was formidable, and we studied it continually for decades. We knew, with reasonable certainty, the enemy order of battle, his methods of operations, his equipment and the battlefield terrain. The Soviets were doctrinaire, known for centralized planning and withholding latitude from tactical commanders. Much was fixed, except whether and when war would be fought.
The US response was a complex biennial deliberate planning process. The typical output was a lengthy OPLAN, including time-phased force deployment data (TPFDD), which detailed unit movement. In theater, our knowledge of the enemy and the environment was so detailed that we produced voluminous catalogs of targets matched to preferred destruction means and doctrinal templates that aided in predicting enemy intent. The response to the wealth of available information was the sophisticated IPB process. Deliberate planning became institutionalized in US defense culturein Washington and in the field. 2
The deliberate planning process emphasizes plan development; a separate training methodology was developed to exercise plan execution. The classic training event is conducted in real time, begins when the first shots are fired, runs 24 hours a day for five to seven days, executes a previously constructed plan and traverses a single path in detail through a very bushy tree of possibilities. 
3
Perhaps the most insidious consequence of training focused on plan execution is that strategic, operational and tactical echelons all are trained in the tactical time context. Strategic and operational thinking are the domain of deliberate planning. Training in the tactical time frame does not allow senior commanders to exercise strategic and operational decisionmaking. In addition to the deliberate planning and training responses, a third response solidifiedadapting to change. The services implemented the combat development process separately in garrison. A long-term intelligence process focusing on Soviet evolution supported combat development. Unified commands nominally generated the requirements that drove the combat development process. But, as often as not, technological opportunity, the need to replace aging weapons and visions within various organizations in the producer chain of command, drove combat developments. Adapting to the evolving threat was the combat developers responsibility.
Over the past several decades a complex of sophisticated processes has spread across the departments bureaucracy, each office operating with specialized skills in a different time frame. One element of the larger process is deliberate planning with voluminous output every two years. A separate training process produced units trained to doctrinal standards to accomplish the specific missions derived from OPLANs. Warfighting commands trained to execute tasks doctrinally in real time; they did not train to adapt in real time at the strategic, operational or tactical levels of war. The services also implemented the combat development process. Combat developers were continually challenged to absorb new technology and weapon systems and respond to Soviet advances with doctrine, organization and equipment.
Many Cold War assumptions are now invalid, including known threat, known doctrine and known order of battle. Our organizational responses are still based on those assumptions and must be reconsidered in light of asymmetry.
One of the most dramatic post-Cold War trends is from permanent to temporary commands, for example, from the dominant role of unified commands and their component headquarters to a reliance on ad hoc joint task forces (JTFs). A corollary trend is from a regional commander in chiefs (CINCs) area of operations to a JTF commanders joint operations area (JOA), the former characterized by an established and familiar infrastructure and the latter by immature and unfamiliar infrastructure. A second corollary trend is from forward-deployed forces assigned to a specific unified command to deployable forces apportioned to multiple commands. The trend in planning is from deliberate planning to time-sensitive, or crisis-action, planning. The final related trend is from warfare between conventional forces to military operations other than war involving conventional, unconventional and irregular forces. 
4
There is always uncertainty in war, but the overriding trend following the Cold War is a dramatic increase in uncertainty. So much of what was known and could be planned for is now and will remain unknown. A useful way to summarize the changed environment is the dramatic shift in balance between what is fixed (relatively certain) and what is variable
A corollary trend is from a regional CINCs area of operations to a JTF commanders JOA, the former characterized by an established and familiar infrastructure and the latter by immature and unfamiliar infrastructure.
(relatively uncertain). The natural tendency is to apply familiar and institutionalized processes and procedures to the new environment. But adapting to the new threat environment is not a matter of replacing the Soviets with a different enemy that we can come to know as well as our old foe. Some future opponents may not exist today as formal organizations. Some unforeseen event may bring together disparate groups into a new, loose coalition. Not knowing the actors and conditions in advance requires adaptable organizations and processes to cope with emerging threats. Adaptations must continue throughout military missions. As US forces succeed at countering a recently recognized method, an asymmetric foe will adapt to find other vulnerabilities. US forces must be trained, organized and equipped to adapt quickly and proactively.
The United States and its allies had decades to understand the Cold War problem and propose solutions in the form of war plans. All that remained was to execute. We trained execution. Against a world of asymmetric actors, we must be prepared to learn as we go. That does not mean that we should not plan for what we can, but we must build organizations that can improvise. Those that can only execute a plan according to fixed doctrine will fail in the new environment. A proper response to the changed environment is to adopt different command habitsadaptive command. It is not so much a new command model as a shift in emphasis that parallels the shift in emphasis between what is fixed and what is variable in the environment. Thomas J. Czerwinski offers a lucid and useful taxonomy: command by plan, command by direction and command by influence. 
5
These command models are determined by who exercises command and when. Command by plan centralizes command in the higher-echelon commander, who exercises it in advance by creating and promulgating plans. Command by direction also centralizes command at the top, but it is exercised through real-time orders. Command by influence distributes command to lower echelons, where it is exercised by on-scene leaders. Adaptive command is not about who commands or how but concerns the command function; adapting doctrine, organization and the concept of operations to the situation must be a function of all command levels.
US forces must adapt their doctrineincluding tactics, techniques and proceduresas asymmetric opponents develop theirs. This response will be driven more by contact with the enemy than by intelligence gathered in advance. Adaptive command will require different and tighter integration of intelligence and operations functions. Intelligence functions that monitor the enemys physical disposition before contact and assess battle damage afterward will be inadequate. The intelligence function must include monitoring enemy behavior during engagement and recognizing its evolution. Rather than train to doctrine, US forces must learn to anticipate, recognize and adapt on the fly.
Teaching, training and learning have specific meanings here. Teaching imparts an assembled body of knowledge, often through traditional classroom methods, including reading and lecture. Training improves the performance of a particular skill set through practice. Learning creates new knowledge over a problem space through exploration and discovery. Teaching and training assume an existing body of knowledge; learning does not.
Both training and learning rely on multiple iterations and observation. In training, repetition is key to making performance second nature. Observation and feedback are necessary to diagnose shortfalls and correct them in the next iteration. In learning,
multiple trials are necessary to explore alternatives; recognizing unexpected outcomes may be more important than measuring expected ones.
A learning event, in contrast to a training event, would be conducted in fast or skip time and run eight hours a day for several days, engaging the commander and principal staff of only a single echelon.

Appropriate preparation for a relatively certain threat environment is deliberate planning and IPB; training to doctrine; and a separate, long-term combat development process. Appropriate preparation for a relatively uncertain threat environment refines crisis-action planning, reconnaissance and adaptive commandlearning to anticipate, recognize and respond to change. Learning events are anchored in a problem space and are designed to generate possible solutions through better recognition of a problems breadth and depth.
Leaders at the tactical level must be prepared to adapt. The asymmetric actor may apply lowtechnology means and methods against US conventional forces. Asymmetric actors continually adapt through trial and error, and the opposing tactical commander with limited doctrinal responses will be the victim. General Montgomery C. Meigs, Commander, US Army Europe and 7th Army, puts it this way:
We have become adept at replicating a set-piece enemy for our units. We do a good job of giving them an opponent that fights with consistent, predictable doctrine and tactical procedures. We must now move to the next level and present an enemy that uses asymmetrical approaches and who learns from our Blue Force, adapting to avoid our strengths and to exploit our tactical weaknesses as he moves from battle to battle. . . . Units must

There are a host of impediments to exploring new combinations at the tactical echelons. In garrison, homogeneous units, such as artillery battalions and fighter squadrons, achieve efficiency. On the other hand, combined arms teams achieve effectiveness. Training opportunities are optimized for a specific type of force and range of operations. Peacetime efficiency militates against combined arms learning opportunities.
The problem extends well into the hierarchy. Division tables of organization and equipment, like their battalions, are designed and optimized for a specific range of operations. Training opportunities like the Battle Command Training Program are designed accordingly. The range of possible combined arms operations in an armored division is limited. The same is true of light infantry, airborne or air assault divisions. The somewhat defunct infantry division may offer the widest range of combinations to explore. At all levels the force must be designed for competence across a broad range of missions but optimized for none.
Some interpretations of the operational level focus on picking the point in space and time for the decisive battlethe close-with-and-destroy-theenemy school. Another school of thought focuses on geographythe seize-and-hold-terrain school. Yet another focuses on penetrating a linear defense to move deeply to the enemys soft rear areathe maneuver-warfare school. None of those may be relevant in the asymmetric environment. The US Army needs coping mechanisms as a dominant characteristic of the operational level of war in asymmetric environments.
A JTFs mission may be dominated by long periods of maintaining peace while responding to sporadic flare-ups. Or, responding to asymmetric incidents may be part of larger, conventional operations. In either case, insufficient resources will be available to prevent all potential asymmetric attacks. They must be detected and dealt with as they emerge. Preparation means emplacing coping mechanisms in advance.
Urban emergency services, including police, paramedics and fire fighters, offer a useful model for the operational level of war in asymmetric environments. With insufficient resources to prevent all accidents, crimes and fires, city managers cannot plan to be in the right place at the right time in advance, but they can implement mechanisms in advance to monitor and respond with the critical resources necessary. These are the bases of coping mechanisms.
Coping mechanisms at the operational level of war are not new. One was implemented after the incident in Mogadishu on 3 and 4 October. That small, independent units in the city would come under attack could be known in advance; when and which ones could not. A monitoring network and quickresponse force was established to cope with what could be anticipated but not prevented. Air mobility as employed in Vietnam could be considered as an operational-level coping mechanism. US forces could neither prevent enemy troop concentrations nor predict and plan for them. They could, however, detect them as they emerged and respond rapidly. Close air support, when tightly integrated with dynamic ground operations, can also be seen as a coping mechanism.
Law enforcement may also offer instructive insights for intelligence. Rather than conventionalforce templates, mug shots, family trees, and telephone and bank records may be appropriate intelligence products. Intelligence staffs will learn to provide different products, and operators will learn to ask for them.
Learning will certainly continue to occur in the unforgiving laboratory of ongoing operations. JTFs created for real operations offer opportunities to experiment with a wide-ranging combinations of cop-
ing mechanisms. JTFs are not part of standard military organizations in garrison. Just the opposite is true; garrison forces are pure and rarely join a heterogeneous force. Without standing JTFs, garrison and learning operational readiness will be weak.
Adaptive command is a daunting task for a good team and perhaps impossible for a last-minute pickup team. Yet, we plan to form our command team at the last minute. The newly appointed commander must build a team at the same time the team is building a response to an emerging crisis. The ad hoc JTF headquarters will defy adaptive command, or any type of command, until the command team is built. The learning curve will be slow and costly. US forces and objectives will be vulnerable at the operational level of war until the joint command team forms. 10
The US military is accustomed to fighting abroad. This reality presents an enduring strategic vulnerability for an asymmetric actor to exploit. During regional conflicts, asymmetric tactics may be applied out of area as part of a larger strategy or as the sole elements of a long-term strategic offensive. Protecting the joint deployment system continues to be a strategic imperative but cannot be separated from more general force protection.
Learning at this level focuses on developing a strategic response that subordinates means to ends.
In the event of a crisis, a JTF commander will be appointed and assigned a JOA within a unified commands area of responsibility (AOR). There will be significant opportunities for asymmetric actors to attack outside the JOA and even outside the AOR. For example, another Middle East scenario might involve bombers and strategic airlift operating out of Rota, Spain. An asymmetric actor might be willing and able to disrupt operations there or to raise Spains cost of providing basing. The mere potential for asymmetric attack caused significant problems to planners of Operation Eldorado Canyon when Spain and France denied overflight rights to US FB-111s flying from Great Britain to Libya.
Asymmetric attacks can be less direct than physically destroying military facilities. They may include inciting locals to riot or strike. Throughput capacity would be seriously degraded if forklift operators, railroad engineers and stevedores did not report for work. Attacks on family housing would have great strategic effect. How can the United States learn to anticipate, prevent and cope with out-of-area attacks?
A learning event could be designed to focus attention on the joint deployment system, including ports of embarkation, lines of communication, ports David J. Reimer Sr. Emergency Services Photography  of debarkation and forward operating bases. A learning event should explore as many potential asymmetric attacks as possible and determine how to cope with the most dangerous and most likely. At one extreme, resources can be statically preallocated to protect the force against all potential threats. Such a prevention strategy is exhausting and cannot be sustained. A strategy that subordinates means to ends would dynamically allocate resources to the force element most critical to mission accomplishment. Additional resources would be allocated to monitor threat conditions and to respond accordingly.
Coping mechanismsresources organized to monitor and respondunderwrite this second strategy. If intelligence detects a rising threat condition and operations can mount a timely response, then coping mechanisms can be effective in a prevention strategy. If this real-time, stimulus-response cycle cannot be built, then coping mechanisms should be designed to deal with the aftereffects. The real-time interaction of intelligence and operations is critical and should be a focal point for both learning and training.
Examples of coping mechanisms used to respond to out-of-area attacks in the Mediterranean region during a Middle East scenario include an amphibious ready group with a Marine expeditionary unit, a special operations task force, an air assault-based task force, a chemical-biological incident response force or a fleet antiterrorist security team supported by closely linked intelligence.
Neither the JTF commander nor the CINC will be positioned to deal with all out-of-area attacks, but the total system must anticipate and prepare for them, and the JTF commander must be prepared to cope with the effects. The risk of a potential asym-metric attack outside the JOA must be evaluated in terms of strategic priorities and the JTF commanders theater priorities.
The balance has shifted between what could be known and planned for in advance and what could notbetween what was fixed and what was variable. Increasingly, being prepared is less a product of deliberate planning, training execution to doctrinal standards and long-term combat development processes and more a product of warfighting organizations that are trained in crisis-action planning and adaptive command. Adaptive command, as defined here, is becoming more common. Coping mechanisms can be found in military history but may become central doctrinal concepts in asymmetric environments.
Centering learning in the user chain of command will produce organizations that can more readily adapt and more effectively lead long-term combat development rather than be its belated recipient. Combat developers must more actively convert lessons learned in operational commands to doctrine, organization and training. Combat developers must produce a more diverse playbook of combined arms at the lowest tactical levels and coping mechanisms at higher-level commands. But, combat development is conducted principally by services and branches within them. When competing for acquisition funds, branches dominate combined arms organizations, and services dominate joint organizations. Only leadership, another precious resource, can overcome the inevitable imbalance accompanying the flow of money. More important, to overcome limitations that standard patterns of behavior often place on government action, adaptation must become a hallmark of US military behavior. R UDIMENTARY military staff organization and procedures have developed since 2000 B.C., beginning probably with the armies of early Egypt. But, according to James D. Hittle, a historian of the military staff, the modern staff system did not emerge until late in the 19th century, even later for the US Army. Hittle postulates that modern staff systems have certain features:
l A regular education system for training staff officers.
l Delegation of authority from the commander. l Supervised execution of orders issued by or through the staff.
l A set method of procedure by which each part performs specific duties.

The Generalstabs power eventually usurped civilian policy because the exhaustive, inflexible military decisionmaking process (MDMP) and planning actually drove political decisions. The best example of this was at the beginning of World War I when Germany executed the Schlieffen plan. Named for Alfred von Schlieffen, head of the Generalstab from 1892 to 1906, the Schlieffen plan called for swift victory against France through a flanking attack across neutral Belgium. The greatest flaw in the plan was the Generalstabs assumption that victory would come in six weeks, thereby allowing Germany to respond to the expected sluggish Russian mobilization on a potential eastern front.

but also by being successfully implemented then proven inadequate. 
3
As the Schlieffen plan was being developed and the world drew closer to World War I, the US Army lacked published staff doctrine. The 1910 publication, Regulations for Field Maneuvers, did not include a description of staff processes; a 1914 field service regulation (FSR) mentioned the need for a commander and staff estimating process but did not describe one. 
4
5
In 1932 the Staff Officers Field Manual compiled principles, information and data to be used as a guide for the operation of staffs of all units and territorial commands, in peace and war, rather than a set of rules and regulations to be rigidly and blindly followed. 
6
In 1940 the Army began expanding to prepare for World War II, growing to more than eight million soldiers by the end of the war. The scale and complexity of military decisionmaking and planning made staff work proportionately more intricate; thus, staff doctrine expanded with the Army. The August 1940 US Army Field Manual (FM) 101-5, Staff Officers Field Manual: The Staff and Combat Orders, increased the scope and depth of staff doctrine beyond the 1932 version.
A new method of using draft staff officers doctrine emerged after World War II. The US Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC) published draft staff officers doctrine to update frequently changing terms and procedures. The 1949 CGSC draft, for example, emphasized the planning process rather than the orders format. Later CGSC versions were published as numbered reference books and student texts under various titles and formats.

The November 1954 FM 101-5 made the commanders estimate a part of an overall estimate of the situation and added specific staff estimates for personnel, intelligence, operations, logistics, civil affairs, military government and deception. Interestingly, the deception estimate fell out as a stand-alone estimate in the next version and has not reappeared in staff doctrine. The manual adopted the basic fivestep analysis associated with the commanders estimate process and added conclusions or recommendations to paragraph five to supplement the decision step. This version also added atomic weapons and chemical, biological and radiological effects as factors of analysis.

Finally, the 1984 edition added a special appendix, Emerging Staff Techniques and Procedures, which provided a forum for brief discussion of Armywide initiatives in staff techniques and procedures developed to enhance the effectiveness of staff operations in the face of emerging doctrine and rapidly changing technology.

After many CGSC student text drafts, FM 101-5 was again updated and published in 1997. It devoted a chapter to staff officer characteristics, reflecting contemporary management influences; it explained the most intricate procedural aspects of MDMP with a complex, 38-step procedure; it contained more detailed examples for completing plans, orders and annexes; it had a separate appendix on information management; it introduced the concept of the commanders critical information requirements; and it detailed the concepts, duties and responsibilities of liaison officers based on lessons learned from coalition operations in the Gulf War. Also noteworthy was the absence of any link to STANAGs.

German stormtroopers in France, circa 1916. The failed Schlieffen plan aimed for a swift victory against France through a flanking attack across neutral Belgium.
A contemporary observer stated that when the operation broke down, shell holes became trenches and the trenches eventually became an elaborate defensive system several miles deep.
The 1997 edition introduced commanders intent in Army staff doctrine, a concept that had been experimented with at length at CGSC and in Army operations and training. Commanders intent, along with initial guidance and concept of operations, introduced innovation and initiative to the traditional, analytically oriented MDMP. Thus, for the first time, this edition emphasized synthesis (integrating elements into a cohesive whole) in the MDMP as a complementary mental attribute to the traditional analysis (successively decomposing into parts).
Modern MDMP is a multidimensional undertaking with the decisionmaker, environment, organization (vertical and horizontal), planning, learning and procedures its major aspects. Many decisionmaking models (most are procedural) have been developed to assist decisionmakers in other than military organizations. However, researchers studying decisionmaking in civilian organizations have found that decisions appear to be somewhat arbitrary and not necessarily based on the best possible course of action. Hence, one purpose of the Armys doctrinal MDMP is to ensure that defining a problem and choosing the best course of action is not randomly matching variables but a deliberate action.
The decisionmaker is the central MDMP element. Effective military decisionmakers do not necessarily occupy formal leadership positions or have senior rank. Future military operations in a dispersed and noncontiguous battle space will likely distribute authority and decisionmaking. Soldiers operating remote sensing devices, uninhabited vehicles or precision-guided munitions, for example, may operate autonomously and make critical decisions affecting the outcome of military operations.
Good decisionmakers can employ both intuitive and analytic skills. Intuition is an unconscious appreciation of patterns of operationsa synthesis process. It reflects understanding that fosters the ability to achieve workable solutions even when in-formation for making that decision is inadequate or unavailable. Conversely, analysis is conscious reasoning based on decomposition and manipulation of a situation. It is a methodical process that seeks knowledge in complex environments and involves a step-by-step, systematic procedure.

Planning aspects of MDMP. In large Army organizations, such as corps and divisions, near-term decisions (current operations) are always nested in long-term decisions (plans). To plan is to design a desired future (ends) and orchestrate effective ways and means of bringing it about. A plan is anticipatory decisionmaking that involves a set of interdependent decisions. The process is continuous and has no conclusion or end point. What separates strategic planning from operational and tactical planning is largely the difficulty of reversing its effects during execution.

The September 1915 offensive was based on an allied delusion that artillery could blast a hole through the opposing wall for infantry and thereby

One danger in MDMP is being overanalytical, creating a tendency toward premature closure in the process of formulating stratagems. Decisionmakers may be more comfortable or competent conducting MDMPs procedural aspects. They may give inadequate attention to the less-structured, but more important, step of generating stratagems in the first place. 
41
42
43
Another pitfall similar to premature closure is self-imposed constraint. Preventing or removing unnecessary constraints permits creativity and learning. The MDMP environment contains controllable variables, such as friendly forces, and uncontrollable variables such as weather, terrain and enemy attack. The ideal situation does not constrain how the decisionmaker controls the controllable variables and reduces or removes the effectiveness of the uncontrollable variables. 
44
Army education, mentorship and organizational experience through training and operations should synthesize what has already been learned and extract a holistic view from it so decisionmakers can better convert information and knowledge into understanding. Answers that are expected cannot be creative and therefore may inhibit innovation. 
45
Army organizations must achieve decision superioritygood decisions made faster than an opponent can react or, in a noncombat situation, at a tempo that allows the joint force commander to shape the situation or react quickly to changes and accomplish the mission. 
46
To do so, Army doctrinal MDMP must merge with joint decisionmaking processes. The corps commander and staff serving as a joint task force headquarters will have little or no time to change from Army MDMP and doctrinal orders to the joint operation planning and execution system that produces joint force orders. Until the procedures match, Army theater-level and corps commanders and staff must translate MDMP so it becomes seamless with joint processes.
Most studies of Army commanders and staffs have focused on potential MDMP improvements to shorten decision times and conduct more detailed analyses. 
47
l Enhance decisionmakers intuition through Army training, education, and current and planned operations.
l Transform Army culture from placing value on analytic (procedural) aspects of MDMP to give equal weight to its more multidimensional aspects.
l Revise MDMP to ensure it is seamless with joint decision processes.
l Blend Army Staff organization and operations with Joint Staff organization and operations; allied, coalition or combined staff organization and operations; the interagency process; and nongovernment organizations.
l Increase flexibility and speed in MDMP because Army forces will deploy when there is only an orientation plan available.
l Adapt MDMP for force planning and decisionmaking in the institutional Army.
The history of staff organization and operations is clearly evolutionary, and for almost a century, no major changes were made to the basic steps of estimating the situation or providing analysis for MDMP. The current edition of FM 101-5 introduces
more of the thinking aspects of staff organization and operations to avert conditions that lead to a competency trap.
When continuing current operations become ineffective, innovative thinking can make a difference. Effective new stratagems may not emerge clearly from established doctrine; tactics, techniques and procedures; or past successes and failures. In formulating innovative stratagems, MDMP will require commanders and staffs to suspend traditional thinking and learn by treating:
l Self as a hypothesis.
l Intuition as reality.
l Hypocrisy as transition.
l Memory as an enemy.
l Experience as a theory.

It takes an Army to deter a war.
US Army Chief of Staff General Eric K. Shinseki I F THE US ARMY is to deter war in the 21st century, it must embrace its largely ignored amphibious warfare responsibilities and focus doctrine and capabilities on rapidly projecting power to dominate littoral (coastal) regions. The most effective method for the Army to achieve littoral deterrence in the near term is through deploying interim brigade combat teams (IBCTs) as part of an integrated, synchronized joint task force (JTF) to secure port facilities and airfields.
Since 1990 US forces have been involved in 50 crises around the world, most supported by Marine and Navy amphibious forces deployed to littoral regions. About 70 percent of the worlds population lives within 75 miles of a coastline. The rapid growth of megacities in the littorals and resultant avalanche of changing demographics, competition for resources and indigenous tensions have produced regions plagued by strife and conflict. Littoral operations are expected to be the norm for the 21st century.
However, successfully performing the littoral combat mission requires tactically responsive naval surface fire support (NSFS). Operations in Kosovo demonstrated that bad weather can wipe out air support. Global Positioning System (GPS)-guided, precision-guided munitions (PGMs) could not destroy Serbian ground forces. NATO employed more than 10,000 PGMs and destroyed only 14 tanks, 18 armored personnel carriers (APCs) and 20 artillery pieces. 1 However, they proved effective when employed against stationary targets such as bridges, power plants, railroads and the Chinese Embassy. Unfortunately, The Navy admits that it currently has no credible surface fire capabilities to support forced-entry from the sea and inland operations by US Marine Corps (USMC) and Army forces. 
2
The Army and USMC are implementing strategic and operational maneuver concepts to meet requirements for increased mobility. The Armys near-term response is the Interim Force while the Objective Force takes shape. The USMCs nearterm and long-term strategies are Marine Corps Strategy 21 and Operational Maneuver From the Sea (OMFTS). These revolutionary maneuver concepts could significantly enhance US ability to wage and win strategic and operational war. However, the inability to provide assaulting forces with reliable, tactically responsive, all-weather fire support prevents the United States from effectively projecting power and risks needless casualties, being defeated or both.
Regardless of how a force arrives, it deploys on the ground and fights tactically. Fire support to soldiers and Marines ashore require reliable, highvolume, tactically responsive, lethal, all-weather systems. Neither maneuver concept adequately considers or provides fire support that meets the 
realities of close combat. In the initial stages of any joint littoral operation, until sufficient time elapses to deploy organic artillery, both services must rely primarily on naval aviation and long-range NSFS, which require more than 10 minutes to respond.
Sometimes tactical is so broadly defined that it is dangerously imprecise. US Army Field Manual (FM) 100-15, Corps Operations, defines the corps as the largest tactical unit in the US Army, a definition unchanged in more than 60 years. 
3
The corps-and joint-level task force headquarters have too many communication layers between them and the shooters to be responsive to the close fight and main battle. Although we have sensor-toshooter connectivity, it is doubtful that high-level responsiveness can be sustained hundreds of times a day across a corps front. These applications are best suited for high-payoff targets or special operations but cannot reliably support the volume of requests needed for large-scale combat.
Although the corps operates in the field under tactical environmental conditions, due to technological advancements in command, control, communications and computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C 4 ISR), todays corps and corps-sized JTFs conduct an operational level of war and influence an operational battle space. Todays corps can influence an area of operation formerly assigned to numbered US armies in World War II.
Because the range and responsiveness of organic weapon systems is limited, the division should be designated the largest tactical unit. Additionally, the tactical battle space should be redefined to mirror the zones and sectors assigned to divisions. Associated battle areasthe close fight, main fight, deep battle and rear battlemust specify responsive thresholds because time and distance are interdependent, defining criteria. Department of Defense (DOD) Directive 5100.1 sets forth the Armys amphibious mission requirements: The primary functions of the Army are: 6.6. Duri ng the 1982 Fal kl ands-Mal vi nas War, Exocet anti shi p missiles and conventional bombs struck 16 British warships, sinking seven and severely damaging three. A containership was sunk with thousands of tons of stores and ammunition as well as half the helicopters dedicated to the land force. British carriers were forced to operate at the extreme range of the i nvasi on area.
The vulnerability of modern, lightly armored warships to determined air attack had changed little since World War II. Yet, even as the Argentine and British forces fought in the South Atlantic, work began at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard to modernize a warship largely impervious to conventional weapons. The USS New Jersey was the first of four Iowa-class battleships returned to active service as part of Presi dent Ronal d Reagan' s mari ti me strategy.
Built during World War II, these vessels still had as much as 20 years of service life remaining. In addition, antiship weapons had been desi gned over the decades to counter i ncreasingly thin-skinned warships. With a 6-inch armor deck and hull and citadel armor ranging up to 14.5 inches thick, the battleships would be able to engage in sustained, allweather operations in even the most deadly environments. All four ships were recommissioned by 1988 with state-ofthe-art communications, radar, nuclear-biological-chemical protection, chaff and electronic countermeasures systems. Additional weapons included 16 Harpoon and 32 Tomahawk cruise missiles as well as four 20mm Phalanx systems (similar to the Vulcan). Today, two ships, the Wisconsin and Iowa, are maintained, ready for activation under the terms of US Publ i c Law 104-106.
Former US Navy Secretary John Lehman believes this level of readiness is insufficient and that the Wisconsin and Iowa "should be kept in a ready-reserve status, manned by a cadre of regulars and a majority of drilling reservists." In this status, says Lehman, "they could do occasional showthe-flag cruises and rapidly deploy in time of crisis." He dismisses arguments that the ships are too manpoweri ntensi ve to be cost-effecti ve: "We manned them i n the 1980s with 1,400 officers and men. By manning only two of the four engine rooms, they still make 24 knots and save several hundred crew. With other sensible reductions made possible by newer technology they could be manned with fewer than 800. At whatever manning, there simply is no substitute for those 16-inch guns. On the first salvo they can be in the wrong county, but with drone or aircraft spotting the subsequent rounds have 100-yard or better accuracy."
Lehman points out that "the Exocet can penetrate only 2.75 inches of armor" and that similar missiles "would have no effect against any of the armor of the BBs." He cautions, however, that no amount of protection can prevent all casualties, particularly if hits are made on the less-armored portions of the superstructure. Still, "The only real conventional threat to the BBs," says Lehman, "is the huge underkeel Russian torpedo, but even there, the BBs have triplelayered bottoms. In short, compared to the 1/4-inch steel of the billion-dollar Aegis ships, the BBs are invulnerable."

Typically, in any littoral scenario, the amphibious ready group (ARG) will deliver the first ground forces most readily available to respond to a littoral crisis. Typically a Marine expeditionary unit/special operations-capable (MEU/SOC), a reinforced infantry battalion, can respond within hours to days, depending on the ARGs proximity to the crisis. However, the next available Marine force, the Marine expeditionary brigade (MEB), arrives 11 days after the MEU deploys. For crises requiring a force larger than an MEU and sooner than an MEB, the Armys 82d Airborne Division and IBCTs are ideal. The Army should contribute IBCTs to JTFs responsible for securing port facilities and littoral airfields.
Employing IBCTs to respond to littoral national security interests would not be interpreted as an encroachment on Marine Corps turf. USMC leaders acknowledge that the Corps alone is too small to adequately respond to large-scale crises. Commandant of the Marine Corps General James L. Jones stated: Marines win battles, the Army wins Wars.

Unfortunately, as planning to support IBCTs and OMFTS becomes more definitive, important tactical requirements remain ill-defined, if not neglected. In the Armys case, the fire support deficiency is highlighted by an October 1999 Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans (DCSOPS) meeting of the Council of Colonels. Transformation workshops were conducted to enable early and continuous joint, integrated and overwhelming strategic and operational fires and maneuver, throughout the depth and breadth of the battlespace and across the spectrum of operations.

for the need for tactically responsive fires.
Even 2 minutes, 30 seconds can seem like a lifetime when you need fire support. Perhaps this is part of the problem. Not enough of todays soldiers have experienced combat, and decisionmakers too often fail to listen to those who have. Recently retired General Barry R. McCaffrey stated, With only a handful of exceptions, our soldiers have never witnessed a protracted, high-casualty ground campaign. . . . Many of the lessons of Vietnam have been lost, forgotten, or cast asidedeemed inconvenient or irrelevant. . . . It is critical that they learn from, and not repeat, the mistakes of the past. 
12
13
If this is the current Army standard for tactical fire support responsiveness, if the USMC follows the Armys Artillery School for tactics, techniques and procedures (TTP), and if the US military is always to fight jointly, this fire support standard should also apply to the Navy and support for soldiers and Marines ashore. Additionally, the tactical battle space should be limited to the distance at which fires can range targets and still be responsive in any weather. This designation applies for all ground operations, whether in the littorals or in the Balkans. Doctrine can grow as technology improves so that fire support remains tactically responsive and be doctrinally sound but not doctrinally bound. 14
General Anthony C. Zinni, USMC, commander in chief (CINC) of US Central Command, detailed shortfalls in joint fire support capabilities for forcedentry scenarios. He asked, How do we employ joint fires when were building up the force? Its easy to employ joint fires in an exercise where the entire force is already in place. 
15
16
In the initial stages of a joint littoral operation, until sufficient time elapses to deploy organic artillery assets, both services must rely heavily on air power (primarily naval aviation) for fire support because the Navy cannot provide credible NSFS to support joint Marine and Army amphibious operations. Even the Navy admits that it currently has no credible surface fire capabilities to support forced-entry from the sea and inland operations by Marine Corps and Army forces.

l Its decommissioning of Iowa-class battleships in the early 1990s without a comparable replacement.
Retired Colonel James E. Lasswell, former head of experimentation operations, USMC Warfighting Lab, Quantico, Virginia, wrote: Current [naval fires] systems are too few, too short in range, and inadequate for providing the kind of fire support needed to support any sizable sea-based maneuver operation. War games and experiments have identified serious problems in conducting . . . STOMforcible entry operationswithout a robust naval-fire capability. Littoral penetration points cannot be adequately isolated, counter-battery fires are not sufficient, and responsive fires in support of maneuver are inadequate. . . . Absent the introduction of a significantly improved naval surface fire system, landing forces will continue to rely on air-delivered munitions as the primary fire support instrument during sea-based maneuver operations. This situation will persist until they can drag their own fire support [ashore]. 
20
Navy solutions to the NSFS gap include two nearterm programsthe 5-inch extended-range guided munition (ERGM) and land-attack standard missile (LASM) and one long-term program the 155mm advanced gun system (AGS) for the DD 21 land-attack destroyer. According to Lasswell, these programs, if fully funded and implemented, could put a dent in the requirement. 
21
ERGM is part of a $2.1-billion program to design, test and field a long-range munition for the Navys new 5-inch, Mk 45 Mod 4, 62-caliber gun system. The EX-171 is a 12-caliber (61 inches long), 110pound, rocket-assisted projectile that carries a 19pound payload of 72 Army M-80 antimateriel/antipersonnel submunitions that will produce a circular destructive pattern on the ground to a planned maximum range of 63 nautical miles in 7 to 8 minutes. Relying on an on-board GPS-updated Inertial Navigation System (INS), ERGM will have an accuracy of 10 to 20 meters. The EX-171 relies on a rocket motor that generates 18 megajoules of energy to reach an altitude of 80,000 to 85,000 feet from where it glides to its target.

round to stick in the barrel. The extreme barrel heat melted the projectiles on-board GPS/INS, but incredibly, the Navy ruled the test a success. Designing an inertial measurement unit, an essential part of the systems GPS guidance package, is also difficult because it must withstand the force of 12,000 Gs as it leaves the gun barrel. To make matters worse, according to a 1997 General Accounting Office letter, The near-term [ERGM] phase of the [Navys NSFS] program is not expected or designed to fully meet the fire support requirements recently established by the USMC. A key deficiency is responsiveness. 
24
Performance deficiencies. Following are some serious ERGM performance deficiencies: l Responsiveness. Van Riper said, A consistent concern is time of flight, which could be eight to nine minutes. If the target is mobile, it could disappear even if terminal guidance were available. 
25
l Destruction fires. The 5-inch ERGM (only slightly bigger than a 120mm mortar) holds 72 M-80 submunitions, which are ineffective against hard targets such as tanks, APCs, bunkers, caves and fortifications that soldiers and Marines typically face in littoral regions.
l Sustained/subsequent operations ashore. The DDGs on-board storage capacity of only 230 ERGMs cannot support sustained operations ashore. At its sustained rate of 10 rounds per minute, the DDG is out of ammunition after 23 minutes.
l Volume. The DDGs single gun cannot achieve the volume required. Van Riper writes of a need for low-cost, high-volume rounds that can be used to provide close supporting fires to maneuvering land forces. Quantity of fire, on time and on target, has a quality all its own. Precision/terminally guided munitions are needed but not to the exclusion of inexpensive, volume fire munitions. Both precise and less-precise munitions are critical in the window of vulnerability during the early stages of ship-toobjective maneuver [STOM] when organic artillery is afloat. 
26
27
Land-attack standard missile (LASM). The supersonic LASM is installed on Aegis warships and uses GPS and INS for precision guidance. Program funding for LASM started in FY 00, and LASM initial operating capability is planned for FY 03. The procurement objective is 800 missiles. There have been three flight demonstrations and two warhead arena tests, but missile solutions for fire support are insufficient because they fail to provide the anticipated responsiveness and volume of fire needed by the landing force. 
28
The AGS is a 155mm gun weapon system planned for installation in the DD 21 land-attack destroyer, which is still in the design stage. DD 21 will carry two 155mm guns capable of independently firing twelve 200-pound, GPS-guided, ERGM-like rounds per minute, out to 115 miles, from two 750-round automated magazines. However, one of these guns is projected for removal in favor of a vertical launch system to support theater ballistic missile defense.
The first AGS is scheduled for delivery in FY 06, with an initial operating capability of 2008. However, the first DD 21 probably will not be fielded until 2012 or produced in sufficient numbers until after 2020. Even when the systems are fully fielded, DD 21 will not be able to match the Iowa-class battleships

in firepower and shock effect.

Currently, only major-caliber guns have the allweather reliability, lethality and responsiveness to support tactical operations. Such guns are now found only on the Navys two mothballed Iowa-class battleships (USS Iowa, BB-61, and USS Wisconsin, BB-64). The 16-inch Mark VII gun shoots 1,900-pound, high-capacity, shore-bombardment projectiles out to 24 miles with flight times under 2 minutes. However, with extended-range projectiles, like those in development during the late 1980s and early 1990s, major-caliber guns could deliver projectiles varying in weight (525 to 1,300 pounds) out to 52 statute miles in approximately 2 minutes. This time of flight still leaves sufficient time to develop a fire solution and still put steel on target in 2 minutes, 30 seconds. Tight shooting powders such as the Armys M31 could produce unguided, ballistic circular error probable (CEP) on the order of 250 meters at 52 miles with a lethal radius of approximately 200 meters. Unlike GPS-guided fire support, 16-inch gunfire is timely, not subject to jamming or inclement weather and cannot be shot down.
Invest in four ships. The Navy has been reluctant to invest in the capabilities of a small ship class when the equipment developed could not be used elsewhere in the fleet. However, the 16-inch extended-range ammunition is a special case that can be justified economically as well as operationally. The investment pays off during operations that involve a large portion of the Navys amphibious shipping but only a few of its surface combatants.
Further, implementing laser guidance could transform ballistic projectiles into PGMs that can be guided from a wide range of sources, including the eight remotely piloted vehicles organic to the battleship. This capability will give troops ashore highly reliable fire support in the close fight that is responsive, precise and lethal. Extended-range ballistic projectiles can provide all-weather, lifesaving fire support on timeanytime.
Other major-caliber, extended-range projectiles could be employed to support a proposed division deep-battle responsiveness requirement of 5 minutes. In 1991 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency proposed an 11-inch sabot projectile, fired from a 16-inch gun, which would have had a 115mile projected range and a 4-minute time of flight. Since ballistic accuracy decreases beyond 50 miles, terminal guidance would be necessary to maintain acceptable accuracy. Large-caliber projectiles fired beyond 52 miles would represent transition to the

operational battle space because of responsiveness.
A snapshot of todays sealift and other movement capabilities shows only incremental change from the way we had conducted amphibious operations in the 1940s. 
31
The battleship, with its major-caliber guns, is the only system that can be modernized to meet the many rigorous fire support requirements of 21st-century JTF commanders performing littoral combat missions. For a relatively small investment, several battleship upgrades would enable tactically responsive, extended-range joint fires and quickly integrate US and coalition firesair and indirect. Modernized battleships can integrate and synchronize the joint fires mission end to end.
Advanced Field Artillery Tactical Data System (AFATDS). This Army and USMC automated artillery system plans, executes and tracks fire support missions. A battleship with AFATDS would fill the need for integrating joint fires to support Army and USMC forces engaged in close combat ashore.
Target-acquisition battery (TAB) radar. Included in Van Ripers memo was a requirement for a fire support ship to be configured with TAB radar. A maritime version of the AN/TPQ-37 Firefinder radar could pinpoint enemy artillery and Scud-type weapons engaging ground troops ashore for the battleships 16-inch guns to destroy immediately.
Vertical-Launch-System (VLS) Tomahawks. Plans exist to install 96 VLS Tomahawk missiles. The below-deck design significantly increases their survivability and lethality. These missiles would be instrumental in destroying key enemy fixed or stationary C 4 ISR, air defense targets essential in blinding the enemy and rolling back enemy defenses.
Deterring war and winning wars when deterrence fails is the US militarys defining mission. No single weapon system short of nuclear weapons deters aggression like the battleship. For example, during the Iran-Iraq tanker war in the 1980s, every time the Iowa would enter the Persian Gulf, all the shooting would stop and all southern Iran would go quiet.

good sense and gives US littoral forces performing operational and strategic maneuver the potential to achieve Sun Tzus supreme excellence.
The Navy has determined that the blue-water strategy does not apply in the 21st century and replaced it with a brown-water strategy (littoral warfare). The Navy must ultimately realize that with this shift in strategy comes the primary responsibility to provide troops ashore with accurate, reliable, tactically responsive, high-volume NSFS under all conditions. Without it, our troops ashore risk needless casualties, being defeated or both.
The idea of making Iowa-class battleships joint assets as part of a JTF commanders go-to-war toolkit was first proposed in October 1998 as a workaround to the Navys arguments for not maintaining them in active service.

Sir John Woodward 1 J OINT FIREPOWER synchronized with operational-level maneuver bites with formidable force and terrorizes the enemy. Precise, brisk, devastating operational firepower has been around only since World War II, and its place in major operations and campaigns is no less important today than at Normandy. Firepower is a fundamental tool of the operational artist, and every campaign planner needs a sense of how such devastating power can be most effective.
Following the smoothbore age, military operations changed course, and open warfare resolved into close encounters around fixed points. While maneuver was prominent during three of the four years of the American Civil War, the fourth was largely spent in siege operations. The Franco-Prussian War began with six weeks of maneuver, followed by a five-month siege on Paris. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877 was basically a single-siege operation, and the Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05 closed with 600,000 men consumed in trench warfare.
Because of this attrition form of warfare, military leaders concluded that heavier firepower was needed. In 1916 during the battle of Verdun, the Germans heaped two million rounds on French positions at the rate of 100,000 rounds an hour. While these are impressive figures and the magnitude of the barrages must have been awe-inspiring, firepower alone did not achieve an operational decision in the precursor events to World War I, nor did it during the devastating years of the war itself.

The term operational firepower refers to a commander in chiefs (CINCs) application of fires to achieve a decisive impact on the conduct of a campaign or major operation. Operational firepower, while a separate element of the concept of operations, must closely integrate and synchronize with the CINCs concept of maneuver. At the operational level, firepower is defined in terms of what it does rather than what it is. It does not necessarily directly equate to attrition warfare and, of necessity, plays a critical role in maneuver warfare.

l Isolates the battlefield by interdiction. l Destroys critical enemy functions and facilities, eliminating or substantially degrading enemy operational-level capabilities.
l Facilitates operational maneuver by suppressing enemy fires, disrupting maneuver and creating gaps in defenses.
Operational fires help achieve operational and perhaps strategic objectives while holding enemy critical functions at risk throughout the depth of the battle space. They are more than deep fires because they extend the battlefield in space and time. Existing capabilities permit acquisition and attack at increasing ranges and faster response times than ever before. Operational firepower can expose or allow attacks directly on the center of gravity and set con-ditions for maneuver. Through disruption, delay or by limiting critical functions, firepower can dictate the terms of future battle.

Firepower is often associated with attrition, which depends on industrial strength, cumulative effects and destroying target arrays. Overusing this method leads to routine target acquisition and repetitive repertoires to support a preponderance of firepower. While firepower is an effective means of war, it is neither self-sufficient nor a swift instrument of victory. The Vietnam experience affirms this truth: as firepower and attrition dominate operational design, maneuver seems less important; yet, without it, a decision is improbable. 9
Decisively defeating an enemy force requires dominant maneuver throughout the depth of the battle space. Dominance requires seeing activity in the battle space, moving rapidly through its depth and directing firepower to dominate the maneuver relationship. Final dominance comes through simultaneously applying firepower and controlling terrain. 
10
11
At the operational level there are two basic forms of maneuver that support sustained land action: cen-
tral maneuver using penetration, frontal attack and infiltration; and flanking maneuver using envelopment or turning movement. World War II illustrates how each form has been applied and how firepower facilitated success. For example, Operation Neptune demonstrated a frontal attack, Operation Cobra a penetration and Operation Bluecoat an envelopment.

Frontal assaults and penetrations require facilitating similar methods. The official US Army history of the cross-channel attack records that the task of smashing through enemy beach defenses was to be facilitated as far as possible by naval fire and air bombardment. The Atlantic wall was expected to contain 15,000 concrete strong points, 15 coastal batteries and 300,000 defenders. A frontal assault against such defenses required heavily suppressing enemy fire, tearing gaps in the imposing defenses, isolating enemy reserves from the lodgment area, destroying German mobility and supporting the deception (Operation Fortitude).

exemplify how firepower might support such an effort. Slim, having retreated from Burma during 1941, found himself in an economy-of-force theater throughout World War II. As he began to transition to a theater offensive against Japans 15th Imperial Army in 1944, the security of his northern flank became a major concern. Slims objective was to secure his northern flank and prevent Japan from reinforcing its 15th Imperial Army. He used the Chindits to cut the LOC of enemy forces facing US General Joseph Stilwell on the northern front. 
22
23
Britains Number 1 Air Commando and 3d Tactical Air Force received the first priority of establishing and maintaining local air superiority over the operational area. This force destroyed all Japanese air forces that could influence Chindit operations.
Bombs from Fifth Air Force B-25s straddle a Japanese patrol boat from a convoy headed for Rabaul, 16 February 1944. In the background (see inset) a cargo vessel receives a fatal hit while only the bow remains visible of another ship heading for the bottom. The convoy was caught off Kavieng, New Ireland.
River bridges from Rouen to Mantes-Gassicourt were rendered impassable. An area the size of Indiana was isolated in the northwest corner of France.
Front caused the Japanese to believe Lower Burma was about to be invaded from India. Consequently, Japanese reserves were not free to oppose Chindits on the Northern Front. Approximately 750 tons of munitions were delivered to facilitate infiltration of the Japanese 15th Army. Antiaircraft firetraps were also used against Japanese air forces. Allied air forces would lure the Japanese into these networks to increase attrition and prevent interference with the infiltration operations. 24
Because envelopments and turns are similar, the general character of operational firepower that facilitates such maneuvers would take on similar patterns. In fact, many patterns are similar to those required in central maneuvers with one notable exceptionprotecting a flank. The US XIX Tactical Air Command (TAC) supporting General George S. Pattons Third Army during mid-August 1944 demonstrated how to protect an operational flank using firepower. According to planners, Never in military history had a ground commander entrusted the defense of a flank to tactical aircraft. The rapid maneuver during Pattons exploitation toward the Seine River line and Paris called for special emphasis ahead of the advance and especially along the vulnerable Loire valley flank. 
25

28
MacArthurs turn of Rabaul illustrates equally well operational fires protecting ones flank. After the Battle of Coral Sea in May 1942, Japanese penetration toward Australia and LOC into the Southwest Pacific region was disrupted, but Rabaul still dominated the region. From this major naval and air base, the Japanese could continue to threaten the LOC to Australia and New Zealand and dominate the right flank of any regional operations. Allied forces were held to the Bismarck barrier, where the Japanese effectively waged attrition warfare to dominate the approaches to Rabaul and contain Allied forces.
After one year of campaigning, Allied forces had advanced less than 200 miles in the Southwest Pacific. At that rate it would have taken 15 years to reach Japan. An approach through the Central Pacific looked more inviting as the Japanese began reinforcing Rabaul, eventually assembling 100,000 well-armed men.

Maneuver and firepower have rarely stood alone as decisive in and of themselves; they are inseparable and complementary. While one might dominate a particular phase of a campaign, the most beneficial effects derive from integrating operational-level maneuver and firepower relative to the enemy center of gravity. When maneuver and firepower are synergistically orchestrated to disrupt the supporting structure, unbalance command decisions and impose chaotic disorganization, disproportionate success is possible. Focusing on maneuver or firepower without the other misses the point altogether.

US troops wear helmets and body armorhence their nickname, ninja turtles. They travel in convoys with guns manned and ready. When they stop, they disperse to overwatch positions, ready to apply defensive force. At night most retire to fortified camps or outposts as Romans did on campaigns, cut off from the people they came to protect.
British troops wear berets and walk and talk with the locals. They travel in small groups, armed but with weapons slung. Some wear ammunition pouches; some do not; none wears body armor unless there is an imminent threat. Off duty they eat and relax in town; many live there. Single vehicles often travel the roads, identifiable only by their painted military patterns.
Each nation participating in the implementation force (IFOR), stabilization force (SFOR) and Kosovo peacekeeping force (KFOR) has adopted forceprotection policies based on national doctrine. The British posture represents most nations approach; the US posture is the exception. 
2
Neither British nor US doctrine implies zerocasualty tolerance or places force protection above mission accomplishment. Both restate the traditional military responsibility to win with minimal casual-ties. Commanders have historically planned, adjusted, retreated, regrouped and advanced with new strategies to win at the lowest cost. Both US and British generals are concerned about casualties, and they adjust strategy to minimize them but not at the expense of the mission. Why do these generals with very similar doctrine differ in their policies?
Numerous references in official reports support a popular military view that policy differences among coalition members will be exploited in peace operations to manipulate public sentiment against a specific force.

Senior military leaders are directly influenced by orders from above and results from below. They are indirectly influenced by other factors such as doctrine, experience, history and resources. Although they receive their orders from civilian leaders who represent society, societys mood may also influence them. Presumably, the British, with their routinely
less-protective uniform, posture and procedures, and claims of mission command, would show greater tolerance for risk. US policy, because it is dictated or influenced from above, should show the opposite.
The Prime Ministers Questions in the House of Commons and parliamentary debates over Bosnia and Kosovo do not indicate a philosophy of casualty aversion. The prime minister was an early and vocal supporter of maintaining a credible ground war option for Kosovo. There was a sober recognition of the personal and political effects of casualties but nothing indicating hesitation on these grounds. The debates seemed to concern the level of British interests, the ability to field the required force and civilian casualties in the war zone more than potential British military casualties. In fact, the subject of British military casualties occurs infrequently and then only as a derivative rather than a primary topic.

As with the British, there is no overt evidence that the US force-protection policy was a reaction to political or social pressure. General George A. Joulwan was supreme allied commander of NATO forces and the senior US officer in Europe when US forces crossed the Sava River into Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of IFOR.

10
In a 1998 speech President William J. Clinton stated, We must, and we will, always do everything we can to protect our forces. We must and will always make their safety a top priority. . . . But we must be strong and tough and mature enough to recognize that even the best-prepared, best-equipped force will suffer losses in action.

15
standing US military tradition, practice and doctrine to minimize casualties while accomplishing a mission. It is a leaders inherent responsibility and has been the goal for equipping, training and preparing professional militaries. Along with the presidents public acceptance of risk and Joulwans statements, these expressions cannot be taken as pressure for zero or unrealistically low casualties. The Congressional Record from December 1995 through November 2000 indicates significant discussion of casualties but always in the context of national interest. Most contention concerned the presidents authority to commit military forces to hazardous situations without consulting Congress a reason many gave for not supporting the Kosovo bombing. Risk to soldiers or aircraft did not play prominently in debates outside the context of national interest. The Congressional Record signals no intolerance of casualties, only that risk should relate to unimportance and that Congress has a decisionmaking role.
Sociologists have likewise concluded that the American public will tolerate casualties but require that US interests warrant the cost. 
16
17
18
Many commentators seem to presume that political guidance to limit casualties is improper. There is also a popular suspicion that senior military leaders have allowed an inference of zero-casualty tolerance to affect mission accomplishment. This leads to two questions: What is improper pressure? What would an action based on improper pressure look like?
Appropriate pressure seeks mission accomplishment at least cost and considers whether decisions accept the estimated risks and costs. Before selecting a course of action, parameters such as acceptable risk or casualty tolerance are simply planning guidance. Since military operations in US and British doctrine support political objectives, such political guidance would be proper. Using this guidance, military leaders would prepare the most acceptable courses of action and advise how to balance political and military costs and benefits. Considering casualties, a central factor in the publics calculus of operational merit, is not in and of itself improper. Directing an operation without being willing to risk casualties, however, inverts the mission-first-at-least-cost principle and constitutes improper pressure.
Overt pressure has not been a factor in senior military policy formulation but might have been inferred. The evidence commonly cited appears to show this at first but is arguable, fragmentary, of unknown context or not directly to this point. 
19
If a leader adjusted strategy to eliminate casualties and still accomplished the mission, he would be considered a hero. If he refused to commit forces until complementary action had eliminated the risk of casualties and were still to succeed in the mission, it would be hailed as a triumph of synchronization and politico-military campaign planning. If he enforced inconvenient security measures but got the job done without casualties, he would be called prudent and responsible. Success is success and the cheaper the better. The only indicator that inferred political pressure has improperly influenced an operation would be an inversion of the mission-firstat-least-cost formula. As long as the mission is accomplished acceptably with minimal casualties, it is impossible to conclude that political influence has been improper or that military leaders have failed to do their duty because of what they infer.
To judge negatively the conservative approach of military leaders who successfully accomplish the mission is to express personal preference, not an objective conclusion. Joulwan, speaking of his Bosnia experience, states without reservation that his plans and policy were based on military necessity, not political or social pressure. 
20
Joulwan states that initial US force-protection policy was based on military necessity and that he was influenced by two factors. First, many believed that a lack of professionalism contributed significantly to the US failure in Vietnam and that lax uniform standards were part of the lost professionalism. Enforcing mission-appropriate uniform policies became an underlying tenet of professionalism. Since the mission in Bosnia was peace enforcement, not peacekeeping, the force had to be prepared for combat. Joulwans uniform policy conformed to that need.
Second, senior US military leaders cited a terrorist threat to US forces, perhaps greater than that to our allies. Joulwan held the conviction that strength deters attacks and encourages cooperation. He felt that the IFOR peace-enforcement mission must not be confused with the UN Protection Forces peacekeeping mission. An image of combat readiness was, in itself, good protection.

35
The belief that US force-protection policy is based on casualty intolerance is a myth that does not accurately describe the policys origins or intent. The artifact of the force-protection policy is interpreted through this myth and misunderstood. What the authors of the policy see simply as a more formal articulation of a commanders traditional responsibility for minimizing casualties, agents of the myth see as an exhortation to zero casualties. 
37
38
39
The myth then becomes routine. As guidance spreads downward, it becomes more elaborate and restrictive. The inevitable rise of institutional structures produces staff officers with checklists, riskassessment methodologies and force-protection paragraphs in orders. Force protection rises to the status of a mission from its traditional role as a responsibility. Institutionalizing force protection has become a cottage industry in the US military; it now consumes resources and affects events. Even an intentional impression of zero-casualty tolerance could not have been better reinforced.
It is reinforced more directly when observations fit expectations. Interviews with junior military leaders in Bosnia in 1996 indicated widespread dissatisfaction with what was seen as out-of-touch policy.
The troops did not see a high threat, despite the official mission of peace enforcement.

Ultimately societies determine what is worth dying for and, therefore, what is tolerable risk. Assessing their militaries requires understanding the underlying social calculus. The United States and Britain use the same formula but weigh the factors differently. When side by side, the nations may respond to the same threat differently. It appears that both US and British citizens tolerate casualties when their interests are at stake. However, Britons find their interests at stake more often, and their interests are of higher relative value. Thus, their tolerance for casualties is naturally higher, and as members of that society, their military leaders are commensurately shaped. US interests are not directly involved as often as British ones and are less often seen as vital.
The United Kingdom historically views itself in terms of its military interventions.

Mercantilism became essential to its prosperity, a trend fueled by demands of the industrial revolution. The growing need for foreign raw materials, labor and markets required subduing competitors and protecting freedom of the seas.

53
British leaders may consider their interest in the Balkans as more vital than the United States does and not just because of geographic proximity. Moreover, senior British military leaders have been socialized to a tendency to follow British tradition and have no immediate reason to jeopardize their traditional hearts and minds campaign by taking a more US-like approach, even though it could immediately reduce casualty risks. The United States would not have the same option of choosing a lessprotective posture, not because of casualty intolerance within US society, but because of the heightened standard set by its cultures focus on individuals and by the expectations set by US history.
Britain has unapologetically fought wars for economic purposes. The British military serves the monarch and suffers wounds in service of queen and country. British military culture is expeditionary; troops often have deployed in relatively small strength on distant shores. 
54
55
In doing so, the British have developed a charisma some call arrogance. It is not. This demeanor enables them to dominate without constant recourse to force of arms and to develop a professional reputation that is a form of symbolic capital. 
56
US culture has aided the US Armys willingness to accept an unintended implication of zerocasualty tolerance. The US Army has a reputation as a firepower force to avoid casualties, the United States invented reconnaissance by fire, the daisy cutter and the atomic bomb. US military doctrine has always been able to overwhelm its opponent with an overmatching force. It deploys and fights in strength with adequate resources to assure victory. The basis for this approach has been an idealistic valuation of the individual, along the lines of John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The materiel luxury of bombs and bullets substituted for soldiers lives reinforces the viewpoint that all men are created equal. Philosophy and wealth do not instill a zero-casualty cultural attitude but, rather, reinforce commanders traditional responsibility to avoid casualties at all cost. However, it is a short step along the spectrum from minimal to zero casualties, one the US Army is now taking.
US general officers, like their British counterparts, respond to their own culture. The US militarys symbolic capital lies in its readiness to use overwhelming force. Senior US military leaders understand this without thought and use it just as the British use their approach. Force-protection policy developers who examine the major influences on US and British militaries rule out direct and indirect political and public influences as causal. Nearly identical doctrines have allowed such different policies because leaders applying the doctrines are products of different cultures, experiences and historical pressures. Because underlying ways of thinking and operating have been effective and codified in traditions that promise further success, it would be surprising if US and British generals had arrived at the same policy.
Successful multinational operations must bridge such gaps simply by coordinating policy during coalition formation and routine military-to-military contacts. Better yet, peacetime engagement with other militaries, including participation in international forums, develops practical interoperability tools and allows people to meet people. There is room for additional research, for instance, to validate or debunk the popular notion that policy dissimilarities are counterproductive. Also, the US Army should examine the balance between mission and casualties, and its potential impact on its warfighting ethic. Armies around the world are transforming. The better they understand these issues, the more promise there is for compatibility when and where it counts.
T HE END OF THE COLD WAR marked a new era for the US Army. Recent changes ranging from the geopolitical structure, to the nature and role of the family, to individual soldier values have significantly affected the US Army. As a result, the 21st-century Army is an organization in transition. The institutional level has responded with planned development and force modernization efforts that focus on new technology and mission roles. Likewise, at the soldier level, the Army is responding by redesigning efficiency reports and increasing the length of basic training. 
1
One area strained by changes in the nature of war is officer education. The comparatively new, rapidly changing role of professional military officers necessitates their increased understanding and application of sociological concepts. As a discipline, sociology provides a systematic method from which to assess and organize social activity. A sociological background gives company grade combat arms officers the necessary conceptual skills to operate on the modern battlefield and prepares them to take advantage of advanced professional education later in their careers. 
2
Recognizing the dilemma facing todays military leaders, the Center for Strategic and International Studies convened a committee in 1997 to assess the Professional Military Education (PME) System and provide recommendations. The committee found that service schools and colleges must do more to help the officer corps adapt to the rapid technological advances of the information age and the changing mission of the post-Cold War era. 
3
4
In 1802 the United States Military Academy (USMA) was founded, marking one of Americas earliest attempts to codify Army officer training. Since then officer development has experienced several significant changes, yet at the same time, such associated activities remain one of two distinct but mutually supporting components: ethos and intellect.
Ethos concerns fledgling officers corporate identity, developed through selection, institutional instruction and informal mentoring. 
5
6
Intellect represents the technical and mechanical skills officers require while executing their duties. Military revolutions of the 16th and 17th centuries redefined the officer corps. Early in the 18th century it became apparent to the great armies that it was too costly for all officers to be general practitioners who learned their craft solely on the battlefield. In response, specialized staff schools emerged, and the first permanent standing (staff) officer school appeared in France in 1780.

A college education serves the Army officer in several ways. First, a college degree demonstrates an officers capacity for learning and self-discipline. Likewise, the process of acquiring a college education develops the critical thinking and reasoning skills necessary to address unforeseen and unspecified future problems. Additionally, a college education can provide future officers with specific skills that are unattainable through the Armys institutional training. 
23
Today, given the magnitude and number of changes affecting the military, postsecondary schools can no longer adequately fulfill the intellectual component of officer development. While some colleges and universities can meet this need, the Army cannot assume that any bachelors degree is adequate for most officers. The Army is undergoing significant changes because of internal and external pressures. While the two components of officer development remain valid, specific processes and products of these componentsparticularly college educationmust change at a comparable rate.
Two significant changes affect the Army and military leaders: advances in the methods (technology) of war and variations in the nature of warfare, including peacekeeping and counterterrorism. These two forces, by their very nature, greatly affect junior officers. At higher echelons, specialized officers fill staff positions and stay current on specific changes and provide senior commanders with appropriate advice on their functions. However, staffs below division level are comprised of generalists rather than specialists. At these lower levels, staff officers still advise commanders on matters related to their functions. However, unlike staffers at upper echelons, these company grade staff officers receive nearly identical training in the PME Systemtheir specialized training is limited. Additionally, if the Army implements a force designed around brigadesized units, then the density of specialized staff officers assisting commanders decreases further. 
24
The Army has responded to changes in the methods of war with Force XXI and Army After Next initiatives, which represent a systematic institutionwide approach affecting everything from strategic doctrine to individual soldier training.

officers require education coupled with training that allows them to assess varied missions and understand their human dimensions. One way to prepare leaders for this environment is to train them to apply sociology.
Advocating training and education in sociology does not mean all officers should become sociologistsquite the contrary. The increasing complexity and division of labor calls for a military composed of specialists in many areas. Likewise, because the Army requires various specialists, other academic backgrounds will continue to serve the Army through various personnel billets. However, for those leaders at the tip of the spear, an academic grounding in sociology may be the most efficient and useful collegiate specialization. Junior military officers who execute the Armys core function would benefit from an increased understanding of social sciences, sociological concepts in particular.
Forward-deployed junior officers face a widening array of relevant factors and need tools to organize conditions and information to respond effec-tively. In terms of academic training, sociology meets this need by providing a framework within which to integrate and synthesize other fields for application to social conditions. Sociology integrates and draws upon components of several other social sciences by considering social life and behavior, especially in relation to social systems, how they work, how they change, the consequences they produce and their complex relations to peoples lives. 
30
31
Changes in the nature of warfare demand that junior combat arms officers be warrior-scholars. The professional officer produced from a military education, complemented with a study of sociological
concepts, is a warrior-scholar. This concept is a variation of Segals soldier-statesman/soldierdiplomat.

44
Although the upper military echelons may assess a society from a nation-state perspective, a company commander performing humanitarian assistance for a village must see that village as a society and act accordingly. Junior officers who apply sociological imagination to the following three question sets can assess systematically various 21st-century situations and societies they will confront:
l What is the structure of the society as a whole? What are its essential components and how do they relate to one another? How does it differ from other social orders? Within it, what is the meaning of any particular feature for its continuance and for its change?
l Where does this society stand in human history? How is it changing? What is its place within and its meaning for the development of humanity as a whole? How do particular features affect the historical period in which they move, and how is it, in turn, affected?
l What varieties of men and women prevail in this society and period? What varieties are coming to prevail? In what ways are they selected and formed, liberated and repressed, made sensitive and blunted? 
45
This pragmatic use of sociology draws from a distinct domain within the disciplineconsensual sociology. 
46
47
48
49
Developing warrior-scholars to meet the changing nature of warfare presupposes an increased need for them that the current officer accession system is not already filling. Measuring the presence of these two conditions requires a longitudinal review. Three representative periods provide a basis for reference:
l 1987the end of President Ronald Reagans defense buildup (late Cold War).
l 1992post-Cold War and Desert Storm. l 1997contemporary reference.
Comparing the number of soldiers deployed each fiscal year gauges varying US military involvement. 
50
51
As the Army has drawn down and shifted to force projection, the aggregate number of deployed soldiers has actually declined over the past 10 years. 
52
The Army needs to assess whether it has already responded to mission-profile changes by increasing the number of sociologically trained officers. Potentially, the institution, as part of a larger social system, may have already adjusted and could be developing warrior-scholars without deliberate intervention. Comparing the number of officers holding a degree in sociology as of 30 September (1987,  1992 and 1997) helps assess whether the Armys accession program has already responded to the new battlefield. 
53
Despite the increased need for warrior-scholars, the officer accessions program has not responded with a matching induction of sociologists. The total number of officer sociologists has declined as part of the drawdown, but more important, the percentage of sociologists has remained relatively constant at less than one and a half percent. The Armys officer accessions program has not responded to warfare changes by providing more officers with sociological training from which warrior-scholars can be developed.
The PME System has responded to 21st-century challenges by updating its curriculum and resources, but these efforts typically do not develop officers until at least the senior captain level. Because peacekeeping efforts are effective only as long as the peacekeeping force remains able to operate in the full spectrum of conflict, combat arms officer basic and advance courses remain grounded in traditional functions. While institutional schools have made laudable efforts to broaden curricula to cover MOOTW missions, they remain focused primarily on their core functions. Budget constraints keep schools from developing the reasoning skills and training to deal fully with modern warfares ambiguous environment. Because initial PME schools currently cannot address new officers 21st-century educational needs and advanced PME schools occur too late in an officers career, precommissioning education becomes critical.
The Army currently assesses officers through OCS, USMA and ROTC programs at colleges and universities across the country. Each candidate has a contractual obligation to obtain a baccalaureate degree, and the Army should increasingly specify the courses. The idea of increasing specificity in precommissioning education is not new. Service academy curricula heavy in science, math and engineering produce military leaders and top technicians to deal with rapid technological change. 
54
55
College classes grounded in the humanities may raise the old debate about whether to value breadth or depth. Dick Cheney notes that the right balance between educational paths that stress a broader, liberal arts background versus educational paths that focus on science, math and engineering promises to prove one of the greatest challenges to the PME system. 
56
While the Center for Strategic and International Studies panel spoke of education in terms of the humanities and hard sciences, actual changes require greater specificity. Just as the conditions of warfare in 1850 made training in some disciplines more relevant than others, 21st-century warfare demands training in specific, albeit different, disciplines. Sociology is an academic field with great tactical value to modern leaders in MOOTW.

In The Art of War, Sun Tzu says that [v]ictory smiles upon those who anticipate the changes in the character of war, not upon those who wait to adapt themselves after the changes occur. 
1
Clauswitz argues that perfect prewar planning for contingencies is difficult, if not impossible, because of the fog of war. To anticipate the full array of possibilities of changes and plan a way to adapt to all of them is, at least, futile. Therefore, the strategist and his enamored tactician must be able to properly assess the situation, given wartime realities, and adapt to battlefield changes. Revising the strategic net assessment is a first step on the road to victory.
Clausewitz states, Friction, as we choose to call it, is the force that makes the apparently easy so difficult.

During the American Revolution, the British had a prewar plan of using coercive measures to force colonists to capitulate to British empirical and parliamentary rule. The prewar British plan was seemingly simple put down a rebellion and return the colonies to the desired status quo.
Sun Tzu would have criticized the British for not considering in the prewar planning process the colonials will to resist and ability to prevail. He would have told the British to anticipate French and Spanish forces joining the battle. In short, he would have suggested that the British needed a better scriptwriter.
Shooting British subjects would not win colonial hearts and minds. If they had ascertained that using force would do nothing more than nourish the rebellion and recognized that force was detrimental to their cause, the British could have designed courses of action to counter colonial reaction. They could have determined whether it was more feasible to go for the decisive blow or to accept a colonial independence while maintaining a prominent economic existence. While the British did not believe they would have to resort to force to put down what they viewed as a weak rebellion, shedding blood at the onset should have led them to reconsider their strategy.

The character of the war in Korea could have led to US use of nuclear weapons to prevent communist Chinese intervening between the North and South Koreans. 
5
Arguably, a preplanned nuclear reaction to a possible change in battle would have been detrimental to the military situation in Korea and to international diplomacy. Therefore, while it is important to have preplanned, rehearsed contingencies, it is equally important to reassess situations continually and adapt to changes as they occur.
With the US and South Korean armies forced into the Pusan Perimeter and the Chinese threatening to join the war, the possibility of using nuclear weapons was real. However, the US ability to reevaluate the situation and adapt to real-time changes prevented it. US Army General Douglas MacArthur, reevaluating his possible courses of action, chose the bold, impressive Inchon landing, which curtailed the North Korean advance.

Initially, FLN actions appeared to have failed. No popular uprising followed the November 1954 revolt, and the French military remained in power. However, the FLN had wisely reevaluated the situation and adjusted its focus, converting its tactics to attackingsuccessfullyFrench political and social vulnerabilities.
Ironically, the French inability to properly reevaluate the situation helped the FLN succeed. Reassessment was critical, especially when the French continually failed to gain Muslim support. The French continued to believe that if they could defeat the FLN operationally they could end the insurgency. They were
wrong. Had they reassessed the situation, they would have realized that reforms and an offer of independence would have won the Maghribs support.
Ideally, strategists would be able to foresee all possible contingencies. However, while it is important to anticipate changes, it is also imperative to reassess and adapt strategy continually to meet each situations demands. Author Michael Handel writes: [E]very war is rich in unique episodes. Each is an uncharted sea.

In four days of desperate fighting, from 29 February to 3 March 2000, a large force of Chechen fighters wiped out a Russian paratroop company in the harsh defiles and ridges of the Argun Gorge in the mountains of southern Chechnya. Although the battle was a catastrophic tactical defeat for the Russian airborne force, the companys stubborn defense to the last man and the concentration of Russian relief forces inflicted a strategic setback on the Chechens. The Russians stumbled into this catastrophe through poor unit leadership, but Russian blood and valor transformed it into victory.
In Fall 1999, the Second Chechen War began. The Russian Army sought to reimpose the Russian Federations authority in lawless, breakaway Chechnya. The Russians and Chechens shared 200year history had been punctuated by convulsions of blood and cruelty. The First Chechen War, from 1994 to 1996, had ended in the Russian Armys humiliation and left Russia with its highest loss of resources and professionalism since the Soviet Unions demise. The loss of basic combat skills also had been horrific. This second round was the Russian Armys opportunity to show that it had recovered something of its former ability.
Nothing expressed the depth of Russian-Chechen animosity more than the battle cries hurled back and forth across the firing lines during the siege of Groznyy. To the Chechen shouts of Allah Akhbar! the Russians would respond, Christ is Risen! After Groznyy fell, Chechen forces regrouped in the rough, mountainous areas of southern Chechnya. By late February, a large Chechen force of from 1,600 and 2,500 fighters had concentrated in the town of Ulus-Kert, where the Abazolgul and Sharoargun rivers join. 
1
A Russian Airborne Forces (VDV) tactical group attacked Chechen forces at Ulus-Kert, forcing them southeast. One of the VDV tactical groups regimental task forces, based on the 104th Guards Parachute Regiment (GPR) of the 76th Guards Airborne Division (GAD), was to block the gorge while the VDV tactical group encircled the Chechens.
The small town of Ulus-Kert is surrounded by extremely steep, mountainous terrain. Approximately 6 kilometers south of the town and extending far to the southeast are the Dargenduk Mountains. A road leading generally south out of Ulus-Kert The Chechens planned to escape advancing Russian forces by using the advantage of the mountainous terrain southeast of Ulus-Kert. After slipping through the passes, the fighters could seize the strategic population centers of Makhkety, Elistanzhi, Zaduli, Kirov-Yurt and Vedeno, which provided a west-toeast corridor in relatively low, flat terrain through which remaining Chechen forces could withdraw to Dagestan. 
2
The VDV tactical groups mission was to counter the Chechen forces objectives by blocking its escape through the mountains then encircling it so artillery and combat air support could be used. Engaging infantry soldiers in direct combat was to be kept to a minimum. The plan to encircle Chechen forcesa common Russian tacticreflects the Russians desire to minimize casualties.
The First Chechen War had not been popular with the Russian populace because of the high death rate. Tension was also rife in the Russian command arrangement. Airborne forces felt they were being used as cannon fodder to reduce casualties among motorized infantry troops. Underlying this tension was the old rivalry between Russian airborne forces and ground forces. Historically, the VDV had been a separate service. Briefly in the late 1990s, it had been subordinated to ground forces. Newly appointed commander of Russian airborne forces Colonel General Georgiy Shpak had obtained a reversal of this decision and zealously guarded the VDVs independence.
Shpak streamlined the organization and obtained new missions for it, primarily in peacekeeping operations. By the time operations around Ulus-Kert were under way, the grouping of airborne forces had been subordinated to Colonel General Gennadiy N. Troshev, Commander of the Eastern Grouping of Federal Forces, who reported directly to General of the Army Viktor Kazantsev, who commanded the Operations Group, Joint Grouping of Federal Forces, in the North Caucasus. The arrangement was not a happy one; airborne forces felt they were not being properly supported. 3
The VDV tactical group was a task force based on divisional parachute regiments augmented with VDV command-level assets, such as reconnaissance subunits. The 104th GPR task force was assigned the mission of blocking Chechen escape routes east through the mountains. 104th GPR, like most Soviet/Russian parachute regiments, had three airborne battalions, an artillery battalion equipped with two S9, 120-millimeter, self-propelled guns and various support assets. Each airborne battalion had three airborne companies numbered sequentially one through nine, with the first, second and third companies composing the 1st Airborne Battalion and so on. Each 104th GPR company was augmented with reconnaissance and/or SPETSNAZ subunits from the VDV command to form company tactical groups. 
4
The Chechen force, retreating to the southeast of Ulus-Kert along a road leading over Hill 705.6 away from the main advancing body of the VDV tactical group, was looking for the first unguarded or weakly held way over the mountains. The 1,600 to 2,500 fighters wore winter camouflage and were well equipped with various small arms, grenade launchers and mortars. They were supported by a logistics train of hundreds of pack animals.
Early on 29 February, a 104th GPR airborne company encountered a significant Chechen force on the road leading southeast out of Ulus-Kert. Russian paratroopers engaged the Chechen fighters for control of Hill 705.6. The Russian company, significantly stressed during the fight, gained control of the hill and pushed the Chechen force southeast into the small gorge below. The company was most likely heavily supported by artillery and helicopters, as was the usual Russian operation in this war.
The 104th GPR commander ordered 2d Airborne Battalion elements to block the saddle between hills 776 and 787, which was the next possible path over the mountains for the Chechens. The 2d Airborne Battalion headquarters was already in place on Hill 776. The 2d Airborne Battalion element was to be in place by 1400. In the early morning, 6th Company, including the third platoon, 4th Company, and two reconnaissance groups, probably from the regimental reconnaissance platoon, started on foot toward the saddle.

The Chechens, armed with automatic weapons, grenade launchers and mortars, reacted quickly, seizing the initiative. The small force was probably followed by a combat element, which would have been consistent with Soviet-style reconnaissance doctrine that places great value on immediately seizing the initiative in any engagement by having a strong combat element close behind the advance reconnaissance ele-ment.

Early in the morning on Hill 1410, a reinforcement group of two VDV SPETSNAZ platoons, one Vympel SPETSNAZ group and two airborne companies departed on foot for the saddle. The group encountered several ambushes while traversing terrain as steep as 70 degrees. At approximately 0330, one VDV SPETSNAZ platoon broke through to Hill 787 but was forced to dig in because of stiff Chechen opposition.
The 1st Company was also sent to reinforce 6th Company. While attempting to cross the Abazolgul River northeast of Ulus-Kert, the unit encountered a Chechen ambush force of up to 60 men. Despite repeated attempts to fight through the Chechen ambush, the 1st Company was forced to dig in on the rivers bank. At 0300, during a brief lull, 2d Airborne Battalion deputy com-mander Major Aleksandr Dostovalov, with 4th Companys third platoon, broke through to the encircled company. While relief forces were being held back by ambushes, waves of Chechen fighters continued to assault 6th Company on Hill 776. 
14
While some reports question the lack of artillery and combat air support, others indicate that both where present throughout the four-day engagement. In his report to defense minister Igor Sergeyev, Shpak states that 2d Airborne Battalion was supported by a self-propelled artillery battalion of the 104th Parachute Regiment and by army aviation. 
15
Press reports also cite use of Grads122-millimeter BM-21 multiple-rocket launchers that VDV units do not have. 
16
17
At approximately 0500, the Chechens breached 6th Company defenses. Cumulative casualties and odds of at least 10 to one were too much for the dwindling Russian force. As Chechens overran Hill 776, fighting became hand-to-hand, and Chechens began shooting wounded Russians. The already wounded battalion commander took over the radio from the wounded Romanov and called in artillery fire on his own position, shouting into the radio, I call artillery on myself! 
18
As the second day of fighting closed, 6th Company counted another 26 paratroopers killed and many wounded. Counting the 31 men who had fallen the day before, 6th Company had suffered a KIA rate of almost two-thirds57 out of 90 men. 
19
The Chechens had been throwing themselves at Hill 776 to keep open a path for the rest of their force. This movement was interrupted by the arrival of the relief force from Hill 1410. Major Andrey Lobanov, commanding a 45th VDV Reconnaisance Regiment SPETSNAZ group, was with this force. He noted that hundreds of pack animals had already passed by. The Russians moved into the saddle and found 6th Companys abandoned positions and soon encountered a large Chechen group. The Russians retreated to Hill 787 from which they could cover the saddle.
The Russians intercepted the Chechen commanders desperate orders: Do not engage in battle.
Force your way forward. 
20
21
Late in the morning, the 1st Company broke through Chechen forces and reached the battle area. However, it could not relieve 6th Company, which was still under close attack. One officer and 32 men were still alive. Deputy company commander Captain Roman Sokolov had arrived in Chechnya barely 13 days before. Wounded in the hand, he organized the survivors final defense. He placed the six most junior soldiers in the care of Sergeant Andrey Proshev and ordered them to escape. Then, as the Chechens pressed the attack, Sokolov called artillery fire down on his position as a desperate attempt to fend off the enemy. Another 16 paratroopers on Hill 776 were killed in the continuing fighting. 
22
The struggle for control of Hills 776 and 787 ended on the fourth day of the fighting. The last 11 paratroopers on Hill 776 were killed. 
23
24
The Chechens won a Pyrrhic victory. Tarrying to bludgeon through 6th Company allowed VDV forces to fight through difficult terrain and Chechen ambushes to close off the main bodys escape. Most surviving Chechens were ultimately forced back into the gorge, where troops from 104th GPR took a number of prisoners.
While no 6th Company personnel surrendered or were taken prisoner, the four-day struggle resulted in the death of at least 84 VDV soldiers, including 13 officers. Even after losing its senior officers, 6th Company held its final positions against a much larger force.
Chechen casualties included approximately 400 dead. According to Krasnaya Zvezda, the official newspaper of the Russian Ministry of Defense (MOD), this figure was based on radio-intercept data, intelligence reports, eyewitnesses, local residents and captured Chechens.

27
28
The loss of 6th Company provoked an interservice exchange of recriminations. At a news conference, Shpak bluntly blamed the disaster on the Eastern Grouping of Forces commander, to whom the airborne troops had been subordinated. Shpaks subordinates added their fire: It all began back in Dagestan, when Kazantsev sent the airborne troops to their death and protected his own infantry. 
29
30
31
Kazantsev, former commander of the Grouping of Airborne Troops in Chechnya, accurately described the situation: Such heavy losses could have been avoided. Reconnaissance must be carried out more carefully. 
32
33
However much the Russian official line emphasizes the heroism of 6th Company paratroopers, the results of the official inquiry ordered by President Vladmir Putin was professionally blunt. The force was accused of slovenliness, laxity and unprofessionalism. 
34
On the positive side, 6th Company recovered and fought well against enormous odds once it moved to Hill 776 under the effective leadership of the battalion com-mander and his deputy. Other Russian airborne and SPETSNAZ forces in the area, responding to reinforce 6th Company, fought their way into the area and eventually stopped the Chechen breakout. All this occurred in enormously difficult terrain and weather conditions and against tenacious Chechen resistance. Because the Chechens are notoriously atrocity-prone, especially toward members of the more elite Russian military organizations, fighting to the death makes a necessity.
Media reports consistently indicate that no 6th Company soldiers were taken prisoner. They refused to give up their position, even while knowing they would be overrun and killed. The VDV is known as an elite force composed of soldiers with high morale, discipline and a sense of purpose. Their actions make it clear that this characterization held true. Despite glaring tactical mistakes in security and reconnaissance, the Russian airborne spirit successfully imbued its men with the morale and courage that come with pride of corps.
Despite the bad publicity surrounding the casualty figures in this battle, the Russian Army achieved an important victory. By holding Hill 776 long enough for additional VDV troops to fill the area, 6th Company defeated the Chechen strategy to break out of the mountains and regain the initiative. Chechen fighters, seeing they could not break through Russian lines, were forced to scale back their objectives. Instead of employing relatively large groups against vulnerable population centers, Chechen leaders realized they had to break up into smaller formations to wage war at a much lower level.
But, this was an expensive Russian victory. Russian blood and valor had to make up for the deficit in basic combat skills, an issue larger than one small-unit leadership failure. The entire Russian force has suffered too many similar catastrophies for the fate of 6th Company to be just a tragic exception. Still, there was significant improvement in battlefield performance between the First and Second Chechen Wars, although performance levels still remained low, ALMANAC which reflected how bad things had become. The failure of an elite force such as the Russian airborne shows how fragile and perishable such skills are.
The battle of Ulus-Kert was quickly enshrined in heroic myth, its theme loudly echoed by Russian media, the Ministry of Defense and the airborne forces themselves. This reflects popular support for the war and the military and a renewal of Russian nationalism. It also served to distract public attention from manifest failures the catstrophe revealed. Certainly the results of the official inquiry commissioned by Putin will never be made public. Nonetheless, he issued a decree decorating all of the fallen paratroopers, with all 13 officers and nine enlisted men receiving Russias highest medalHero of the Russian Federation. 
35
Speaking at the funeral, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev stated, This battle for a nameless height was the turning point of the entire Chechen campaign. It was a do-or-die crisis for the fallen, and they chose to follow the paths of their ancestors in similar desperate straits. Just such decisions were made by Russian servicemen on Kulikovo Field, on Lake Chud, at Borodino and at Sevastopol. In the winter of 1941 Panfilovs legendary heroes defended the last line with their lives on the approaches of Moscow. Nowadays the Argun Gorge has been just such a line for the Guards paratroopers.

As the Department of Defense (DOD) struggles to keep up with ebusiness, e-tailing, e-everything, it does so not to be in vogue but to achieve a definite national-security goal. That goal remains consistent from one major defense review to the nextreduce the costs of nonwarfighting tasks, and apply the savings to the acquisition of new weapons systems. 
1
Traditionally, e-commerce helps suppliers sell directly to consumers and develops ongoing trade relationships at the speed of cyberspace, cutting costs to middlemen. As the online marketplace has become commonplace, military leaders have capitalized on the lessons of industry and have purposefully charted an e-conomic e-commerce course.
Electronic commerce holds many rewards.

The Promise of e-Commerce to Defense: The Road to Savings J. Michael Brower
help counter Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos prophecy: It will turn out in the long term that the US is the worst country for e-commerce. 
4
DODs commitment to e-commerce principles began in earnest with the May 1998 Defense Reform Initiative Directives. The Joint Electronic Commerce Program Office (JECPO) was to navigate DODs transition to e-commerce. 
5
In fiscal year (FY) 2000, the e-mall contained nearly 5 million items and processed $78.8 million of transactions. JECPOs goal for FY 2001 is to have 12 million items in the e-mall to generate as much as $143 million. 
6
In countenancing future logistic operations, DOD must cut administrative costs and improve efficiency in the acquisition arena. Sadly, neither acquisition policy nor legislation can match the speed of change associated with the technology they would regulate. Consequently, acquisition reformthe DOD watch phrase during the 1990shas not resulted in predicted savings (approximately $60 billion) to apply toward acquiring new weapons systems. 7
To help make up the shortfall, ecommerce shepherded procurement purchase using reverse auctioning and smart cards. With reverse auctioning, all potential vendors can see the price for goods and services, thereby driving the price down. The reverse-auction process produces the best price when all merchants can see DODs bottom-line costs.
Smaller companies join the process by using the Internet to conduct business and by adopting estandards like Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Universal Description, Discovery and Integration (UDDI). Potential suppliers can register quickly, and technology they already have is leveraged to help cut their bottom lines, which allows them to compete against larger firms.
Competition helps DOD find the best deals. For instance, the Navy is busily reengineering its procurement precepts, including the cultural change of delegating to the lowest level. The Navys Fleet Martial Supply Office, with the mission of providing IT for Naval Supply Systems Command, has partnered with Razorfish Incorporated to put buying decisions at the lowest tier. 
8
The DOD Purchase Card Program has also produced savings. By FY 2000, DOD had met its goal to have 90 percent of all DOD purchases under $2,500 made with government purchase cards. JECPO provides the infrastructure to support information exchange among credit card companies and DOD financial systems.
Before the advent of purchase cards, buying supplies and services was labor-, paper-and bureaucracyintensive. As of September 2000, more than 10 million purchase card transactions had been made$5.5 billion worth.
E-commerce capitalizes on buying power that DOD already has and is an excellent counterweight to effects of personnel and resource austerity that characterized much of DOD during the 1990s. E-commerce has proved its viability and pays for itself in savings.
As though by design, but generally because market mechanisms are functioning in the new economy much as they did in the old, DOD is using e-commerce to offset the pain of 1990s budget stagnation. With potential savings so immediate and immense, e-commerce will continue to grow, to the benefit of private economy and national security.
When are contracting personnel, public and private alike, ready to adopt an e-commerce strategy? Generally, the following factors must be determined before bottling and tossing the e-procurement message into the cybersea:
l Are costs for technology and associated hardware and software low, particularly for access to e-commerce design kits?
l Are usable applications and hardware for end-users and procurement personnel available?
l Are standards promulgated and consistent, particularly in terms of the application of cross-communication?
l Do e-commerce transactions have measurable utility, convenience and value-added?
l Will transactions be secure?
l Will e-commerce transaction have minimal legal and policy constraints? l To fully man warfighting units. l To provide for the well-being of soldiers, civilians and family members.

The Armys business is to fight and win wars. However, it is involved in many other activities. In 1997, Assistant Secretary of Defense John T. White, addressing the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Board, stated, We are at a pivotal point in history where the Cold War recedes . . . and a new century rushes toward us.

Since 1994 the Commission on Service Roles and Missions has continually targeted US Army Air Defense Artillery (ADA) for budget and personnel cuts. The dogmatic Short-Range Air Defense in Army Divisions: Do We Really Need It? objectives of reducing the size of Army divisions and enhancing strategic mobility while maintaining lethality and survivability attracts the force-structure scalpel Army senior leaders wave toward mission areas such as short-range air defense (SHORAD) forces. The question is, should SHORAD be in an Army division? Do the threat and existing joint capabilities suggest the need to keep the air defense battalion in division warfighting formations?
Why do we have air defense artillery in Army divisions? The last hostile aircraft shot down by US ground-based air-defense forces was in 1950 when the 507th Automatic Weapons Battalion shot down two of four hostile North Korean planes. Antiaircraft guns and US Air Force (USAF) fighters quickly neutralized the Korean air threat.

As well as preparing for two nearly simultaneous major theater wars, the Army faces significant increases in other activities, ranging from humanitarian and relief operations to major deployments. The US military has deterred aggression in the Arabian Gulf, restored democracy in Haiti and stopped war in Bosnia. The armistice is stable on the Korean peninsula, and the Yugoslavian army has withdrawn from Kosovo. 
13
During Operation Desert Storm, 97 soldiers were killed in action. The US public has come to expect such low casualty rates, but leaders of rogue nations, failing states and terrorist gangs are not overly concerned with casualties. They watched US forces pull out of Somalia and Beirut because of unexpected casualties and realized that the most direct way to deter the US military force was to increase the probable casualty rate.
In 1992 the National Research Council identified advanced technologies that most likely would be used against the United States in the 21st century. Adversaries would:
l Use improved methods for delivering chemical and biological warfare agents.
l Use low-flying cruise missiles. l Use advanced tactical ballistic missiles capable of surmounting US defenses.
l Attack initially deploying US forces before US heavy forces can support them. 
14
The US militarys ability to anticipate the threat and react accordingly with the appropriate technology is not always first rate. Since 1980, ballistic missiles have been used in six regional conflicts. 
15
16
If hostile states and nonstate actors learn from the past, they will never permit US forces to freely establish a lodgment in the area of operations or a safe haven in a nearby country. Their objective will likely be to strike quickly with an array of air and missile threats aimed at forwarddeployed US forces. If that fails to sway US public opinion, they will consider WMD use. The best time to execute such actions would be when the United States is already entangled in Kosovo-or Bosniantype commitments.
Predicting what capability a potential enemy might employ is always controversial. Such an endeavors difficulty is revealed by the fact that the Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency seldom present a consensus, given a global weapons market, parallel technology and decreasing costs associated with high-tech digital systems. A common fallacy is to interpret no peer threat as no threat. 
18
19
The National Air Intelligence Center maintains that ballistic and cruise missiles are a significant threat to deployed US and allied forces. Cruise missiles have great standoff as unmanned, armed aircraft that can be launched from another aircraft, ship, submarine, or groundbased launcher to attack ships . . . or ground-based targets. 
20
Because LACMs are difficult to detect, track and intercept, air defense systems will be stressed. Cruise missiles are smaller than aircraft and, depending on terrain, can fly below radar coverage. For example, ground-based radar can detect an aircraft flying at 10,000 feet over 150 miles away. Because of the earths curvature, the same groundbased radar cannot detect a low-flying cruise missile outside 20 miles. 
21
22
One can easily debate how the array of theater missiles and manned fixed-and rotary-wing aircraft can be used in a given contingency. With the growing costs required to maintain aircraft and train pilots, UAVs and LACMs are attractive yet effective aerial platforms. This does not suggest that manned aircraft will be cut from a potential threats arsenal. Manned aircraft might not increase in numbers, but they will improve in sophistication.
The credibility of US ground-toair and air-to-air defensive capabilities will be challenged. Applying attack or strike operations against short-dwell and fixed-launch platforms, supply points and command and control (C 2 ) facilities could reduce or modify the use of theater missiles and other aerial platforms. However, since Operation Desert Storm, US efforts have improved attack operations only slightly.
With UAVs and cruise missiles requiring smaller operational and logistic footprints than ballistic missiles, the possibility of interdicting such targets is remote. The future threat will economically gain operational and strategic advantages by using an array of theater missiles.
In July 1996, JV2010 was issued to provide a conceptual framework within which the US Armed Forces can view and prepare for the future. It also provides a blueprint with which to leverage military forces and achieve effectiveness in joint operations. Its intent is to provide direction to achieve joint, full-spectrum dominance through four operational concepts: full-dimensional protection, dominant maneuver, focused logistics and precision engagement. 
23
24
25
To achieve dominant maneuver and precision engagement, commanders must have freedom of action. Freedom of action suggests full-dimensional protection, including protection from asymmetric threats, across all phases of an operation. A multilayered defense against a range of threats requires offensive and defensive actions such as theater-missile defense and defensive counter-air operations.
Stretching military resources over numerous missions throughout the world creates situations in which the US might not be able to maintain air superiority. Fighters must be in the area of concern to intercept low-flying cruise missilesafter receiving ample early warning and positive identification. The smaller the radar cross-sections of cruise missiles and UAVs, the more challenging acquisition and combat identification are for the pilot. This problem is further exacerbated by issues such as the availability of sufficient airframes for offensive and defensive missions, tankers for refueling operations, C 2 platforms and safe havens from ground and aerial threats.
The capabilities of all services systems vary according to each aerial targets abilities. However, given a rapid-response requirement, initial-entry forces will rely on SHORAD to achieve full-dimensional protection. Also, as operations become more nonlinear, forces will be isolated and subjected to a host of aerial threats. These threats have lower radar cross-sections, are extremely maneuverable, require less logistics than manned airframes and are extremely difficult to destroy on the ground. SHORAD is easier to introduce into the theater, costs less and can be maneuvered with ground forces.
Current SHORAD force structure includes a ground-based sensor, a C 2 architecture and three platforms that fire surface-to-air Stingers. This system of systems engages the air battle with a 24-hour, all-weather radar that can detect low-radar crosssection aerial targets and near-real time automated C 2 architecture that provides situational awareness to joint and combined forces. The C 2 system integrates horizontal and vertical air defense weapons, thereby enhancing situational awareness and reducing fratricide. Stingers fired by individual soldiers or from wheeled or track vehicles can provide 24hour, shoot-on-the-move, mobile protection for maneuver forces. 
26
SHORAD relies on identification, friend or foe (IFF) or visual identification and does not include an uncooperative target-recognition capability. In 1995, the Office of the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation maintained that FAAD C3I and GBS were operationally suitable. However, without enhanced combat identification, FAAD C3I might be useful only in a self-defense role. 
27
In 1996, DOD created the Joint Theater Air and Missile Defense Organization (JTAMDO) to improve joint air and missile defense and to coordinate all DOD theater air and missile defense activities. 
28
JTAMDO also revealed a joint air and missile defense system of systems that lacked a timely air picture and a universal combat identification capability. 
29
The JTAMDO master plan included a single integrated air picture (SIAP) that would allow participating units to observe the same digital air battle. Engagement coordination drastically improves when all services see only one track for every airborne object. A complete, common and accurate air picture enables a distributed fire control that can use remote data to engage a target. 
30
The next major hurdle is to develop an integrated fire-control capability to allow weapons to fire using data another service sensor provides. This fire-control net would reduce the effects of terrain on ground-and sea-based sensors and allow engagements against low-flying, low-radar-cross-section targets. Cruise missile and UAV defense lacks a common air picture, a reliable combat identification (CID) system and adequate airborne platforms to be able to see low-flying threats. By 2010, SIAP benefits, CID and integrated fire control will provide early, long-range detection, continuous tracking, long-range engagements, 360-degree capability and tactical flexibility supported by less-restrictive rules of engagement.
Of all the joint air and missile defense systems, SHORAD has the most advanced C 2 and reliability regarding a common air picture. SHORAD will significantly benefit INSIGHTS from improvements in CID and SIAP because SHORAD already fuses joint sensors within the internal ground-based-sensor net. SHOR-ADs shortfall will remain missile range and the inability to engage short-range ballistic missiles.
Future threats will include ballistic and cruise missiles and UAVs. Equipped with WMD, these threats will need to be engaged at ranges beyond the existing Stinger capabilities. Currently, force developers are examining ways to engage beyond 20 kilometers. Additional experiments are being conducted on a suitable, reliable and survivable airborne sensor for both acquisition and fire control.
JV2010 goals and the operational concepts leading to full-spectrum dominance are at risk. The Air Force cannot be all things for the joint force commander. Its decreasing force structure will challenge its ability to perform defensive and offensive air missions. Full-dimension protection and dominant maneuver is a difficult task when the enemy can leverage cruise and ballistic missiles and UAVs against forward-deployed formations, C 2 facilities, safe havens and logistics bases.
Shinsekis vision to be on the ground quickly with a relevant combat force requires deploying air and missile defense protection. The Patriot force is heavy and requires an investment of strategic lift. As ground forces move to forward operating bases, air and missile protection should move forward also. SHORAD can provide this protection. Its force structure is suitable for use against cruise missiles, UAVs and fixed-and rotary-wing threats. However, as unmanned threats be-come more lethal, a longer-range system is necessary.
The Stinger is a reliable missile for manned aircraft, but it lacks the range and lethality to counter more sophisticated airborne threats. A mobile, ground-based system with 360-degree coverage against all aerial threats would be an appropriate follow-on system, which could be linked to an elevated sensor to gain over-the-horizon engagements. Also, the system should be able to engage short-range ballistic missiles and rocket artillery.
Continued research and development on laser technology will eventually produce a lightweight, lethal, ground-based laser capable of providing multiple inexpensive engagements against all aerial threats. When the SHORAD force brings antirocket capability to the maneuver formation, its relevance will never again be questioned.
Full-spectrum dominance requires force protection against all aerial threats. Responsive, mobile, lethal formations projected on hostile terrain will need air and missile defense to guarantee freedom of maneuver. Maintaining the air defense battalion in Army divisions must be a priority when assessing the Armys force structure for the 21st century.
All US intelligence projections suggest that the future threat to forward-deployed forces will not come from an armored vehicles main gun, but from the air. For over 50 years the United States has not been truly tested from the air, and assessments of current capability point out weaknesses in the US Armed Forces ability to perform joint air and missile defense.
The proliferation of unmanned platforms, commercial satellite imagery and precision navigation will change the nature of future wars, which are as likely to be waged in cities as on open plains and deserts. In future wars, enemy C 2 facilities might collocate with hospitals and schools.
Aerial platforms such as cruise missiles, ballistic missiles, rockets and unmanned aerial platforms will be projected into the sky from mobile launchers cloaked from aerial detection. UAVs, sending real-time information to enemy forces equipped with rocket artillery and short-range, precision ballistic missiles will target soldiers and equipment. Ports and air bases abroad will be untenable because of attacks or threats of attack, and the US Navy will be forced away from brown water by mines and low-tech submarines denying deployed forces the Navys theater ballistic-missile protection and fighter support.
Patriot forces will be overtasked protecting ports and coalition population centers, and the enemy will use dummy aerial threats to deplete Patriot and theater high-altitude air defense missile inventories. Last, the threatened use of WMD on allied nations might deny US entry and use of ports, air bases and safe havens.
Cutting air defense out of the Army division and relinquishing aerial protection of forward-deployed forces to the Air Force would generate casualties in future wars that would far exceed US tolerance. The argument that air defense has not shot down an aircraft since the Korean War and that US air forces are the best in the world would not comfort the families of US casualties.
Change on the horizon requires tough decisions about force structure and traditional roles and missions. As the relevance of air defense in the division is debated, Army leaders must consider aerial threats and the protection of forward-deployed soldiers. If this account is to be believed, and there is no reason to doubt it, US foreign policy was determined more by timing and the ebb and flow of events than by planning. Policies succeeded or failed because of external events neither side controlled. The Carter administration succeeded in normalizing relations with China but not because its officials were any smarter than their predecessors were but because Carters tenure coincided with Deng Xiaopings rise to power. Brzezinski is presented as a fierce bureaucratic warrior and dissembler eager to negotiate an agreement that put a premium on deception and ambiguity. These diplomatic attributes allowed Chinese and US negotiators to disagree while publicly insisting they agreed.
One is left to wonder at the bureaucratic maneuvering in the several presidential administrations, but to recoil in horror or total disbelief would be a sterile, self-defeating reaction. Instead, one should remember that the power struggle in Washington was minor-league when compared to the power struggle occurring in Beijing, where the personal stakes were much higher.
If US policy makers did not display the naked self-interest they did and were not the ruthless bureaucratic warriors they were, how could they have hoped to deal with the Chinese? In the end, success went to those with the most developed, focused, aggressive self-interest. Tyler emphasizes that distinctions in US China policy are not between Republicans and Democrats or liberals and conservatives; they are between those who had the rigorous self-discipline to look at Sino-American relations the way they were evolving and those deluded by preconceptions.
Tyler presents President Bill Clinton as an unfocused president who ignored his foreign policy, national security and intelligence advisers. He created a China policy that con-centrated on human rights. While trendy and fashionable, it was not sensible. Abandoned as unworkable, its epitaph was uttered in 1993 by US Ambassador to China J. Stapleton Roy: If you look at the last 150 years since the Opium Wars, then you cant avoid the conclusion that the last 15 years have been the best 15 years in Chinas modern history, and of those 15 years the last 2 years are the best in terms of prosperity, individual choice, access to outside sources of information, freedom of movement within the country and stable domestic conditions. When reporters asked Roy whether China could satisfy Clintons demands for improved human rights, he said he did not know because the administration had never defined what it meant by significant progress.
In Clintons defense, it must be added that he eventually moved back toward a more realistic China policy. But, according to Tyler, Clinton remained inattentive toward Chinese Premier Zhu Rongjis overtures for a compromise on outstanding issues that were preventing China from entering the World Trade Organization. This inattention, plus foreign policy initiatives created solely to satisfy internal political constituencies, was the primary characteristic of the Clinton administrations China policy.
The Taiwan issue has long been an irritant. China and the United States have consistently underestimated Taiwans strategic importance to the other. Tyler reveals that each thought the other would compromise over this secondary issue. However, neither has fundamentally changed its position. In fact, the United States and China now find themselves in a position where Taiwan controls both countries policies.
It would be tempting to attribute the US position solely to the Republican right and the Taiwan lobbyas the Chinese Communists doand Chinas position on Taiwan to emotional nationalismas some Americans do. The reality is more and less complicated. China believes its national security depends on possessing the island. The United States believes its position in Asia depends on brokering a peaceful resolution to the problem. Events since 1972 have aggravated and combined these strategic dilemmas. As Tyler shows, inattention combined with realpolitik could lead to a war born out of miscalculation.
Major John A. Nagl, US Army Although the post-Cold War world has changed the nature of conflict, many argue that the US military cannot adapt quickly enough. The military is one-third smaller than it was in 1990, and its budget is about 30 percent lower. It now faces a shortfall significant enough to be described as a coming train wreck.
The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the Department of Defense (DOD) requires an additional $30 to $50 billion a year to maintain current force structure without any additional spending on National Missile Defense, which is President George W. Bushs top defense priority. Yet, there is little sup-port for a larger defense budget. Train wreck might be too gentle a description of the crisis the military now faces.

Cindy Williams, who until recently led the National Security Division of the Congressional Budget Office, is the books editor. She is not afraid to take on the defense establishments sacred cows. Her January 2000 Washington Post opinion piece, Our GIs Earn Enough, caused a firestorm. 9 But, this is not a book written by liberals or crackpots. The authors are highly respected security professionals who do not believe that the US Armed Forces have adapted to the sort of challenges they will likely face.
The authors are not decisionmakers but advise congressmen on defense budget decisions. They argue that it makes no sense to revert to Cold War levels of defense spending [when] threats to national security are as low as they are today, particularly when the United States is marching into the new century with forces designed for the old one.

The current allocation of resources among the services has remained amazingly steady for the past 35 years25 percent for the Army, 31 percent for the Navy and 25 percent for the Air Force. This allocation might no longer be appropriate in the post-Cold War world. Owen Cote, Karl Mueller and James Quinlivan suggest strategies and force structures that place more emphasis on Navy, Air Force and Army contributions to future US security needs. Their recommendations demand attention.
In Buying From the Sea . . . , Cote suggests that the major theater wars of the future are likely to occur along the worlds littorals and that future US access to ports and airfields is likely to diminish. This would require more emphasis on the Navys ability to operate without fixed bases overseas. He argues that Violence that ends without reconciliation will not lead to permanent peace. Religious organizations, rooted in local traditions and culture, offer the greatest hope for reconciliation between warring factions. The pivotal roles for external organizations are identifying the credible religious organizations and training them as national mediators in conflict transformation and reconciliation.
Reconciliation is the end point of a process of finding facts, identifying perpetrators, paying reparations, healing memories and offering and accepting forgiveness. Religious activists are committed to peace and reconciliation with enemies. Religious extremists are committed to reconciliations defeat by any means.
In The Ambivalence of the Sacred, B. Scott Appleby expands the definitions associated with religious organizations and clarifies the roles they play in national politics, conflict and peace. Because they are already part of the community, religious organizations have great credibility and legitimacy in conflict transformation. Their roles in reconciliation include conflict resolution, conflict management and structural reformation. But, they also must translate the religious language of reconciliation into a human-rights discourse and a broad picture of hope and peace that appeal to all sides. Appleby thoroughly supports his thesis. He establishes clear definitions, argues powerfully for reconciliation and clearly delineates the legitimacy that religious activists who pursue it already enjoy.
Military professionals work with crises around the globe, including those that involve centuries of conflict. Interposing armed forces between factions will not solve the conflict. Military professionals must address root causes and move toward a vision of the future. While military professionals will never have the credibility to foster reconciliation that community-based religious organizations have, they can facilitate the process. Therefore, they should understand how vital reconciliation is, how it occurs and which actors might best bring it about.
MAJ In Latin America La Patria means more than ones country. It encompasses a community, a culture, a territory and, most of all, a spiritual principle. For Latin American militaries, service to La Patria is more than defending the nation against all external and internal threats. They view their roles to be above changing threats and enemies. They are the ultimate defendersthe essence of La Patriawilling to take whatever action is needed to protect their land.
In For La Patria, Brian Loveman builds a strong case for this interpretation of Latin American armed forces. His systematic use of history is far more rigorous than any anecdotal evidence. From his discussion of Iberian colonial influence, through European and North American influences in the 19th and 20th centuries, he tells the logical story of this developing mindset. Lovemans followon discussion applying this idea to the 21st-century world environment is noteworthy. There is no reason to think that this driving reason for being will change among Latin American armed forces. It will, however, continue to develop in new ways as new missions appear. And, in whatever actions arise, Latin American armed forces will assuredly go for-ward for La Patria.
The book is worthwhile for research value alone. It has a comprehensive bibliography of more than 500 works, yet it remains enjoyable and easy to read. It is a must for anyone having dealings with Latin American militaries. In Stonewall Jackson: A Life Portrait, K.M. Kostyal takes a fresh look at the legendary Confederate lieutenant general. Drawing from archival and period photographs and illustrations, and supporting them with an easy-to-read, understandable text, Kostyal assembles Jacksons life portrait. Jackson was careless in appearance, eccentric in habits, devout in religion and cause and heroic in battle. Jacksonthe man and legendlooms large through the magnifying glass of history.
Although Civil War scholars will find little that is new, this deeply moving collection of Jackson imagery honors the memory of a great military mind. No one with an interest in Jackson or the Civil War can David C. Jordans Drug Politics comprehensively treats the troubling connections between the global narcotics industry and power centers in national and international politics. Jordan asserts that narcotraffickers core strength is the ability to subvert legitimate organs of state power within target societies. That ability, coupled with the globalization of capital markets and organized crime, makes narcotrafficking the worlds most influential and pervasive criminal enterprise.
Jordan sees current counternarcotics policy as predestined to fail. Policymakers ignore the fundamental character of the illegal narcotics industry, preferring to apply a simplistic, liberal, economic template to what is a more comprehensive sociopolitical problem. Conventional counternarcotics strategy relies narrowly on limiting the supply and demand of illicit narcotics. In doing so, policymakers ignore the roots that narcotraffickers weave into the social, political and financial structures of producer and client societies.
Jordan points out the fallacies in prevailing assumptions, which range from the centrality of supply and demand to the perceived certainty that official and unofficial forces within societies are committed antidrug activists. Competing and winning against these assumptions are four principle advantages narcotraffickers leverage to their benefit: the development of anarchy, the globalization and politicization of organized crime, the globalization of international finance, and the potential of narcotics trafficking as an instrument of state power.
While essential and relevant, this book is difficult to read. Many of the most important facts are hidden within wider political theory. But, Jordons message is essential in the current operational environment. He underscores the critical and comprehensive security threat that narcotrafficking poses. He also outlines a way allied and US policymakers could move forward. Credit Mark A. Stokes for providing an alternative view to the conventional portrayal of the Peoples Republic of China Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) as a backward continental force. Stokes posits that the PLA is poised to make significant progress in its long-range precision strike capabilities and aerospace defense, primarily backed by the quest for information dominance. The United States must not underestimate Chinas ability to make revolutionary breakthroughs in areas key to achieving its goals.
Stokes supports his thesis with substantive evidence and sound reasoning. His extensive investigation traces Chinas technological developments in indigenous defense industries that point toward an aggressive quest for information dominance, credible long-range precision strike capabilities and aerospace defense.
Stokes argues that Chinas quest for strategic modernization is driven by its emerging doctrine, which emphasizes strategic attack against the most critical enemy targets. Much of this has been influenced by Chinas Gulf War Syndrome caused by the enormous US success, at least at operational and tactical levels, which has awakened Chinese leaders to the preeminence of air power, longrange precision strike and information-based warfare.
Stokes extensively cites Chinese sources that cover PLA military space and directed-energy weapon development. He also supports claims with his experience as the assistant air attaché in Beijing from 1992 to 1995. He provides a balanced analysis and refrains from painting too rosy a picture of Chinas modernization effort. He points out the obstacles that could complicate Chinas ability to modernize the PLA, including budgetary constraints, technological overloads and the difficulties of integrating systems acquired from different sources.
Perhaps Stokess greatest contribution is his illumination of a possible blind spot in conventional analysis of the PLA. By highlighting the PLAs strategic modernization, which is often overlooked, Stokes warns that the PLA is a significant force. Still, he cautions against overreaction.
While providing evidence of PLAs strategic modernization, Stokes falls short of qualitatively assessing how well the US military can counter such capability, particularly if both sides square off over Taiwan. Overall, Stokess well-supported, extensively documented and balanced study contributes a significant new facet to the analysis of the PLAs capabilities.  The essays regional and countryspecific writers showcase changes in European foreign-policy attitudes since the end of the Cold War. Although many of the essayists point to economics as key to the emerging strategic environment, their unwillingness to see economic globalization by way of China, Japan and the rest of Asia is mystifying considering the current economic power and potential of those countries. Still, by focusing on countries linked by history and land mass, the writers offer provocative, useful alternatives to some of the worlds most vexing problems.
The book also gives military professionals the opportunity to peer into the soul of a true strategic thinkerMurray himself. His 23page introduction weaves history and philosophy into a conclusion that is both interesting and important. He closes with a too-short afterword that attempts to answer the questions of why we do what we do in the military and how the 21st century might change this.
A historian of the highest order, Murray clearly believes the art of looking back is key to looking forward. He uses industrialist Henry Fords history is bunk quote then smashes it with intellectual prose, which convinces me that Ford might have known cars but not history. In The Secret War Against Hanoia superb history of US operations against North VietnamRichard H. Shultz Jr. provides the first comprehensive look at this extensive adjunct to the Vietnam War. The actions and activities chronicled constitute the largest, most complex US covert operation since World War II. Shultzs research is supported by recently declassified top-secret documents. He also interviewed senior government policymakers and those actually involved in the operations.
The organization was established in Saigon to plan and conduct secret operations under its cover name the Studies and Observations Group (SOG). Its membership included representatives from all the services and the CIA. SOG evolved from President John F. Kennedys dissatisfaction with the CIAs guerrilla operations against North Vietnam. He gave the responsibility to the Department of Defense, where SOG operated under the direction of the Pentagons Special Operations Group.
SOG had four core missions: training and inserting agent teams and deception programs; conducting psychological warfare; maintaining maritime operations against the North Vietnamese coast; and disrupting activities along the Ho Chi Minh Trail. How these core missions were planned, supported and carried out constitutes the heart of the book.
The secondary storylessons for the futureinvolves the politics of how SOG was directed and used; the restrictions under which it operated; its manning; and military attitudes toward these types of operations, particularly the Armys. These lessons provide valuable guidelines for how not to do things in the future.
This book publicly acknowledges For a conflict that lasted only four years and occurred 135 years ago, the American Civil War has spawned a publication industry. Terry J. Winschels Vicksburg: Fall of the Confederate Gibraltar, is another welcomed addition, although I rate his book as a good text for a beginner or novice.
Winschel does an excellent job of covering a major campaign with just enough detail to make sense, but several points will raise military readers antennae. Winschel identifies only two of three levels of warthe tactical and strategic. The intermediate, operational level is post-Vietnam US military vocabulary taxonomy. In this book it would have been useful to differentiate it from the strategic level to provide an understanding of how Union General Ulysses S. Grant developed his plan in complementary stages.
One glaring inaccuracy is Winschels discussion of the 13th Infantry shoulder patch. The designation First at Vicksburg is an honor, although I consider this dubious because the unit was repulsed! It is not worn on any US Army patch. The 13th Infantry has not been a separate regimental organization for well over 50 years and even then it was not worn as a regimental shoulder patch. The slogan is located on the regimental colors, as is the custom of regimental mottoes, and it is also located on the distinctive unit insignia.
Another oddity is that Winschel cites Grants turning movement from Port Gibson to Vicksburg as having often been referred to as the blitzkrieg of the Vicksburg campaign. I am relatively well versed on the campaign and have only seen the phrase used oncein this book. I do not disagree that the term is a good descriptor, but I believe Winschel is the first to use it.
Also, the description of locating the USS Cairo fails to credit the major contributor to the effortWarren Graubau. Graubau, a retired US Army Corps of Engineer civilian employee in the Vicksburg district, has been long overlooked and neglected for his substantial contributions to the discovery of the Cairo.
On the plus side, the books maps are fully sufficient for a general understanding of events, and for those who are beginning a study of the Vicksburg Campaign, this is a great primer. I also highly recommend it to students who are planning to visit Vicksburg. The Arrow War is an important event in 19th century Anglo-Chinese relations, but scholars have never placed it in a satisfactory historical framework. Most view it as a part of the attempt to force China to accept Western norms in foreign relations. Marxists interpret the war according to the evil nature and innate rapacity of Western imperialism. This interpretation fits nicely into Chinese preconceptions and emphasizes the differences between a culture steeped in the rule of law and one steeped in the rule of virtue.
If a historian should read documents until he can hear the people speak, J.Y. Wong has been reading and listening. In this lengthy, wellwritten, revisionist work he explores some of the reasons nations go to war and describes imperialism in a specific context from multiple viewpoints. Long used as an epithet, few have attempted to depict imperialism as a historical phenomenon in specific contexts. Drawing on years of research, Wong places this small war in its British, Indian and Chinese context, highlighting mutual misunderstanding, arrogance and xenophobia.
Wong chronologically narrates events then analyzes issues. He places primary responsibility for the wars outbreak directly on British consul Harry Parkes and Sir John Bowring, the plenipotentiary in Hong Kong. Chinese obduracy on diplomatic representation in Beijing maddened the British government. Yet, this was only one issue connected with upholding British imperial prosperity and expansion. The war connected domestic politics to the politics of opium, cotton and teathe pillars of British prosperity.
Wong shows how the British prepared an alliance against China before the Arrow incident and how the need to safeguard diplomatic, strategic and economic power led to a series of wars against the Chinese, Sikhs, Russians and army mutineers in India. He restores the wars role as an equilibrium mechanism, believing that while economic and political questions are important, Great Power political conflicts are fundamentally about power.
In the mid-19th century, British imperial power rested on Indian revenues, which depended on revenue from the opium monopoly. Part of Britains economic problems, which many scholars trace solely to domestic causes, might have come from the post-1885 growth of Chinese opium production and its deleterious effect on Indian revenue. Everyone who wants to understand the connections between internal politics, diplomacy, strategy and economics should read this book.
The ability of major US networks to report significant events fairly, accurately and objectively is a topic of great debate. This is especially true for reports pertaining to national defense and security. Given the role of evening newscasts as principle conveyors of information, watchdogs and interpreters of government policies, how accurately do they present defense and security issues to the public they serve? Do they present these issues in the proper context without distorting or omitting facts? Stephen D. Aubin says, No.

General Dwight D. Eisenhower has long been a favorite of biographers. He is perceived as a hero and a good president. Geoffrey Perret does Eisenhower justice without succumbing entirely to the legend.
Eisenhower certainly achieved legendary status in his own lifetime, but not without critics. Some men who are perceived as great during 
In GPS Vulnerabilities by LTC Thomas K. Adams (Military Review, March-April 2001), the last sentence on page 11 should read: Since the FAA also intends to broadcast GPS correction via geostationary satellites, worldwide airlines will likely take advantage of this highly accurate system for normal en route navigation, collision avoidance and airport ground navigation. Also, the USAF does not invest $600 million annually for commercial tracking purposes; it maintains the GPS that private firms use. MR regrets any confusion. Aubin attributes the high percentage of shortcomings to the medias narrow focus on scandals, corruption and other sensational stories about the misuse of government funds. These shortcomings were noted throughout the presidencies of Ronald Reagan and George Bush. Networks told of the government buying expensive, sophisticated weapons that did not work; kickbacks between defense companies and part suppliers; and significant increases in costs during weapons systems development because of mismanagement and improper charges. Networks seldom addressed the defense budget in terms of procurement; operations and personnel costs; capabilities of new weapons systems and technology to support military strategy; and the acquisition and development processes that define how the government buys new weapons and how industry produces them.
Reasons why networks fall short when covering such issues include correspondents lack of knowledge and the need for brevity. Other problems include lack of balance, overemphasis on drama or bad news, loaded labeling or advocacy and bad news judgment. Aubin recommends that networks remedy the situation by giving greater attention to specialists, such as Pentagon correspondents, and avoiding using abbreviated reports by anchorpersons.
At times, Aubin voices a strong personal opinion on investigated issues rather than allowing his welldocumented results to do the convincing. However, the book clearly authenticates the problematic coverage of defense and security news.

July-August 2001 l MILITARY REVIEW the Navy does not need more ships to accomplish its missions but should use existing nuclear missile submarines to carry conventional guided missiles. Cote would free up defense dollars for the conversion by canceling the F-22, Comanche and Crusader and by eliminating the 82d Airborne Division, the 101st Air Assault Division, 18th Airborne Corps Headquarters, all eight Army National Guard divisions, and one National Guard and two Active Component (AC) F-16 wings. He would also convert the 10th Mountain and 25th Infantry into interim brigade combat teams (IBCTs). He says that light Army divisions, and the airborne and air assault divisions in particular, make no sense in either the near or the longer term security environment.

Quinlivan would keep the Comanche but eliminate the Crusadersomething on which all the authors agree. He feels that DOD could save more money by eliminating two aircraft carriers. Quinlivans argument is based largely on the assumption that the United States will continue to engage in smaller-scale contingencies with boots on the ground. These missions, which the Army accepts unenthusiastically, are the only hope the Armys advocate can find for preserving Army force structure in the 21st century.
The book concludes with a summary of each authors conclusions. Noting that the current two-majortheater-wars (MTW) strategy is not producing the capabilities needed for the challenges that the military faces [and will continue to face] in the future, Williams argues that such a strategy no longer makes sense.

Christmas this most decidedly is not. But, readers who believe that President George W. Bushs administration is unlikely to heed these recommendations have not studied budget realities or the lessons of history. Traditionally, Republican presidents have been fiscal conservatives unwilling to spend large sums on defense. In fact, during the early 1950s, Army Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway resigned in protest at President and former General Dwight D. Eisenhowers cuts in the Armys force structure under the New Look defense policy.

Ordering JFQ their lifetimes fade in reputation once they pass from the scene. Others grow in stature. Eisenhowers fame has passed through these stages. He was a respected general, beloved president and a leader in crisis. He was esteemed as a military hero but reviled by scholars. Not surprisingly, there are few objective views of Eisenhower.
Perrets Eisenhower emerges as a real man with all of a real mans foibles. Perret makes no claim that Eisenhower was a brilliant general or a brilliant president. Instead, he portrays Eisenhower as a good theater commander and a good and active president.
Eisenhower was self-effacing but possessed an enormous ego, which is not surprising to those of us who have served with senior officers. He had a sense of who he was and the import of his position, yet he tried to remain Ike of Abilene, Kansas. Perret ably navigates the rocks and shoals of this complex yet uncomplicated mans life.
Perret also brings new scholarship to the story. Previously closed personal diaries, opened in 1998, give insight into what Eisenhower really thought as opposed to what he revealed publicly. For example, he made claims that neither known facts nor his diaries support, such as his claim that he was a great proponent of armor and willing to take risks. In reality, at the moment risks appeared, he backed off. When confronted with difficult situations, he often compromised his beliefs to advance his career.
The chapters on Eisenhowers political career are the most useful for readers intensely interested in military history. Eisenhower led the way to Soviet containment during NSC 68. Such massive retaliation was pure Eisenhower. Massive retaliation in practice means first strike, which explains a great deal about Eisenhowers less-than-enthusiastic support of Army positions during his tenure. Eisenhowers diminution of the Army in the 1950s infuriated his old friends and subordinates. He made decisions without regard to old loyalties but also without malice or romance. Some readers will find Perret insufficiently critical of Eisenhower. However, the book is a well-balanced account of a man who is deservedly among the pantheon of great Americans.
