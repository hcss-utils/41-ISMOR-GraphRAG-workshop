We also encouraged a return to foreign military education.
The Iraqi military sent a number of officers abroad to India, America, Russia, etc.,
to take courses on operational level of military thought.
We imported Russian and Egyptian books on the topic.
Unofficially, we read histories on German operations during World War II.
However, the most important books were American and British.
The British had adopted the operational level.
The Germans had used the term â€—operational level' during World War II.
It consisted of the operational cycle, fire and movement, and the task of the corps commander to concentrate fire, support, and logistics.
This is how we were educated before we started teaching at the war college.
