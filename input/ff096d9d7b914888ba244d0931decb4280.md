Even the takeover of Crimea, which arguably involved the most successful deployment of gray zone tactics to date-Russia was able to annex the peninsula without going to war-depended heavily on conventional Russian forces.
While local pro-Russian self-defense "volunteers" and proxies assisted by, for example, blocking the roads in Sevastopol, the operation was led by Russian special forces (spetsnaz) and unmarked Russian soldiers from the 810th Independent Naval Infantry Brigade (a marine unit).
The operation was facilitated by a large snap exercise in the Western and Central Military Districts to cover for troop movements, divert attention from the events in Crimea, and deter the Ukrainian government from intervening.
