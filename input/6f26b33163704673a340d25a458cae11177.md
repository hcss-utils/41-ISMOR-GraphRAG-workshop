To the extent that U.S. military capabilities remain equal or superior to that of regional powers-to include Russia-then, all else being equal, we can remain confident in the ability of U.S. forces to achieve their missions.
However, we must take into account the fact that the base of U.S. military power is shifting from its forward, and permanently deployed positions of the past to the continental United States.
In addition, there is the desire to reallocate the burdens of regional defense, placing more weight, particularly for smaller contingencies, on U.S. allies.
The political significance of the change is related to the determination of the administration to encourage allies to become more self-reliant in security affairs.
This means, in turn, greater U.S. reliance on these allies when U.S. interests are threatened.
This raises, in turn, questions about the capability of U.S. allies to shoulder a greater percentage of the regional security burden and the willingness of the United States to assist them in improving their military and technological might.
