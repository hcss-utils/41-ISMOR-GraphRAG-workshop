In recent years, proxy warfare seems to have changed again.
As the examples of Syria, Libya, Yemen, and Ukraine discussed at the outset of this chapter suggest, major powers, including Iran, Russia, the United States, and others, have again been players in these and other civil wars.
As might be expected from their involvement, the resources available to both insurgents and governments, including advanced weaponry and military training, have similarly increased.
From the perspective of U.S. decisionmakers and military planners, the key questions are whether such conflicts mark the beginning of a resurgence of proxy wars in a new era of strategic competition and, if so, what the defense implications are for the United States.
