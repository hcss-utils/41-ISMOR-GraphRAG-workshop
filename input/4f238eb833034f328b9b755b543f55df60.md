Possibilities include the cumulative effects of the bombing, particularly in combination with pressure on the ground from the indigenous Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA); the decision to take out the electrical power grid serving Belgrade and most of Serbia, which truly "brought the war" to the Serbian people; the perception that NATO was secretly planning for a ground assault (the now infamous B-Minus plan); and the withdrawal of Russian political support.
In truth, it is probably all of the above, but at this point only Milosevic knows for certain.
