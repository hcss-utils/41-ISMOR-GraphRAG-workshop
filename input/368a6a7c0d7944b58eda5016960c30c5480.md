Although Russia previously stationed "peace keepers" in South Ossetia and therefore had combat power in the area before the conflict, the first significant Russian response came from the area of the Roki tunnel.
Russian forces having just trained during the Kavkaz 2008 exercise began movement through the tunnel and massed in South Ossetia.
Although eventually able to deploy sufficient forces through the tunnel, Russia's military readiness slowed movement and initial deployment attempts met with significant difficulty.
Russia's forces still primarily used vehicles and vehicle designs left over from the Soviet Union.
Furthermore, the equipment was not maintained causing impairment to movement.
