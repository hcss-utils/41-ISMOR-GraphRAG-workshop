During the Second Chechen War, Russian commanders used airpower extensively, with mixed results.
On September 22, 1999, following aerial bombardment of Chechnya's capital city of Grozny, in which warplanes hit the airport, an oil refinery, a TV tower, and the area surrounding Chechen President Aslan Mashkadov's residence, Russian Prime Minister Putin denied that he was planning any large-scale [ground] offensive.
Putin continued to play down reports of a looming ground invasion, saying, "we will not thoughtlessly put our boys under fire."
