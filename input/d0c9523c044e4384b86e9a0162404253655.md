This review of events suggests a more interactive and opportunistic model for Rus sian political warfare, with Russia sowing seeds for conflict in fertile conditions and escalating the resulting unrest.
Significant opposition to Estonian activities by local Rus sian speakers led to protests and cyber attacks by relatively untrained individuals.
The Rus sian authorities then capitalized on the opportunity to oppose, undermine, and attack the Estonian government by imposing sanctions 65 Cyrus Farviar writes, "Partly because of the evidence that he's seen, and Moscow's reluctance to be cooperative leads made Estonian Chief Prosecutor Margus Kurm say that he is confident that the leaders of the attacks are in Russia, despite saying: "We have no evidence and no information that this was the Rus sian government."
Still, Kurm is pretty hopeless of ever gaining any further information that could be legally useful for prosecuting anyone for cybercrimes against the Republic of Estonia.
In an interview in July 2007, he admitted to me: "The status is that we haven't got any information from Russia and I'm quite sure that we will not get any information"
