The critical point here is that, as difficult and protracted as the Anglo-American debate over grand strategy was, from the Arcadia conference in Washington to the November 1943 conference with the Russians in Teheran, Roosevelt, Churchill, Marshall and Brooke ultimately got their grand strategy right.
They committed no major blunders.
Granted, "Brooke's and Churchill's campaign up to the Po Valley was largely a waste of effort after Rome, while Marshall's and Roosevelt's Operation Anvil/ Dragoon [the Allied landings in southern France] was also largely a waste of time."
86 But these were minor missteps compared to Adolf Hitler's strategic blunders, some of which he repeated time after time.
Hitler's "no withdrawal" policies in Tunisia, Russia and Italy as well as his decisions to invade Russia and to pursue extermination campaigns against the Jews and Bolsheviks all appear to have been major strategic errors that have no parallels on the Anglo-American side.
