There are numerous threads to the overall rationale for the size and scope of capabilities created and maintained by the PLA over the past sixty years, not all of them obvious to outside analysts, and not all of them related to external threats.
To a certain extent, China maintained an enormous and technologically limited army because the founding of the People's Republic had depended on such a force, and its lack of a sophisticated scientific and industrial base prevented it from creating a force modelled on those of the victorious powers after the Second World War.
The demands of internal security likewise augured in favour of a large army, as did that army's role in domestic engineering and infrastructure projects, as well as the social value of providing employment for large numbers of men of military age.
The nature of external threats -e.g.,
from Russia, with both an enormous, sophisticated military force bolstered by nuclear weapons, and later from India, with a population approaching China's in size -also demanded a large force.
Finally, China's lack of the nuclear option required an army that "could defeat a foreign invasion without using its nuclear weapons."
