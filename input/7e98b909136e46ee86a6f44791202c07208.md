tensions in the larger area by reassuring our allies and friends, but it may also lead to more tension and conflict if Chinese leaders see it as an offensive move to encircle China and prevent it from fulfilling its national destiny.
It has been suggested that China could counter the pivot, for example, by following a combination of initiatives including: breaking the semicontainment ring by dropping North Korea and drawing South Korea into its orbit; encouraging India to continue to hedge its position vis-Ã -vis the U.S. in solidarity with the other three members of the five BRICS (e.g. Brazil, Russia, China); following an access-denial approach in the medium term but switching from building a blue-water navy to building missiles and drones that could swarm U.S. carriers; buying European debt to gain leverage since it would drive up U.S. interest rates; keeping the U.S. distracted and dissipating its treasure and energies in the periphery by propping up global troublemakers like Sudan, Zimbabwe, and others (e.g. North Korea, Syria, Iran, Cuba, Venezuela) as we seek to enforce "the responsibility to protect" principle.
