Two current U.S. competitors, Russia and Iran, already have sophisticated proxy warfare capabilities.
But if China were to reengage in this form of strategic competition, how long might it take Beijing to develop such capabilities again?
To answer this question, we distinguish between how quickly a state may be able to initially create a proxy warfare capability and how long it tends to take states to refine that capability and make it more effective or robust.
