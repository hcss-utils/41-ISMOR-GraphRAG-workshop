Russia's campaign of land denial against Napoleon in 1812, Germany's sea denial campaign during both World Wars, and North Vietnam's air denial campaign in Southeast Asia from 1962 to 1973 are effective examples of significant historical denial campaigns within three different mediums.
In each of these campaigns, the weaker adversary attempted to deny the advantages of superiority to the superior power, and did not pursue superiority in that medium.
The US may face this kind of counterstrategy in space in the near future.
