The 2008 Georgia war again demonstrated that Russia out of necessity clung to mass as the preferred technique for dealing with tactical problems.
However, the employment of forces and operational goals of the operation are radically different from the techniques of the Soviet Union.
As with the drawdown in Chechnya, Russia is content with maintaining a modicum of control through the threat of future force, not the imperial domination that characterized Soviet operations.
Even with a modernization of operational and strategic goals, Russia's military continues to face significant obstacles at the tactical level.
