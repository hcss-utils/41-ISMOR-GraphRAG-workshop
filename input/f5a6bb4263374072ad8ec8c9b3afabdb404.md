In the flat open plains, the wide meandering rivers are also effective obstacles.
During Operation Barbarossa in World War II, the Dnieper River in Ukraine and Russia was an obstacle to resupplying the German 6th Army, which was holding a front from south of Kursk to Kharkov.
All the bridges had been blown, isolating the entire army.
The German 88th Infantry Division impressed local labor and built an ice bridge over the river with blocks one to three feet thick.
These blocks were laid on the already frozen river in temperatures of -29 degrees Fahrenheit.
The weight of the additional ice caused cracks, but water that was poured in the cracks froze immediately and acted as a weld.
The completed bridge was then hosed over to make it a solid four to six feet thick.
When a 130-ton locomotive was driven across it, the ice structure bowed 18 inches, but it held and provided the 6th Army with a lifeline until spring.
