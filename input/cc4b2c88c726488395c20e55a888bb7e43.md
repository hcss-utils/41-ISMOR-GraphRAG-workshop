Attacking the enemy's mind prior to the initiation of conflict and during military operations is the preferred indirect technique of warfare used by Russia in Ukraine.
Yuen finds that "Sun Tzu's emphasis on the mental phase prior to actual battle may appear to suggest that he has a strong, philosophical preference for psychology and mind games, rather than real, violent conflict in order to achieve victory."
