The Russian Federation is falling apart for the same reasons the Soviet Union disintegrated.
As the former Soviet republics saw no benefit in supporting a central government too corrupt and ineffective to help them with their own domestic problems, so the regions now seek independence from a federal center irrelevant to their economic recovery.
Russia in the 1910s is a better analogy than Weimar Germany for what materialized in the Balkans, because Moscow seemed to regress to its old disastrous role as defender of the Serbs, and the Russian military, with or without contact, cared more for its pride than for the lessons the contacts program provided.
