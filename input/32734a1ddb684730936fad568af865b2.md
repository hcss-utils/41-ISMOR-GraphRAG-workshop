The third volume of this three?volume report is a collection of topics that range from interoperability between Ser-vices to historical looks at experimentation and warfighting on urban terrain. Appendix G describes the series of joint experiments, the purpose of which was to facilitate U.S. Army and U.S. Marine interoperability and collabora-tive planning. Appendix H provides a look at experimentation between the two World Wars and derives lessons for the U.S. military today. Appendix I highlights the JAWP?s thinking about experimentation beyond the theoretical, describing what constitutes joint warfighting experimentation. Appendix J describes the challenges DoD faces in transformation and joint experimentation, and how to measure progress towards DoD goals during a time where the environment is oriented toward success, quick returns, and zero defects. Appendix K is a thoughtful picture of the lessons reaped from the tragedies of urban operations in twentieth-century warfare, and how the U.S. military must face psychological and political barriers that seem to make it virtually impossible to fight directly for the control of cities in the twenty-first century. Finally, Appendix L is a bibliography that surveys classic and recent articles on military operations in urban terrain.
The Joint Advanced Warfighting Program (JAWP) was established at IDA in April 1998 to be a catalyst for the transformation of US military capabilities, with particular emphasis on joint concept development and experimentation. We began our work by reviewing prior military experimentation efforts, surveying ongoing activities (primarily of the Services), and examining the tools available. From these early efforts we developed a set of ideas about what would constitute an effective program of experimentation. These ideas were honed over several months in discussions among the JAWP staff and in conversations with the US Joint Forces Command (formerly US Atlantic Command), other unified commands, the Joint Staff, the Services, and the Office of the Secretary of Defense.
At the same time, the JAWP began to develop exemplar operational concepts and to think through the joint experimentation required to learn how to make them work. One of these concepts, Attack Operations Against Critical Mobile Targets, was selected by the US Joint Forces Command to be the first joint experiment. At their request, the JAWP led the development of the concept and executed the associated experiment. The experience pushed our thinking about experimentation beyond the theoretical, and made it possible to generate a more thoughtful discussion of joint warfighting experimentation -what it is (and isn't), why it's needed, why it won't be easy, and how it can be done effectively.
There are alternative views on how to do joint experimentation. The view we espouse is of concept-based experimentation as a disciplined process of discovery, in which most of the real learning takes place in venues other than big field activities, and there is as much value from creative military people deducing "what might be" as there is in measuring what happened. This paper does not necessarily reflect the views of the JAWP's sponsors. Our intent is to stimulate ideas, discussion, and, ultimately, the discovery and innovation that must fuel successful transformation. We expect our own views on these topics will continue to evolve. The JAWP Team is composed of military personnel on joint assignments from each Service as well as civilian analysts from IDA. The JAWP is located principally in Alexandria, Virginia, and includes an office in Norfolk, Virginia, that facilitates coordination with the United States Joint Forces Command.

Warfighting experimentation is a process of discovery. It differs from other military activities, such as training exercises, tests, and demonstrations. It aims to explore new and innovative combinations of doctrine, organization, and materiel; assess their feasibility; evaluate their utility; determine their limits; and foster their co-evolution into new capabilities.
While the Services experiment routinely as they upgrade the capabilities they provide to the joint force, there is also a direct need for joint experimentation aimed at the operational level of war. Recent experience suggests that the demands placed on joint force commanders -integrating air, land, sea, and space capabilities to successfully execute military operations -will be even greater in the 21st Century. A variety of new threats and potential combat environments confound attempts to codify future requirements. An effective program of joint experimentation can help by exploring the alternatives and defining new pathways to more effective joint capabilities. It offers insurance against surprise and provides the means by which hard lessons can be learned and acted upon before US forces once again find themselves in combat.
Joint warfighting experimentation won't be easy, particularly if its objective is transformation -which can be succinctly described as big change. Change in large organizations is always difficult. It requires resources that are almost always in demand for other purposes. It requires, too, an uncommon blend of creativity, discipline, and open-mindedness. Experimentation to develop and refine advanced warfighting concepts must account for complex situations, capable and cunning adversaries, and human performance under extreme stress. Success in future operations will come to the side that can deliver decisive effects against the opponent's critical capabilities in a time sequence that disrupts his ability to plan and react. Identifying and measuring the specific effects needed to assure success will be a real challenge in operations where information, speed, and distributed precision attacks -not the traditional mass, lethality, and broad offensive action -will make the difference.
In designating the Commander in Chief, US Joint Forces Command, as the Executive Agent for Joint Warfighting Experimentation, the Department of Defense (DoD) took a major step toward managing these challenges. By conducting a wideranging program of joint experimentation, US Joint Forces Command can help ensure that future joint force commanders have the "born joint" capabilities they will need to integrate and employ to greatest effect the capabilities being developed by the Services.
An effective experimentation program directed toward transformation will display certain essential ingredients. Together, these may be viewed as a recipe for success. 
The first joint experiment, Attack Operations Against Critical Mobile Targets, incorporated several of these ingredients, including a concept-based iterative process, aggressive Red Teaming, and a tolerance for surprise. Other characteristics essential for transformation, including early and vigorous involvement of key stakeholders, remain to be incorporated in future experiments.
Ingredients for Success
Warfighting experimentation is a process of discovery about new military operational concepts and capabilities. It is the process of systematically exploring new and innovative combinations of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, people, and facilities (DOTMLPF) to assess their feasibility, evaluate their utility, determine their limits, and foster their co-evolution into fielded capabilities.
Experimentation differs from other military activities, such as training exercises, tests, and demonstrations.
Training exercises focus on proficiency in executing current doctrine, using current organizations and equipment. They offer limited utility for exploring new concepts, organizations, and materiel.
Tests focus on whether a system (some combination of hardware and software) works. Experimentation tests ideas, not things.
Demonstrations focus on showcasing success to persuade skeptics and build consensus around a concept. Experimentation seeks outcomes (such as driving a concept to failure) that would be unacceptable in a demonstration.
For most of the Cold War, DoD built a military force to deter America's principal For example, the Defense Science Board and others have postulated that small, distributed ground elements -given reliable, broad-band communications, superb situation awareness, and access to remote fires -could exert as much battlespace influence as a much larger force and be more responsive, agile and adaptive. 5 Such a distributed force could have at its disposal all the "things" that have until now been the There is also a need for experimentation that is joint. Historically, DoD has not had a joint approach for determining capabilities and force structure. Each Service has developed its own doctrine, organizations, and materiel and trained its units, leaders, and people, according to its own warfighting concepts. There have been multi-Service concepts, but few analyses in support of a weapon system have been cast in the context of joint force capabilities.
As a result, joint commanders at the operational level have been challenged to integrate sets of Service capabilities in whose development their point of view was hardly represented. Too often, Service systems that need to be integrated into a joint "system of systems" cannot talk to one another. Information collected by one Service's sensors that would increase the effectiveness of another's shooters cannot be shared because technical interfaces and formats differ from Service to Service. Assuring interoperability can increase costs and delay the introduction of needed capabilities; thus, from a force provider's perspective, it can make sense to sacrifice interoperability in favor of reducing cost or shortening the development cycle. But from the perspective of the joint force commander, who must integrate and employ all the capabilities the Services provide to the joint force, it makes little sense, if any.
The interests of future air, land, sea, and space commanders are well represented in the DoD force development process by the four Services. In the past, however, the voice of future joint force commanders -who will have direct responsibility for integrating those same air, land, sea, and space capabilities -have had little influence in decisions that determined the effectiveness of joint forces.
What is more, recent operational experience suggests that the demands placed on joint force commanders to successfully execute military operations will be even greater in the coming decades. While the US and its allies have enjoyed considerable success, a candid review of operations reveals that the factors of information, time, distance, and tempo present new problems. Issues of strategic agility, command and control, theater missile defense, and control and distribution of fires all suggest the necessity for a systematic investigation of new joint warfighting possibilities.
Absent the defining crucible of the Cold War and Soviet military power against which to measure US military capabilities, we cannot be certain what combinations of doctrine, organizations, and technologies will be important for operational success. A variety of new threats and potential combat environments confound attempts to codify future needs using a Cold War requirements system. An effective program of joint experimentation can help by exploring alternatives and defining pathways to new and more effective joint capabilities.
The Commander in Chief, US Joint Forces Command, has been given responsibility to represent joint force commanders of the future in developing concepts and capabilities.

Change in large, tradition-bound organizations is always difficult. A program of experimentation is an effort to institutionalize a process for change, which runs counter to the tendency of bureaucracies to ensure survival by sustaining the status quo.
Experimentation that aims at big change -transformation -will inevitably stimulate resistance. Experimentation that does not serve to support or further advance existing programs will be viewed with suspicion and subject to much debate and criticism. precision and speed to dominate an information-rich battlespace. Success will more likely come to the side that can tailor the right response and deliver decisive effects against the opponent's critical capabilities in a time sequence that disrupts and confounds his ability to plan and react. Identifying and measuring the specific effects needed to assure success will be a real challenge in operations where information and distributed precision attacks -not the traditional mass, lethality, and broad offensive action -make the difference. Complex, dynamic, precision operations will be difficult to replicate credibly without new models and new confederations that enable real-time human-in-theloop interaction with technologies and organizations.
In designating US Joint Forces Command as the Executive Agent for Joint Warfighting Experimentation, DoD took a major step toward overcoming these inherent challenges. But supporting organizations are immature at best, and truly joint processes and procedures have to be invented.
The following discussion assumes that joint warfighting experimentation has transformation as its primary objective. It should focus on learning about concepts that can lead to a breakthrough in the overall capability of joint forces. To help define the parameters of a joint experimentation program and keep it oriented on big change, the following are offered as ingredients essential for effective experimentation.
The object of experimentation is innovation -tinkering with new ideas to discover those worth pursuing. Creative leaders, with a passion for ideas they believe in, are at the heart of successful innovation. Examples can be cited in every Service:
• Army officers Billy Mitchell, Henry H. Arnold, Carl Spaatz, Ira Eaker, and James H. Doolittle championed the idea of air power long before they dreamt of a United States Air Force.
While still a junior officer, William S. Sims made such a nuisance of himself that the Navy finally adopted, against the judgment of many of its leaders, his continuous-aim firing methods. Years later, as President of the Naval War College, he pioneered the use of wargaming and joined other visionaries such as William Moffett, Joseph Reeves, and Jack Towers in pushing the Navy to experiment with aircraft carriers.
Marine Corps Major Earl H. Ellis was the intellectual father of amphibious warfare, but it took the support of Commandant John H. Russell and the energy of true believers like Holland M. Smith to turn the concept into a fielded capability.
Generals James Gavin, Hamilton Howze, Harry W.O. Kinnard, and others who saw clearly the potential of helicopters as a means to achieve tactical mobility drove the Army to experiment with, and ultimately embrace, the concept of air mobility. 7   Creative leaders generally have gathered around themselves a team of enterprising individuals who share their belief in an idea and committed themselves to making it work. Admiral Moffett knew which officers shared his vision of naval aviation and influenced their assignments to create critical mass around the idea. General Kinnard, when told by the Army Chief of Staff to pick a few men to help determine how far and how fast the Army should go in embracing air mobility, knew exactly which few to pick.
But assembling a team of creative people with a shared passion will be more difficult in the joint world, because the Services control assignments and career imperatives -skill progression, command, and professional military education -impact on the availability of people with the requisite talents.
Transformation is at its root a process. It can be slow and methodical, or it can happen quickly: for example, the first combat use of air power occurred only 11 years after the Wright Brother's first flight. The process must be tailored to fit specific times and specific institutions, but valuable insight can be gained by studying prior efforts that brought about big change, as well as those that failed. Today, all the Services are conducting experiments to develop and refine their future operational concepts. The lessons they learn in doing so are an ideal starting point for joint concept development and experimentation. 7 To learn more about these successful efforts at innovation, and others not so successful, see Elting E.

An ancient proverb says, "When the wise man points at the moon, only a fool stares at his finger." JV 2010 pointed toward a military force able to dominate any situation in which it is committed. It is a goal, not the date by which the force is to be fielded. Some of the capabilities envisioned in JV 2010 and its successor documents may be achievable in a few years, others may be as distant as the moon.
Experimentation must be understood as a process for change, not a schedule . . . a journey, not a destination. The important thing is to start, and to learn along the way.
Service participation is crucial to successful joint warfighting experimentation, not only to obtain the Services' buy-in, but also -and more importantly -to capitalize on their energy and resources. Joint experimentation that does not involve the Services risks becoming just one more "stovepipe."
The Services are the institutions that organize, train, and equip military forces.
They have the experience, expertise, and resources to develop concepts and requirements to fulfill the roles assigned to them by Congress. They have the wherewithal to initiate and manage programs that develop and acquire new capabilities. Each Service looks at its portion of the battlespace and does its own concept development and experimentation to determine and develop the capabilities it thinks the joint force will need. A key objective of joint experimentation must be to influence and integrate future Service capabilities -to develop joint employment concepts that will allow the capability of the joint force as a whole to be greater than the sum of its Service parts.

Experiments are harbingers of change, and change is threatening. Innovative endeavors, and especially the innovative people that drive them, need uninterrupted support from the top. The process of innovation requires protection from bureaucratic reprisals, but not from criticism. Protection includes managing expectations -inside as well as outside the process -so that undue criticism does not flow from unreasonable fears or unrealistic expectations.
Admiral William Moffett, as head of the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics, supported and protected naval aviation in its infancy. He secured legislation so that only aviation officers could command Naval Air Stations and aircraft carriers. He invited senior officers from the surface Navy to gain aviation wings as "observers" without having to go though the full training program for pilots. And he placed these observers in aviation commands, where they were eventually replaced by younger officers who had grown up in aviation. 10   Providing cover and protection for those involved in developing and promoting advanced joint warfighting concepts will be a challenge in the joint world. Because promotions and assignments are controlled by their parent Services, officers may be understandably reluctant to champion joint concepts that do not conform to conventional Service wisdom.
Thinking about the future is hard, but essential to innovation. To overcome the natural hesitancy to confront an uncertain future, we now have the ability to create a virtual environment, place innovative operators in the middle of it, and challenge them to discover what they can accomplish with new organizations; command-and-control arrangements; and tactics, techniques and procedures. Placing new technologies into such an operational context -letting real people play with simulated future systemsconnects the operator to the technologist and links "concept push" to "technology pull."
10 Rosen, Winning the Next War, pp. 76-79.
In creating such a future environment, it is necessary to make informed judgments about the performance of systems that do not yet exist. Then, given a range of performance, the objective is to determine how valuable such systems might be. This means asking operators to employ the future systems in different ways in a simulated battle or campaign, then letting the results drive development of the concept and, ultimately, of real systems.
Aggressive Red Teaming is key to ensuring that results of experimentation are robust and persuasive. Failure to expose a concept to Red Teaming can lead to adoption of a doctrine incapable of countering more forward-looking concepts that a potential enemy might develop. An example is the Maginot Line. Built at great cost during the 1930s to prevent the violation of French territory, the Maginot Line did well most of the things it was designed to do. But its designers failed to extend the defenses all the way to the English Channel, and instead relied on terrain (the Ardennes Forest) and allies (the Belgian Army) to protect the left flank and buy time for organizing French defenses. The designers never anticipated the fast-moving mechanized forces, dive-bombers, and Blitzkrieg tactics that, in the end, made the Maginot Line irrelevant. A "Red Team"encouraged to challenge the effectiveness of the defensive chain when it was still in the design stage -could have uncovered its weaknesses. 11   The US Navy's nuclear submarine force provides a model. Members of this community were given wide latitude to examine any number of counters to US nuclear submarine capabilities, and directed to report their findings directly to the Chief of Naval Operations without bureaucratic interference. The key is to pit a robust Blue Team against an innovative and aggressive Red Team, letting both sides learn and adapt as they go so that both sides help improve the effectiveness of the Blue concept.
Experimentation aimed at discovery is by its very nature an iterative process. The first step in military experimentation is development of a concept -a new, integrated set of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, and personnel -intended to perform some function. Iterative trials within a single experiment may increase confidence that the results are not a one-time fluke and that the concept under consideration can be robust over a range of conditions. More importantly, iterative 11 Rudolph Chelminski, "The Maginot Line," Smithsonian, June 1997, 
pp. 90-100.
• Starting point --a preliminary concept • Process is:
-iterative -progressive . 
Some argue, for example, that, in the future, technology will allow distributed ground forces to mass effects without having to mass the large formations typical of past conflicts.
Such a concept entails significant risks, and reason demands that implementation be preceded by confidence that we have the people; organizations; systems; connectivity; training; and tactics, techniques and procedures to do the job.
Gaining the necessary degree of confidence could involve a progression of small and medium-sized experiments before putting them all together in some large event to see how well the overall concept works.
An example of a "small experiment" is one conducted at IDA's Simulation Center for the 1996 Defense Science Board Summer Study. Army and Marine Corps lieutenants and captains were assembled, given information sufficient to establish "situation awareness," formed into two-man teams, given a mission, and asked to formulate a plan, which they executed in an interactive simulation. At the end of each "run," changes were made based on the teams' recommendations. Two-man teams became three-man teams.
The experiments in year four will also gain from the lessons learned in the preceding three years.
The diagram also illustrates why continuous experimentation is essential for developing and testing breakthrough concepts. If these experiments were conducted in sequence rather than in parallel, it would take at least 12 years to complete the exploration of the concept -not exactly the kind of timeline associated with a breakthrough. This kind of continuous experimentation builds momentum for transformation by providing a flow of new ideas and new approaches that build confidence in -and support for -the transformation concepts.
Experiment events may include seminars and wargames to explore and refine the concept. Since experimentation often involves the exploration of capabilities that do not yet exist, simulation plays an important role. Constructive simulations provide some quantitative insights, particularly about the expected performance parameters of future systems. However, constructive simulations do not take into account the key parameter of human performance. Human-in-the-loop (HITL) virtual simulation is therefore an essential tool, as it will permit learning about the interface of human operators with new technology, under conditions of stress, while facing a thinking, adaptive Red Team. HITL simulation will also allow human operators to evolve the concept by trying different tactics, techniques, and procedures -doing this with constructive simulation requires rewriting software code for every new idea.
Field simulations involving live forces are another experimental tool, one that may culminate an iterative, progressive campaign. However, not all experimentation needs to culminate in live field experiments. Field events do offer credibility, but they also bring their own artificiality. Variables become numerous and difficult to control, and repetition is much more difficult. Field events also attract visitors and, despite good intentions, can turn into something more akin to a demonstration than a true experiment. "Joint experimentation will demand original thinking . . . . No doubt there will be occasional failures, but that doesn't concern me. Equally important is openness to the discovery that an idea works in ways different from what was anticipated. This requires that experiments be observed by people with the experience and judgment to see not only what takes place before their eyes, but also what might have happened if conditions or procedures had been even slightly different.
The United States Congress and other institutions, inside and outside government, are clearly looking for "transformation" even if they are not clear on how to measure progress. DoD (and more specifically US Joint Forces Command) needs to demonstrate progress to assure continued support for the experimentation program. Early success can demonstrate progress towards transformation and focus attention on the important issues associated with implementing the positive results of joint experimentation.
Given the processes of government and the lead times associated with major change, even revolutionary change must proceed in evolutionary stages. When the objective is big change, however, it is essential to establish bold goals along an evolutionary path. The approach must be ambitious, lest big change be submerged in a tide of comfortable incrementalism. DoD cannot wait until all experiments are completed to begin planning for incorporation of ideas and concepts generated during experimentation. It takes time to develop and procure new materiel, but the other elements that together comprise a capability -doctrine, organization, training, leaders, people, and facilities -have their own cycles and lead times as well. The experimentation process must foster the co-evolution of all the elements -DOTMLPFwhich, when combined, will produce a new capability.
Transformation can be thwarted by the rigidity of processes that allocate resources needed to implement and exploit new concepts. Flexibility is essential.
Success must be anticipated and a process put in place to move promising experimental products and results rapidly into the field, outside the normal cycle of budget preparation and review. 
13
Achieving the right set of capabilities for joint force commanders of the future to dominate any adversary will require not only difficult doctrinal decisions, but also difficult investment decisions. Such decisions could be helped by experimental results, provided all stakeholders accept them as valid. To obtain the necessary buy-in, stakeholders must be involved in developing the ideas and concepts to be assessed. The process must immerse stakeholders in experiments -to let them "test drive" the ideas themselves.
General Hamilton Howze was a former tank commander, not an aviator, when he was named the Chief of Army Aviation. He was told he'd been chosen on the basis of his strong belief that mobility was the real key to battlefield success.

"To that end, we wrote the Command and General Staff College at Ft. Leavenworth to get the tactical problems they were currently presenting to their students; these we presented to any individual or group of officers we could get to listen. First we gave the problem straight, as C&GSC gave it; then we put a very few selected, attached light reconnaissance aircraft, attack aircraft, and troop-carrying aircraft on one side, but not the other, and presented the problem again; then we shifted the aircraft to the other side and gave it a third time.
"The effect of a few aircraft on the outcome was astonishing. One side knew much more of the other's position, disposition, and activity; one could move critically-needed supplies or persons quickly, the other couldn't; one could cross part of its strength over hills and rivers easily, the other couldn't. Indeed, one could beat hell out of the other, other things (besides aircraft) being equal. The little show was immensely convincing."

The object of experimentation is to discover and refine new military capabilitiesnew combinations of advanced technology (materiel), organization, and doctrine (tactics, techniques, and procedures). Each of these elements of capability has its own development cycle and its own lead time, as do the closely associated training, leader development, training and education, and facilities elements. A capability implemented before all those elements are in place and functioning risks failure. Therefore, to be effective, joint experimentation must aim at their co-evolution.
The first joint experiment, Attack Operations Against Critical Mobile Targets, suggests some of the difficulties as well as the paths future joint experimentation needs to follow. The concept was developed to address the problem of theater ballistic missiles (TBMs), which dates back to the V-1 and V-2 rockets of World War II. Today, TBMs continue to proliferate, and may carry nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons. Attack operations -locating and destroying such weapons on the ground -is therefore a critical challenge for US military forces.
Because it was the first joint experiment, the objectives included learning how to conduct effective experiments and building a base of knowledge and tools for future experiments, in addition to exploring new concepts for prosecuting time-critical targets.
The concept envisioned that sensors and sensor management technologies will evolve in the next 15 to 20 years to the point of enabling comprehensive coverage of objects in the battlespace. These technologies hold the promise of enabling joint forces to locate, track, and then attack TBM launchers and other critical mobile targets.
The challenge in conducting attack operations will be to maneuver different kinds of sensor platforms and sensors, merge their data into "engagement quality" tracks that provide target identification and location sufficient to permit their attack, and bring appropriate weapons to bear, when and where the targets are most vulnerable. The idea is not only to shorten response times between detection and engagement, but more fundamentally to provide a synoptic, shared, engagement-quality picture of the battlespace to enable trained teams to anticipate, detect, and attack fleeting targets.
The focus of the Attack Operations experiment was on command and control -a human-in-the-loop system able to adapt as necessary to integrate target tracks from a network of simulated future sensors, maneuver those sensors, and direct a weapons network against mobile missiles and their support systems. The objective was to learn how to find and destroy the missiles and their launchers on the ground, ideally before first launch.
The experiment team used the Synthetic Theater of War (STOW) simulation, an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), to create a synthetic battlespace integrating the air, land, sea, and space domains as well as the forces that operate in them.
16
The Attack Operations Experiment Pitted Blue Against Red in a Simulated Future Environment Into this environment were placed a mix of simulated future (circa 2015) sensors and weapons, integrated by a future command and control system. Experienced operators experimented with these simulated future capabilities, exploring new methods of command and control and new tactics to improve the speed and efficiency of targeting and attack. An independent Red Team provided dynamic free-play opposition in a series of trials.
In the experiment, sensor "hits" were sent to an Automated Target Recognition (ATR) exploitation and automated fusion emulation, which calculated the probability of correct identification. This probability, along with target location, speed, and direction, was then sent to the Blue Critical Mobile Target Cell (CMTC), where target analysts tracked each target, requested additional sensor coverage when required, and passed the target to an attack tasker, who paired it with an appropriate weapon and directed the attack. The CMTC provided the essential link between the sensing and attack functions.
17
Some attributes of effective experiments were evident in this first experiment:
• It was a process of discovery, tolerant of surprise and failure. Players were allowed, indeed encouraged, to innovate during the trials. Outcomes were not scripted.
It involved a Red Team (perhaps the most important attribute distinguishing experiments from demonstrations and tests). The Red Team both planned and operated Red Forces. Red planners -recruited from academia, industry, and government -developed a future ballistic missile force composed of solid and liquid fuel missiles, launchers with improved mobility, and enhanced camouflage, concealment, and deception measures. Red players provided the "OPFOR" (opposing force) to contest the Blue players during the human-in-the-loop portion of the experiment. Red was encouraged to develop tactics -such as salvo fires, "shoot and scoot" techniques, and enhanced camouflage, cover, and deception -reasonably available to an enemy in the 2015 time frame. Red and Blue were both allowed freedom to adapt internal processes and modify tactics, techniques, and procedures.
It provided early immersion into the future so that subsequent experiments can explore paths to the capabilities envisioned. Set in the 2015 timeframe, it examined a mix of simulated future sensors and weapons, integrated by a future command and control system. Fully exploring the subject will require a campaign of continuous experimentation that progressively adds new variables and additional degrees of difficulty.
It was an iterative process involving concept development, constructive modeling, and human-in-the-loop simulation. At each stage, changes were made based on results of the preceding step. If at any point the concept had "failed," the experiment could have been halted and the concept reworked to incorporate lessons learned.
Perhaps not surprisingly -since this was the first experiment and the front-end planning stage was tightly time constrained -some attributes were not exhibited:
• Service involvement: The heart of the concept was a cell with the authority to task, in real time, sensors and weapons systems without regard to the owning Service. Cultural barriers traditionally prevent a Service from willingly handing over control of its assets. Fostering the changes in culture and doctrine necessary to achieve the capabilities envisioned will require including the Services as full partners in joint concept development and experimentation.
International involvement: Because command and control is central to attack operations, and because it can succeed only if all the constituent parts of the system are interoperable, extensive participation by allies will be essential in developing the concept. Only one other nation took part in the first experiment.
Involvement of key stakeholders: The lack of Service participation has already been cited, but perhaps even more crucial to any future implementation of the concept are the other unified combatant commanders. While the Services may fear loss of control over Service assets, joint force commanders are likely to see at once the advantages of a cell having the authority to task, in real time, sensors and weapons systems without regard to who "owns" them.
Preparedness to exploit success: Preparing to exploit success is perhaps the major challenge facing future joint experiments. This first joint experiment did offer a set of DOTMLPF recommendations, in part to stimulate thinking about what to do with what is learned from joint experimentation. However, it remains for future experiments to consider much more seriously this formidable challenge.
An aggressive program of joint warfighting experimentation -systematically exploring new combinations of doctrine, organization, training, materiel, leadership, people, and facilities to assess their feasibility, evaluate their utility, determine their limits, and foster their co-evolution into fielded capabilities -will provide the means by which hard lessons can be learned and acted upon before US forces once again enter the ultimate laboratory of armed combat against an enemy of the United States.
Achieving fielded capabilities will require exploration of all the DOTMLPF elements, not just new materiel and command-and-control procedures. The first joint experiment provides a good foundation for a program of continuous experimentation aimed at co-evolving a new and much-needed capability, but more attention must be paid to integrating Service efforts, involving stakeholders, and providing persuasive results. However, much of the specifics regarding the form and content of these future capabilities remain to be discovered. Therefore, these documents also call for a vital role for concept development and experimentation in the transformation process.
Experimentation implies a process of innovation and discovery, the possibility of false starts and a tolerance for both surprise and "failure" of concepts. The premise is that it's much better to discover flaws ourselves, through experiments, than to learn about them from our adversaries on future battlefields.
The need for an exploration phase presents challenges to the Department's leadership: how to motivate it, how to gauge progress, and how to explain it to others, including the Congress, the media, and US allies. This challenge is especially acute in an environment oriented toward success, quick returns, and zero defects. Metrics will be needed-metrics different from the familiar milestones with very explicit targets that are used to manage programs.
The paper describes the challenges facing DoD, provides a framework to consider metrics for transformation, and offers some suggestions on how DoD could start developing and using such metrics.
This paper does not necessarily reflect the views of the Institute for Defense Analyses or the sponsors of the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program. Our intent is to stimulate ideas, discussion, and, ultimately, the discovery and innovation that must fuel successful transformation. We expect our own views on this topics will continue to evolve.         
Given the current and anticipated geo-strategic environment, urban warfare and military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) have become significant areas of concern within the US defense community. Historical examples of urban warfare and MOUTmost notably recent Russian experiences in Chechnya, but also experiences dating back to the Second World War, have demonstrated that such operations are typically complex and dangerous. While history has also shown that urban warfare and MOUT may be both difficult to do and impossible to avoid, its lessons may provide current and future warfighters with insights into how to prepare to operate and survive in the urban environment.
This section provides a brief overview of each article surveyed in the document. Article abstracts are presented according to the following scheme.
• The Need for and Nature of Military Operations in Urban Terrain. Entering the city to conduct urban operations is not unanimously seen as necessary among the authors surveyed. Some argue for avoiding cities altogether, while others urge selective application of military force in the city. There is greater consensus that human occupants will drive the nature of operations in the city. • Assessments of Current Preparedness. Several authors offer articles that assess America's current preparedness for MOUT. These articles are divided between assessments of current operational capabilities and assessments of training and training infrastructure to include facilities and simulations.
• Empirical Assessments. Many of the articles surveyed provide assessments of past military operations in urban terrain based on empirical evidence. These articles tend to look either at methods of force employment or at weapon or weapon system effectiveness.
• Evolving Concepts. New concepts offer improvements to MOUT capabilities.
One group of articles proposing new concepts is analytic in nature, based largely on logical argument. A second group describes concepts derived from ongoing experimentation or other developmental efforts.
• Civil-Military Operations. While not explicitly oriented on MOUT, articles are included that bring attention to the civil-military operations that will undoubtedly form a part of operations in built-up and populated areas.
This survey aims to provide interested parties with a quick introduction to recent literature on urban warfare and MOUT. It provides findings but draws no conclusions.
In "The Indirect Approach," Major General Robert H. Scales, Jr., notes that future foes may look to the capture of urban areas to delay or disrupt the arrival of US forces and diminish their combat effectiveness. Scales contends that the United States could effectively counter this threat by forming a loose cordon around the city and controlling supply and information access. Standoff weapons could attack selected targets to weaken the foe. Scales believes that these actions, which would prompt the civilian population of the city to reject the occupying military forces, would enable victory at a greatly reduced cost. (See

Authors providing assessments of current preparedness tended to look either at current operational capabilities or at the state of training programs, training facilities, and other training infrastructure. Abstracts are presented accordingly.
Russell W. Glenn, in "Fox Trot: Seeking Preparedness for Military Urban Operations," examines the positive and negative aspects of the US military's MOUT capability. On the positive side are improvements in Army and Marine Corps MOUT doctrine, and an increasing number of exercises, experiments, and programs dealing with MOUT. On the negative side are too-small MOUT training facilities, nonexistent joint training, poorly constructed rules of engagement, equipment shortfalls for urban-specific tasks, and the lack of a single champion for MOUT in DoD.

The article "Preparing for Today's Battlefield" addresses the likelihood of future urban combat and the way the Marine Corps currently trains for it. Author Lieutenant Colonel Thomas X. Hammes sees Marine Corps training as deficient in quantity and poor in quality. The world's population is shifting into the cities and those cities can not handle the load. This is going to lead to conflict with US troops fighting in those cities. The current 10% of the training spent on urban combat should be increased to 60%. Much of today's training is done at sites that are too sterile and have little in common with the cities of the Third World. Many of the tactics being trained have spilled over from the world of police operations and rescue and are ill-suited to urban combat. (See

A significant number of articles found in the journals were empirical assessments of military operations in urban areas. Many were derived from recent Russian experiences in Grozny, but other articles drew lessons from Mogadishu, Lebanon, Vietnam, and World War II. Authors tended to focus either on methods of force employment or on employment of particular weapons, classes of weapons, and other support systems.

In "Platoon Under Fire: Mogadishu, October 1993," Captain Mark A.B. Hollis examined some of the problems encountered by elements of the 10 th Mountain Division in their role as a quick reaction force in Mogadishu. Their mission was to rescue elements of Task Force Ranger, isolated and under attack after the Somalis shot their Blackhawk down. The limited visibility and thin armor of armored personnel carriers were problematic. The light armor was no match for unsophisticated and common weapons like rocket propelled grenades. With trucks and APCs lacking survivability, mounted infantry became dismounted infantry. Small unit tactics and short range weapons were key to survival. Small units will function independently intentionally or otherwise. Even the smallest units will form combined arms teams. A small observation helicopter adapted to infantry support, armed primarily with small caliber automatic weapons, showed great utility. (See

Lester W. Grau, in "The RPG-7 on the Battlefields of Today and Tomorrow," notes that when combatants are ten to thirty meters apart, artillery and air support is practically nonexistent due to the danger of fratricide. Constricted terrain (mountains, forest, jungle, and cities) leads to a type of direct-fire brawl in which weapons like the RPG-7 excel.
Grau describes some of the tactics used by various RPG-equipped forces. Examples come from Angola, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Chechnya. (See

The vehicle provides a higher level of protection to mounted troops. This new type of vehicle resembles the heavy APC developed by the Israelis. After the urban fighting in Lebanon in 1982 the Israelis found their M113 APCs woefully inadequate for MOUT. They then developed the Achzarit heavy APC (put into production in 1988). Like its Russian cousin, it too is based on the T-55. Armor protection was made the highest priority; the weight of the armor protection alone is reportedly 14 tons. (See

The assumption was that a professional foe would not risk its own cities by fighting in them. That assumption ill-prepared the Russians for MOUT in Grozny. Russian errors included: failure to cut off the city, poor planning, and weak intelligence preparation. The usage rates of some munitions (high explosive grenades, smoke grenades, demolition charges, light anti-tank weapons) were much higher than expected. Snipers were useful but in short supply. Artillery worked best in the direct-fire mode and used a high proportion of smoke rounds. Fixed-wing aviation was of limited value while helicopter gunships were effective. (See

Several authors proposed new concepts or reported on concepts evolving from experimentation or other developmental activities. Article abstracts below are based on the apparent source of the concept. Articles in the first group are analytic or philosophical in nature, relying primarily on logical argument. Articles in the second group describe concepts derived from experimentation or that are in some phase of development.
Lieutenant Commander Charles J. Gbur, Jr., discusses the potentially high casualty rates and unique threat environment of MOUT in "Battalion Aid Station Support of Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain." He believes that MOUT will require changes in the way battalion aid stations do business. Medical personnel will require improved training in the sniper threat, casualty location, extraction of casualties pinned under rubble, urban communications, and working with local civilian medical personnel. Some form of armored ambulance/intensive care unit will be required. Higher levels of care will be required prior to evacuation, given the likely scarcity of helicopter landing zones. Finally, the battalion aid stations will need full C 4 I integration capability. (See [Gbur 1999] page

In "The Foundation for Urban Warrior," Colonel Randolph A. Gangle reviews urban warfare history to reveal several common features. In the past attackers typically surrounded the city and conducted a methodical, linear sweep. That sweep generated numerous friendly, enemy, and civilian casualties, while using large quantities of small arms ammunition and grenades. Combat in the city was extremely taxing on the troops both mentally and physically. Gangle then discusses the efforts of the Marine Corps Warfighting Lab to develop several new concepts for dispersed forces in the urban environment. Urban Penetration has units move quickly (often with stealth) along multiple axes against a specific unit or location. Urban Thrust involves assaults along narrow axes of advance. Urban Swarm uses dispersed units to quickly respond from their assigned sectors to other areas requiring assistance. Active Defense uses a thin screen of forces backed up by a mobile reserve. (See

Comments on the displays were gathered from some of the attending
The introductory chapter provided abstracts based on their principal subject area and analytic orientation. This chapter looks across the entire set of articles for common themes and unresolved issues.
Views on the need to prepare for military operations in urban terrain range from isolate and bypass (see

Intelligence preparation is as relevant in urban environments as it is in open field warfare. However, because of the extensive manmade terrain and the significant presence of non-combatants, intelligence collectors and processes appropriate to warfare in natural terrain are often inadequate to the task. Comprehensive and in depth intelligence preparation is essential for successful urban operations (see

Many articles present conclusions derived from empirical examinations of urban operations. Authors uniformly conclude that successful urban combat operations depend on combined arms operations, and that combined arms teams form at the lowest tactical echelons. The high utility of armor, when used closely with infantry, is a common theme (see

Conclusions on armored and mechanized forces were mixed, especially with respect to light armored vehicles. In some cases, the lightly armored, tracked vehicles simply were not survivable (see

Communications in the urban environment is more difficult and more important. The concrete and steel structures in the city impose limits on simple man-portable radios that do not occur in open terrain. The vertical nature of cities imposes additional restrictions on line-of-sight communications equipment. To compound the technical problems, small tactical units that can communicate with voice and hand signals in open terrain must break into smaller units that operate more independently. Thus, the requirements to communicate increase and the ability to communicate decreases. See

Rules of engagement have been critical in past urban scenarios and will continue to be in the future. Rules of engagement are an important method of implementing political desires by limiting the use of military force. Therefore, in planning and exercises, a number of authors argue that attention should focus on the effects of rules of engagement on military operations and the political dynamics behind their creation (see 
[Glenn 1999

The article then lists several initiatives planned at the time of its writing. The first was the MOUT advanced concept technology demonstration (ACTD). The focus of this joint Army/Marine Corps program was to accelerate development of technologies that could improve urban capabilities in the following areas:
• The identification of combatants/noncombatants and friend/foe,
• a lightweight, armored vehicle capable of precision fire,
• non-lethal weapons for counter personnel and counter vehicle duties, and
• point munitions for infantry to defeat armored vehicles and breach walls.
A second initiative was the J-8 sponsored MOUT Seminar Wargame. That wargame explored the integration of advanced concepts, capabilities, and technologies in a major urban campaign. The third initiative was the Marine Corps Urban Warrior, the second phase of the Sea Dragon ACTD. Urban Warrior will draw upon the success of Hunter Warrior and focus on experimenting with potential solutions to challenges identified from a variety of sources.
Brown, K.W. "The Sustainment Distribution Team -Providing "Close" Combat Service Support in MOUT" Marine Corps Gazette November 1998 Pages 72-73.
In this article, Major K.W. Brown, a Marine Corps logistics officer, describes a new combat service support concept that has come out of Marine Corps combat service support experimentation. The sustainment distribution team concept focuses on the urban combat problems of casualty evacuation and resupply for isolated units operating in the city's heart. As envisioned, when the article was written, the sustainment distribution team would be a small element of eleven to thirteen Marines accompanied by one or two MV-22 transportable vehicles. The sustainment distribution team would augment an infantry platoon and have the tasking of immediate resupply and casualty treatment and evacuation. An important secondary mission of the sustainment distribution team is to provide additional combat power to the platoon.
Unlike many technology-driven initiatives, the organization-based sustainment distribution team concept is relatively inexpensive for experimentation. During the April 1998 Limited Objective Experiment (LOE) 2 the sustainment distribution team concept was heralded as a resounding success. Without the sustainment distribution team, augmentation of the infantry unit would have been paralyzed with ammunition shortfalls and casualty buildups. The author begins by recounting the experience of the Israeli Defense Force in Lebanon. The IDF's initial entry into Lebanon was swift and convincing. The PLO withdrew into the cities where it reduced the IDF advantage and enhanced its own decentralized tactical command and low-technology weapons. The IDF response was to direct artillery and air power to still populated cities and the result was international condemnation. The IDF's second response was to use infantry operations that brought high casualties and an erosion of political support in Israel. Armor-supported infantry is offered as the obvious middle ground.
Most Army MOUT training facilities are oriented on infantry and thus, are not suitable for tank or mechanized operations. The Fort Knox facility addresses that shortcoming. The MOUT cite, with a staff of thirteen, covers 26 acres. It will contain a variety of structures, including school, communications center, open air market, embassy, cemetery, airfield, gas station, train tracks, houses, bridge, sewer system, businesses and an industrial area. The facility will be littered with debris and burnt-out vehicles. Much will be done to stimulate the senses, including sight, sound, and smell. The range is capable of supporting from squad to battalion task force operations, and is instrumented with MILES and TWGSS/PGS equipment.
Celestan, G.J. "Red Storm: The Russian Artillery in Chechnya" Field Artillery January-February 1997 Pages 42-45.
Major C.J. Celestan, an analyst at the Army's Foreign Military Studies Office, sees the lessons learned by the Russian military in Chechnya as relevant to many armies because of the changing nature of warfare. In future conflicts, increasing urbanization will guarantee the use of artillery in close proximity to civilians. Urban combat is extremely manpower intensive and no military force today has a workable doctrine.
Several articles in Russian military publications have addressed the use of artillery in Chechen cities. A common theme was that the quantity of fire support needed was situational dependent and could not be preplanned. This was a sharp departure from traditional Russian fire planning.
Another departure from standard Soviet doctrine was unit size. Soviet doctrine had designated the artillery battalion as the smallest tactical unit needed for effective employment. In Chechnya, larger armor formations were broken up and assigned small detachments of artillery. Direct fire became the approved method for destroying strongpoints, often at 150 to 200m meters. This use of smaller artillery units mirrors the tactics used by Soviet forces storming Berlin in 1945.
As in the past, Russian artillery destroyed the bulk of the targets. A major difference in Chechnya was that artillery was a means unto itself rather than as a part of a combined arms team. A common operation had artillery and aviation bombard a target for several hours until the local commander felt all resistance had been destroyed. Then a mounted patrol would approach the target, calling in more artillery, if there was any resistance. In general, the Russians were happy with their mobile rocket launch systems (122 mm Grad and 220 mm Uragan). Their shock value and ability to destroy large areas with one volley suited Russian tactics. The Russians possessed several precision artillery rounds for their guns and mortars, but the higher command thought they should not be "wasted" in Chechnya.
Chechen tactics took advantage of the Russian preference for preplanned artillery strikes. The Chechens would organize hit-and-run attacks with their own guns and rocket launchers. The Russian would have difficulty reacting with their own strikes before the Chechens dispersed. Russian forces had counter-battery radar that should have allowed for more accurate counter-battery strikes. But poor training and hastily composed units prevented the development of the skills to use that capability effectively.
Infantry May-June, 1996 Pages 8-11.
"Mechanized Forces in MOUT" documents lessons from a mechanized infantry task force employed in Operation Just Cause. The units discussed were combined arms teams, tasked organized for their missions in Panama, with ample time to familiarize themselves with the environment.
Initially, the task force consited of two rifle companies with M113A2 armored personnel carriers plus headquarters and slice elements from battalion. Four months later they were replaced by the 4 th Battalion, 6 th Infantry with four rifle companies, battalion headquarters and headquarters company, and an anti-armor platoon of improved TOW vehicles. The task force arrived approximately four months before Just Cause began.
The mere presence of the M113s was important, and they stayed visible throughout their deployment. The M113 purchased a certain amount of shock value with forces not accustomed to mechanized vehicles. Initially, the rifle companies were designated as quick reaction forces, QRF 1 through 4, with 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, and 4 hours reaction time, respectively. Companies rotated stations every few days and conducted company movements to be visible, to observe PDF reactions, and to desensitize the local population. Movements occurred without rounds and magazines loaded to show lack of hostile intent. Movement was at 15 MPH at 10 meter spacing, ignoring traffic signals. M113s, HMMWVs, and 2 ½-ton trucks were used for combat service support.
During the invasion, companies quickly sealed off intersections. The .50 caliber machine gun provided suppressive fire. One platoon suffered several casualties in night sniper attacks, and the M113 evacuated casualties. After the invasion, the battalion conducted mounted and dismounted patrols to maintain order and locate hostile forces. It also ringed the compound where Noriega had claimed sanctuary.
The M113 could move over most roads but not side streets and alleys. Dismounted infantry played a key role in house-to-house searches. The higher troop carrying capacity of the M113 over the M2 Bradley was advantageous. In a CSS role, the M113 could carry a large complement of ammunition, concertina wire, and sandbags. The M113's mobility allowed it to overcome improvised roadblocks and other obstructions.
Because of the ubiquitous ready-made fighting positions in urban terrain, and because of the typical concern for non-combatants, units must have access to direct fire weapons like the .50 caliber machine gun and anti-armor weapons. Too heavy for sustained dismounted operations, the M113 is an appropriate platform for these weapons. This article reviews urban warfare concepts under test by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory. An historical review reveals four common features.
• The attacking forces surround and isolate the city and then conduct a linear, methodical sweep to clear enemy forces. • This linear sweep results in numerous casualties for all parties in the city: friendly, hostile, and noncombatants.
• The consumption rates for small arms and grenades are extremely high.
• Urban combat is both physically and mentally exhaustive.
MCWL has formulated several experimental tactical concepts for urban operations based on experience gained from the dispersed operations in Hunter 
Warrior.
Sufficient mobility to move quickly along several axes with dispersed units are required. The objective is quickly seized, immediately isolated, and protected from the enemy. Stealth must play a major role in the initial movement phase. • Urban Thrust occurs along a narrow axis (or axes) of advance with the intent to concentrate forces at chosen times and places. Other actions occur simultaneously to protect the flanks and obscure the true objectives.
• Urban Swarm envisions numerous small units (squads or fire teams) operating in a dispersed fashion. As these units patrolled their own sectors they are continuously available to respond to calls for assistance from neighboring units.
The key to urban swarm is speed and flexibility. Implicit in this concept is increased levels of responsibility and command for junior officers. Units must take care not to develop predictable patterns of action and movement. This concept may be most useful in lower-intensity conflicts.
• Active Urban Defense deploys a minimal defensive screen while a larger mobile reaction force operates behind the screen. This serves to confuse the enemy as to the true location of the main force and can contribute to the diversion of his forces to non-critical areas of the battle. The mobile reaction force also allows for quick responses to local emergencies. Military operations in urban terrain involve a high potential for casualties and present a unique environment that can severely test the capabilities of medical units. Medical personnel will have to work in large unsecured areas. This will demand improved combat skills training for medical personnel, especially with regard to the sniper threat, and the use of armored ambulances. An ambulance version of the LAV would be ideal. Although helicopter evacuation is preferable, there may not be suitable landing zones in the area. Mobile armored intensive care units will be needed.
A key problem will be the location and extraction of casualties in the confined terrain of buildings and rubble. Once located, evacuation should be preformed by medical personnel. Current operating procedures call for litter carriers provided by line companies. A better approach would be to gather organic medical personnel at the battalion aid station and make them responsible for all aspects of casualty evacuation. This would prevent the diversion if large numbers of combat troops from the fight. Battlespace awareness will be critical to delivery of medical services and survival of medical personnel. Medical teams should have GPS equipment and be cross-trained in radio use. The battalion aid station must become the central command and control center for the delivery of medical care.
Because of the large number of civilians in the urban environment and the possibility of preexisting medical infrastructure, medical personnel should liaison with local authorities. Dr. Russell W. Glenn, a senior defense and political Analyst at RAND, examines the positive and negative aspects of the US military's ability to prosecute operations in urban terrain, "Fox Trot: Seeking Preparedness for Military Urban Operations." On the positive side, Glenn praises the Army and Marine Corps for updating their urban warfighting doctrine and lauds the increasing number of exercises, experiments, programs, and organizations that wrestle with the issue of urban operations. On the down side, he laments the lack of adequate training (in terms of facilities and programs), the idealistic nature of many of the rules of engagement currently under development for urban operations, the growing mismatch between requirements and capabilities in the acquisition of weapons and weapon systems (when considered in the context of urban operations), and the lack of centralized oversight and advocacy for urban initiatives. Glenn concludes his article by noting that "Without a strong joint champion as a guide…future enemies, resource struggles, and lack of awareness will impede advances" in developing a robust urban warfighting capability.
• Urban warfare requires different types of equipment. Russian experiences in Grozny identified a previously unknown requirement for large numbers of hand grenades, smoke grenades, one shot grenade launchers, grappling hooks, and disposable ladders. Antiaircraft guns and rotary wing platforms were more effective than tanks at suppressing snipers and weapons in upper stories. Pyrotechnics and searchlights blinded and dazzled enemy soldiers.
• Artillery. Indirect fire was useful in approaching cities, direct fire artillery support was preferable while advancing through cities. In this article Grau describes the communications problems encountered by the Russians in 
Grozny (1994
Grozny ( to 1996) )
• Tall buildings and towers can absorb, block, reflect, and degrade FM and UHF radio signals.
• A limited number of frequencies, normally at the lower part of the band, work in cities. These frequencies can quickly jam up as both sides try to push too much traffic through too few frequencies.
• Wire communication links are vulnerable to breakage from vehicle traffic and artillery.
• Wire communication links can give away the location of command posts and takes 2 to 3 times longer to emplace in the urban environment.
Russian forces also transmitted in the clear on occasion. Chechen forces took advantage of this to monitor Russian movements, locate units to attack with artillery, and transmit false reports and orders. Chechen forces extensively used cellular phones, which work well in the urban environment. Apparently Russian forces collected intelligence and order of battle information through cellular intercepts.
Experience shows that proper planning can alleviate or eliminate many of the urban communications problems. An optimum signal plan needs to be formulated using directional antennas, proper frequencies, and secure voice communications. Directional antennas work much better the city. Wire still has a role to play, but it should be employed carefully. It should be protected from vehicle traffic and lines into command posts need to be buried so as not to indicate command post position. When possible, the civilian telephone network can serve for communications. To overcome building interference, aircraft can carry radio retransmission equipment, as they did in Grozny.
Several other technologies could also play a major role in the future urban communications. Encrypted cellular phones could frustrate collection efforts. However, fiber optic cables do not easily mesh with military wire communication links. Ham radios and computers are additional options. Grau examines the vulnerability of Russian armored vehicles within the context of the 1994 Russian campaign against the Chechens. Grau focuses on Chechen anti-armor techniques, the vulnerabilities of armored vehicles, and the implications for the future use of armored vehicles (especially within urban environments).
Within the first month of the Russian campaign against Chechnya, over 10% of the armored vehicles committed to the campaign were listed as non-repairable battle losses. The Chechens engaged and defeated armored vehicles through employment of anti-armor hunter killer teams consisting of three to four man cells, which typically consisted of an anti-tank gunner (armed with a RPG), a machine gunner, and a sniper. These teams utilized the urban environment to limit the combat effectiveness of armored vehicles, the main guns of which had a limited ability to engage targets above and below certain elevations. The machine gunners and snipers pinned down supporting infantry and the anti-tank gunners then attacked armored vehicles, aiming at weak points in the armor (e.g., their tops). Eventually, the Russians employed a systematic "house by house, block by block" approach that limited Chechen ability to perform such tactics. Furthermore, the Russians employed anti-aircraft guns to suppress Chechen forces in urban environments.
Fuel cells and engines were often the preferred target for Chechen anti-tank gunners. While it typically took a volley of three to six rounds to incapacitate such vehicles, the Chechens ability to fire down on the relatively vulnerable top armor enabled them to realize positive results using relatively crude anti-tank weapons. Some effective Chechen techniques for engaging and defeating armor included:
• Using anti-armor hunter killer teams as an effective model,
• Situating ambushes to minimize the maneuverability of armored vehicles,
• Suppressing supporting units (e.g., infantry, air defense guns) first, and Grau provides a compact discussion of the RPG-7 and the tactics of its employment. He draws examples from Angola, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Chechnya.
"The RPG-7 anti-tank grenade launcher is one of the most common and effective infantry weapons in contemporary conflicts. It is rugged, simple and carries a lethal punch. Whether downing US Blackhawk helicopters in Somalia, blasting Russian tanks in Chechnya, or attacking government strong points in Angola, the RPG-7 is the weapon of choice for many infantrymen and guerrillas around the world."
Constricted terrain (mountains, forest, jungle, and population centers) leads to close combat. When the combatants are 10 to 30 meters apart, artillery and air support is practically nonexistent due to the danger of fratricide. Close combat is a direct-fire brawl in which the RPG-7 excels."
Originally fielded in 1961, the RPG-7 is manufactured around the world. Shoulder fired, weighing about 15 lbs., it can launch a variety of munitions from a 40 mm tube. Its maximum effective range against a moving target is 300 meters and is 500 meters against stationary targets. The anti-tank round can be used as an area weapon reaching out to 920 meters while the anti-personnel weapon can reach to over 1100 meters. A tandem warhead (PG-7VR) can penetrate reactive armor.
Anti-armor tactics include attacking tanks with two or three RPG teams. Against reactive armor, the first round neutralizes the armor, while the second and third destroys the tank.
Infantry accompanying tanks were the greatest threat to RPG teams. A counter is teams including automatic weapons, sniper, and RPGs. A counter-counter was to deploy infantry far forward of the tank to engage RPG teams.
Anti-helicopter operations are also accomplished by RPGs and automatic weapons sitting in ambush around anticipated landing zones that might also be mined.
A common procedure in RPG tactics was to shoot then move. The visible signature of RPG firing invites a lethal response. This article reviews Russian logistical efforts associated with the two-month battle for Grozny in 1995. A central point is that urban combat drastically increases ammunition use and logistical needs. The Russians wanted to fight a linear battle, but the Chechens made it a non-linear fight. The Russian logistical system was unprepared for this. Getting supplies up to combat units was much more difficult when the "front line" was constantly shifting. Resupply units were poorly suited to traverse unsecured territory. Medical units encountered the same problem. There was a chronic need for armored vehicles to do both resupply and casualty evacuation. Medical evacuations were often conducted by make-shift BTR-80 ambulances.
Russian medical support was usually well-planned and executed once casualties reached battalion aid stations. However, the Russian record on disease control was worse. Russian soldiers frequently lacked clean drinking water. Also contributing to the medical workload was a higher than normal number of psychiatric casualties. Mitigating the medical workload was a much higher proportion of KIA to WIA. The normal three to four wounded for every dead soldier ratio was reversed to three dead for every wounded. This ratio reversal may reflect the difficulty in getting to wounded personnel quickly.
A key limitation on the Russian logistical effort was a lack of time to plan for the operation, something Moscow's political leadership did not provide. Serious traffic control problems and inadequate truck transportation were symptomatic of this. Russian forces were not prepared to handle the large number of prisoners and detainees. Rail moved the bulk of the supplies into the theater.
Items like small arms ammunition, high explosive and smoke grenades, flame thrower rounds, RPG rounds, tear gas grenades, ladders, grappling hooks and ropes, and night vision equipment were all in high demand. Mortar ammunition and smoke rounds for the heavy artillery were used are in heavy quantities. The ZSU-23-4 anti-aircraft vehicle was very useful because it could elevate its gun and engage targets on the upper floors of buildings. Consequently, keeping that high-demand system in 23 mm ammunition was a constant problem. This article reviews current tactical doctrine for clearing buildings and finds it lacking for military operations other than war (MOOTW). In current doctrine the grenade is a basic tool for clearing rooms. However, the use of combat power in MOOTW must be discriminate and characterized by legitimacy and restraint. To continue to rely on the indiscriminate application of firepower is a recipe for disaster.
The long-term answer to the problem lies in training. The Marine Corps should adopt the concept of Enhanced MOUT (EMOUT) as the standard for predeployment of combat units anticipating MOOTW. The EMOUT training concept originated at the Marine Corps Security Force Battalion's Fleet Antiterrorist Support Team Company. EMOUT blends shooting and tactical skills and is specifically designed to discriminate targets under restrictive rules of engagement.

Operations intelligence will be of great importance, civil affairs and PSYOPS being central to that effort. In fact, tactics may lie less with the numbers of troops and more with an understanding of the battle area at all levels (geographic, demographic, political and social). This understanding will help clarify the true centers of gravity that may be a person, object, symbol, or socio-political condition. Transition to the post-conflict phase will also benefit from a better "big picture" view. Certain military options may be deemed undesirable when viewed through the lens of long-term stability.
The United States is virtually alone at the top of the military technology pyramid. However, the effectiveness of its technology in the urban environment remains to be seen. As warfare becomes less conventional, raw military power may not be decisive. The US technology advantage may be outweighed by an asymmetry of interests. If it loses, a small insurgency force faces annihilation, while US forces merely face embarrassment, and the smaller and less capable protagonist may win. Rules of engagement relate to this. By their nature ROE are unilateral, and future foes will take maximum advantage of that fact. In future urban operations the political limitation via ROE may be greater than the limits of military capability.
Hammes, T.X. "Preparing for Today's Battlefield" Marine Corps Gazette July 1997  This article addresses the likelihood of urban combat and the quantity and quality of current training. The author begins by giving five reasons why US forces are likely to see future urban fights.
• Populations are shifting into the cities. From 1950-1995 the number of cities with 1+ million population increased from 34 to 213 in the developing world alone. • That population increase is leaving behind the ability of infrastructures and governments to support it. This will lead to increasing disorder as restive populations look to radical solutions to rectify their living conditions.
• Reduced US bases overseas. Without bases in theater US forces will need to enter via port and airport facilities, which are almost always in urban areas.
• The large majority of current conflicts are in or around cities.
• The most likely opponents of US forces in fourth generation war are terrorists, insurgents, and criminals, many of whom have migrated to the cities.
Contrasting with this trend is the urban training done by the Marine Corps. The author mentions that basic training still contains the same three to four day urban package he saw 20 years ago, when he attended. He observed the training of half a dozen infantry battalions and less than 20% of their training was for urban combat and much of that was wrong. There has been a spillover in tactics from the police/hostage rescue side of operations. While effective for what they are intended to do, the author believes that these tactics will get marines killed in urban combat. Police tactics are built on two assumptions that a marine in urban combat can not make. One is that the operation will take place with a secure perimeter, eliminating any threat other than the target itself. The second is that the foe will not use explosive type weapons like the RPG, mines, and hand grenades. In urban combat Marines have to worry about threats from every direction at all times. They also must avoid bunching up (e.g., stacking), which presents a perfect target for any explosive weapon Colonel Hammes sees a divergence between Marine Corps proclamations about urban warfare being the future and how it trains for the future. He sees today's training as the same as it was in the 1970's, 99.9% rural. However, he argues that with a little ingenuity, the Marine Corps can correct this deficiency. The individual skills that need work are:
• Urban combat shooting. This does not require urban specific training areas, current live fire facilities will do. The focus needs to be on shooting at shorter ranges, target discrimination, and sharpshooting. • Urban movement. Movement in the urban area is a distinct skill. Marines need to train for the full spectrum of urban scenarios. Marines must learn to think 360 degrees and learn to analyze urban cover. One of the most important tasks is to see that marines do not use civilian police movement tactics, as those will get marines killed in combat.
• Urban communication. This is the most difficult aspect of urban combat. To understand the problems and devise solutions, communications training needs to be a constant component of all urban training.
• Weapons effects training. Marines must understand the effects of their own personal weapons and crew served weapons. Without that knowledge, they risk both friendly and noncombatant casualties.
The facilities in use today are too pristine. What's needed is training facilities that look lived in, complete with slums, trash, junk cars, furniture, rubble, and battle damaged buildings.
Unit techniques must also be practiced, covering the full spectrum from security to all-out combat. Use two-sided free-play exercises whenever possible. Force-on-force exercises conducted at the small unit level can pull it all together. One inexpensive option would be to equip each marine with a paint ball mask and lever action BB gun. While the BB guns have very short ranges, they would work well for interior fighting.
Harding, E.H. "Urban Tank Employment Proposal for the 21 st Century" Marine Corps Gazette December 1999 Pages 37-39.
Lieutenant Harding begins by describing the need for new urban techniques, tactics, and procedures for the Marine Corps tank community. Marine infantry has three needs in the urban fight that tanks can support:
• Precision fire support. The M1A1's excellent fire control system can engage targets precisely with either the main gun or machine guns. • Quick reaction force. Tanks acting in this role could have made a big difference in Mogadishu.
• Mobile reserve. This allows the commander to move firepower quickly.
• Survivable and overwhelming fire support. The M1A1 carries its own large ammunition load without overloading the infantry.
The answer is a mobile react team. Each MRT would compose one tank section supported by an infantry squad and engineer team, mounted on two assault amphibious vehicles. The MRT would stay two to three blocks behind advancing infantry. The support the MRT gives could come in three forms: as an on-call assault gun, as a manned roadblock force, or it could stay back at a nearby compound and sortie as needed.
Currently, joint infantry/tank MOUT training is rarely conducted. The first step would be to make it an annual requirement. What is needed is a 12 by 12 block MOUT training facility complete with shanty villages surrounding the outskirts. Such a training space would allow armor (heavy and light) to test urban warfare tactics.
Hasenauer, H. "F/X for Urban Warfare" Soldiers June 1998 Pages 7-9.
The facility engineers building the first urban combat training center for armor units made realism a priority. In working on the Fort Knox (Kentucky) facility they visited urban training sites around the world and assimilated lessons learned from Bosnia. At the time of the article, the 26-acre complex had 21 structures with an opening date of June 1999. While the training site was primarily for the use of the Armor School, it would also be made available to non-school units. Commanders will be able to expose their troops to situations ranging from urban unrest to mid-intensity combat situations.
The facility will include everything from synthetic sewer stench, to computers, to a bridge that emits smoke as though it were on fire, and "blow out" roofs that allow troops to break through buildings without permanently destroying them. Rooms will have furniture, yards will have playground equipment, and cars will line the streets. Computers will operate .50-caliber compressed-air flame points and 37 mm antitank paint ball launchers. In "Non-Lethal Weaponry: From Tactical to Strategic Applications," Dennis Herbert, a retired Marine colonel, examines the technical evolution of non-lethal weapons, their growing relevance to the operational and strategic levels of war, and the challenges that still exist in developing and applying non-lethal technologies. Herbert contends that advances in non-lethal technologies will, in the current and anticipated geostrategic environments, enable the US military to respond to a broad range of contingencies with greater flexibility.
Herbert notes that the implications of tactical events extend beyond national boundaries, thus requiring troops capable of responding to tactical events in such a way as to not endanger strategic interests. Herbert also contends that non-lethals provide commanders with a means of responding to tactical events in such way as not to turn local popular support and international opinion against America's military actions. Finally, in light of the trend of global urbanization, Herbert believes non-lethal technologies offer the warfighter a means of operating in populated urban environments without causing an undue number of civilian casualties.
With regards to the future of non-lethal technologies, Herbert believes the disjointed acquisition of tactical weapons will yield to the coordinated development of a family of non-lethal technologies for employment at the tactical, operational, and strategic levels of war. He cites two reasons for this shift: the effective use of non-lethal weapons at the operational (and strategic) level of war in Desert Storm (e.g., computer viruses, carbon fibers) and the naming of the USMC as the executive agent for the development of nonlethal weapons.
In closing, Herbert notes that DoD and the services must address some legal, ethical, and environmental issues before employing non-lethal technologies as a familiar and useful option for military commanders.
Hewson, H.J. "Light/Attack Helicopter Operations in the Three Block War" Marine Corps Gazette April 1999  In this article Major Hewson, a Marine Corps Cobra pilot, addresses the role a Marine light/attack helicopter squadron can play in urban operations. He sees the helicopter squadron's flexibility as key to its role in the "Three Block War." In lower threat scenarios the Huey is an excellent platform for high situational awareness overwatch and casualty evacuation. Hueys can also provide quick mobility when mines, roadblocks, or rubble prevent safe ground movement. When enemy forces employ "hugging" tactics their closeness to friendly forces can preclude the use of fixed-wing air support. Attack helicopters can also act as a substitute for fixed-wing aviation.
Hewson states that within the Marine Corps there is a belief that helicopters are not survivable in the city. He calls that reasoning flawed. While the shoot down of several UH-60 Blackhawks in Mogadishu received much attention, what is often forgotten is that both Cobra and AH-6 Little Bird attack helicopters flew extensively without loss. In Chechnya the Russians lost only 12 helicopters in over 6,000 combat support missions. The lesson from those examples is that the aircrews can quickly develop tactics that greatly enhance their survivability.
Unfortunately, Marine helicopter urban training opportunities are rare. Currently, urban live fire ranges do not exist for aircraft-delivered munitions. Hewson believes that while the risks of operating helicopters in the city may seem high, they can succeed with the right mix of tactics and training.
Hollis, M. "Platoon Under Fire" Infantry January-April 1998 Pages 27-34.
In "Platoon Under Fire," Captain Mark A.B. Hollis, describes his platoon's actions during the October 3-4, 1993 battle in Mogadishu, Somalia. The mission, conducted by the UN Quick Response Force, was to rescue elements of Task Force Ranger, isolated and under attack after the shoot down of their Blackhawk. One of the platoons involved in the rescue and recovery operation was itself become separated and encircled by hostile forces. It had to break out and link up with friendly forces.
The battalion rotated missions between its three companies: Companies A, B, and C. In addition to its three rifle companies, the battalion had engineering, transportation, and artillery support. Captain Hollis led the 2d Platoon, Company A, 2d Battalion, 14 th Infantry, 10 th Mountain Division. Company C was assigned the QRF mission initially, and attempted the rescue via 5-ton trucks. They sustained heavy losses as the trucks proved easy targets for Somali irregulars with rocket propelled grenades. Company A, initially in support, then reinforced.
The plan called for Pakistani tanks to lead 2d Battalion soldiers aboard Malaysian armored personnel carriers to the Blackhawk crash site. The tank crews decided to cut their escort duties short of the crash site, leaving the APCs on their own. The APCs did what APCs are supposed to do, protect the infantry from small arms fire, but were all destroyed, when attacked with RPGs. The platoon, on foot, became separated from the rest of the force. Small attack helicopters (the special operations AH-6, a modified light observation helicopter) provided effective close air support.
Once the tanks left the formation and the APCs were destroyed, combat was at close range with small arms, grenades, and smoke. Holes were blown in walls. Urban structures provided cover and concealment. Communications problems were common.
A few lessons emerge from this article.
• Tanks. Because the Pakastani tanks left the formation early, there is not much to learn about heavy armor from this event.
• Armored Personnel Carriers. Limited visibility and thin armor were problematic.
The light armor was no match for unsophisticated and common weapons like rocket propelled grenades.
• Trucks. Inadequate against small arms and RPGs at close range from concealed positions • Infantry. Small unit tactics and short range weapons were key to survival. Small units will function independently intentionally or otherwise. Even the smallest units must be combined arms teams.
• Aviation. A small observation helicopter adapted to infantry support, armed primarily with small caliber automatic weapons, showed great utility.
Problems stemming from the US soldiers' lack of familiarity with allied weapon systems are more a problem of coalition operations than of urban operations. The last minute formation of combined arms teams is also problematic, but is a well-known lesson applicable across environments. Guerilla targets were soft and included government buildings and infrastructure. Targets had political and psychological, not military significance. The Afghan urban guerilla fought small, short duration fights, mostly at night. Operations tended toward raids and ambushes. Key to ambushes was the guerilla's ability to collect detailed knowledge of the occupying force's position and movement. Kidnapping of political prisoners and capture of military prisoners were often objectives. Arms capture was a common theme of operations. Operations were conducted by small groups numbering 5, 15, or 50 fighters. Such groups were never strong enough to capture a city, but through their actions created a siege mentality in the city populace, while diverting enemy troops from the main battle in the countryside. The Soviets and the DRA either exerted dominant physical control, or had none at all. Guerrillas in the city were surrounded by potential informants. Government forces could react to insurgent acts more quickly in the city than in the countryside. Insurgents were typically forced to move through the city unarmed. As a result, many lived in the countryside or suburbs and commuted to town for operations. Larger units had to secure their routes of ingress and egress with up to two-thirds of their force. Guerrillas masqueraded in captured uniforms. Some worked by day in official government capacity. Soviet conscripts were easily corrupted. Uncertainty was the norm.
The AK-47 was the most common weapon, but handguns with silencers and knives were also numerous. The RPG-7 was the standard heavy weapon, but some larger units employed mortars and 82 mm recoilless rifles. Guerilla communications were very weak.
Unsophisticated bombs were frequently employed, placed inside buildings or hidden under pushcarts with produce for sale to military personnel. The results of bombing were lethal and often indiscriminate, but less so than the aerial bombardment employed by Soviet air forces. Explosives and detonators were often transported by the elderly or the young and placed inside government buildings and meeting rooms by insiders.

• FM 90-10-1, A Guide To Combat In Built-up Areas, and
• FM 90-10-X, MOUT Mission Training Plan.
Having covered doctrine on the publications front, the author turns his attention to a handful of other issues. The first is the USIPECT Concept (understand, shape, isolate, penetrate, exploit, consolidate, and transition) that he elaborates on in tabular format. USIPECT will likely replace the formerly accepted four phases of offensive operations in MOUT: reconnoiter the objective, isolate the objective, secure a foothold, and clear the built-up area. [n.b., USIPECT has already been made obsolete by 
USECT.]
The role of UAVs will include use as reconnaissance assets, forward observers, and target designators, and in a close air support role. The Air Force contribution appeared limited to the use of PGMs, but some refinement will be necessary to allow standoff distances without lost of accuracy.
Combat support and combat service support issues were plentiful, particularly the role of engineer branch specialties: combat engineers and construction engineers. The skills needed in the urban environment include breaching obstacles, opening or destroying buildings, smoke, casualty evacuation and vehicle recovery. The list of logistics issues can be summarized as "constant improvisation."
Lamont, R.W. "A Tale of Two Cities -Hue and Khorramshahr" Armor May-June 1999 Pages 24-26.
Lieutenant Colonel R. W. Lamont's "A Tale of Two Cities" succinctly and clearly captures a handful of meaningful lessons about armor in urban environments. He uses two short case studies, one of the US vs. NVA in Hue 1968, the other the 1980 battle of Khorramshahr in the Iran-Iraq war. The two cases are well chosen, both cases having much in common, but each having something unique to offer.
In 1968 the city of Hue had a population of 140,000 with suburbs and an older city center divided by a river. The rural area surrounding the city was contested. Two friendly compounds were in the city, the MACV command post and an ARVN division headquarters. The NVA had no armor throughout the 22-day battle. The marines had infantry, M-48 tanks, and Ontos antitank weapons (small, tracked, lightly armored, with 6 externally mounted 106 mm recoilless rifles and a .50 caliber machine gun, long gone from the USMC inventory).
Phase one of the operation was to reach and relieve the MACV compound. Forces initially available, and later designated Task Force X-Ray, were a Marine rifle company joined en route by a tank platoon. The approach to the city was by truck, but infantry moved to tanks to enter the city. The force made a rapid penetration to the MACV compound before the enemy could react.
Following the penetration and relief, Task Force X-Ray grew to infantry battalion size with a platoon of M-48 tanks and Ontos antitank weapons. The larger force allowed the second phase of offensive operations to commence. The tanks provided direct fire support and relief of small infantry units under fire. In addition, the tanks could open new routes by knocking down walls to allow infantry maneuver and casualty removal. In tactical operations, tanks led and infantry followed.
X-Ray grew to an infantry regiment with a tank company and an Ontos company. Weather reduced the air support that the marines were accustomed to, and additional fire support requirements fell to the tank and Ontos. Phase three began. Tactics included a pairing of tank and Ontos. The tank provided pinpoint fire, the ability to draw out the enemy, and protection. Loaded with shotgun-like canister rounds, the Ontos fired all six of its recoilless rifles at close range providing an area weapon that forced the enemy to ground. When tank ammunition was exhausted, assaults stopped. Combined arms operations were absolutely necessary. Ammunition consumption rates were higher than planning factors for heavy field fighting. Casualties were high for both defender and attacker.
Like Hue, Khorramshahr, had both suburbs and a center city. The city of 175,000 had a strategic location and was near a waterway. Both Iranian and Iraqi forces had armor and infantry, but the Iraqis had numerical superiority in both. Casualties for both defender and attacker were high during the 25-day battle.
The Iraqis initially penetrated through the suburbs quickly. There were tank battles in the suburbs, but Iranian tank and infantry teams in the defense halted the Iraqi advance on several occasions, forcing armor/infantry combined arms attacks to overcome the defender. The Iraqis' ability to conduct effective combined arms attacks was apparently not impressive, and eventually the uneven force ratio determined the outcome. In the city core, however, tanks operated in a supporting role, firing down long streets, for example. Infantry went from house to house clearing stubborn resistance. The IDF fielded a mechanized, technologically advanced, casualty sensitive first world army against both conventional (Syrian) and unconventional (PLO) opponents in a media-saturated, third world urban environment. The PLO was well-financed and wellarmed guerilla organization equipped with Western and Soviet Bloc small arms, antitank weapons, artillery, mortars, and a few old tanks. The Syrian army was a conventional force equipped with Soviet equipment. The IDF employed nine heavy divisions and planned to move rapidly through and bypass resistance; follow-on forces reduced bypassed enemy strongpoints.
Tyre, the southernmost of the three cities, lies on a peninsula, with densely populated PLO camps inland to the east.
• One IDF division was employed. It surrounded Tyre on the first day. Its attack commenced on multiple axes, including an amphibious landing. Struck with surprise and mass, the PLO fell back. Then, the IDF began to clear PLO camps slowly. The remaining PLO positions were isolated and reduced with infantry, direct fires from tank and self-propelled artillery, indirect fires, naval gun fire, and close air support. • Initially, infantry advanced in M113 APCs, but were successfully ambushed by PLO anti-tank teams. The IDF quickly adapted, moving infantry forward on foot, with APCs ferrying supplies forward.
• There were civil affairs and psychological operations failures. Civilians were warned to move to the beach, but there were no plans to care for them. Large numbers of refugees left the city, masking PLO movement and ambush sites.
Sidon is a large coastal city that allowed an amphibious assault to complement overland and air operations.
• The Israelis employed three divisions with one in an amphibious approach.
Again, the attack was rapid and from multiple directions and followed by deliberate clearing. The Israelis subdivided enemy positions and reduced them with direct and indirect fires. • PLO resistance was sporadic but fierce. Civilians masked positions and movement.
• Infantry led the penetration of the city, with tanks supporting. Self-propelled artillery and close air support aircraft also provided support. The Israelis cleared the city in two days.
• Penetration of the camps, however, was led by tanks. Inside the camps, infantry led. The PLO continued resistance for five days.
Beirut was the largest of the three cities, spanning 50 square kms with over one million inhabitants. Like, Tyre, it is a peninsular city with modern skyscrapers. Beirut housed between 10 to 15 thousand PLO and 2 to 5 thousand Syrian troops. Fighting lasted three months.
• The Israelis employed a divide and conquer strategy (salami slice) to force the PLO into increasingly smaller areas. Only known PLO areas were attacked. First, the Israelis isolated, then attacked these areas with company-sized teams of infantry, tanks, and self-propelled artillery, CAS, and indirect fires. • In Beirut, the IDF placed greater reliance on fires than on building-to-building clearing by infantry. It limited fires to PLO-held areas. Infantry advanced after PLO positions had been isolated and then saturated by fires.
• There was an early fight between Israeli and Syrian forces for the major east-west route out of Beirut to Damascus. Control of the highway kept Syrians at bay and allowed the IDF to concentrate on PLO strongholds.
The PLO left Lebanon, but Israel continued to occupy a buffer zone between Lebanon and Israel at the time of the article. This article reviews the actions of the US military in the 1992 Los Angeles Riots and the Brazilian Armed Forces in countering criminals in Rio de Janeiro in 1994-1995. The author states that lawlessness and organized crime have become necessary components of national security planning and analysis. Criminal activity is woven into many security threats such as: weapons proliferation, drug trafficking, terrorism, insurgency, and illegal immigration.
The 1992 Los Angeles Riots lasted five days, killed 54 people and caused an estimated $700+ million dollars damage. National Guard troops deployed on the second day. Civilian leaders viewed the Guard's deployment as too slow. However, much of that delay came from a late order. The Guard ultimately deployed 10,465 troops to Los Angeles. By the third day the Guard troops were federalized and federal troops began showing up. The actual number of federal troops was not that large, but sufficient to put a federal officer in charge of Joint Task Force-Los Angeles.
Once federalized, the Guard troops became less responsive in support of law enforcement agencies. The cause was the Posse Comitatus Act, which was intended to exclude regular military forces from domestic police activities. It does not apply to Guard forces operating under the command of a state governor. The JTF-LA chain of command applied a test to all requests for assistance from law enforcement agencies to check for compliance with the Act. This proved an unnecessary constraint, as the Act does not necessarily apply in cases of unexpected civil disturbance.
There were problems with both rules of engagement and leadership. The incoming Federal commander ordered more restrictive rules of engagement on day four. When questioned by forces in the field, the chain of command replied that the rules of engagement should not be interpreted literally. This reflected a failure to confront the difficult issues associated with urban combat in a peacetime environment. The politically charged interagency environment affected the quality of direction given by civilian leaders to the military.
The lessons learned from the 1992 riots were: trained civilian leaders are critical to success, plans and exercises should include all potential contributing parties, the troops need better radios for the urban environment, the troops need better protective gear, and non-lethal means are needed.
From November 1994 to January 1995 the Brazilian military conducted Operation Rio in Rio de Janeiro a city of 12 million people. The mission was to take back control of the 4 to 5% of the city's ghettos controlled by criminal gangs. These gangs had won over the local population by distributing food, medicine, and money, where state services had failed. Police in these areas were unmotivated, ineffective and often in league with the gangs. By 1994, the level of violence throughout the city had reached a level that the political leadership of Brazil decided to act through military force.
Planning was guided by several restrictive imperatives established by the Federal Government. These factors became a foundation for concepts of operations and the tactical rules of engagement later issued to the troops.
• Maintain Institutional Normalcy: The legal environment surrounding the operation would be kept as close to normal as possible. No significant new restrictions would be put upon the civilian population and the military would act in a police-like role. A special emphasis was placed on maintaining the reputation of the Armed Forces by avoiding innocent civilian casualties. • Limited Time-frame: The operation was to have a short three-month duration.
Then control of contested areas would revert to the local government to minimize the loss of combat readiness by military units.
• Sustain Legitimacy: An important measure of success would be an increase in popular support for the local government.
• Lack of Information: The local police had not established a useful criminal intelligence system. The military had to develop its own interagency intelligence system.
Unity of command was achieved when the Brazilian President and State Governor placed the Federal and State Police elements under the military's control. The operation was composed of three overlapping phases: isolate, police, and combat. The isolate phase was designed to cut off the gangs from both their outside sources of contraband (mainly drugs) and their customer base in the city. The police phase involved aggressive patrolling in high-crime areas. The combat phase focused on confronting gang strongholds. These areas were often encircled and then searched building by building.
The results of the operation were remarkable. While conducting the operation under intense media scrutiny polls showed a 90 percent approval rating among the populace. Throughout the operation no innocent bystander was injured or killed. Later in the operation the intelligence effort received a major boost as citizens began calling in information on the police hotline. One downside was that the main "drug lords" did manage to get out of the city before the operation got underway.
Packard, S.E. "Bottom Line: It's Infantry" Proceedings November 1998  This article focuses on the doctrine and organization of the US military relevant to urban OOTW. The author states that urban operations emphasize the employment of infantry, while reducing the effectiveness of aircraft, tanks, artillery, and technology. Because the urban environment limits mobility, communications, and fire support, traditional US advantages are reduced. Dominant battlespace knowledge is not credible in the urban environment. However, US doctrine has not kept pace with the needs of urban combat.
Several social forces are driving combat to the cities. As wealth and power gravitates to cities, power seekers have focused on the cities to gain legitimacy and infrastructure. As urbanization continues to grow unabated it breeds a disenchanted constituency ripe for subordination. With the advanced surveillance systems in the US inventory the best place for a foe to hide is in plain sight, among the masses of people in a city. The presence of noncombatants also will cause US forces to be restrained in the use of firepower.
There must be doctrine not only to deal with the challenges of the urban environment, but also to handle the range of potential operations. Doctrine focuses on an abstracted enemy while in OOTW the focus is on the people. For a mission to have legitimacy, both the US public and the locals where the mission is taking place must approve of the mission. Apparent disregard for local political sovereignty, apparent disregard for the local territorial integrity, and or excessive civilian casualties can erode public support.
Marines are taught to rely on combined arms. Unfortunately, the combined effects of OOTW, urban terrain, and the actions of the enemy will strip away the synergistic effect of integrating multiple combat arms. Tanks are death traps in urban combat, as evidenced by Stalingrad and Grozny. Anything other than direct-fire weapons may have marginal value. The only indirect-fire weapons that will have widespread utility are those that can make sharp course corrections while in flight (i.e., 90° around a building). Aircraft are too vulnerable and incapable of delivering precision fires in the urban environment.
Stripped of the support of combined arms the infantry must adapt with innovative tactics and flexible organization. To interface with any area's inhabitants US forces must establish a continual presence. Time on the ground builds the relationship with the locals, which pays HUMINT dividends. It also makes possible pattern recognition allowing for a "heads up" when changes are forthcoming. Dispersed infantry operations facilitate rapid convergence to a hot spot, a tactic used quite effectively by the Somalis in 1993. There are risks with dismounted infantry movement in the city. However, dismounted infantry does not have to move down restricted streets where the primary killing zones are. They can move building to building, following the urban guerillas wherever they go.
Current military communications are inadequate for urban operations. Given the conditions likely in the city the best course of action is to teach Marines to act autonomously. Operations on the dispersed urban battlefield call for new organizational structures. One interesting model for organizations that face dynamic environments is called a "command network." In a command network the organizational structure changes with each situation, depending on the specific task and overall mission. Its effectiveness depends on collecting all the data possible, appropriate analysis, and passing the data to the lowest level possible. Command networks depend on high levels of crossdepartment communication. The bottom line is that infantry operating with flexible organizational structures can maintain a legitimate presence in urban OOTW.
Peters, R. "The Human Terrain of Urban Operations" Parameters Spring 2000 Pages 4-12.
In "The Human Terrain of Urban Operations," Ralph Peters argues that the human characteristics of an urban area are as important to warfighters as the city's physical characteristics. Focusing more on peacekeeping operations than combat operations, Peters identifies three types of cities:
• Hierarchical cities characterized by a broadly accepted chain of command and rule of law. In exchange for some civil responsibilities (e.g., taxes, standards of public behavior), the citizenry expects certain protections and services. This is the traditional form of the city. In terms of military operations, Peters believes that hierarchical cities "…can provide bitter prolonged resistance to an attacker. Paradoxically, they can be the easiest to govern once occupied if the population recognizes its interests lie in collaboration." • Multicultural cities are cities in which "…contending systems of custom and belief, often aggravated by ethnic divisions, struggle for dominance." In these cities, contending groups struggle at weighing the balance of power in their favor. Peters uses Jerusalem as a prime example of a multicultural city. With regards to military operations, Peters believes that "…multicultural cities can be easy to conquer-with the aid of oppressed minorities as a fifth column-but difficult to administer after peace has been established." Peacekeeping often becomes a constant struggle to appease competing groups, thus drawing the occupiers into ethnic and cultural arguments not easily resolved.
• Tribal cities are cities in which differences rest in blood (tribes) instead of race or religion. Peters contends that urban areas draw impoverished young males from outlying areas. This influx of a volatile population bound by blood makes conflict resolution difficult if not impossible. This type of environment provides the peacekeeper with several challenges: 1) difficulty in differentiating between the warring parties, 2) difficulty in collecting intelligence on clans and tribes, 3) clan and tribal hatreds are usually deep-seated and difficult to resolve.
Peters concludes by noting that this taxonomy provides the military professional with a "crude framework" for thinking about the challenges of operating in urban environments. He ends with the observation that "…the center of gravity in urban operations is never a presidential palace or a television studio or a barracks. It is always human."
Peters, R. "Our Soldiers, Their Cities" Parameters Spring 2000 Pages 43-50.
In "Our Soldiers, Their Cities," Ralph Peters contends that urban operations are an unavoidable aspect of future military operations. He further contends that the US military, as currently structured, is grossly unprepared for operating in the urban environment. The article then proceeds to list and describe several different facets of military operations in urban terrain that need consideration before the US military operate effectively within the urban environments of the next century. Some of the facets requiring consideration and resolution include:
• The nature of urban warfare. Peters notes that military organizations prefer horizontal conflicts (e.g., fighting on the plains of Europe in a Third World War) whereas urban operations are decidedly vertical (i.e., extending above and below the street). This difference will complicate military operations through the separation and compartmentalization of military forces. Furthermore, the existence of large and often segmented civilian populations will also complicate urban operations. • The organization and equipment of military units. Peters contends that urban operations will be manpower intensive (which runs contrary to the US preference for advanced technologies performing human functions) and will require enhanced medical and communication capabilities, more effective weapon systems (e.g., personal weapons, shotguns, personal thermal imagery systems), and innovative combat units (e.g., sapper platoons in infantry battalions). While Peters believes infantry will play a central role in urban operations, he also believes that there is a need for direct fire capability at the tactical level as well as a means of moving infantry and supplies rapidly and safely through hostile environments.
• The role of intelligence and civil affairs. Intelligence and civil affairs, often perceived as under-appreciated aspects of military organizations, will play an increasingly important role in urban operations. Intelligence professionals will perform a variety of tasks and need to enhance their human intelligence capability. Civil affairs and psychological operations will merge with the intelligence capability to improve their efficiency and effectiveness.
• The need for discipline and training. The urban environment is full of stressors and distractions. As such, future warfighters will need to be extremely welldisciplined, in superb physical condition, and capable of making sound decisions. This article contrasts the demands of the urban combat environment with the concepts described in Joint Vision 2010. The author sees four primary challenges to JV2010 from MOUT.
• Command and Control. The technical and operational roadblocks to attaining the level of battlespace knowledge demanded by JV2010 are formidable. Current look-down radar and moving-target indicators work poorly in the urban canyons. Today's ISR assets do not distinguish hostile from neutral civilians. Dispersed units will be difficult to control when buildings block GPS and radio signals.
Comprehensive data bases need to be built on urban geography. • Precision Fires. Today's arsenal contains many weapons with arching flight trajectories of limited value in cities with multi-story buildings. GPS guided munitions could have their signal blocked by taller buildings. Weapons effects and penetration capabilities need to be reconsidered.
• Maneuver. Land vehicles will have to contend with rubble and craters in roadways. Helicopter will have to contend with swirling and unpredictable air currents around buildings. • Logistics. A major supply problem will be in dealing with the needs of the noncombatants masses. Rearming a variety of widely distributed units within a megacity may have to be addressed by caching or other innovative means.
An operational baseline of today's capabilities should be established to design and build future forces. Support tools and training need to be improved. The training of small unit leaders needs to be revamped as their role is paramount in urban operations. Training areas are too small and fail to replicate major urban areas.
Press, D.G. "Urban Warfare: Options, Problems, and the Future" Marine Corps Gazette April 1999 Pages 14-18.
This article was extracted from a report on a conference sponsored by the MIT Security Studies Program held in 1998 at Hanscom Air Force Base, Massachusetts.
The first question to ask in regards to urban operations involves their inevitability. Advocates of increasing American MOUT capability see future US leaders, regardless of strategic wisdom, ordering US troops into urban areas. Therefore, US urban capabilities must improve. Critics of improving MOUT capabilities see a better approach as educating US leaders as to the risks and difficulties associated with urban combat. A second question relates to technology's potential in the urban environment. Can US forces replicate in cities the dominance they have achieved in open terrain? A third question deals with alternatives to urban combat.
In dealing with these questions one can divide urban operations into three types: policing operations, raids, and sustained combat. The contention that urban policing operations have and will occur frequently holds true in this case. With proper training and equipment US forces should be able to police cities with low casualties.
Conducting raids is a more difficult proposition, but within the realm of possibility. The two biggest obstacles to most raids are intelligence and insertion/extraction. Improving intelligence capabilities may be the best way to improve the prospects for urban raids. Training and equipping US forces to operate effectively at night can best deal with the insertion/extraction problem. With investments in superior doctrine, training, and technologies, substantial military advantages can be achieved for urban raids.
Sustained urban combat is the most difficult and least likely type of urban operation. US forces have not been involved in sustained urban combat for three decades. America is unlikely to tolerate high military and civilian casualties that would accompany full scale urban combat unless the national interests at stake were large. A better alternative would be to establish a loose cordon around the city, while cutting off utilities to encourage desertion and rebellion by the populace against enemy forces. It is easy to think of scenarios in which US decision makers would want a city retaken quickly, but it is difficult to think of one where that attack would justify the costs and collateral damage.
There are often more attractive alternatives to sending US forces to fight in the cities. Humanitarian assistance can often be both cheaper and more effective in helping people overseas. The so-called "CNN Effect" of public outcry forcing interventions is overrated.
In sum, US forces should prepare for urban policing and raid missions, but they should not prepare for unlikely and costly sustained urban combat.
Reed, F. This article reviews the efforts of URBAN WARRIOR, a 14-month series of battle experiments conducted by the Marine Corps Warfighting Laboratory. The goal was to test tactics and technology specifically tailored for the urban environment.
The Warfighting Laboratory wants to avoid the historical approach to urban combat, one in which the city is cleared building by building in a slow and costly linear sweep. In order to win without heavy losses, Marine leaders need to have a wide variety of intelligence information. Laboratory officials believe that the tactical key is decentralized control of troops.
An important element in decentralized operations will be inexpensive short-range radios that would allow lower-level commanders to communicate directly with each other. The Laboratory is relying heavily on commercial available communications equipment to reduce costs and shorten acquisition cycles. Normal military acquisition times are far too slow to take advantage of rapid changes in many of the technologies useful for C 4 I in the commercial sector. One Marine officer argued, "We want to be able to buy new communications equipment about every three years at the bottom of the pyramid."
Another difficulty facing the Marines involves current equipment that is often ill suited for urban combat. Tank ammunition works poorly against buildings and most shoulder-fired rockets emit too much back blast to fire safely from inside a building. One unusual solution is Dragon Fire, an unmanned 120 mm mortar. It was relatively inexpensive to develop and can fire 10 rounds per minute from a 32-round magazine. The weapon has its own GPS receiver and a squad leader can exercise remote control if needed. Another weapon being considered is a fiber optic guided missile. This weapon could be flown around buildings on the way to targets while providing a camera view back to the person controlling its flight.

This article reviews the Marine Corps efforts on MOUT through its Urban Warrior exercise. The author states that because future foes will not directly challenge US military forces in the open, they will seek arenas that limit the US military advantages. Cities could serve that purpose.
The Urban Warrior exercise, begun in 1997, sought to find solutions to urban combat before marines need them in actual combat. To economize, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) equipment was used where possible. With its purpose to test concepts, Urban Warrior made extensive use of simulation. In one exercise, a helicopter was outfitted to simulate a future UAV. Non-lethal weapons that could incapacitate those in a building were also examined as a long-term alternative to room-to-room fighting. Quickhardening rigid foam was under consideration as a future technology. Its use would allow the quick sealing of rooms, sewers, and subways. Blue-on-blue engagements were another concern. By improving situational awareness, the Marines hope to reduce friendly-fire incidents. By improving the use of computers, they hoped to reduce the size of headquarters units. Some of the solutions were decidedly low-tech. New gray uniforms with a brick-like pattern blend in much better than the standard green. Knee and elbow pads allowed troops to crawl on concrete without injury. Captain Chad A. Rupe describes the "road to war" and the aftermath of the battle of Chechnya between December 1994 and February of 1995. Many of the lessons are not unique to warfare in urban settings, including poor intelligence, poor leadership, and hubris. Perhaps most important was the misidentification of the rebel leader rather than the Chechen farmer's plight as the center of gravity. That is, confusing conventional warfare with insurgency warfare.
Chechnya is home to two ethnic groups, the Ingush and the Chechens. Ethnic Chechens wanted independence from Russia, while the Ingush wanted more autonomy within the Russian Federation. Yeltsin openly backed the Ingush against the Chechens in a civil war from 1991 to 1996. The Ingush attacked Grozny, the capital of Chechnya, in November 1994, backed by Russian advisors and air power, but the attack failed. Russia then responded to the defeat with a three pronged attack against Grozny in December 1994. The final objective was the Presidential Palace and the rebel leader. The main effort came from the north, with supporting attacks from east and west. The advance from the west was thwarted by civilian blockades. The northern force penetrated the city without waiting for supporting forces.
The Chechens defended in three concentric circles around the Palace. The outer perimeters on the city outskirts and the middle perimeter 2 to 5 km from the palace were formed of strong points. The inner perimeter, about 
1.5
Russian intelligence preparation was abysmal. The Russians misgauged the center of gravity to be the rebel leader rather than the Chechens. They did not even possess adequate maps of the city. Perhaps as important as the intelligence failures, or as a result of them, the Russians expected poorly trained civilian mobs to collapse without a fight. Guns were unloaded and troops were sleeping in the back of APCs during the attack.
The Chechens formed hunter-killer teams of three to four men each. Killer teams were composed of an antitank gunner with RPG, machine gunner, ammunition carrier, and sniper. These teams formed into groups of 15 or 20 fighters. Each group followed a Russian column through the city. Scouts (hunters) communicated with infantry (killers) over hand-held radios to set up ambushes. Destroying the first and last vehicle in the armored column then allowed the Chechens to destroy the remainder of the column.
The Russians began operations with superior numbers, 24,000 troops to 15,000 and 80 Russian tanks to 50 largely non-operational Chechen tanks. The Russians quickly learned that armored columns were easily defeated and formed combined arms teams of a tank, two fighting vehicles, and infantry to clear buildings. Indirect fire support from artillery and mortars was provided at the battalion level.
Approximately 25,000 Russian soldiers, rebels, and civilians died in the battle of Grozny. The death of the rebel leader did nothing to stop the fighting. Russian special police raped, murdered, and molested villagers, increasing the Chechen will to fight. Even after the Russians declared victory, the civil war continued.
The author recommends a company team formed around a mechanized infantry or tank company augmented by an additional tank section, leg infantry platoon, mortar section, combat engineer vehicle, and sapper platoon. He also suggests tactics, techniques, and procedures to deal with the problems of high and low angle of attack and adjacency of moving forces to occupied buildings.
He also stresses the importance of integral engineering assets. Engineers are needed to breach obstacles that form ambush sites. They are also needed to create new routes for maneuver and evacuation.
The ability for infantry, at the platoon level, to talk to commanders of armored vehicles was stressed. The author also recommends for increased training in urban warfare for mortar sections due to the smaller impact on the civilian population than other means of indirect fire.
Scales, R.H. Jr. "The Indirect Approach" Armed Force Journal International October 1998 Pages 68-74.
In "The Indirect Approach," General Robert H. Scales, Jr., Commandant of the US Army War College, asserts that rather than engaging enemy forces in urban areas, the US would be better off to isolate the city and let it "collapse on itself." In support of a renaissance for siege warfare, Scales contends that the human cost of operating in urban environments is a burden that neither the American government nor people will bear. By isolating cities and using time to advantage, Scales contends that US forces can bring about the collapse of an enemy without suffering unnecessary or unacceptable casualties.
Scales believes that future adversaries will try to minimize American combat effectiveness by using two strategies. The first involves a rapid military campaign to seize limited objectives, immediately followed by diplomatic maneuvering, which will attempt to impede and delay a US/coalition response. The second strategy, which might occur in conjunction with the first strategy, will have the enemy dispersing his forces within an urban area and settling in for a protracted, attrition-based campaign. Such a strategy would minimize US tactical mobility and combat effectiveness and play on casualty-aversion myth.
To counter the second strategy, Scales advocates the indirect approach-a strategy of isolating a city, using time to weaken the enemy's combat effectiveness and using standoff capabilities to engage the enemy-over the direct approach advocated by many within and without the Department of Defense. Once isolated, the population would be urged to leave. US and coalition forces would give former residents of the city safe passage to refugee camps. Scales asserts that the remaining population would then become a refugee burden for the occupying force. Eventually, a lack of supplies and popular support would bring about enemy capitulation. Thus the indirect approach would enable the United States to achieve its strategic objectives without the risk and cost that is associated with urban warfare.
Scales concludes with the caveat that the indirect approach will not always prove effective because of levels of popular support, pain and suffering thresholds, the amount of stored goods, the ability to seek respite elsewhere, etc. transition to civil authority can all contribute to the enemy's defeat. Strategic and tactical lift capabilities are integral to urban peacekeeping operations. The deputy MOUT ACTD division chief stated, "Just because a piece of equipment is not particularly high tech does not mean that it will not be a formidable addition to the inventory." trained in marksmanship, response to ambushes, and operations under riot conditions.
• For Infantry. Currently, special operations forces are trained and equipped for the kind of close quarter drills that take place inside buildings. For urban operations, regular infantry will need similar training and equipment.
• Equipment. Common tools, like the flash/bang grenade used to precede entry into a room, is not commonly part of standard training. This article, like others, argues for the full integration of combined arms at the lowest tactical echelons. Engineers have a strong roll to play. They built obstacles to canalize movement toward fortified checkpoints, and were required to relocate checkpoints overnight. The 2 d battalion, 87 th Engineers used "speed wiring" to cordon off portions of Kismayu in Somalia by driving a truck around the block designated for search, trailing rolls of concertina fence around the area in 15 minutes, allowing infantry to concentrate more on search than on cordon. Military Police were also integral to urban operations. They were instrumental in crowd and riot control and for searching cars for bombs, etc. The M1A1's armor and machineguns (not its main gun) were mentioned in passing. Its exhaust heat proved useful in dispersing crowds. The M551 Sheridan, a lightly armored, tracked gun system, also had a strong "presence factor." Light helicopters are useful at battalion level for overhead surveillance and for troop insertion on roofs. In "Air Operations in Low Intensity Conflict: The Case of Chechnya," author Timothy Thomas, a retired US Army lieutenant colonel and analyst at the Foreign Military Studies Office, examines the limited effectiveness of air power in low intensity conflicts. His thesis rests on a statement by General Charles Boyd, USAF (ret.) 2 and examines Boyd's argument in the context of Russian operations in Chechnya. The article then examines two specific aspects of the air war over Chechnya: Russian tactics and operations and an assessment of rotary wing and fixed wing effectiveness in low intensity conflict.
In the early phases of the 1994 campaign, the Russian military struck at Chechnya's limited air capability to preclude its use against Russian military targets or its use as crude guided missiles (e.g., kamikaze aircraft). Russia also used its air force to prevent the Chechens from establishing air bridges with other countries. In spite of these relatively effective operations, the Russian air force was the subject of severe criticism. Despite near complete air superiority (the Russians encountered a sporadic and relatively unsophisticated air defense capability), the civilian-to-"rebel" death ratio remained fairly high (approximately 8:1). Furthermore, many critics said the Russians learned little from Desert Storm as they had focused on the Chechen air force over command and control nodes, communications nodes, and important nodes in the infrastructure. To the Russians' credit, they realized that low intensity conflict offered the same opportunities for the use of information operations. Although, in the final analysis, the Chechens were judged masters of the information operations game.
The second aspect of air power that the author examines is the performance of both rotary-wing and fixed-wing aircraft in the campaign against the Chechens. The Russians extended rotary-wing tactics developed in Afghanistan (e.g., approaching targets at high speeds and low altitudes, making hard maneuvers on approach to the target, using electronic warfare assets) and used rotary wing aircraft in conjunction with fixed wing assets. However, the Russians had trouble coordinating rotary-wing aircraft with ground troops. Several factors contributed to this problem: units were often unable to collect or receive accurate and timely reconnaissance information; ground commanders were often unwilling to share their plans with pilots (instead, only providing them with specific instructions); and forward air controllers became favorite targets of the Chechens. Ultimately, Russian rotary-wing assets were of limited value in the conflict.
2 General Boyd, in an article that appeared in Foreign Affairs, noted that "a reliance on air power alone-the strike option-in this type of terrain with these types of targets has never held any real promise of conflict resolution."
Fixed-wing aircraft, because of their durability, emerged as the preferred means of air support in the campaign against the Chechens. However, for fixed-wing aircraft to perform effectively in the low intensity conflict, the aircraft had to be durable, capable of flying at low altitudes, capable of flying at low speeds, and capable of flying in all weather conditions. Timothy Thomas, a retired US Army lieutenant colonel and analyst at the Foreign Military Studies Office, provides the reader with a brief overview of lessons learned by the Russians in urban combat operations against the Chechens in the mid-1990s. While the bulk of the article focuses on lessons learned, Thomas also contemplates the implications and consequences of these lessons for future military operations in urban terrain.
Thomas identifies five lessons learned in the Russians' first campaign against the Chechen forces in Grozny.
• Know your opponent and his turf. Thomas relates how the Russians failed to understand either Chechen culture or the terrain on which operations would be conducted. They failed to consider not only the deep-seated hatred that a century of Russian domination instilled in the Chechens, but also cultural considerations such as adat (a revenge-based code of justice) and the nature of Chechen tribal relationships. Furthermore, the Russians failed to gain adequate situational awareness and understanding. For example, Russians typically had 1:100,000 scale maps when 1:25,000 (or better) scale maps were more appropriate. These failures enabled the Chechens to maximize both popular support and the terrain. • Don't assume-Prepare, prepare, prepare.
The Russians made several questionable assumptions in preparations for war against the Chechens. Among these assumptions were misreading the Chechen will, their own ability to plan and execute complex operations, and the readiness of the Russian units sent to Chechnya.
• Choose the right weapons. The confined and multi-tiered nature of urban terrain made some weapons and technologies preferable. The Chechens preferred rocketpropelled grenades (used as both direct and indirect fire support), cellular phones, commercial scanner systems, television signals, and the internet. The Russians preferred Kalashnikov assault rifles, grenade launchers, and flame-throwers, which flushed people and snipers out of buildings at significant distances and was as effective as 152 mm artillery. Both sides made heavy use of snipers to slow troop movements, force troops to take alternative routes, and demoralize their opponent.
• Adapt tactics to the situation. Fighting in the urban environment caused both sides to explore and exploit innovative tactics. The Chechens preferred a "defenseless defense" in which they could maintain mobility at the expense of developing and defending strong points. Other Chechen tactics included blending in with the civilian population when possible, "hugging" Russian units, and boobytrapping or mining chokepoints. The Russians became methodical about taking the city, building by building, and block by block, and adopted the use of combined arms teams (e.g., a combination of infantry, mechanized, and armored units) to conduct operations.
• Anticipate and resolve communications problems. Establishing and maintaining communications was the Russians' most significant technical problem.
Communication broke down at platoon, company, and battalion levels. This was complicated by the Russian's initial decision to transmit unscrambled messages, which enabled the Chechens to monitor and influence Russian message traffic. Furthermore, Russian soldiers carrying radios (with tell tale antennae) became prime targets for Chechen snipers. Russian after action reports recommended the acquisition of lightweight communications equipment, using cell phones and trunk-adaptable radios, and developing a common-use battery.
Additional lessons included the utility of non-lethal weapons, the psychological strain of urban operations, and that no two urban operations are alike. This article looks at the different approach Russian forces took in attacking Grozny in January 2000 versus their 1995 attack. The changes in Russian tactics were as follows.
• Improved political support from Moscow. The apartment building bombings in Moscow generated popular support for the war. Moscow gave the military a force 2 to 3 times larger than the one used in 1995. President Yeltsin also promised the military he would abandon frequent cease-fires that so irritated the military in the first Chechen conflict. • More cautious advance on the city. Instead of moving armor columns directly into the city, the Russians cautiously advanced to Grozny's outskirts. They then infiltrated several hundred snipers into the city to attrit Chechen forces and provide intelligence as to enemy location and movements.
• Improved use of fire support. For the first time the Russians decentralized their fire support system. They provided artillery support directly to smaller units, allowing for more responsive and effective support. Artillery hit Chechen forces at a distance, thus reducing Russian losses.
• Improved communications security. The Russians made much greater use of encrypting radio equipment.
• Winning the propaganda war. In 1995 the Russians lost the propaganda war by default. This time they made every effort to control the media and ensure that Moscow's view dominated public opinion.
• Improved PSYOPS. Russian forces waged an active campaign to encourage civilians to leave the city and erode support for the Chechen fighters. The Russians also planted false information about escape routes out of the city. When Chechen forces attempted to use these routes, minefields, and ambushes awaited. Some problems still remained for Russian forces. Friction between Interior Ministry troops and Defense Ministry troops continued. Chechen human intelligence often proved more valuable then Russian signals intelligence. Russian forces still did not possess a reliable identification friend or foe system.
Tuozzolo, J.J. "The Challenge of Civil-Military Operations" Joint Forces Quarterly Summer 1997 Pages 54-58.
In "The Challenge of Civil-Military Operations," author John Tuozzolo, a colonel in the US Army Reserve, examines the military's role in supporting two specific aspects of the Dayton peace accords (which ended the hostilities in Bosnia-Herzegovina in December of 1995): the creation of a "viable" central government and a functioning legal system. Initially, the roles of civilian and military agencies were separate and distinct. However, to overcome the political and social challenges of war-torn Bosnia-Herzegovina, the military had to cooperate and work with civilian agencies in unexpected ways.
Tuozzolo notes that despite a desire to limit the military to specific responsibilities detailed in the peace accords (separating and disarming the warring parties and enabling freedom of movement by civilians and non-governmental agencies), the actual conditions resulted in the military supporting civilians and civilian agencies in unexpected ways. Specifically, military civil affairs professionals assisted in the reconstitution of the legal system, the registration of voters, and producing and distributing educational material. While none of these missions were beyond the ability of uniformed civil affairs professionals, they were beyond the anticipated missions of IFOR. Despite the unexpected nature of the mission creep, a robust civil affairs capability enabled IFOR to perform its mission and enabled civilian NGOs to fulfill their missions.
Warford, J. "The Resurrection of Russian Armor: Surprises from Siberia" Armor September-October 1998 Pages 30-33.
"The Resurrection of Russian Armor" will be of great interest to those concerned about recent developments in main battle tanks and armored personnel carriers.
Both the Israelis and the Russians have fielded heavy armored personnel carriers (APCs) to overcome the demonstrated inadequacies of lightly armored APCs. The Russian BMP-2 proved vulnerable to Chechen rocket propelled grenades (RPG), and the Israeli's US built M113 fell short of the challenge in the 1982 war in Lebanon against the same weapons. The Russian BTR-T heavy APC and the Israeli Achzarit heavy assault carrier are both based on the old Soviet T-54 or T-55 cast steel hull with turret and main gun removed. Engine horsepower has increased, as has troop carrying capacity. The Achzarit is reputed to have advanced composite armor as well. The BTR-T will likely be fitted with Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor.
The article also recounts the main battle tank (MBT) arms race between the US Army and the Soviet Army. In 1988, the Future Soviet Tank FST-2 had a low-profile, unmanned turret with a 135 mm main gun, two-or three-man crew, layered composite armor capable of defeating NATO antitank weapons, and counter-optics capable of blinding NATO optical systems. The FST-2 prompted the US Army to adopt depleted uranium armor in its MBT. The FST-3 may have evolved into the Russian Black Eagle MBT, announced in 1997, although its specifications have not been made public. Some claims have been made that the main gun is 152 mm, but more common claims are that it will have a 135 mm to 140 mm main gun. The hull is welded, not cast, and will employ the Russian version of Chobham composite armor as well as the additional protection of Kontakt-5 reactive armor. A 1500 hp gas-turbine engine powers the tank. References were made to electro-magnetic armor that will revolutionize tank design. This article reviews the efforts of the Marine Corps to improve equipment stocks for urban combat. The author attended the Modern Day Marine Military Exposition that showcased various advanced equipment. The Exposition functions to allow industry to both interact with military personnel and check out what competing defense suppliers are working on. Several marines attending the show thought the equipment was too technical to be practical for combat or available in the near future. Another marine stated that marines take pride in being able to still get the job done will hand-me-down, less advanced equipment.
The Marine Corps Systems Command deals with research and acquisition of everything from combat boots to computers. One of the primary goals in the technology program is to move experimental systems out of the lab and get them to marines in the field quickly. For this reason the Corps is increasingly purchasing commercial off-theshelf products. The Marine Corps is also looking to outsource some of its various functions. This would free up personnel for more combat-related assignments. Outsourcing would also fit in conveniently with plans to create a lighter more lethal force.

The view was that the US lack of capability derived from several areas. One was a lack of joint training. Current facilities are not sufficient to permit joint exercises, they need to replicate cities in the Third World. Communications will also prove difficult in cities. The increased mental strain of MOUT would also be a factor; due to short engagement ranges and surprise. One attendee stated that the morale of the troops might give out before material resources did. Some suggested that the United States needs to dominate the urban environment like it does currently in the air. One official from the Office of the Secretary of Defense stated that the long-standing goal of taking the entire city is no longer valid.

The information they were given changed, as did the way it was displayed. Such an event may be termed a "small experiment" -discovering what a team of junior officers can do, given certain technological advantages.
This suggests a need to deconstruct major concepts into sub-concepts and subsub-concepts that can explored and evaluated in small-scale, individual experiments.
Once the sub-concepts have been refined, and confidence is gained in their feasibility and effectiveness, they can be integrated into more complex concepts for larger experiments.
Eventually, the larger concepts can be integrated into a single concept for a more comprehensive series of experiments to explore the complete concept end to end. The following diagram illustrates this idea. 
In years one and two, relatively simple sub-sub-concept experiments are conducted, and the results are integrated into three "medium-sized" sub-concept experiments in year three. In year four, all the parts are integrated for a "large experiment" to explore the complete concept. Throughout this process, sub-concepts will change -some will be improved, others may fail. Failure of a critical sub-concept could cause the complete concept to be rejected, but it is more likely that the learning that takes place in the early stages will cause the overall concept to be strengthened and refined.
Urban warfare and military operations in urban terrain (MOUT) have recently received greater attention within the US defense community. Demographics underline the growing urbanization of the world while historical experiences (especially the recent experiences of Russian forces in Chechnya) highlight the complexity of urban operations. This document provides an important input to the ongoing work of the Joint Advanced Warfighting Program to develop for the Department of Defense a comprehensive roadmap for urban operations. It provides an overview of the recent literature on urban warfare and MOUT, and summarizes key findings derived from the surveyed literature.
The authors limited their survey to articles that appeared in selected professional and academic journals from 1995 through 2000 listed in Table 
S-1
Common themes and open issues from the surveyed articles include:
• Current US capability is inadequate for the conduct of urban warfare or military operations in urban terrain, but the need to prepare for combat in urban environments is arguable.
• Current MOUT training facilities are inadequate. The size of the unit trained is too limited and facilities are often oriented on a single branch. Armor, artillery, and aviation fires are typically excluded.
• The nature of operations in urban environments is determined as much by human occupants as by physical structures.
• Inadequate intelligence preparation of an urban environment's human and physical characteristics is a common cause of failure.
• Isolating and dividing areas is a common and successful approach.
• Combined arms teams-including armor, infantry, artillery, aviation, engineers, snipers, and combat service support-form at the lowest tactical levels.
• The roles of aviation and light armor are unsettled. The evidence on their effectiveness is ambiguous.
• The physical environment makes communications problematic. The common need for wide-spread, distributed operations of small tactical units that rely on communications for survival exacerbates the problem.
• Rates of ammunition consumption are higher than in other forms of military operations. This fact strains already difficult and vulnerable logistics capabilities.
• Rules of engagement are critical. They must be simple, dynamic, and tailored to specific situations.
• Military operations in urban terrain will likely be combined, interagency, and joint. Exercises need to be designed accordingly. military personnel. The Marine Corps is also looking to speed up the acquisition process by purchasing off-the-shelf commercial equipment. (See 
[Willingham 1999
Colonel John J. Tuozzolo, in his article "The Challenge of Civil-Military Operations," discusses the complex role of military organizations in peacekeeping and peacemaking missions. He notes that, while military units perform the usual stability, security, and freedom of movement duties, they sometimes have new and unique missions to perform. In order to succeed, they must often work with civilian agencies to accomplish the overall mission of the civilian-military force. To accomplish this, military personnel must become more involved in the civilian process than originally envisioned. (See 
[Tuozzolo 1997
87.)
[Smith and Hofstetter 1999]
Under the Soviets, military doctrine posited that urban warfare would occur in conjunction with large-scale, high tempo offensive operations and that undefended cities would be captured, while defended cities would be bypassed. The military doctrine also assumed that the enemy was a professional soldier who valued the continued existence of cities over their destruction. The Russian campaign against Chechnya set existing military doctrine on its head.
The Russians envisioned the campaign against Chechnya as another march against Prague or Kabul, where the indigent military forces would offer little or no resistance. When the initial New Year's Eve assault on Grozny was repulsed, the Russians, rather than organizing and preparing for a campaign against the capital, responded by sending a hastily assembled force of composite units into the city as part of a police action. The result was a dismal failure.
Through these failures, and later experiences, the Russians identified several important lessons learned. These lessons include:
• Cities must be dissected. The Russians concluded that for urban operations to be successful, the city must be isolated, "key installations" on the fringes of the city must be seized, residential and industrial areas must be controlled and, finally, the military must destroy enemy units, clear mines, collect weapons, and establish control (e.g., curfews). • Intelligence is critical. Russian planning occurred without detailed maps (e.g., 1:25,000). Few Russian commanders had access to satellite-based or airborne imagery.
• Existing doctrine does not always suit current realities. The Russians used storm groups and storm attachments for urban operations. Such organizations proved to be counterproductive. The preferred solution was to augment or enhance existing organizations as the situation required. Compared with Afghanistan, Russian forces in Chechnya did not use air evacuation as much, particularly after Chechen forces shot down several medical evacuation helicopters. Wounded were normally evacuated in armored ambulance (BTR-80). In Grozny there was a higher percentage of burn wounds, and mortar fire caused the majority of wounds. The bulk of those killed were hit in the head or chest by sniper fire. While the normal ratio of wounded to killed was 3:1 or 4:1, in Grozny it was 1:3. Some of the lessons learned by Russian forces fighting in Grozny were:
• Medical facilities need to be closer to the fighting and better protected from enemy fire, possibly dug in.
• In constricted terrain armored ground transport is the preferred method of casualty evacuation.
• Burns, shrapnel, and sniper wounds are far more common in 
MOUT.
Two lessons emerged from the exercise. One was that the Marines got a close up look at the Army's state-of-the-art MOUT training facility. The buildings are fully instrumented to allow for detailed feedback on training evaluations. However, the facility suffers from the same drawback as every other MOUT training site, it is too small. It amounts to a village rather than the true cityscape future forces are likely to confront. While many strategic thinkers believe urban battles will be a major factor in future war, most training still focuses on the company level. The author argues that it is time for DoD to create a MOUT counterpart to the NTC and JRTC. Conceivably, one of the military bases subject to closure could provide the initial land and support facilities.
A second lesson was the effectiveness of small teams versus a conventional force.
The JRTC OPFOR has a conventional and guerrilla force. The guerrilla force operates in dispersed three to five man teams, with individual 82 mm mortars in support, and routinely achieves seven to one kill ratios against visiting units. The visiting units usually do better against the conventional opposing forces. That leads to the question of what small teams could achieve, if backed by air support and the firepower of modern American forces. The JRTC would provide the forum for future tests of an infestationstyle force against an Army brigade or Marine Expeditionary Force.
Kelly, J.F. "Simulation Support for the Urban Warrior Advanced Warfighting Experiment" Marine Corps Gazette January 2000 Pages 39-41.
Urban Warrior was a Marine Corps experiment to search for new concepts, tactics and technologies to fight and win in the city. It culminated in a live exercise in March 1999 in 
California.
Each marine possessed a GPS unit and MILES laser detection gear. The GPS system would give the marine's location (with 1-meter accuracy) and "health status" at all times when outside. Because GPS does not work well inside, each building used in the exercise was instrumented to show the location of the marines inside. The MILES gear uses lasers and laser detectors to simulate direct fire. The JCATS system allowed participants to request indirect fire missions via normal channels. The results of those fires would then be calculated by JCATS depending on: flight time of the incoming fire, location of impact, and the location of live participants. JCATS has the ability to model urban terrain in great detail. One large 9-story hospital had all 900 of its rooms modeled.
An Integrated Marine Multi-Agent Command and Control System (IMMACCS) tied the sensors together. It provided a near real-time common tactical picture down to the squad level. The system provided position and health status updates on each of the live participants roughly every 30 seconds. With the IMMACCS system urban combat training can incorporate indirect fire systems. As a result, training is more realistic and effective. • Urban combat is too costly and should not be done because it throws away the US technology trump card. Taking the view that urban combat is unavoidable may create a self-fulfilling prophecy. • Urban combat is not what the US military does best now but it is the wave of the future so it had better learn how to do it right. Rampant urbanization will place most of the world's people in cities. US military supremacy will push foes into the one environment they can survive in, the city. Third World cities may collapse under their own weight and create the need for humanitarian intervention.
US military doctrine advises the services to avoid urban conflicts whenever possible. Despite that, the Marine Corps, and to a lesser extent the Army, has taken the most aggressive stance in tackling the MOUT problem. Heightened US domestic political sensitivity to civilian casualties will make it impossible to use certain tried and true tactics, such as clearing a room by first blinding throwing in a grenade. Both the Marine Corps and Army have identified common challenges in MOUT. They say that urban operations will put a premium on reliable and timely intelligence. Unfortunately, current intelligence systems are not well suited for the urban environment. HUMINT requires increased emphasis. Some experts see it as a problem that only four of the Army's ten active division are infantry oriented. This could make conducting manpower intensive urban operations difficult. Urban communications also pose the problem of radio transmissions. Robots could prove a critical tool for future MOUT. They could clear mines, locate snipers and detect chemical and biological weapons. Some experts see the urban fight as putting a premium on airpower and close air support over traditional artillery and indirect fire, because of concerns about shell trajectories and the need for precision. The demands of urban warfare will also likely revolutionize armored vehicles.
While efforts are being made to improve urban capabilities, there are limits to the changes the Army and Marine Corps will make. Both services are resisting calls to form specialized urban combat units, citing the continuing need to conduct operations in open terrain.
FACING UP TO THE URBAN FIGHT  In this article, Lieutenant Colonel Lamont looks at the urban combat techniques used by North Vietnam in its 1975 Spring Offensive. To attack urban areas the North used a technique they first developed in the early 1950s called the "blooming lotus." This tactic avoided the defenses on the city's perimeter while driving fast-moving columns into the city center. Once in the interior the C 2 nodes there were attacked. Only then were the now leaderless and confused units around the city's perimeter defeated piecemeal. This approach contrasts sharply with the outside-in method of Western doctrine.
Two critical problems presented themselves to the Northern commander using this tactic. The first was to precisely locate both the forces guarding the city's perimeter and the C 2 nodes within. This required excellent intelligence collection. The North Vietnamese relied on the "revolutionary structure" HUMINT network within each city to supply that information. The second problem was securing key roads and bridges to permit mounted columns fast access to the city center. This was accomplished by infiltrating sapper and infantry teams prior to the attack. This again required intelligence on where these critical transport points were.
The key lesson for today's Marine Corps is the importance of HUMINT. Only by blending HUMINT with the technical side of intelligence collection can a MAGTF commander hope to identify the right centers of gravity.
Miles, J and Shankle, M. "Bradleys in the City" Infantry May-June 1996 Pages 6-8.
"Bradleys in the City" documents lessons derived from training a US Army mechanized infantry company at a MOUT site in Germany. A mechanized infantry company includes 14 M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicles (BFVs): three platoons of four BFVs each and one BFV each for the company commander and the executive officer. The authors' experience includes assignments as company commander, platoon leader, and other positions in Company C, 1 st Battalion, 15 th Infantry. The company's training included three phases: gaining an initial foothold in a city, moving tactically through a city, and establishing and securing a company-sized assembly area in a city.
The article assumes that the initial foothold in a city would be a building. Reconnaissance determines which building. BFVs deliver the assault force. The remaining BFVs support the assault by fire on the objective and adjacent buildings. The firepower of 14 BFVs was effective in isolating and suppressing buildings for the initial foothold. Diagrams indicate adequate fields of fire for 10 BFVs abreast with the other BFVs in the assault. Rather than a large assault force in the field, the authors argue that initial contact should occur with the smallest element possible, as is the standard in wooded terrain.
Movement through the city occurred with infantry deployed ahead of and behind each BFV. A six-man forward security element led, and a 4-man track security element followed. The basic battle drills for BFVs remain relevant but must be generalized from the ground plane to span positive and negative elevations.
The authors also discuss occupying and defending an assembly area. The defense was designed to exploit buildings, streets, and alleys. The defense was based on three platoon strong points inside buildings, BFVs covering vehicle avenues of approach, and infantry conducting security patrols. Because of the small number of approaches, many BFVs were positioned inside buildings or otherwise under cover.
The replacement of the M113 armored personnel carrier with the M2 Bradley fighting vehicle saw a significant decrease in manpower and gained firepower. The authors note that urban operations are manpower intensive. BFVs don't enter, clear, and hold buildings. The vulnerability of the lightly armored vehicles is a common theme in other articles based on real world operations, but not addressed by the authors. The company was pure, the typical organization in garrison, not the typical tank and mechanized infantry company team found in combat. The article leaves unanswered the question of whether or not the Army is planning on fighting with pure mechanized infantry in urban operations.
Peters recommends that the leader-to-led ratio be increased at the tactical level to ensure the maintenance of discipline and sound tactical decisionmaking.
Peters then closes with some recommendations that the US Army could implement to improve its ability to operate in urban environments.
Reed, J. "The Chechen War: Part III" Red Thrust Star October 1996 http://call.army.mil/call/fmso/red-star/issues/oct96/oct96.html#chechen.
Russian ground force commanders learned much while conducting operations in Chechnya. At upper levels, after-action assessments focused on the need to implement changes in tactics for urban combat, combat reconnaissance, and military-civilian interaction.
While Soviet history from World War II is filled with urban victories, the Russians seem to have forgotten much of what they learned. Chechen snipers greatly hampered Russian forces. In future urban operations, one can expect to see a greater number of Russian snipers and counter-snipers. Other likely changes to tactics include creation of an armored advance force and the creation of urban reconnaissance teams.
Russian air operations also performed poorly. One problem was inferior quality munitions, such as rockets fired from Mi-24 attack helicopters. Their motors would often fail to ignite and they would fall straight down onto friendly forces. The training level of the pilots was weak, and they were not prepared to function under fire. Unsecured radio links made ground units unwilling at times to give their position to friendly aircraft. This contributed to the inaccuracy of air strikes. The authors begin by stating that not all urban operations involve infantry intensive house-to-house fighting. The urban fight is a "joint fight," and a one-size-fits-all approach to the problem is a recipe for disaster.
The classic view of MOUT is that it negates traditional US military advantages. Proponents of this view see it as manpower intensive, mostly close quarters combat, requiring the use of low-tech solutions, and relegating aerospace aspects to a supporting role. Some "high-end" scenarios may warrant the political risks and human costs inherent in such an approach. However, most conflicts in urban areas will fall short of this mark, making such an approach an unrealistic military option.
A competing school sees the city as a system of critical nodes that US forces can identify and destroy using aerospace assets. By making these nodes the focus of operations, US forces can match their strengths against the enemy's centers of gravity without having to close. The authors then lay out a hypothetical concept of operations:
• Battle-Space Analysis. An important component of the concept, battle-space analysis encompasses intelligence preparation of the battlespace and maintenance of operational-level situational awareness. This view would come from a combination of space-based systems, manned and unmanned aerial vehicles, human sources, and archived data. • Isolation. This involves physically and psychologically separating an adversary from his urban support base. Associated with this would be the limiting of the foe's mobility, communications, and intelligence efforts. Isolation also implies the physical protection of the populace from enemy attack, exploitation, and collateral damage.
• Decisive Engagement. Aerospace power is absolutely pivotal in this component.
In the future, tactical strike aircraft will be more closely tied to UAV sensors.
• Sustainment. Sustaining the momentum of decisive-engagement operations will come from continual real-time analysis of the battle space, effects against key nodes, reinforcement, and logistical support to committed forces.
• Transition to Peace. The destruction of weapon stockpiles, the monitoring of activities of warring factions, the introduction of peacekeeping forces, and the
Smith, M.M., and Hofstetter, M. "Conduit or Cul-de-Sac? Information Flow in Civil-Military Operations" Joint Forces Quarterly Spring 1999 Pages 100-105.
In "Conduit or Cul-de-Sac? Information Flow in Civil-Military Operations," authors Michael M. Smith, a lieutenant colonel in the Army Reserve, and Melinda Hofstetter, a major in the US Marine Corps, assert that better relations between civil organizations and agencies (e.g., NGOs, PVOs) and military institutions (specifically at the battalion and brigade-sized units) must improve, if the military's performances in civil-military operations (CMOs) and military operations other than war (MOOTW) are to be more effective.
The authors contend that the increasing frequency of CMO and MOOTW requires a different approach to warfare; one in which warfare "…transcend[s] material destruction of property and populations to deal with the underlying economic, sociological, religious, and ethnic issues of society at large 
[p. 101]
Furthermore, the authors contend that the nature of NGOs-using relief workers to address specific and enduring problems-can serve as a major source for the collection of intelligence and improvement of situational awareness. Such a benefit is not without cost: the military must also share information with the NGOs. While there are several challenges to the realization of this type of information flow (e.g., NGO's frequent distrust of the military, interoperability, language), it can frequently be achieved through initiating personal relationships at the "worker" level.
Finally, the authors note that the military ought to monitor and exploit existing information sharing networks (e.g., government agencies, NGOs, media, public gathering locations) to gain information on and assess the situation in the area of operations.  Perhaps the strongest theme in this article is the importance of intelligence gathering at the individual soldier level.
• Urban conflict places civilians, regulars, and guerrillas together on the battlefield, thus complicating the rules of engagement and demanding training that includes large numbers of neutrals to complement the opposing force.
• The author argues that the individual soldier must be part of the intelligence gathering mechanism. Patrols amidst the local populace will need to be conducted to establish good will and detect changing patterns of behavior.
• Intelligence gathering is an individual soldier skill that needs development during standard training. After the initiation of hostilities during Operation Just Cause, a methodical search began for weapon caches and for Popular Defense Forces. Patrols were expected to gather and report intelligence information.
• Snipers may be incorporated to conduct surveillance and effect surgical kills on threats as they emerge.
The article has limited discussion of information technology, but does mention that at battalion level, remotely monitored battlefield sensor system, low-level voice intercept, and ground surveillance radar can augment the intelligence gathered from patrols. "Still, the subtleties of operating in urban terrain will make using these assets more of a challenge to operators and commanders."
The author also cites equipment shortfalls, including the need for a shotgun incorporated at the lowest tactical echelons. The shotgun is needed to breach doors and dispense crowd control agents. Its short range reduces the risk of non-combatant casualties.
The article has other implications for training.
• For CSS. The "frontless" urban environment requires CSS units to immerse themselves in the same environment as the infantryman. Therefore, they must be CONCRETE COMBAT Valceanu, J. "Concrete Combat" Soldiers June 1999  In this article, author Staff Sergeant John Valceanu describes the activities at the Shurgart-Gordon MOUT complex at Fort Polk, Louisiana. The facility is named for two soldiers posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions in Mogadishu. Units rotating through the Joint Readiness Training Center utilizes the complex.
The Center brings maximum realism to MOUT training. The $70 million dollar complex covers seven square kilometers and has 29 buildings. Some buildings are two to three stories tall and all contain appropriate furniture. Most rooms in the buildings are equipped with infrared cameras and microphones that allow observers to monitor what happens. Live-fire exercises can be conducted in some buildings up to platoon-level. Force-on-force exercises usually involve battalion-or brigade-size units against the resident OPFOR, the paratroopers of the Fort Polk-based 1 st Battalion, 509 th Infantry. A company of paratroopers, with an intimate knowledge of the terrain, can often repulse a battalion-size attacking force. Unit training also forces visitors to contend with "civilians." These role-players, provided by the JRTC, assume the roles of the mayor, the local Red Cross, and regular citizens. Units being trained must attempt to minimize civilian casualties, while countering intelligence efforts or hostile actions by the civilians.
The final piece of the training package is the after-action review. Using footage and sound bites captured by the facility's sophisticated audiovisual equipment, soldiers have a chance to watch and hear themselves.
