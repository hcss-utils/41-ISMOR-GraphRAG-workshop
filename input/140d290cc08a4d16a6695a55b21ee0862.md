The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union saw a realignment of the relationship between Russia and the United States.
The animosity of the Cold War gave way to a tenuous period of disarmament, cooperation, and transparency.0 F 1 In an effort to establish good relations with the US and its allies, Russia reluctantly met the stipulations of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty by re-allotting nearly half of the Soviet Union's tanks, artillery, armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft, and helicopters to the former Soviet republics and consolidating the Soviet nuclear arsenal with the Russian military.
The breakup of the Soviet armed forces resulted in the redistribution of four million Soviet military personnel and the creation of national militaries in the fifteen independent states that superseded the Soviet Union.
The haste and disorganization of the reformation left the initial post-Cold War Russian military with a deteriorating force posture, limited infrastructure, unaffordable defense industry, and contracting defense budget.
Thus, Russia struggled to develop and implement a national strategic concept that aligned with its international position and defined its interests, threats, and requirements.
The subsequent Russian national security doctrines from 1992 to 2000 proved to be inconsequential in terms of influence on policy and failed to generate any significant military reforms.
Rather, Russian political and military elites remained focused on maintaining Russia's status as a great power.1 F 2 Russia's position as an internal sovereign state and a great power form the core of its national identity and security focus.
Consequently, Russia's efforts to define the statuses of great power and sovereign statehood ultimately conflicted with the actions and interests of the US and its allies.2 F 3 Russia's security emphasis on great power status and state sovereignty serves to justify employing force internally, within its perceived sphere of influence, and in support of sovereign allied/partner governments.3 F 4 Accordingly, Russian misgivings and objections to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) enlargement rounds during 1999 and 2004 generated a nascent shift in Russian foreign security policy.
The improved US-Russian dialog that occurred towards the end of the Cold War included discussions regarding US efforts to develop pan-European security institutions that would not divide Europe and fulfil core Russian security interests.
Therefore, Russia did not conceive nor expect NATO expansion eastward.
Rather, Russia supported the development of pan-European multilateral security arrangements and organizations that respected its status as a great power and provided a public front for Russian influence.4 F 5 However, US efforts after 1991 included integrating institutions aligned with the US and its allies into the newly formed democracies of the former Warsaw Pact nations and Soviet Republics.5 F
