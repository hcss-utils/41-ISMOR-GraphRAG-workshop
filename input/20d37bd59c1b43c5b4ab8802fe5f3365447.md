Contrary to the anticipated trends in geopolitical factors, our assessment of ideological factors is not as grim.
Neither current major U.S. competitor, China and Russia, has a particularly ideological regime, certainly not in comparison with the regimes of the same countries during the earlier Cold War period.
Neither represents a globalized ideology with a ready-made set of potential partners throughout other parts of the world (and, conversely, potential local partners lack a ready-made ideology to appeal to China or Russia for assistance).
Indeed, while the extent to which these differences are sincere is unclear (and there are reasons to be skeptical), the main professed ideological difference that China and Russia represent relative to the United States and its allies is a focus on state sovereignty and the continuity of existing governments, regardless of their behavior or treatment of their people.
This stated ideology may or may not help increase their willingness to provide support to governments in the midst of civil conflicts, but it hardly seems likely to increase their interest in providing support to VNSAs.
