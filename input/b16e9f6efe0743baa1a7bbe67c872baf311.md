Aleksandr Golts also highlights that, due to the 2008 reforms, the military "had a clear mission.
They had to win in a short-term local conflict."
However, Golts notes that the only way to win a large-scale conflict with the West, given the reformulation of the military, was using nuclear weapons, pointing to the importance of strategic deterrence over a preparation for large-scale war in Russia's current strategy for the armed forces.
