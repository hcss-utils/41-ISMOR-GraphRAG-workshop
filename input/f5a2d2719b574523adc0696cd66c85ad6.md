The purpose of this study is to examine how Grassroots and Civil Society Organizations impact the application of United States strategy with regards to this strategic continuum, often referred to as the competition continuum.
This monograph looks to answer this question through an analysis of two different historical examples.
First, an examination of the roles of GRO/CSO in function provides an understanding of their strengths and weaknesses as potential partner organizations.
Second, a review of the role and use of GRO/CSO by the Russian government in Crimea and eastern Ukraine provides a timely case study to examine GRO/CSO as partners in strategy execution.
Third is an examination of how the partnership with GRO/CSO impacted the US' strategy in Syria combatting the Islamic State.
Fourth is an analysis of several critical issues inherent in dealing with these organizations provides a more rounded view of the problem set.
