Consider for a moment the strategic implications of a world in which the United States remains the predominate economic and military power, but is locked in multiple enduring rivalries with near-peer competitors-China, a resurgent Russia (assuming it overcomes its crippling economic and demographic challenges), and possibly even the European Union (particularly on the commercial level).
Simultaneously, a number of regional rivalries may be able to sustain themselves as the rivalries between those powers with global reach never would achieve the red-hot intensity that would force the rest of the world to pick a side.
Or conditions do not form where every act of other states is seen through the prism of the overarching "great rivalry."
Such a world would be prone to periodic dangerous flare-ups in widely disseminated locations.
Sustaining order in this world would require the United States (as the remaining dominate power) to undertake a very delicate balancing game between multiple powers.
Unfortunately, within such a global order the United States may be unable to dictate every solution.
Still, it may be one where the United States can still have a strong influence in most affairs-something similar to the United Kingdom from 1815 to at least 1914.
