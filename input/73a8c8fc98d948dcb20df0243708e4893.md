Since the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia has been cautious about entering into direct conflict with great powers such as the United States.
Therefore, Russia sought other means to gain asymmetric advantages during their rise in status to a great power competitor.
Russia's approach to gaining an asymmetric advantage is heavily reliant on a critical capability that has roots within Soviet history, with the distinguishing characteristics relating to ideology, technology, and the ability to more succinctly orchestrate activity across the elements of national power.
The modern Russian authoritarian regime has been more successful than the communist regime of the Soviet Union at managing the elements of national power within the great power competition by increasing its emphasis on active measures as a critical capability.
