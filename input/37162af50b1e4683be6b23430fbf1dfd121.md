In the meantime, China and Russia are more likely to pursue their objectives along the lines of a trend discussed in Chapter Five: operating in the gray zone and relying on incremental aggression or using covert military forces.
While the military forces of near-peer competitors are becoming more capable, Iran's and North Korea's conventional military capabilities are, in many respects, stagnating.
To compensate for these problems, both countries have developed asymmetric strategies and niche capabilities in efforts to offset superior U.S. and allied forces.
This will likely be a growing trend in the next ten to 15 years.
