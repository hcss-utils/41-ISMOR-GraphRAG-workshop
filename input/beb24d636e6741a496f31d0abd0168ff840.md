In many ways, Ukraine is a best-case scenario for Russian disinformation.
Russia knows Ukraine better and is far more intimately connected to Ukrainian culture, history, and politics than to most other countries.
Consequently, Russia might not be able to replicate in another context all of the tactics that it employed in Ukraine.
Nonetheless, Ukraine as a case study provides several important insights regarding Russian disinformation tactics on the operational level and illuminates some best practices that USAF and the joint force should consider if the need arises to respond to such activities in the future.
