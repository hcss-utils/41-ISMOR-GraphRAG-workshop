As Russia moved toward a conventional conflict with Georgia, Russian military forces were regularly mobilized for maneuvers near the Georgian border.
This overt military posturing was meant to intimidate the Georgians into giving certain concessions, and would ultimately ensure that the forces necessary for the actual invasion was assembled well in advance of the actual invasion.
On September 29th, 2006, Russia responded to the arrest of several GRU officers in Georgia by alerting the Black Sea Fleet and Russian Forces in the North Caucasus.
The fleet began maneuvers off of Georgia's coast and the army moved to the Georgian border.
These forces did not just show force, but implemented a full embargo on Georgia, preventing all commercial traffic and travel.
