In the future, despite Russia's proclaimed defensive strategic approach and preference to avoid major military combat with the West, there exist opportunities when the Russian military may go on the operational offensive for a short duration to achieve political objectives.
If Russia becomes an aggressor in the Nordic states of Finland or Sweden, for instance, it is likely that the Russian military will have approximately thirty days to operate before the West can levy an effective military response-if at all since these states are not NATO members.
At that point, it will likely be too late to affect change militarily without risking significant escalation that Western societies may not support.
Therefore, operational surprise, massing effects, and operational tempo will be critical in such a case to secure as much territory quickly and then sue for a political settlement or transition to defense in depth to repel a counteroffensive.
