Thus, Prussia rarely had the time to experiment and prove new ideas during conflicts or in the short intervals between wars.
An example of this time constraint is Moltke's brief window to absorb lessons from the American Civil War between that conflict's termination and the beginning of hostilities with Austria in 1866.
Furthermore, the short duration of the wars with Austria and France left Prussian leaders with no time to review, alter, and prove these new practices during operations.
