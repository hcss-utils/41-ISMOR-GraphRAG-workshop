The THAAD deployment also presented China with an opportunity to further its key interests more broadly.
Deployment provided another salient and shared issue for diplomatic and military cooperation with Russia, against the US.
It enabled China, by accepting a discrete potential cost (the continued deployment of a single THAAD system) to constrain South Korea's alliance behavior with the US, and the US's future regional BMD plans.
And, it demonstrated to other regional actors-and the US-that China is willing and able to use its economic leverage to further its political and security interests.
In this sense, the THAAD dispute highlights many of the underlying weaknesses of the US position in the Asia Pacific; as even close and long-term allies (such as South Korea and Australia) become increasingly dependent on China economically, the potential costs of remaining firmly in the US camp on security issues increases.
China has sent a clear signal that it can use its economic leverage to drive a wedge between the US and its regional allies, something Washington might want to keep in mind as it engages in its current trade dispute with China.
