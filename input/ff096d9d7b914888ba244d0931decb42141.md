# Title: Competing in the Gray Zone: Russian Tactics and Western Responses
# Database: Google Scholar
# Year: 2019.0
# Fulltext:
Just because Moscow has not gained a significant advantage with its gray zone activities to date does not mean that the West should ignore these Russian actions.
The United States and its European allies need to take steps to strengthen their defenses against gray zone tactics and to improve their ability to identify when Russia is shifting from everyday gray zone tactics to a more targeted campaign.
Even the strongest states need to combat "truth decay"-which Russian gray zone tactics contribute to-by expanding awareness about disinformation and teaching how to distinguish facts from fiction.
