China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order In late 1936, within two weeks of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, threatening an alliance that could visit a two-front war on Russia, Russia intervened diplomatically in the Chinese civil war.
On the Russian promise of conventional military weapons, the Nationalists and Communists agreed to halt the civil war in order to combine against Japan, whose invasion of China had proceeded without interruption from Manchuria (1931-33), Jehol (1933), and throughout North China (1933-35).
In 1937, after the Russian diplomatic intervention, the Second Sino-Japanese War escalated to encompass Central and South China, when the Nationalists abandoned their strategy of defeating the Communists before fighting the Japanese and went to war against Japan.
Both the Communists and Nationalists believed that the Russians would also provide soldiers.
They did not get it.
Once they were in, Russia was out.
Millions of Chinese died fighting Japan so Russians would not have to.
