First Phase: Concealed Origin During planning in the first phase, Russia thoroughly analyzes his enemy, the characteristics and weaknesses of his command and control system, and his willingness to fight in order to arrange interdependent, sequential reflexive control mechanisms that can deteriorate parts of the command and control system and degrade the enemy's willingness to fight during the next phases.
The case studies show Russia's narrative to intervene in neighboring countries is to protect Russian minorities.
The region itself most likely contains a frozen conflict in which, after the decline of the USSR, groups of actors already showed their desire to join Russia.
The reflexive control mechanism to justify this claim is distraction, the creation of an imaginary threat that Russia can use for justification and distract the targeted country and the international community from the real intent.
