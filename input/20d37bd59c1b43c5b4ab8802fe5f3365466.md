Although these conflicts are already ongoing, this recommendation is also relevant to Operation Inherent Resolve and Operation Freedom's Sen-tinel in Iraq and Afghanistan, respectively.
While proxy support dynamics have been key aspects of these conflicts from the beginning, given the long-standing involvement of Iran in supporting Shia militias in Iraq and Pakistani support for a number of militant groups in Afghanistan, proxy involvement in these conflicts could still intensify or expand, especially as the United States further draws down its presence, as the more recent expansion of Iranian and Russian involvement in Afghanistan highlights.
The United States should therefore continue to assess the risks both to mission and U.S. personnel of greater third-party involvement in these conflicts and take necessary actions to mitigate those risks as needed.
