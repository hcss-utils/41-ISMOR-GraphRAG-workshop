91 Up until now, Greece has never been a victim of Russian energy blackmailing; however, we should remain aware of the fact that Russia could use energy as a political tool to influence Greece.
The goal of this chapter is to analyze the potential for Russia to influence the Greek energy sector.
It contains four different analyses: a political analysis of Greek-Russian relations, a temporal analysis of Greek energy security, a social network analysis of the Greek energy companies' network, and a geospatial analysis of Russian energy exports in relation to EU energy dependency and the Greek energy infrastructures.
Based on the results of the analyses reported in this chapter, we have concluded that the Russian influence in the Greek energy field is multidimensional in that Russia holds sway based on controlling a vast portion of the Greek natural gas imports; it is well positioned regarding the current structure of the Greek energy infrastructures; and Russian companies maintain influential positions within the Greek oil network.
