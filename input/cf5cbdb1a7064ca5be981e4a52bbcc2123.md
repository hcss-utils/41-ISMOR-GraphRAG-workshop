The subject of hybrid warfare has received even more attention since Russia initiated its occupation of Crimea in 2014.
A number of scholars such as András Rácz, James K. Wither, Mehmet Seyfettin, and Safak Oguz have analyzed the case and discuss the different methods that Russia has used against Ukraine.
Wither, a professor and a retired British army officer, wrote that in 2014 Russia's techniques against Ukraine were a mix of conventional and irregular methods, and "sponsorship of political protests, economic coercion, cyber operations and, in particular, an intense disinformation campaign."
