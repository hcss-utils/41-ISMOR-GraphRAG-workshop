Bin Laden, Ibrahim argues, violated the fundamental precepts of Islamic wisdom, which require that faith be yoked to strength, justice, and tolerance.
Even as he preached the value of piety and faith, bin Laden should have either listened to his own internal counsel or tried to understand his adversaries.
In the end, he fell victim to hubris, relying on an ambition "to fight the entire world simultaneously, though he does not possess real power and cannot find a shelter or a government to assist him â€¦ Nevertheless," Ibrahim points out, "he wants to fight America on 9/11, the Russians in Chechnya, India in Kashmir, as well as carry out military operations in Muslim lands in Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Morocco, Indonesia, and elsewhere."
Had bin Laden paid adequate attention to his humble capabilities, he would have refrained from declaring war on the world.
Because it lost touch with reality, rationality, and the essence of Islam, al Qaeda caused the downfall of two Muslim regimes-in Kabul and in Baghdad.
Ibrahim sees little difference between bin Laden's al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's dictatorship: one destroyed his own network, the other destroyed the Iraqi state.
