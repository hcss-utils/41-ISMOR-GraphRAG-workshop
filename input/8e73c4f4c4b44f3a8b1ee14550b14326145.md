With the current threat environment constantly changing due to peer competitors' development of new technologies and capabilities, the Navy might be required to prioritize coastal defense more so than in the past.
With the current increased maritime and missile capabilities of peer competitors such as Russia and China, a maritime strategy that includes the prioritization of allocating maritime forces "away" rather than at "home" might not be a viable solution in the future.
One solution to the fear of prioritizing and allocating maritime forces improperly to effectively defend the homeland is to establish a binational maritime and aerospace defense command.
