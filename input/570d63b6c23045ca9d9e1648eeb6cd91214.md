The predominant developments focus on the creation of heavy forces that can engage a nearpeer adversary close to Russian borders and that can deliver a preponderance of power in the initial stages of conflict and thus bring it to a swift conclusion, or at least place Russia in a favorable position for negotiation.
That said, lessons learned from the Syrian campaign also seem to be incorporated into the armed forces.
The creation of light and ultra-light battalions seeks to further enhance mobility and maneuverability of land force sub-units, especially in areas where other formations seem to be too heavy or require significant logistics support.
