Estonian accounts of the crisis highlight four reasons to attribute the crisis to Russia.
First, they note Russia's influence in sustaining a narrative opposed to Estonia's view of World War II.
Second, they claim there was direct support and communication between the Rus sian embassy and the "Night Watch," a youth group (allegedly supported by Russia) that appears to have played a significant role in rallying the rioters.
The Night Watch was apparently established "to protect the monument from being profaned by provocateurs and vandals," and held a number of protests against the removal of the statue prior to the Bronze Night ("A Brief History," 2007).
