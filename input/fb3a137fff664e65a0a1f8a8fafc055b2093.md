The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   The Russians knew who to blame for their travails at Berlin.
Not Britain, whose support of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire was a pillar of foreign policy.
Not Austria-Hungary, which had stolen in at the last moment to pick up the spoils from Russia's military victory.
Not France, certainly, which as deranged with anger as it was towards Germany, still managed to come away from the Congress with something to show: permission to occupy and administer the North African city of Tunis.
