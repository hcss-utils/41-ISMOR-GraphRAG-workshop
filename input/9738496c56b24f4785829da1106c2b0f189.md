Russia's experiences and lessons learned about hybrid war arise from the mid-1990s when Chechen forces were blending conventional capabilities, irregular tactics, information operations, and deliberate terrorism as they waged war against Russia in the territory of Chechnya and o deep in Russian territory.
Hybrid means like high-visibility terrorist attacks and mass hostage-taking incidents were deliberately implemented by the Chechens.
Russia initially had to withdraw its forces from Chechnya, but later led by a former KGB operative, Vladimir Putin, were able to defeat the Chechen rebels by using undercover operations that adopted terrorist tactics.
