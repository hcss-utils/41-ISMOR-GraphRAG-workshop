Prior to Casablanca, American planners noted the early signs of a significant personnel shortage caused by the demands of conscripting soldiers, mass producing war material for new American units, and continuing Lend Lease to Great Britain and Russia.
This personnel shortage began to have a dramatic effect on the size and quality of the Army Ground Forces (AGF) in 1943.
The AGF had reduced its troop basis (planned number of divisions that it would mobilized to fight the war) because of a combination of limited personnel resources and production capacity.
The Allied campaign plan had suffered from excessive focus on tactical forces to the detriment of sustainment activities.
8 This proved particularly problematic for a mechanized combat force fighting in such an austere environment.
Upcoming campaigns would suffer similar shortcomings, due to national personnel shortages, not poor planning.
Eisenhower, as the OPD (Operations Division) commander, learned the importance of logistics in modern warfare.
