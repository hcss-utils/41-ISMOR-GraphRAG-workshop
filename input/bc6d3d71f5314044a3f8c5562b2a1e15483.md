Many people are aware of the space race between the United States and Russia, but not many know about the importance of Robert Truax, an accomplished rocket scientist, to vessel development.
His desire to build a rocket with private funding "consumed him for a decade" (p. 47).
The authors detail how Truax paired with Evel Knievel and came up with the idea that public relations could generate support for space innovation.
Truax, who had either plenty of time or plenty of money but never both, was continuously plagued by slow development, which would cause the money to dry up.
However, despite such problems, his legacy "set the standard for the swim-against-the-current entrepreneurs who would follow" (p. 60).
