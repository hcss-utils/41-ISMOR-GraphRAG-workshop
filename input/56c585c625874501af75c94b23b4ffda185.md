-Secretary of Defense James Mattis, attributed to Colin Gray In conclusion, Russia found initial success in its strategy in Ukraine but this success hinged on two factors: deniability of its involvement and the unpreparedness of Ukrainian forces to operate on par with Russian forces in the operational and information environment.
As intelligence experts exposed Russian involvement to the international community, Russia lost some freedom of action in the IE and lost legitimacy to international audiences.
However, to domestic and some regional audiences' acceptance of the Russian identity narrative, the strategy gained legitimacy as ethnic Russians actively or passively supported Russia actions.
Additionally, once Ukrainian forces adapted to Russian tactics of employing electronic warfare and other information capabilities in conjunction with kinetic activity, Russia lost the initiative and the Russo-Ukrainian war devolved into a "frozen conflict."
