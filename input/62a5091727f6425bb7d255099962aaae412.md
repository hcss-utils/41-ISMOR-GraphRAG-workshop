Far cases are highly vulnerable.
National assets, such as IADS, protect lines of communication for only a short portion of the port-to-port journey.
Access limitations that result in narrow and torturous transit routes apply to both sustainment and combat assets, and narrow channeling through NATO (e.g., Bosporus) or non-NATO but U.S. allied air and shipping lanes (e.g., Japan) creates vulnerabilities by proximity: Russian assets may have the right to move through narrow channels close to hostile states, but in doing so they expose their assets to strike.
Flying over or transiting through waters controlled by hostile states is always an option, but it is quite dangerous for obvious reasons.
