A relatively coherent and consistent view of Russia's security policy goals currently exists, and these have been translated into a political-military strategy for the armed forces that involves five key tasks: strategic deterrence (to prevent aggression on the Russian homeland); regional dominance, including responding to instability, terrorism, or conflict in the near abroad (meaning the non-Baltic former Soviet Union); expeditionary operations; preparedness in case of a major ground war; and domestic stability.
While changes are possible, we expect continuity in this strategy.
Other economic, demographic, and societal factors underlying Russian military power over the last decade have undergone significant change, but they also show signs of remaining stable over the medium term (ten years).
Public attitudes show support for Russia's government, foreign policies, and the military.
Russia is projected to experience relatively stagnant economic growth of 1 percent to 2 percent of large volume of indirect fire launchers and munitions from the Soviet Union with less significant modernization.
Russia's rapidly deployed forces-including the Airborne and GRU Spetsnaz-also build on Soviet-era formations, but represent new and dramatically reformed forces, with novel C4ISR systems and other state-of-the-art equipment.
Russia's internal security forces, which play an important role in the defense of Russia, have been built from pieces of Soviet-era structures within newly created or reorganized institutions.
