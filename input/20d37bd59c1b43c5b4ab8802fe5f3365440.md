Unfortunately, at the time of our research, systematic and publicly available data on the use of proxy warfare did not extend past 2010, so it is difficult to determine whether a resurgence in proxy warfare has already begun in recent years up to the time of this writing (summer 2022).

Perhaps more worryingly, we have seen a shift from the earlier post-Cold War pattern in which proxy warfare was largely a tool of weaker states (e.g., Rwanda in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo or Liberia in Sierra Leone).
In recent years, we have seen a large increase in Russia's and Iran's use of proxy warfare, both quantitatively (the number of proxies that they are supporting) and qualitatively (the geographical scope of their operations and the sophistication of their use of these instruments).
The big questions for analysts and policymakers going forward are
