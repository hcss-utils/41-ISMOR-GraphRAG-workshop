Over a five-day period in August 2008, Russia's Armed Forces were "victorious," swiftly mobilizing a force with overwhelming numerical superiority to defeat a much smaller foe.
Russian forces achieved their military objective-bringing two Georgian breakaway territories, Abkhazia and South Ossetia, under Russian control.
Yet while Russian forces demonstrated better planning and operational proficiency relative to the two wars in Chechnya (1994-1996 and 1999-2000), Russia's Armed Forces struggled more than was anticipated by both Russia and the West against the Georgian military.
Russia's command and control (C2) chains experienced multiple failures at nearly all echelons.
Obsolete Russian equipment suffered numerous breakdowns, thus halting the forward flow of forces.
The Russian air component lost more than ten aircraft flying only 200 sorties against an opponent that lacked fighter aircraft or advanced air defenses.
