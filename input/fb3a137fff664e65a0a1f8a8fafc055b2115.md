Promising "benevolent neutrality" in the event that either party "should find itself at war with a third Great Power" but specifically excluding a German war with France or a Russian war with Austria, the Reinsurance Treaty was Bismarck at his Machiavellian best.
At the very least, it violated the spirit of the Dual Alliance (since expanded into a Triple Alliance with the addition of Italy), and later attempts by historians to defend it fall into hair-splitting legalism at best.
The new Kaiser, Wilhelm II, who succeeded to the throne in 1888, regarded it as dishonorable and unworthy of a great Power, and so did many of the advisors around him.
Wilhelm II was a callous and crude young man in so many ways but even he could see that treaties so complex they required a team of lawyers to interpret were no treaties at all.
His refusal to renew the Reinsurance Treaty was one of the crucial issues leading to Bismarck's forced resignation in 1890.
Bismarck's successor as chancellor, Leo von Caprivi, complained that conditions in the Balkans have increased the antagonism between Russia and Austria.
Germany would run the danger of someday having to decide between Austria and Russia.... What value are alliances if they are not founded on a community of interest between nations?
