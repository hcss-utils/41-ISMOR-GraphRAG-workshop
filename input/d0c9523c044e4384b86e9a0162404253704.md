This chapter has examined Rus sian thinking and practices regarding political warfare.
Russia's political warfare activities are informed by Rus sian understanding of new generation warfare, by Rus sian and Soviet historical uses of political warfare, and by recent Rus sian domestic politics.
While Russia has wide-ranging capabilities, including proxies, nonkinetic use of military forces, information activities, cyber warfare, and economic influence, these tools are not unlimited and are generally used in specific contexts in limited and opportunistic ways.
Based on the observations above, we highlight three central observations about Rus sian political warfare that have important implications for defense and deterrence against Russia and for adapting U.S. and allied political warfare to be more effective.
