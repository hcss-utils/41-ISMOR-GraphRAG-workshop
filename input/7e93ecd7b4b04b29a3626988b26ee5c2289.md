# Fulltext:
Having detailed the legal mandate and organizational structure of the Russian General Staff in Chapter Two, in this chapter, we place the organization in comparative institutional context with the U.S. Joint Staff.
This high-level comparison provides a reference for policymakers and warfighters alike who engage with their counterparts in Russia, and it illuminates structural differences and how they affect how U.S. and Russian military leadership make and execute decisions.
This chapter is not meant to provide an exhaustive comparative analysis that mirrors the structure of Chapter Two.
It is intended to broadly illustrate the key respects in which the mandates of these two institutions diverge.
