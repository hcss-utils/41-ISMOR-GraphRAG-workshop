This is a study of the termination of asymmetrical limited war. Its central thesis is that the major policy choices of a great state's leadership in the closing stages of such a war are-best understood from an analysis of domestic politics. Two analytic tasks are undertaken to support this claim. The first task is to elaborate an institutional conception of how domestic politits inflritnces policy making in asymmetrical limited war termination. An institutional view of domestic politics exposes the strong influence which domestic political motivations have on a President's foreign policy decisions and illuminates domestic political processes as powerful instruments which compel the President to respond to domestic imperatives, even in the face of certain external demands. The second analytic task is to defend this approach to the study of war termination against the challenge of structural realism. Wars seem particularly suited to structural-realist analyses because they are essentially contests of power. Knowing the distribution of power in the international system and the location of the belligerents within that system permits relatively certain predictions regarding the outcome of a conflict: strong nations win wars against weak nations. However, big nations don't always win their small wars. Moreover, the example of a great power disengaging from an lundesirable war by means of a long, protracted withdraw l'suggests some basis other than ) ( structural interests motivating state behavior. This paper argues that that basis is domestic politics. The body of this study applies a domestic politics analysis to the case of U.S. efforts to end the Vietnam War---a war which America lost to a much smaller power. Three focal points, or critical war termination decisions, frame the analysis: Lyndon Johnson's decision in 1968 to de-escalate the war; Richard Nixon's decision in 1969 to Vietnamize the war, withdraw American troops and negotiate a settlement; and Nixon's decision to formally accept peace terms in 1973. The institutional approach to domestic politics used here suggests that because a President is fundamentally politically motivated, he must be responsive to domestic political considerations. Consequently, even foreign policy decisions are, under certain circumstances, essentially political.

Introduction Why do large, powerful nations sometimes lose small, limited wars? Why does it often take so long for great states to end such wars? One expects large and powerful nations to win their small wars and to do so in short order.
But history gives us a number of cases where our expectations in this regard are disappointed. Britain's ill-fated Boer war, and the shocking defeat of Russia at the hands of Japan in the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-1905 are but two examples.
The decades following World War II provide further instances of this phenomenon. The experience of France in Vietnam and Algeria, the United States in Vietnam, and the Soviet Union in Afghanistan all illustrate conflict involving belligerents with grossly disproportionate power capabilities and conflict in which the more powerful nation disengaged only with great difficulty and without having realized its war aims. What is it about limited war, the fighting nations, or both, that yields such unanticipated results?
The limited wars cited here all share three striking characteristics:
first, in each, the principal belligerents were dramatically mis-matched in power capabilities; large nations fought small ones. Secondly, the war for the more powerful state was limited, while the conflict for the weaker state was total. Thus while the larger nation held an clear power advantage, the stakes in the conflict generated asymmetries of motivation which favored the smaller state. 1   And finally, in each case, the more powerful nation failed to defeat its smaller adversary and emerged from the conflict with its international reputation severely damaged for the experience. This study classifies these wars as asymmetrical limited wars. 2   The dominant paradigm in the study of international relations, structural realism, holds that states are like actors operating on a 'self-help' basis in an anarchic international environment to safeguard their security and sovereignty by maximizing their power. Inter-state relations are characterized by competition and conflict. 3 Structural

The present work is a study of war termination. Its central thesis is that the major policy choices of a great state's leadership in the closing stages of such a war are best understood, not from an analysis of their structural motivations, but rather from their domestic sources. This assertion points to a potent, but often disregarded element in foreign policy analysis: in the innumerable international dealings between states that do not involve national survival, the external stimulus of foreign policy accounts for only a part---and in many cases only a small part---of the substance of that policy; domestic political considerations account for the rest. In other words, much of a state's foreign policy---its timing, character, and potency---is less a response to external motivations than to domestic imperatives.
To support these claims, two analytic tasks are undertaken: the first task is to elaborate an institutional conception of how domestic politics influences policy making in asymmetrical limited war termination. An institutional view of domestic politics not only enlarges the cast of foreign policy principals as originally formulated by Allison in his model of bureaucratic politics, 4 it exposes the strong influence which domestic political motivations have on a President's foreign policy decisions and illuminates domestic political processes as powerful instruments which compel the President to respond to domestic imperatives, even in the face of certain external demands.
The second analytic task is to defend this approach to the study of war termination against the strong challenge of structural realism. To argue that domestic politics offers a superior means of understanding some important instances of war termination is to challenge structuralism in one of its most secure domains---its power for predicting outcomes of international conflict. Wars seem particularly suited to structural-realist analyses for several reasons: first, because the anarchic nature of the international system leads 4 Graham T. Allison, Essence of Decision, (Boston: Little, 
Brown and Company, 1971.)
Kncwing the distribution of power in the international system and the location of the belligerents within that system permits relatively certain predictions regarding the outcome 5 If country A attacks country B, it is safe to assume that B will respond in kind if it is able. That the legislature or the executive was responsible for the decision to react is less important to understanding the event than the simple observation that B responded to A's attack. of a conflict. Strong nations win wars and weak nations lose them.
We have, however, a number of historical cases that don't conform to the expectations of structural realism. The postwar era alone offers several. In 1954 France was clearly more powerful than Vietnam, yet in the wake of its disastrous defeat at Dien Bien Phu was forced to withdraw in defeat from its former colony. Similarly, the United States outstripped North Vietnam in nearly every conceivable measure of power during the course of its war with that nation, yet it engaged in a long, protracted withdrawal; its war aims left unfulfilled. And the experience of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan offers but the most recent example of this same phenomenon. When Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1985, he declared that his nation would end its war in Afghanistan. Yet the tortuous withdrawal of Soviet forces has taken nearly four years to complete, leaving many to wonder why it could not have been accomplished more rapidly with less gratuitous loss of life.
The results of these wars demonstrate that contrary to the expectations of structural realism, big nations don't always win their small wars. Moreover, the example of clearly superior powers disengaging from undesirable wars with less able adversaries by means of a long, protracted withdrawal, (forfeiting in the process the full achievement of their war aims) suggests some basis other than structural interests motivating state behavior. This paper argues that that basis is domestic politics.
To be sure, when nations are moved to war to defend and protect their very survival as a sovereign state---when nations are moved to total war---structuralism offers a powerful explanation for events; motivated by the need to survive, the state will fight on until it defeats its adversary or until it finds itself defeated. The great wars of this century have often been called total wars. But many wars are not total--not characterized by a fully mobilized population focused on ensuring the survival of the state. In these limited wars, such as the conflict that has simmered for years between Libya and Chad, adversaries of approximately equal strength vie with each other for some limited objective---control of territory, for example--rather than the extermination of one's opponent.
Asymmetrical limited war, however, differs from symmetrical limited war. These are conflicts in which one belligerent seeks limited objectives while its opponent perceives itself locked in total war, and structuralism is pained to account for these situations. We must look elsewhere for aid in understanding this important class of events.
The present work takes some steps in this direction and argues the merits of a domestic politics approach to some important aspects of foreign policy. The termination of a limited war involving unevenly matched adversaries suggests a significant instance in which a domestic politics perspective is a more appropriate means of apprehending reality. To develop this claim, I examine one of the cases touched on above: the termination of American involvement in Vietnam.
The ending of the war in Vietnam is an apt illustration of the role of domestic politics in war termination for several reasons which are derived in part from the nature of the American democratic society and in part from the nature of limited war. First, democracies, by their nature, enfranchise more of the constituent society in governance than do totalitarian or oligopolistic regimes. That is, when compared to studies of nations in which the processes of government are less, or virtually in-accessible to nongovernmental actors, an analysis of a democratic society allows a fuller consideration of the role and influence of domestic political factors in the policy making process.
Second, wars of relatively short duration that are decided largely on the basis of military superiority offer few opportunities for factors extraneous to the immediate prosecution of the war to influence the conclusion of that war. The converse is that the longer a war lasts, and the more it appears that an end to the war cannot be brought about through military efforts exclusively, the greater the opportunity for other factors, namely domestic political factors, to exercise an influence in the resolution of that war. Indeed, this was the case during the closing stages of Vietnam as it was earlier in the French defeat in Indochina.
Third, actual efforts to conclude U.S. involvement in Vietnam provided an opportunity for domestic politics to play a significant role in policy making not only because of the sheer length of the termination process, but also because that process overlay two Presidential and three Congressional elections---political exercises which allow political interests to become opportunities for policy influence.
Finally, war and its institutions reflect the social environments from which they spring. All wars are fought within a political context, and a focus on the role of domestic politics in war termination illuminates the essential relationship between military force and its political purpose. The example of Vietnam suggests that when the application of force becomes grossly disarticulated from its political purpose, the war loses meaning and prompts a nation to seek its exit from that war.
The study begins with a brief foray into the small but growing body of scholarly literature which exists on war termination. Much of the current work on war termination consists of limited theoretical probes and impressionistic though insightful treatments of the subject; some important concepts regarding the termination of war have been illuminated, and serve usefully to ground the present undertaking. Chapter two offers an institutional analysis of domestic politics related specifically to the issues and processes of war termination. Its main thrust is that because a President is at the fulcrum of a complex, often unpredictable political process, he must be sensitive to and often responsive (even when he would prefer not to be) to political considerations. In consequence, even his foreign policy decisions are, under certain circumstances, subject to the familiar political techniques and gamesmanship which characterize much of domestic policy. This work argues that the termination of asymmetrical limited war is just such a circumstance.
The body of this study considers the case of U.S. efforts to end the Vietnam War. Three focal points, or critical war termination decisions, were chosen to frame the analysis: a)
the point at which the leaders of the larger nation consciously decides to end the war, as opposed to continue the fighting; b) the way in which they chose to end it, and; c) their recognition that the war had indeed ended. These theoretical points translate into specific questions regarding the United States and Vietnam: a) When did the American leadership determine that it had to actively intervene to end the war, rather than let the fighting on the battlefield determine its outcome? b) How would the war be brought to a close? That is, given the decision that the war had to end, how would this be accomplished? Through negotiation? Immediate and unilateral withdrawal? Nuclear bombs? and; c) What conditions would need to hold for the belligerents to agree that the war had ended? That is, how would they know the end of the war when they saw it? 6
The beginning of the end of America's war in Vietnam is fixed, for the purposes of this study, as 
March 31, 1968
Given, then, that the war would end, the question became one of how? The new President, Richard Nixon, adopted a manifold strategy to end the war: he would attempt to negotiate a settlement with North Vietnam while gradually handing over the principal responsibility for fighting the war to the South Vietnamese in a process known as Vietnamization. In tandem with these actions, the President began to order the withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam at first sporadically, but later on a more regular basis geared often to the requirement to maintain domestic political acceptance of his overall policy. Importantly, while the withdrawal of American troops was originally 6 In limited war, recognizing the end of the war 'when you see it,' approximates the point of war termination. In total war the ending point is marked by the defeat of one's adversary. In limited war, total defeat is not a goal of the fighting and therefore it becomes more difficult to determine the conditions which will signal the conclusion of the war. contingent upon the mutual withdrawal of North Vietnamese forces from South Vietnam, by May 1971, the U.S. had dropped this demand and continued its withdrawals on a unilateral basis. The possibility existed that the war would end for the United States, if not through a negotiated settlement, than through the simple absence of American combat forces in Vietnam.
The point at which the belligerents agreed that the war, for the United States, was over, is fixed as the date on which the Paris Accords were signed, January 27, 1973. Some may take issue with this date, arguing that the war did not end until the fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975, over two years later. While there are strong arguments in favor of this date as the point at which the war ended for the Vietnamese, for the United States, the war was already over. U.S. ground combat operations had ceased several years before and there is little evidence to suggest that Nixon could have succeeded in re-introducing American soldiers onto the Indochina peninsula even if he had been so inclined--an inclination which the record also does not support. Additionally, we could not have foreseen the overrunning of Saigon in April 1975 from the vantage point of January 1973 (though few would argue the tenuous nature of the 'peace' that immediately followed the signing of the Paris Accords).
Moreover, the possibility cannot be excluded that, had the Watergate revelations not compelled Nixon to resign and so thoroughly undermined many of the powers of the American Presidency, he would have taken stronger measures, short of renewed combat, to assist South Vietnam in its crisis of late 1974-early 1975 (although to do so the President would have had to overcome or bypass strong Congressional and public opposition.) 7 Analytically and substantively, the signing of the Paris Accords marked the end of the war for the United States. Though hostilities did again break out between North and South Vietnam, this can be represented as the beginning of a new war. 8   These three Presidential decisions:
Johnson's decision in 1968 to de-escalate the war; Nixon's decision in 1969 to
Vietnamize the war and withdraw American troops; and the decision to formally declare the war to be at an end in 1973, represent the significant policy choices taken during the process of ending U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War.
Each of these decisions occurs within a structural framework and lies imbedded in a particular domestic political condition. It is a burden of this study to demonstrate that the policy decisions under examination here are, in the main, Presidential responses to the domestic political imperatives, and not to the structural conditions 7 Evidence presented in the epilogue supports this contention.
8 Indeed, in late 1973, South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu announced the beginning of a 'third Indochina war.

negotiations); and by factors dealing with the domestic political situation within the nations at war. While an analysis of each of these sets of factors provides some insight into the dynamic of settling a war, none is itself sufficient for understanding that process in its entirety. Some are, however, better than others for understanding why asymmetrical limited wars end when and how they do.
By way of a general beginning, let us consider the following questions: Why are wars, the most costly means of settling international dispute, apparently very difficult to stop once they have started? How do national decision-1986): 95-106; Leon V. Sigal, Fighting to a Finish, Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1988. makers, once having arrived at the decision that a war must end, end the war? Which factors speed this process; which prevent it? How does the process of war termination shape the character and scope of the settlement agreement? The present work takes the position that an analysis of war termination from a domestic politics perspective suggests interesting and useful answers to these questions.
Though this study explicitly deals with the domestic political structure of the United States, I believe its central argu-:ent can be abstracted for wider application for societies similarly structured. Many of the industrialized nations which make up the modern international system share certain characteristics, and the notion of domestic politics used here captures the essence of this similarity.
Within the governments of the industrialized nations of the world there are individuals, or a small group of individuals, who command the power to make foreign policy decisions affecting the entire nation. In the United States this power rests largely in the office of the President, in Great Britain with the Prime Minister, and in the Soviet Union with the General Secretary of the Communist Party and the Politburo. Moreover, the majority of these societies have some larger representative body organized to address the needs of the larger population. In the United States this is Congress, in the Federal Republic of Germany this is the Bundestag, and in France the Parliament. In each of these nations, the government has a bureaucracy to attend to its administrative needs, and a military to guarantee the sovereignty of the country, and further, there are extragovernmental organizations such as industry, the media and interest groups which exert influence in the policy making process (with varying degrees of opportunity and success.)
It is to these societies, the modern industrialized nations of the world, which the discussion of domestic politics as presented here might be applied. 2
Surveying the Field I would misrepresent the actual state of affairs if I were to speak of the 'literature' on war termination. But the collection of articles, scholarly and otherwise, and the few compendia concerned with war termination, represent written 2 The use of this view of domestic politics and war termination has certain limitations. I see them principally as two stemming from consideration of the type of society at war, and the type of war being waged. An institutional view of domestic politics seems inappropriate when applied to certain developing nations.
In these states, the relationship among the different agencies of government or between the government and the governed might resemble that of industrialized nations only at the limits of intellectual tolerance. Clearly a sense of domestic politics derived from an industrialized western nation is less useful for understanding how societies of a radically different type would end its wars. Secondly, a domestic politics analysis might itself be inappropriate for understanding how certain kinds of wars end---i.e. a war in which the objectives for both sides are total, or a war of exceedingly short duration. The present discussion of war termination attempts to understand the role of domestic politics in the process of ending a war by drawing on a specific society---the United States, in a specific war---Vietnam. I invite application of the essential theoretical argument to other societies in other wars to test the limits of its applicability. knowledge on the subject to date, and it is with this body of work that one must begin. 3 Within this material, agreement on certain fundamental concepts remains elusive. The expression "termination" is itself problematic and has been considered both the point at which a war has ended and the process through which that ending was achieved. In the absence of formal instruments of war termination, establishing the point at which a war has ended presents a particularly difficult problem. How do we distinguish a cessation of hostilities or cease-fire from a more or less stable peace settlement?

similarly.5 In this study, I consider theories of war Michael Handel has identified five categories of research into which work on war termination has generally fallen--normative, economic, international law, diplomatic history and theory of international relations ("War Termination-A Critical Survey", Jerusalem Papers on Peace 
Problems, Jerusalem, 1978)
Normative studies of war termination consider the moral implications of war and peace. This category is by no means consensual, including both 'just war' theories and the so-called 'peace studies.' Economic studies of war termination center around the potential economic impact of continued war or imminent peace. These studies, like their opposite numbers which seek to explain a war's origin, trace the roots of any meaningful action in a war termination process to an economic source. Resolution of hostilities is obtained when the economic equilibrium between belligerents is either restored by choice or imposed by necessity.
International law focuses more precisely on the treaties and other means by which nations formally draw hostilities to a close. This is perhaps the most coherent body of literature on the subject, if only for the length of time formal documents have been employed by men to record their agreements. Diplomatic history provides a rich and detailed account of events leading up to and during the war termination process, but gives little or no theoretical frame on which to hang the facts so faithfully represented. Handel suggests that the most fruitful body of study has been in his last category of international relations theory, and it is within this category that the present study is conducted.
As an alternative approach, Berenice A. Carroll in a useful, though now dated, review of war termination hypotheses observed that there were five general categories of questions regarding how wars are brought to a close: definition and classification (e.g. How does one define the point at which a war ends?), descriptive or quantitative (e.g. What are the types and frequencies of wars' ends throughout history?), analytical (e.g. Can factors be discerned which account for war termination? Does every war have a 'decisive battle'?), evaluative (e.g. What does the manner in which a war concludes foretell of the subsequent peace?), and policy (e.g. What are the conditions under which an advantageous close to war is possible?). Berenice A. Carroll "How Wars End: An Analysis of Some Current Hypotheses" Journal of Peace Research 6 (1969): 295-321, pp. 296-297. Though she focused on the hypotheses derived from the descriptive and analytical sets of questions, classification, evaluation and policy implications of war termination have had their advocates. In another effort, Carroll divided existing war termination theories into two categories:
"fightlike and gamelike." See her discussion in termination by dividing them somewhat arbitrarily according to the levels of analysis in conventional use in American
Political Science: structural/systemic, strategic interaction, decision-making, and domestic politics. But before doing this, two points deserve discussion in order to clarify the concept of war termination as it is used in the present work.
The first point concerns an implicit assumption often made in studies of war that the end of the war always leads to the beginning of the peace. This assumption equa war with conflict and termination with peace. In fact, political conflict may continue by non-military means even after the formal, organized fighting stops. No one, for example, would assert that with the conclusion of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, Egypt, Syria, and Israel were not still in conflict;
and few officials in Saigon believed that their troubles were over with the drying of the ink in Paris. There is a useful, and indeed necessary, distinction to be made between war "War Termination and Conflict Theory: Value Premises, Theories and Policies" in The Annals of The American Academy of Political and Social Science 392 (November 1970), pp. 14-29. Wallace Thies makes use of yet a different approach. Observing two key elements in the war termination process, 1) bargaining and signalling between belligerents, and 2) the conceptual models each side uses in interpreting the other's actions, Thies uses these as a typological basis for organizing and assessing past studies of war termination. Wallace J. Thies, "Searching for Peace: Vietnam and the Question of How Wars End." 
Pnlit, 7 (Spring 1975): 304-333, pp. 313.
With a war's end, conflict may still exist, but the method of brokering the conflict comes under a different set of rules.
The second point regards the scope of war termination--that is, war termination for whom? It is clear that for wars involving more than two belligerents, war termination becomes a much more complicated business. The end of wars in which obligated alliances (where an ally is bound to continue fighting so long as the main belligerent does) or coalition warfare are present imply that when at the time of termination, all parties to the conflict cease fighting. But what of those situations where a party to a conflict, principal or otherwise, leaves early, or changes the nature of its commitment?
Has the war been terminated? An answer to this question lies in the careful specification of the subject of analysis. The United States in Vietnam provides an example.
From 1965 until 1973, the United States maintained an active ground force commitment in South Vietnam representing, for the balance of those years, the strongest belligerent 6 Handel, Ibid., p. 10. See also, 
Stein, Ibid.
In the interest of clarity then, any treatment of war termination must explicitly establish its analytical domain.
For our purposes, war termination is not simply the end of "...the condition which prevails while groups are contending by arms," but rather the condition which obtains when a belligerent ceases its attempt to resolve its differences with its adversary principally through the means of force. 7   For the United States, the Vietnam war ended in Paris on January 27, 1973.
Having specified the conception of war termination used in this study, I turn now to a consideration of available theories. As previously mentioned, I have divided up existing work into structural and sub-structural groupings to evaluate how well they account for the phenomena in which I am interested. We will first examine stzuctural-systemic theories and the hypotheses they generate.
7 Drawn from Quincy Wright A Study of War (Chicago: University Press, 1965), p. 8, ff.
Structural theories of war termination are derived from consideration of the anarchic nature of the international system, the distribution of power among the member states, and the self-regarding behavior of those states particularly regarding issues of security and sovereignty. One survey of theoretical issues associated with war termination suggests several structural hypotheses which stem from three dimensions of the international system: aggregation, polarization and militarization. 8   Aggregation refers to a process whereby smaller units of the world system are incorporated into larger units. States are not only known by their sovereign identity but also by their membership in international unions. Defense and economic associations are the most common manifestations of increased international aggregation. The existence of many or large such associations imply increased agreement among 8 Francis A. Beer and Thomas F. Mayer. "Why Wars End: Some Hypotheses." Review of International Studies 12 
(April 1986)
95-106, especially pp. 100-103. Though their discussion of structural/systemic hypotheses is extremely limited, it represents, to date, the only explicit effort of its type and is therefore examined in some detail here. The present discussion of structural hypotheses of war termination draws heavily on the parameters of the international structure presented in their work but also suggests an expanded interpretation of those systemic characteristics. Though beyond the scope of this project, a good deal of additional research on structural factors, such as the role of third party intermediaries, the influence of geographical proximity of the war zone, and the international reputational effects associated with victory or defeat remains to be done. See also Francis A. Beer, Peace Against War:
The Ecology of International Violence (San Francisco: W.H. 
Freeman, 1981.)
Polarization refers to the differences among nations which take shape and persist within the international system. 9 The ideological differences of the NATO-Warsaw Pact rivalry manifest security differences, but economic polarization can also exist. North-South studies which have focused on the dependent relationships that sprang from the days of colonial imperialism have highlighted economic polarization between the relatively wealthy, industrialized nations and the poorer, developing states.
Militarization is defined as the degree to which nations are inclined to resort to military means to resolve their differences. The greater the disparity in military capabilities among nation states, the higher the tendency for war to result. Conversely, as parity in military capabilities increases, the tendency toward war decreases.
Each of these three dimensions of the international system offers certain insights regarding war termination. Among the hypotheses the theorists draw: 9 According to Beer and Mayer, polarization can occur along any or all of three dimensions: differentiation, inequality and instability, and, while each of these dimensions suggests hypotheses regarding war termination, they will not all be addressed in this survey, the interested reader is referred to pages 101-2 in their article.
terminating an ongoing war also increases. 1 0   In the process of aggregation, nations tend to share more and more common interests, or at least share notions of how interests are pursued. Because interaction norms increase in systems with high levels of aggregation, there are more mechanisms by which warring nations can resolve their differences without resorting to additional warfare.
Further, because of increased interaction among nations in general, the contending parties have greater incentives and an expanded basis on from which to cooperate.
Polarization refers essentially to the amount of latent conflict within an international system, and the extent to which polarization is or is not prevalent in a system has implications for war termination. Thus the hypothesis:
Decreasing instability of the international context in which a war takes place will shorten the duration of that war. 1 1   The implication is that a generally stable international system would encourage belligerents to settle armed disputes as rapidly as possible. This is not to suggest that a system which is unstable will discourage early termination, but while an unstable system might not necessarily prolong a war, it clearly does little to encourage peace.

An implicit assumption of realist theories of international relations is that a state's behavior is tightly linked to its structural interests. Such a realpolitik view of things would ascribe three fundamental interests to all states: first, the acquisition and maintenance of power relative to other states; second, the safeguarding of national security and the preserving of sovereignty; and third, the maintenance and enhancement of national reputation within the system of states. If these structural interests indeed motivate a state's international behavior, we might derive from them some hypotheses regarding the termination of asymmetrical limited wars. Let us consider the first structural interest: power.
A great nation involved in an asymmetrical limited war is not taxed to the limits of its power resources in the conflict. If nations are motivated by the pursuit of power, it would seem that in some sense, the power to be gained as a result of victory in the limited war must exceed that lost through the armed conflict. Therefore a simple cost-benefit analysis using the factor of national power yields the following hypothesis: Great states will seek to end their involvement in limited wars when the power lost in the conduct of the war threatens to exceed that expected to be gained through military victory.
The second structural interest---the safeguarding and preserving of national security and sovereignty---at first blush seems to suggest little for the termination of asymmetrical limited wars. The security and sovereignty of a great state is normally not threatened when that state becomes involved in a limited war, particularly when it enjoys a decided power advantage over its adversary, Nevertheless, in democratic societies, there appears to be a complex relationship between a nation's security and its participation even in limited war.
One of the legacies of the French Revolution is the fact that democracies wage major wars as a society. When war threatens to become an enormously costly undertaking, the whole of a society becomes party to the conflict, and the leadership faces the task of mobilizing the population to support the war effort. "National Security" is a strong justification which motivates people to accept the death and destruction incurred in war. The cry goes up that the war must be fought lest life as we know it disappear. Even in limited war, where the security and sovereignty of a great power is not in proximate danger, this rationale can be applied with some force. A limited war must be fought, the argument goes, because although this particular conflict does not seriously threaten us, our failure to respond (or our response ending in failure) could lead to further, worse challenges in the future. This connection, however remote, between national security and the willingness of a state to take up arms yields the following:
A great power will seek to end its limited war when the conditions obtain that lead to a judgement that no its vital interests are no longer threatened.
It is important to recognize that victory for the great power---that is its defeat of the lesser state---is not the only condition which would persuade the great nation that its vital interests are not longer threatened. Protracted limited wars in which the belligerents find themselves mired in stalemate may result in a reevaluation of the original basis for the war inducing the leadership and the people of the great state to conclude that the threat as formerly perceived no longer exists.
A final structural incentive centers on the nation's reputation in the international system. Essentially the generalized estimate which nations have of each other, reputation forms the basis of one state's predictions regarding the future conduct of another. Nations have incentives to behave in ways that preserve their international reputation. A number of benefits accrue to nations as a result of their international reputation. A powerful state has an especially strong interest in maintaining its reputation as a great nation, particularly as its power begins to wane.
The desire to preserve one's reputation can influence the action a great state takes in attempting to terminate a limited war. Indeed, reputational concerns are particularly poignant for large, powerful nations involved in asymmetrical limited wars, for at least two reasons. First, large nations are not expected to lose small wars or to have enormous difficulty in winning them. And secondly, while great powers are expected to 'win' such wars, they must be mindful of the rules of proportionality in their pursuit of victory. The complete annihilation of a lesser state by a more powerful nation in a limited war can undermine the reputation of the latter who is expected to moderate the application of its own power. Either the defeat of the larger nation or the excessive use of military power in victory can do a good deal of damage to the reputation of a great power state.
Because a damaged reputation results in diminished influence, the need to 'save face' can induce certain behaviors. These considerations suggest the following hypothesis regarding the role of reputation in a state's efforts to terminate an asymmetrical limited war: Great states will seek to end their limited wars to avoid incurring adverse reputational effects.
The vital security of a powerful nation is not generally threatened in a limited war with a smaller adversary, therefore we might expect to see states acting to end a war in order to preserve their reputation under any of the following conditions: when the prospects of a military defeat appear high; when they become entrenched in an indecisive stalemate; or when they appear able to secure victory only through the massive application of military might.
There is another group of hypotheses regarding war termination which is derived from consideration of the strategic interaction between the belligerents. By focusing on the interdependent decision-making of nations at war, a strategic interaction analysis reveals the dynamics of signalling and bargaining attendant to efforts to negotiate a settlement to a war. In an analysis of this type, we can gain some understanding of policy outcomes (i.e. whether to end a war and what the nature of that termination will be) as a function of the decisions a nation's leaders make in response to the perceived actions and intentions of its opponent. 12 The military exhaustion of the capacity to wage war, mutual or unilateral, is an outcome of the strategic interaction between belligerents. The following hypothesis is derived from a consideration of this extreme state:
Wars will end when the belligerents have exhausted their war-making capabilities.
This hypothesis implies mutual exhaustion, and wars have ended in this fashion; the state of the recent war between Iran and Iraq approximates a war terminated through mutual exhaustion. 1 3 However, unilateral exhaustion would also precipitate the ending of a war---wars cannot go on if there is only one belligerent left fighting.
At the opposite end of the spectrum from the complete depletion of the ability to wage war, is the overwhelming ability not only to wage, but to win war. Clear military superiority suggests the following:
12 For a useful discussion of the complexities of bargaining as a strategic interaction problem in which belligerents attempt to manipulate each other's values and perceptions of them, see Glenn H. 13 But this is only an approximation. The winding down of this war is perhaps better explained through Iran and Iraq's mutual recognition that the military stalemate could not be altered by additional fighting which would only lead to further mutual exhaustion.
(I am indebted to Alexander George for this clarification.) A war will end when one nation militarily overwhelms (or effectively threatens to overwhelm) the other. This is perhaps the most conventional view of war termination. Wars end when one side 'beats' the other. War termination here implies a clear winner and loser. But obviously there are those wars which have ended more ambiguously or with mixed outcomes.
Negotiation and bargaining in the process of ending a war is founded, in part, on the notion that warfare itself is a bargaining process by which belligerents seek to settle a dispute. 14 By considering an entire war and its termination process as a complex bargaining problem, several hypotheses suggest themselves: A war will end when the belligerent nations reach some measure of accommodation of the war objectives of each through concession or quid pro quo.
Or, since wars are means by which belligerent nations reduce their uncertainty regarding either their opponent's commitment to their stated war objectives or the opponent's ability to accomplish those objectives, we might surmise Wars will tend to end when belligerent nations resolve their uncertainty regarding the opponent's commitment to war aims and their ability to achieve those aims. This hypothesis anticipates several scenarios. Since the resolution of uncertainty occurs both as a result of the 14 See Paul J. Pillar, Negotiating Peace (Princeton: University Press, 1983), p. 3.
progress of the war and the progress of negotiations, war termination tends to occur when uncertainty is resolved, regardless of whether it is resolved mutually or unilaterally. That is, the tendency for a nation to pursue a military solution, as against a negotiated settlement is increased when that nation perceives an unwillingness on the part of its opponent to fight on (through a realization that its opponent is irresolute over its war aims and seeks to modify its demands during negotiations via important concessions).
Alternatively, the tendency for a nation to seek a negotiated end to a war would be increased if it perceived that its opponent was unwavering in its commitment to achieving its war aims with a demonstrated willingness to fight to the 'bitter end' to achieve them. This realization can induce the first nation to modify its utility for its own war aims in the face of certain prolonged struggle with a steadfast opponent. The situation between the United States and Japan at the close of World War II approaches this condition. Although America was not prepared to negotiate with Japan over the latter's capitulation, it did modify its demand of unconditional surrender and allow Emperor Hirohito to remain as head of that nation. Scholars have argued convincingly that the change in the position of the United States on this issue was due directly to its desire to hasten the surrender of Japan and avoid additional, unnecessary, combat.15 A war's end is often seen as a direct function of a nation's success or failure to achieve its war aims. But the war aims of belligerents can change over the course of the war. If a war is going particularly well, a nation might be moved to seek even greater objectives. For example, a nation might enter a war in response to the aggressive behavior of another with the aim of reestablishing the status quo ante.
Finding itself victorious however, it might be inclined to pursue the transgressor further to 'punish' it for causing the war in the first place, or in the extreme, annihilate it altogether. Conversely, if a war is going poorly, a nation can be induced to pare its original war aims down to the bare minimum, i.e. survival as a national entity, in order to end the war. If we can consider wars as armed disagreements, we might hypothesize that A war will end when the minimum, irreducible demands (or objectives) of the opponents no longer conflict.
Derived from the complex relationship between belligerents which underlies the fundamental conflict, this hypothesis presumes that wars cannot end as long as a belligerent nation perceives that its minimum interests conflict with those of its opponent. The future of the Thieu regime in the Vietnam negotiations serves as a modest example to illustrate the point. For some time the North Vietnamese would not agree to a settlement in Paris as long as the Thieu government was allowed to remain in power in the South. For many months this issue was arguably the most significant obstacle to the conclusion of a peace settlement with the United States. In October of 1972, however, the North modified its demand, and dropped its insistence that Thieu go before they would agree to a cease-fire. This modification represented a major breakthrough in the talks and formal cease-fire agreement followed within months.
One has only to leaf casually through the memoirs of the world's great leaders to develop a sense of the importance an individual can have in the shaping and timing of significant international events. Has the presence (or absence) of a key decision-maker or other significant individual, perhaps a third party mediator, been decisive in a war termination process? How does one's image of the opponent (the conceptual model a key decision-maker has of his adversary) contribute to the ease or difficulty with which a war is terminated? How has misperception affected leaders' interpretations of their opponent's actions?
The best answers to these is not unreasonable to believe that dominant individuals play important roles in the conduct of interstate affairs, in the modern era, the instance of a national leader ending a war through singular efforts is seldom encountered in the historical record. Charles DeGaulle's role in ending the French-Algerian war is a notable exception. His example suggests an interesting hypothesis particularly suited to the type of war of interest in this study:
When domestic forces are badly divided over the desirability of an unfavorable termination, the existence and influence of a strong leader is necessary to end the war.
Apart from studies of individual cases, the decision-making framework is less often applied to theoretical studies of war termination, but theoretical models at this level of analysis hold promise for greater insight into the why and how of the war termination process that cannot be easily or adequately answered by structural theories.
Rational choice theory, based on the assumptions that decision makers are rational utility maximizers confronting choice opportunities under conditions of uncertainty or risk suggests the following general hypothesis:
Wars end when national decision-makers calculate that the costs of continued fighting outweigh the costs of settling the dispute. Game theory, a subset of rational choice, suggests that decision-making in war termination (indeed, decision-making in general) might be modeled. 1 8 Prisoner's Dilemma is a classic game where decision-makers, faced with uncertainty, realize that while their 'payoff' depends in part on the decision of the other player (in war, the opponent), they have no control over the other player's decision. In cases such as these, the most efficacious strategy depends on whether or not the game is iterative (tit for tat is best), or single play ('minimax' is best).
Expected utility is another means of apprehending decision-making under conditions of uncertainty. According to expected utility theory, decision-makers assign probabilities to the expected states of nature which might occur and choose strategies based on the expected utility associated with each. The following hypothesis might be derived from an expected utility analysis:
If the difference in the expected utility each belligerent associates with a particular war outcome is great, the tendency for the war to end is decreased.
For each outcome that can result from a conflict, the value that one nation places on that outcome can be completely different from the value that its opponent has for that same outcome. For example, in a war where Country A desires the complete military defeat of Country B, this result is obviously not particularly valued by Country B, though it is 18 I thank Terry Moe and Bruce Bueno de Mesquita for their comments on this section. highly valued by Country A. The above hypothesis suggests that since the expected utilities for this possible outcome are so far apart the prospects for war termination are diminished.
One rational approach to war termination has proposed that a view of war termination as a process wherein belligerent nations make rational calculations reveals a necessary condition for war termination. 1 9 Unless both parties to a conflict believe that they can be made better off by a settlement, the war will continue: "[aln agreement (either explicit or implicit) to end a war cannot be reached unless the agreement makes both sides better off;
for each country the expected utility of continuing the war must be less than the expected utility of settlement." Uty (w), that is, the settlement must make both countries better off than continuing the war (p. 747).
A problem arises when one attempts to operationalize 'better off. 
'
When the risk propensity of that national decision-maker is introduced, we can hypothesize further:
The more risk-averse a decision-maker is, the more likely he is to seek an early end to a war. 2 1   By suggesting that the difference between escalation and termination lies in the reputation of a nation's leader as a betting man, testing this hypothesis would require an indepth belligerent nations' utility for settlement was greater than their utility for continued warfare, we have no information regarding the factors which contributed to the reassessment of those utilities. Following this approach, the analyst, and indeed often the decision-maker, can only know that certain decisions or actions brought the war to an end after it happened, and not before. However, as Wittman observes, the fact that this condition must obtain for a war to end suggests that the intuitive relationships between the level of fighting and the proximity of a war ending do not necessarily hold. Thus, for example, a reduction in the level of hostilities may in fact reduce the likelihood of settlement (thereby serving to prolong the war).
Similarly, increasing the likelihood of military victory does not necessarily result in an increased likelihood of settlement (pp. 749-754).
Wittman maintains that these findings represent important results of his approach. Though I do not reject his work as a means for developing some understanding of the war termination process, I challenge the causal relationship he imputes between his theory and these results and reject the implication that these findings would remain obscure in the absence of an expected utility analysis. study of individual leaders' 'operational codes.' 2 2 But despite our lack of indepth understanding of the motivations of powerful leaders, Robert Jervis ably reminds us that international disaster is often traceable to decision-makers' perceptions of their environments. Clearly the decision-making process itself an important explanatory variable. Such factors as perception and misperception, cognitive limitations on rationality and the impact of judgmental biases and heuristics in the decisionmaking process become important for understanding the role of the key decision-maker in the larger process of ending a war.
But while a decision-making analysis uncovers important variables, these variables only account for a part of the explanation for the endings of asymmetrical limited wars. Each of the above approaches to war termination offers interesting and useful contributions to the field; none, however, offers adequate understanding of the process by which large, powerful nations end their small, limited wars.
Structural hypotheses suggest external conditions which favor the termination of a war or lead to its continued prosecution, but the type of explanation they offer through exclusive consideration of systemic factors brings us no closer to answers to the original questions of this study.
Similarly, though important factors such as the signalling, bargaining and negotiation between nations at war, the progress of the war, and the reciprocal relationship between the negotiating table and the battlefield are revealed through an analysis of the strategic interaction between belligerents, we are still without an explanation of how and why certain strategies were adopted and how interaction informs the character and timing of subsequent decisions.
Though national decisions and actions clearly influence strategic interaction outcomes, unless we approach the question from a different perspective, the sources of those decisions remain obscure.
Part of the difficulty with these approaches to war termination stems from the assumption of the state as a 'rational unitary actor.' While this assumption might be useful for systemic or strategic interaction studies, again, it is a major obstacle to finding clear answers to the questions of concern here. 2 5 To understand how a nation's leadership arrives at decisions regarding war termination, we cannot assume that the nation acts as if it were a 'rational unitary actor.' Rather than unitary, the nation is a collection of many and varied actors, groups and institutions whose relationships are interconnected by complex processes; rather than 'rational' (the best choice among a range of alternatives), policy decisions reflect compromises among the various groups, and often the bases for these compromises are only remotely connected to the substantive issues to which they are addressed. To understand how a nation attempts to extricate itself from armed conflict we must focus on the sources of national decisions, and to do this, we turn our attention to domestic politics.
25 Further, there is a risk that, in considering the nation as a single 'rational unitary actor' one might consider decisions regarding war termination similarly aggregated. But this obscures the true nature of the war termination p aa. Efforts to end a war involve countless decisions. Any decision short of the immediate cessation of hostilities which results in the resolution of contentious issues, involves some recalculation of the utilities of various goals, and provides the basis for future decisions. Prolongation of the war and the war termination process invariably results. In other words, a nation confronts a choice situation throughout the conduct of the war and any negotiations which might be in progress: to end the war as the situation stands or not.
If not, what to do? Escalate? Negotiate? If negotiate, should we alter the terms for settlement? Alter our negotiating strategies and tactics? etc. War termination involves a series of such decisions. The final decision itself to accept whatever status quo prevails as the end of the war is, in effect, the last decision of the sequence.
The analytical perspective of domestic politics seems the most efficacious, under certain conditions, for understanding a nation's major decisions regarding the termination of an asymmetrical limited war and, once having arrived at that decision, how policy decisions are implemented to bring about that end. What are these conditions? The first concerns the existence of an opportunity for domestic politics to 'matter' in war termination. A limited war of relatively long duration, not characterized by decisive military successes despite considerable expenditure of resources and appearing insoluble through exclusively military means, presents an extended opportunity for domestic political factors to exercise influence in the war termination process.
A second condition presents an increased incentiv for those domestic factors to take advantage of that opportunity.
In societies involved in a prolonged war, the percentage of society participating in the war increases, and as the number of those directly involved increases, the number of those indirectly involved similarly grows. As the war drags on, the death toll rises and the costs of continued fighting increases. These factors combine to raise both general and specific interests regarding how and when the war will end.
The instance of a large, powerful nation engaged in an asymmetrical limited war, captures both of these conditions.
The use of domestic politics in this study of war termination finds its roots in pluralist notions of domestic politics. 2 6 National goals are seen not as the exclusive aims of the elite leadership, but rather as the product which results when many groups with complex goals compete among themselves for some measure of satisfaction. 
The derivation of organizational goals is consistent with the neo-classical school of organization theory characterized by the work of Herbert A. Simon, James G. One considered essay on war termination observes that domestic politics affects all aspects of ending the war, including the formulation (and modification) of war objectives, the conduct of the war itself and the negotiation process to conclude the war. Public pressure to prolong a war, stemming from desires to recoup some return from the 'sunk costs' of the war, or pressure to terminate, stemming from general 'war weariness', derive their explanation largely from the domestic context.
The actual process of ending a war can inspire violent 28 This is not the first effort to understand war termination from a domestic politics viewpoint, but the current effort seeks to establish the relationship between domestic politics and war termination in a more comprehensive and theoretical way.
Of the earlier work, see the articles by Halperin, Randle and Rothstein in The Annals, and chapters 4 and 5 in Ikl&'s Every War Must End.

Indeed, in the case of Vietnam there was opposition to the Paris peace talks on the grounds that the costs invested in the war deserved better than a pleaded peace with an  The institutional conceptualization of domestic politics presented here relies, in part, on newer scholarship on political institutions, and focuses on the organizational bases of policy making. 1 It argues that, in certain 1 See, for example, James G.

The asymmetrical limited wars fought over the past forty years have revealed a suggestive pattern: consensus slowly forms among the national leadership that the war must end, and a period of time exists between the forming of that consensus and the achievement of war termination. It is during this period, or 'lag,' that one observes patterns of decisions which reflect the leadership's efforts to bring about an end to the war. During this time, domestic political factors gain primacy among all other variables that influence decision-making, such as negotiations, progress on the battlefield and other international pressures.

In terminating an asymmetrical limited war, legitimating policy decisions for the domestic audience confronts the leadership as a difficult but necessary aspect of politics in a society where consensus building is essential to governance. 2 Legitimation is sustained when the President succeeds in convincing enough members of his administration, Congress and the public that his policy goals are worthwhile, and that the means he has chosen to implement that policy will work. 3  But because the efforts of the leadership are constrained by strong institutional interests and pressures from other significant domestic groups, I argue that leaders maintain policy legitimacy, not only by forging supportive coalitions insofar as possible, but also, and more usually, The decision-making process in terminating an asymmetrical limited war provides a focus for the task of demonstrating this claim. War termination consists of a few significant policy decisions which establish the general direction and character of many lesser ones. Examples of such major decisions include the decision itself to end the war, the choice of the principal means to bring that end about, and recognition that the time is right to conclude a peace.
Having chosen termination, the decision-makers fix the direction that all subsequent implementation decisions will follow. The implementation decisions make up an important part of the leadership's effort to sustain legitimacy for its policy to end the war. 4 Because decision-makers work so hard to sustain legitimacy it becomes difficult for leaders to 4 A specific policy stance becomes then, to a degree, self-legitimating, since a decision made has much more force than a candidate decision. That the war will end, rather than continue (at a higher level of intensity perhaps), shifts the administration's effort toward finding an acceptable form for that ending to take. Thus for example, Johnson's move in Spring 1968 to de-escalate channeled subsequent decisions in that direction and established a pattern of decision-making which persisted to the end of his administration. The decisions that initiate such patterns and the patterns themselves which emerge from those decisions are the focus of the present study. It is argued here that these patterns represent not only efforts to implement the major decisions, but efforts to legitimate them within the domestic political context as well.
drastically change their policy without adverse political repercussions.
The politics of decision-making involved with terminating an asymmetrical limited war runs high and therefore considerable domestic controversy invariably attends the process. Thus when we observe policies which appear to disregard the systemic imperatives of the conflict situation, as is often the case in asymmetrical limited wars, the explanation lies in the domestic sphere. For example, what structural reasons exist for a nation's leadership to choose to de-escalate its military commitment despite a battlefield advantage (or stalemate)?
Similarly, what would induce a nation to accept the terms of a negotiated settlement which do not reflect those which might otherwise be obtained through the application of its clear military superiority?
How do these choices reflect a state's efforts to maximize its power? Safeguard its security? Preserve its international reputation as a great power? These behaviors, observable in the example of the United States ending its involvement in the Vietnam war, defy structural/systemic explanation. A domestic politics analysis provides a much better basis from which to gain an insight into the shape of the entire war termination effort, despite structural conditions which might demand alternative action from a state.

An institutional perspective also suggests that organizations acquire a dynamic, or inner logic, quite separate from the direction of the organization's leadership.
Organizations are complex entities, and to maintain that their leadership exerts primary influence over all its 9 This argument is consistent with the view of Charles Perrow who challenges current institutional work for its lack of specificity in defining the environment with which the organization interacts. It is his opinion that current scholarship too often takes the larger society as the 'environment' when, in fact, the whole group of organizations similar to the type under study is perhaps more appropriate. He challenges institutional treatments which fail to consider the inter-active relationship of organizations and their environments. Organizations are not merely created and molded by the environment in which they are found; they, in turn, create and mold the their environment.
The specification of the salient environments influencing (and influenced by) organizational behavior is an important element of the current argument. The institutions of government in this country are relatively stable. Though aspects of their internal configuration change, their goals remain largely intact, though they too may change gradually over time. Powerful governmental institutions do not experience the goal displacement that characterizes smaller or less powerful organizations which are far more sensitive to internal and external processes which can cause organizational drift or eventual disintegration. This is because governmental institutions are able to "institutionalize on their own terms," creating, to an extent, "the environments they desire, shape existing ones, and define which sections of it they will deal with" as Perrow argues that the large and powerful dominant private sector institutions do.

Complex Organizations,
What does an institutional perspective of domestic politics disclose about the motivations and ways in which Congress, the public, the media, the military, the bureaucracy, and the President's 'inner-circle' advisers influence Presidential decision-making in the termination of an asymmetrical limited war? Each of these groups has specific expectations, broadly defined to include issue demands and preferences for their implementation, regarding whether and how the war ends, and 10 The notion of organizational dynamic and momentum influencing goal formulation differs from the view is advanced particularly by the classical organization theory school. This body of scholarship, characterized by the writing of Fayol, Taylor, Weber and Gulick, advances a strong-leader role in organizational goal formulation and modification. The relevant articles of these authors appear in the Pugh and Shafritz and Ott volumes noted above.  To understand how military considerations can influence war termination decision-making, one must consider a nation's expectations regarding its success in a limited conflict, and the role and performance of the military over the course of the entire war. Nations do not start or fight wars to end them; they fight to win. This association of conclusion with victory, however ill-defined or vaguely understood, suggests that the military will have a good deal of policy influence in the early phases of a war. Expectations of victory also suggest that the military's interests in war termination will be tempered by its perception of its role as the agent through which victory is achieved. The means of warfare lie essentially in the hands of soldiers, and soldiers plan for war. For the military, ending the war means winning it.
And, as the first chapter of this work noted, one achieves miltar victory by relieving one's opponent of his immediate and potential ability to make war. Establishing the political significance of this victory, particularly in limited war, remains the difficult task of the nation's leadership and politicians.
Military considerations play an important part at any time in war, but the opening stages of a conflict present military advisers a particular opportunity to play a leading role in the policy process. The choice of war implies that decisionmakers will not only be more disposed to military advice, they might become less receptive to suggestions for resolving the dispute from groups not related to the immediate prosecution of the war. Choosing one strategy to deal with a problem, i.e. going to war, implies rejection, to a degree of other strategies. Thus, for example, Lyndon Johnson's decision in 1965 to increase the level of U.S. combat activity in Vietnam reflected a growing consensus among the leadership that the North Vietnamese could only be dissuaded from their designs on the South through force. The choice of the military option all but foreclosed extended consideration of alternatives over the next several months. 1 2   Once a war begins then, calls for ending the conflict or pursuing alternative means for settlement, though often present, find little support in the dynamic unfolding of events. Early in war, the military commitment tends to escalate, and the pattern of decision-making that emerges to support this escalation reinforces the choice of war, and the significance of the military in the policy process.
In these early stages, the civilian leadership also anticipates an end to the war through military victory.
Having linked their political fate to war, the leadership depends upon the military to achieve success and, quite obviously in the process, bring the war to an end.
Battlefield successes reinforce this dependence on the military, and the status of the military in the policy process remains high, their influence strong.
One is cautioned, however, not to see the relationship between the military and the civilian leadership quite so simplistically. To speak of the 'military's interests' in 12 The alternatives to force appeared to be two: develop a strong and stable government in South Vietnam responsible for and capable of its own defense, or negotiate a solution. The Administration held bleak prospects for both. 
Gelb and Betts,
Op.it.,
Each individual military service, concerned with its own autonomy and growth, tends to have a wider view of war termination, trying to anticipate the long term effects of a particular type of settlement on its future role. And by virtue of its position in the hierarchy and multi-service constitution, the general staff is more sensitive to the domestic and foreign policy implications of military actions and functions often as buffer between civilian decisionmakers and military field commanders. The experience of Vietnam revealed that 'military interests' were neither consistent across nor within services, varied over time and often emerged as a result of political battles both within 13 This point is convincingly made by Morton Halperin in "War Termination as a Problem in Civil-Military Relations," Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science 392 (November 1970): 86-95.
the Department of Defense and between DoD and other executive agencies.14 Time and poor progress on the battlefield work to cripple the effectiveness of military advisers. 1 5 Prospects for a rapid victory wane as a war progresses, and faith in the military diminishes as mediocre results mount, forcing the realization that military means will not bring hostilities to a decisive conclusion. A long, protracted war, or one going poorly, can precipitate consensus forming among the nation's leadership that the war should be ended before their military force is exhausted or decisiiely defeated.
A nation faced with setbacks can chose to escalate its commitment in the conflict, or if there is reasonable expectation that the enemy's fortune's will decline, simply hold out until that occurs. 1 6 But in some conflicts, the 14 For a masterful treatment of the how the Army's performance in Vietnam reflected strong institutional biases, see Andrew F. Krepinevich, The Army and Vietnam (Baltimore: Johns-Hopkins Press 1986).
15 Though indeed, scenarios can be envisaged in which time and poor performance combined to i military influence, though in a way and with results which lie outside the scope of the present work. I have in mind those situations in which reaction to the poor performance of the military comes from within the military itself---from a group of disaffected officers, for example---and this group takes action to usurp authority in the country via a military coup.
In this hypothetical case, poor military performance does not result in diminished military influence but asserted military dominance.
16 Michael Handel has suggested that expectations play an important role in war termination. The perception that one's realization sets in that an end to the war cannot be brought about through exclusively military means or that the war cannot be won at a price and level of commitment acceptable to the decision-makers. When decision-makers become convinced that there is no military solution to the conflict they begin to search for alternatives. This in fact occurred in the Spring of 1968 when Johnson and his advisers realized that the U.S. could not defeat North Vietnam without a sizeable---and ultimately unacceptable---increase in the level of U.S. combat power.17 'War ending' as opposed to 'war fighting' thinking slowly emerges to establish a new pattern of decision-making. The military is faced with the harsh reality that the responsibility for bringing an end to the war has, in effect, been taken out of their hands. The line between military and civilian affairs which often seems clear at the outbreak of war becomes blurred, and the military finds that not only has it lost the ability to decisively influence national policy, it begins to lose the ability to determine even the most own fortunes are on the rise, or one's opponent's are declining, will induce a belligerent to postpone the ending of a war, through the expectation that a more favorable outcome is possible.

technical aspects of waging war it regards as within its exclusive competence.
The forces which have served to convince decision-makers that a military solution is not possible or not worth added costs have acted in similar ways on other domestic political factors. Pressures mount for a change in policy. Those closest to the President have the opportunity for the most immediate impact. Among the inner circle of Presidential advisers, those long standing skeptics, or those who only slowly lost their enthusiasm for the war, often seize the opportunity to make the earliest and often most meaningful calls for change. 1 8   18 There is quite an extensive literature on the relationship between the President and his advisers.

Known as the 'rally effect', this support occurs because citizens tend to believe that their leaders are responding to a national threat and that unity, not divisiveness, is needed at this time. The onset of crisis conveys tacit legitimacy to the leadership's actions. There is an implicit assumption on the part of the general public that decision-makers have more information regarding the threatening situation and that their response---the war---is appropriate.
National leaders attempt to capitalize on this legitimacy for as long as possible and rely on battlefield successes, among other things, to maintain public support for their policies. For a nation such as the United States, the nature of the interaction between the public and politics imposes two demands on policy makers: that their efforts yield successful results, and that those results be achieved with some speed. 22   A lack of military success, combined with perceptions of an apparently interminable war, raise the public's war termination 'consciousness.' Battlefield failures precipitate a decline in expectations for future success, and public support for a war effort wanes similarly. Feelings of 'war weariness' begin to rise as casualties and other costs of continuing the war mount. But the decline in public support will not necessarily mean an increase in active opposition unless there are one or more opposition groups to mobilize the masses and give political expression to their discontent.
The general public represents the domestic group least well equipped to convert its expectations regarding the ending of a war into immediate and tangible pressures compelling Presidential action. Other domestic groups can provide that function. Advisers who have become disenchanted with the war often provide the important focus and direction for the public's unhappiness with the war effort use public opinion as a tool to bolster their positions in policy debates within the White House. Congress and the press provide official and unofficial fora for the expression of public sentiment and use the shifting public mood to augment pressure they might bring to bear for alternative policy preferences. 
22
The impact of public opinion will not only depend on its skillful handling by one or another major actor, but on the increased susceptibility of decision-makers to its significance. Political processes, such as elections, are means by which that can occur.
It opinion polls serve as the most frequent index of public sentiment, voting results remain the most important. For the nation's leadership, elections serve as the principal means by which they are made responsive to the general public. The possibility of electoral punishment or the prospect of electoral reward suggest a more significant role for public opinion in Presidential election years and, if less in midterm election years, still greater than in years without national elections. To ensure the success of their policies and their own political future, politicians must convert the ephemeral and amorphous public opinion into votes. The impact of the electoral cycle on the termination of an asymmetrical limited war, particularly if that war has become decidedly unpopular, is undeniable.
Questions which surround voting have preoccupied scholars for a number of years. 
In the United States, the 'elite media,' or press, refers to the three major television networks, the principal daily newspapers with national circulations, such as The New York Ti and Washington Post, and the major current affairs magazines Time and Newsweek. For a discussion of the role and impact of the press in the foreign policy making process carved for itself a political role with the implied position that it is as least as representative of the general public as Congress or the Presidency. Indeed, some have observed that the media has supplanted the political party system in important functions such as 'policing' the ranks of potential candidates, providing general and specific political education to the public and performing the service of encouraging people to vote. 2 5 Subtly intertwined with the policy making process, the media often casts existing policy disagreements in sharp relief. In situations such as the termination of an asymmetrical limited war where controversy surrounds policy choices and decisions, or even after a course of action has see Bernard C. Cohen, The Press and Foreign Policy (Princeton: University Press, 1963); Michael Baruch Grossman and Martha Joynt Kumar, Portraying the President:
The White House and the News Media (Baltimore: John-Hopkins University Press, 1981), and S. Robert Lichter, Stanley Rothman and Linda S. 
Lichter, The Media Elite (Bethesda, Maryland: Adler and Adler, 1986)

Braestrup, Big
News, scoops and headlines sell newspapers, and the various media compete between and among themselves for larger circulations and wider viewership. This economic reality points to a cyclical relationship between the press, the public and the politicians. A greater share of the market means that a particular newspaper or network reaches more of the national constituency, and the press attempt to capitalize on this fact to gain privileged access, thereby having more scoops and thereby gaining a wider audience.
Because a wide segment of the public reads newspapers, and an even wider segment watches television, politicians realize that the media offers useful, and cost saving, ways to reach their constituency. Thus the press gains the access they want; they sell more papers and air time and become ever more important and powerful in the political process. 28 By virtue of its responsibility as the representative branch, Congress has certain internal mechanisms and procedures that reflect the institutionalization of members' interests---the principal one of which is, of course, getting re-elected. One scholar, David Mayhew, has suggested that Congressional structures and procedures reflect this, and further suggests that, since members of Congress owe their allegiance to their constituencies, domestic issues generally receive more attention and Congress is often likely to take the lead here. Congress will manifest those behaviors which serve to maintain the organization and procedures with which it operates. Mayhew's convincing argument that Congressional structures and procedures reflect the principal motivation of Congressmen which is re-election generates the conclusion that re-election concerns militate against a strong and active role for Congress in foreign policy decision making. David R. 
Mayhew, Congress: The Electoral Connection (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1974)
29 Robert Randle offers a discussion of Congress' powers to influence Presidential decision-making in war termination which expands slightly on the three presented here. "The Domestic Origins of Peace," in TheAnnais, pp. 76-85. Of all of Congress' powers, it is clear that the power of the purse is its most significant. A President can side-step Congressional debates and inquiries which threaten his policies by charging that they are politically motivated ploys which ultimately work to harm the national interest.
The President can also attempt to by-pass Congress completely with appeals for support from the national constituency; a constituency which he alone can claim. But the President has little recourse when Congress withholds funds for a war effort---though in so doing, Congress immediately becomes the President's partner in the problem of terminating the war.
Because of Congress' power of the purse, the President must choose policy options and oversee their implementation with care. If, in the formulation of war termination policies or in the effort to sustain legitimacy for those policies, the President has infringed upon any of the rights and prerogatives of the legislature, Congress will react unfavorably. Indeed, depending on the extent to which the President appears to have overstepped his bounds, not only might his war termination policies be opposed, but other aspects of his political agenda become susceptible to serious challenge. The prospect of this debacle in the extreme makes Presidents particularly attentive to signs of trouble from Congress.30 30 Randle also makes this point, noting that impeachment is, of course, the weapon of ultimate recourse for Congress.
How does the President formulate and discharge policy amid the complex web of domestic political pressures that attend the process of terminating an asymmetrical limited war? To answer this question we must examine the organizational structure of the Presidency, the formal and informal resources of both the office and the incumbent, and the incentives which motivate the President to use the Executive structure and resources to formulate and discharge war termination initiatives.
The organizational structure of the Presidency includes the bureaucratic institutions of the Executive Branch and the formal procedures by which they interact with other governmental agencies and societal groups. Executive resources take in the position and reputation of the President as Chief Executive, senior member of his political party, head of state and Commander-in-Chief. Presidential power is finite and variable. 3 1 The limited formal capabilities of the Executive represent a dilemma for the 31 Following Neustadt's lead, 'powers' as used here, refers to authority formally granted to the Executive by the Constitution. 'Power' refers to the individual President's ability to accumulate additional influence resources and to exercise these and his 'powers' to accomplish his policy goals. See 
Richard Neustadt, Presidential Power, (New York: Wiley and Sons, 1960)
The Formal Structure of the Presidency It was no accident that the Founding Fathers were vague about the Constitutional responsibilities of the Executive. 3 3   Wishing to avoid the excesses of monarchical rule, they

In addition, of course, there are many useful treatments of the Presidency from a Constitutional perspective. "'He'll sit here,' Truman would remark (taping his desk for emphasis),' and he'll say, 'Do this! Do that!' And nothing will happen.'" Quoted in Neustadt, Presidential Power, p. 9 (emphasis original.) 37 There are, of course, extensive literatures which analyze each of these agencies and their relationship with the President. A small sample is cited here. For general works on the bureaucracy of foreign policy see, "The Organization of the Government for the Conduct of Foreign Policy", The Robert D. Murphy Commission Report, 7 vols., 
(Washington D. C.: Government Printing Office, 1975)
For more theoretical treatments, see, Graham T. Allison, Essence of Decision; Anthony Downs, Inside participate in the foreign policy making process with its committees on foreign policy, defense and intelligence in both the House and Senate, it is the executive agencies which represent the means by which the President discharges policy and attempts to orchestrate domestic legitimacy for those policies. Presidential appointments, both major and minor, provide executive entree into these bureaucratic agencies.
The existence of formal structures does not guarantee a President smooth decision making or policy implementation processes. As noted earlier, governmental institutions, like all organizations, operate with complex sub-routines which, contrary to expectations of process expediency, often make any amount of production a marvel. Bureaucratic agencies are in fact institutions which demand much from the President. The President's task is to obtain policy results through the bureaucratic conviction that the implementation of a Presidential initiative sustains their existence. the most significant: re-election, popular acclaim, and history's favor. 4 1   The political realities of public office-holding bear down hard on every elected official, and the President is no exception. The desire for re-election represents a compelling motivation for first-term Presidents faced with pressures to demonstrate policy success. Nevertheless, it is difficult to determine precisely the extent of the electoral motivation behind Presidential decisions and actions. Indeed, President's themselves, often do not know the exact reasons for their behavior. But we do know that Presidents, from the moment of their election, are under severe time constraints.
They must initiate policies and, with luck, begin the process of implementation to capitalize on successes or overcome adversities in time for re-election---today 'in time for reelection' means no more than two and one half to three years into a term. Getting elected and staying in office is a prime motivator of politicians and political behavior. As Theodore Sorensen observed, politics is ". ..an ever-present influence---counterbalancing the unrealistic, checking the unreasonable, sometimes preventing the desirable, but always 41 For discussions of other Presidential incentives see, Cronin, State of the Presidency, p. 182.
Cronin cites underlying incentives shaping Presidential performance as the doing those things which are a) easy; b) urgent; c) 'Presidential.' Neustadt observes that a President's actions are motivated by a need to a) ease his own conscience; b) conciliate a faction; c) please a trusted counsellor; and d) countervail opposing power 
(Presidential Power,
p.87)
There is possibly no better description of the re-election incentive as it applies to Presidents in office.
Obviously, however, the prospect of another term in office is not the only incentive which motivates a President. A second term President, obviously less inspired by reelection, is motivated instead by desires for popular acclaim or 'history's favor.' For people in general, and perhaps politicians in particular, there is a genuine need to be popular. For Presidents, popularity is important beyond reasons related to personal prestige; it forms the basis of their political strength as President. Without popular support, the President has lost a valuable resource, and any public appeal he may make to bypass a recalcitrant Congress or unresponsive bureaucracy will be less effective. Because the President is politically motivated, even in his foreign policy actions, it is not unlikely that his objectives may collide with those of other domestic groups.
These collisions can be catastrophic for the nation's war termination policies.
Though the powers of the President are generally perceived as formidable, scholars have told us that while the Presidency is at once too powerful, it is always inadequate.
The Presidency is
[a]lways too powerful because it is contrary to our ideal of a 'government by the people' and always too powerful, as well, because it now possesses the capacity to wage nuclear war (a capacity that unfortunately doesn't permit much in the way of checks and balances and deliberative, participatory government).
Yet always inadequate because it seldom achieves our highest hopes for it, not to mention its own stated intentions. 4 4   This points to the policy dilemma facing the Presidency in war termination. Though immensely powerful by virtue of a unique position at the certer of government, every President is confronted with the task of accomplishing nearly unattainable policy goals while accommodating, to greater or lesser degrees, the expectations of policy outcomes and pressure for their implementation, which the various domestic groups insist upon. The President's tools for doing accommodating these pressures are essentially the bureaucracy surrounding the Executive Branch and the personal and political resources he can bring to bear to generate results from this bureaucracy---both of which must function within the wider framework of the entire government. The policy imperatives he advances, and the points at which he applies pressure to achieve them, depend, in turn, on his political motivations and incentives. 44 Cronin, The State of the Presidency, p. 22.
Presid<nts take bold foreign policy moves in an election year, though only if they are calculated to succeed.
But in addition to competing domestic pressures, time constraints, limited knowledge, and scant control over policy implementation act to constrain Presidential action. 4 5 Time constraints are imposed not only by the four year duration of a Presidential term, but also by mid-term elections and the time-frame of war. Given the pressures of time, Presidents are loathed to rely exclusively on bureaucratic processes for the implementation of their pol*cies. To achieve rapid successes, it is often desirable that the solution to a problem be found from those which do not heavily depend on agencies external to the White House for their implementation. 4 6   45 For an extended discussion of these and other obstacles to quality decision-making, see the section on "Sources of Impediments to Information Processing" in George, Presidential Decisionmaking in Foreign Policy.
46 An example of this is the increasing reliance on Executive Agreements, as the means of solidifying international understandings, as opposed to formal Treaties. Treaties require two-thirds approval of the Senate, and this process is often politically charged and potentially embarrassing to the President. The Executive Agreement can be seen as a means of centralizing the policy implementation process to spare the President and those with whom the agreement is made, unwanted disclosure of negotiating detail, inordinate delay, and the political expense of controversial agreement. For a discussion of the use of Executive Agreements in this way see Troch Johnson and James M. For policy implementation, the task is far more difficult, though the Presidential desire for as much control as possible here is no less than in the policy formulation 47 See George's discussion of the limits of Presidential knowledge, their attempts to overcoming these limitations, and the pitfalls which confront these attempts in Presidential Decisionmaking, pp. 25-53. For other discussions of limitations of Presidential decisionmaking, see Cronin, State of the Presidency, pp. 332-336; and Theodore Sorensen, Decision Making in the White House, pp. 24-42.

stage. As noted earlier, the bureaucracy exists to provide the administrative underpinnings of the governmental process.
Often however, it is perceived as a nearly insurmountable hindrance to that process. Heclo maintains that neutral competence is desirable in government. He decries what he sees as an erosion of the standards of neutral competence stemming from "..a real... danger...that demands on government performance are growing and... the need for continuity, executive branch coordination, and independent analysis is increasing..." the era of the modern Presidency. 53 They are not merely oneshot attempts by which Presidents have sought to achieve their aims. Rather, they are manifested institutional responses to pressures from the domestic political environment.
This chapter has offered an institutional conceptualization of domestic politics which focused on how various domestic groups within this country might pressure war termination policy making. In the United States, the President as the locus of decision-making, confronts many preferences, demands, and expectations from various groups trying to influence war termination decision-making.
In the face of these pressures, the President attempts to sustain legitimacy for his chosen policies by using the organizational structure of the Executive Branch of government and the other resources of his office. The President is motivated to formulate and adjust policy by his desires for re-election, popular support or history's favor.
The legitimation process represents the President's effort to achieve politically acceptable and substantively prudent courses of action in the process of achieving the ultimate 53 Noting this with particular reference to the Nixon administration is Wildavsky in "Government and the People," in Wildavsky, ed. Perspectives on the Presidency, pp. 56-57. See also the discussion of 'peopling the government' in 
Crabb and Mulcahy,
Presidents and Foreign Policy Making,
A President is fundamentally politically motivated; he must be sensitive to the political environment and end a controversial war in a way that will safeguard the national interest and ensure his own political longevity. The problem of accommodating the President's desire for re-election with the substantive needs of foreign policy exposes two tensions which exist in a democratic society. The first is the tension which exists between the search for 'better decisions' in ways which preserve the democratic process while guaranteeing efficient government. The second pits the requirement for rapid executive action against the rights of the people to know what their government is up to. The termination of an asymmetrical limited war often brightly illuminates these tensions.
The following section consists of three chapters, each corresponding to a major war termination decision: Johnson's decision in 1968 to de-escalate; Nixon's choice of a complex strategy involving withdrawals, negotiations and Vietnamization in 1969; and the decision in January 1973 to accept the terms of a formal peace treaty. If these chapters demonstrate that it is the complex domestic political inducements and pressures which yielded these major policy choices of the war, in the face of systemic counter-demands for policy, an important limitation of structuralism will be established. We are prepared to move immediately toward peace through negotiations.. .in the hope that this action will lead to early talks, I am taking the first step to de-escalate the conflict. We are reducing---substantially reducing---the present level of hostilities.
And we are doing so unilaterally and at once. 1   It is easy to forget that on the evening of

Reports from earlier in the year, which gave qualified endorsement to the notion that the U.S. had turned the tide and indeed could eventually 'win' this war, had begun a flow of official memoranda, message traffic and studies, the cumulative effect of which advanced the idea that successful progress was being made in the war, and military victory could indeed be achieved. 5 The only question that remained to be answered was, when?
In the early years, the answer to that question was thought to reside largely in the results of the military's combat efforts. Though the Johnson administration sought to end the fighting via diplomacy numerous times, the regime of Ho Chi Minh proved remarkably adept at playing the political game of 4 A compilation of the trend in public support for the war during the period 1969 through 1969, containing, of course, the period relevant to the present chapter, in contained in The Gallup Opinion Index 52 (October 1969):

Vietnam was necessary to ensure this and that could only be guaranteed by the presence of U.S. military power. 6   From the moment LBJ authorized the first aerial bombardment strikes and the first major ground troop deployments to South 6 According to Allan Goodman: "Once at war, Washington's strategy for terminating it depended on success on the battlefield. In President Johnson's mind, achieving a position of strength became an essential prerequisite for negotiations. The President quickly realized that such a position was not likely to be achieved rapidly merely by strengthening the GVN. It was essential at the same time to increase military pressure on North Vietnam and thus compel Hanoi to negotiate." The Lost Peace (Stanford, California: Hoover Institution, 1978), p. 24. Over the course of three years, the U.S ground force commitment grew from 23,000 in December 1964 to almost 450,000 in December 1967, and, as the level of American military activity grew, the possibility of a negotiated settlement shrank. The bitter and largely fruitless experience of attempting to negotiate with Hanoi coupled with the widened ground war and its reported progress generated and supported the feeling in Washington that the war could be 'won' through the military defeat of the North Vietnamese.
Vietnam in 1965, the uniformed services became the chief advocates of a military solution to the war. The military naturally pressed hard for the resources thought necessary to a successful and expedient prosecution of the conflict.
Their combat experience in this century had validated a strategy and doctrine of war fighting which traced its roots to a deep-seated American preference to avoid unnecessary loss of human life in war. Complex military organization, massive firepower and modern technology were the hallmarks of the 'American way of war,' and the Vietnam experience would be no different.
As the war in Vietnam developed, two distinct elements of the American effort emerged: ground combat and aerial bombardment. While the ground war belonged to the Army, the air war, code-named "Rolling Thunder," was conceived and executed principally by the Air Force with support from the Navy. For reasons relating to his desire to maintain the costs of the war at minimum levels, Johnson relied heavily on the air war to achieve the objectives in Vietnam. 7 The ground war, once underway however, offered unintended competition to the aerial effort for the limited resources which the President was willing to commit to the war. The Force, were cast in sharp relief. These long-standing, and often not so subtle, inter-service rivalries had been brewing since the formation of the Air Force in the wake of World War II.
The combination of events which led President Eisenhower to adopt a strategic doctrine of 'massive retaliation' formed the basis of, and justification for, the institutional rise of the Air Force to a prominent role in this nation's defense. Threatening nuclear retaliation to Communist aggression, the Eisenhower administration relied on the Air Force as the military agent who would make good that threat.
Throughout the 1950s the Army struggled to maintain a significant role in national defense. 8 8 In the wake of World War II, with the establishment of the Air Force and the institution of the strategic doctrine of 'massive retaliation,' the Army's frustration with its rapidly diminishing responsibilities and prestige bubbled to the surface in a series of articles published in the New York Times in May 1956. For an indictment of the policies which the Army labored under during the Eisenhower years, see

Harry Summers, On Strategy:
Krepinevich rejects Summers' claims that lack of strategic resolve, the failure on the part of the civilian leadership to secure popular backing for the war, and a strangulating control on the war by non-military leaders contributed to the defeat. Interested readers should also see General Bruce Palmer's very competent treatement of the military in Vietnam, The The young president persistently directed the Army to expand its doctrinal notions and institute a Special Forces program commensurate with the administration's emphasis on counter-insurgency. The Army's means to resist this unwanted mission, however, proved formidable. Rejecting the notion that counter-insurgency warfare required any particular skill, the Army remained convinced that because of its doctrinal emphasis on large forces supported by superior technology and massive firepower, conflicts which required less could be easily handled by simply 'scaling down.' 1 1  In simple terms, the massive organization and established operations of the Army militated against counter-insurgency doctrine.
As a result, the Army marginalized the study and development of unconventional warfare and indeed, were "still reviewing the concept" when Lyndon Johnson was elected President in 1964.12 Though Special Forces operations went on in Vietnam, the bulk of the ground effort was committed to fighting conventional warfare as the Army had developed the concept. The military's view was that this nation wins its  It includes the provision of sustained, credible territorial security, the destruction of the enemy's underground government, the assertion or reassertion of political control and involvement of the people in government, and the initiation of economic and social activity capable of self-sustenance and expansion.

The felt that there was too much bombing, the military, and its supporters, felt there was too little.
Designed to impede and reduce the flow of enemy troops and supplies across the intra-Vietnamese border and to impose an ever higher price on the North for its aggression in the South, the bombing campaign was intentionally limited. The military's opposition to the limitations stemmed from the feeling that the target restrictions imposed by the White House violated basic tenets of sound air war doctrine.
For "Rolling Thunder" to be successful, the military believed they needed to hit the enemy at three strategic points: at the source of war related materiel; along the routes by which supplies moved to the front; and on the battlefield itself, to increase the enemy's consumption of scarce and vital supplies such as ammunition and fuel. The military maintained that the United States' aerial effort, and consequently the ground war, could be made immeasurably more effective if the source of war supply---the ports---were hit. The freedom to strike these targets was all the more important because the weather restrictions of the monsoon season allowed effective bombing only from the middle of May to the middle of September each year. 17
System Worked ( suggested that in addition to being restricted to the fair weather months, the aerial campaign was also hampered by bomber inaccuracies. Hoopes observed that Air Force preoccupations with the development and fielding of strategic nuclear forces after World War II resulted in the service's neglect of tactical air operations. He writes: "It was.. .a little publicized fact that bombing inaccuracies had improved hardly at all in the period between Korea and and Vietnam. Shrouded in professional embarrassment, the explanation was traceable to the Eisenhower-Dulles era and the strategy of 'massive retaliation."
Throughout that period most of the Air Force money, operational energies, and creative research was applied to the development of strategic nuclear forces...while tactical aviation was starved and neglected. Even the few tactical fighter-bombers developed in those years were build and programmed as nuclear weapons carriers, and since pinpoint accuracy is not a necessity with nuclear weapons, no one devoted much attention to advancing the art of precision delivery."

The growing pressure of U.S. air operations has not shaken the North Vietnamese leaders' conviction that they can withstand the bombing and outlast the U.S. and South Vietnam in a protracted war of attrition.
Nor has it caused them to waver in their belief that the outcome of this test of will and endurance will be determined primarily by the course of the conflict on the ground in the South, not by the air war in the North. 
24
Ground commanders promoted the air war because they genuinely believed that bombing pauses in the North resulted in increased American and South Vietnamese casualties in the South. 2 5 They were frustrated that this association might not be made by civilian policy makers or observers outside government, who might be inclined instead to attribute rising casualty rates to generally poor military performance, or worse, a lack of leadership on the ground.
25 The comments by General Wallace M. Green, Commandant of the Marine Corps, in an address given during one of the Administration-mandated bombing pauses typifies this view: "We have stopped [the bombing, and] we suffer az.Aditional casualties as a result." Vital Speeches 33 (June 1, 1967): 509-512, p. 512.
But precisely because of the magnitude of its destructive capability, the air war was held in check by the White House who was fearful that it could lead to the Soviet Union or the People's Republic of China joining the war. 2 6  The possibility that the bombardment could have such unintended consequences meant that the military were never completely successful in wresting control of the bombing away from the White House. The military did, however, achieve at one point or another, the opportunity to attack nearly every major target they requested. squarely on the side of the military, and used these hearings to give public air to resentments which had been brewing for some time across the Potomac.
In a thinly veiled attempt to discredit the Defense Secretary, expose what they believed to be his isolated opinions, and thereby remove him as an obstacle to military requests for unrestrained bombing, the committee heard testimony from every senior military officer associated with the air war. McNamara, recently returned from Saigon, was the only civilian called. 2 9   In his statement before the committee on August 25 McNamara defended the Administration's policy, and observed that increased bombing and fewer target restrictions, as desired by the military, would not yield results appreciably different from the current effort.
selective, carefully targeted bombing campaign, such as we are presently conducting.. .can and does render the infiltration of men and supplies more difficult and more costly.
At the same time, it demonstrates to both South and North Vietnam our resolve to see that aggression does not succeed.
A less discriminating bombing campaign against North Vietnam would, in my opinion, do no more.
We have no reason to believe that it would break the will of the North Vietnamese people or sway the purpose of their leaders. That the air campaign has not achieved its objectives to a greater extent cannot be attributed to inability or impotence of airpower. It attests, rather, to the fragmentation of our air might by overly restrictive controls, limitations, and the doctrine of 'gradualism' ... The top military leaders of this country are confident that the Port of Haiphong can be closed, the land lines of communication to China interdicted, and Hanoi's receipt and distribution by sea and land routes of war-sustaining materiel greatly reduced by Air Force and Navy aviation if they are permitted to do so... in view of the unsatisfactory progress of the war, logic and prudence requires that the decision be with the unanimous weight of professional military judgement... the cold fact is that [the administration's current] policy has not done the job and it has been contrary to the best military judgement.

Within 50 See, for example, William Tuohy, "Newsmen's View of Viet War Fails to Match U.S. Optimism," The Los Angeles Times, October 29, 1967, pp. 1, 10; and Ward Just, "The Heart-Mind Gap In the Vietnam War," Washington Post, November 19, 1967, pp. B1-2. ..there will be a billion Chinese on the Mainland, armed with nuclear weapons, with no certainty about what their attitude toward the rest of Asia will be.. .the free nations of Asia.. .don't want China to overrun them on the basis of a doctrine of the world revolution.. .we are not picking out Peking as some sort of special enemy. Peking has nominated itself by proclaiming a militant doctrine of the world revolution, and doing something about it." (Pentagon Papers, IV, pp. 681-2). His words were echoed by Vice-President Humphrey in Doylestown, Pennsylvania on October 15 who said that world peace was threatened by a ". ..militant, aggressive Asian community, with its headquarters in Peking China... [tjhe threat to our security is in Asia. And we are hostile rhetoric of Mao Tse Tung, a nation whose domestic problems threatened the country with self-collapse. CIA analysts in Washington generally shared this view. Their skepticism regarding the purpose for which the U.S. was fighting, coupled with their grim assessment of the progress that had been made, directly countered the reports from CIA elements in Saigon. 5 4 However, the assessments of these second and third-tier officials did not persuade senior policy makers who in these months were preoccupied with diffusing criticism from outside the administration.
November saw repeated illustrations of the differences between official administration positions on the war and the reports of the media. Government officials continued to insist that positive progress was steadily being made, while the news media in the Capital, fueled by reports from the hundreds of newsmen on the ground in Vietnam, claimed otherwise. U.S. offices in Saigon buttressed the optimistic claims of the White House with a maze of official cables and reports which did lead one toward optimism (though they often appeared irreconcilable---with calls for increased resources fighting there not only for the Vietnamese, but for ourselves and the future of our country." 54 Hoopes, Limits of Intervention, pp. 94-5. The stark difference between Washington and Saigon groups of both the State Department and CIA would resurface again under Nixon, particularly during the reassessment of Vietnam policy which occurred in the formative months of his administration. juxtaposed with claims of improving conditions.) By official measurement, the cumulative effect of the military's effort in South Vietnam was having the desired effects. American casualty rates were leveling off and declining, the influx of new technology and improved tactics combined for more effective ground operations, 'free elections' had been held in the South (though admittedly with less than desired results), and the ARVN was showing signs of growing competence.55
The view from the media could hardly have been more disparate. Reporters 'on the ground,' saw no evidence that the North was easing up through a loss of will. Saigon was as corrupt as ever, and the ARVN remained all but completely ineffectual. By revealing the 'truthful details', as they saw them, the media implicitly claimed sole authority to relate the accurate story of Vietnam, often rejecting out of hand, official press releases and battle accounts. 5  For interesting discussions of some of the factors which reportedly biased media coverage of the war on the ground in Vietnam, see, Kathleen Turner, Lyndon Johnson's Dual War: Vietnam and the Press (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, media, capitalizing upon and, to a degree, providing the basis for a growing mistrust of official reports of progress in the war, slowly gained the upper hand in the credibility war waged on the home front, giving shape to the changing political will of the nation.
The administration tried to counter by emphasizing, as it had all year, positive progress in the war. 5 7 Ambassador Bunker and General Westmoreland were recalled from Saigon to 1985), pp. 218-219. Later, in an analysis of the media coverage of the Tet Offensive of 1968, Peter Braestrup, correspondent for The Washington Post and The New York Times would write:
". ..the collective emanations of the major media were producing a kind of continuous black fog of their own, a vague conventional 'disaster' image, which few newsmen attempted to reexamine and which few news managers at home sought to question. Indeed, in the case of Newsweek, NBC, and CSB, and of photo displays by others, the disaster theme seemed to be exploited for its own sake."

Washington. 2 volumes (Boulder, Colorado: Westview Press, 1977)
In the rest of the country, however the hard questions being asked as winter set in, revolved around the issue of whether the U.S. was, in fact, winning the war. Indeed, if the United States was not fighting to impose military defeat on North Vietnam, what would it take to force Hanoi to cease its aggression in the South? 72 What would it take to end this war?
72 That the United States did not seek the military defeat of North Vietnam was made repeatedly in official statements. See, for example, the statement by U.S. AmbassAdor to the United Nations Arthur J. Goldberg on October 10, 1966. "...We do not seek to overthrow the Government of North Viet-Nam... we do not ask of North Viet-Nam an unconditional surrender or indeed the surrender of anything that belongs to it..." (for excerpts of this and other official justifications for the war, see Pentagon Papers, IV, pp. 626-684.) See also the testimony of Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp at the Stennis committee hearings in August 1967. Air War Against North Vietnam, part 1, p. 5.  This exchange, as others before, reveals how complex political relationships within nations can influence relations between belligerents at war.
In the United States, Senate hawks and the military exerted nearly constant demands on the White House that the U.S. assume a more aggressive stance in the war. They called for full mobilization and fewer restrictions in the air war.
Other Congressmen, however, reacti:.g to the 47% of the American people dissatisfied with the President's handling of the war, desired no additional troop deployments prior to the Presidential elections in the Fall. A decision to halt the bombing would accordingly seem to require a corollary decision to alter the around force strategy (but there are] political difficulties [with this switch] .
Abandonment of 78 These words, however, did not reflect the majority sentiment of his party. In reality the Republicans were keenly divided over just what the best policy for dealing with the war should be. Some, like Senators John Cooper of Kentucky and Jacob Javits of New York, favored a negotiated settlement to the war, while hard liners, represented by the position of Senator Tower, believed the war should be brought to a conclusion through the application of decisive military means, such as an intensified bombing campaign.

"The extent of this offensive was not known to us, although we did feel it was going to be widespread. The timing was not known... I did not anticipate that they would strike in the cities and make them their targets." Assenting in this, Johnson later wrote:
...Tet was.. .a shock, in one degree or another, to all of us..
We knew that a show of strength was coming; it was more massive than we had anticipated.
We knew that the Communists were aiming at a number of population centers; we did not expect them to attack as many as they did. We knew that the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong were trying to achieve better coordination of their countrywide moves; we did not believe they would be able to carry out the level of coordination they demonstrated, We expected a large force to attack; it was larger than we had estimated. 9 0   The American military puzzled over the assault. 9  In the States, the offensive proved to many, that despite repeated aerial bombardment and reported setbacks on the 92 For the domestic impact of the Tet Offensive, particularly on the administration and official Washington, see: Tom Wicker, "Vietcong's Attacks Shock Washington," New YokTimes, February 2, 1968, pp. Some others here [in Washington, D.C.] believe that the breaking point could readily come before the presidential election in November-but not necessarily to the advantage of either Mr. Johnson's election chances or his place in history. ground, the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were still able to coordinate and conduct a major operation. Tet shattered whatever vision there was that an end to the war could be brought about quickly at the existing level of resource commitment. 9 3 More than this, however, it convinced many that the military effort of the United States thus far in the war had been all but completely ineffective in forcing the North Vietnamese to capitulate. 9 4   The irony of the Tet Offensive is that while it led to the establishment of a military advantage for the U.S. and South Vietnamese forces, it dealt a devastating blow to the administration's strategy for fighting the war. In analytic 93 As Henry Kissinger would later note:
". ..the Tet offensive marked the watershed of the American effort. Henceforth, no matter how effective our actions, the prevalent strategy could no longer achieve its objectives within a period or with the force levels politically acceptable to the American people. This realization caused Washington, for the first time, to put a ceiling on the numbers of troops for Vietnam. Denied the very large additional forces requested, the military command in Vietnam felt obliged to begin a gradual change from its periphery strategy to one concentrating on the protection of populated areas. This made inevitable an eventual commitment to a political solution and marked the beginning of the quest for a negotiated settlement."
"The Viet Nam Negotiations," Foreign Affairs 47 (January 1969): 211-34, p. 216.
94 The following observation is taken from the Pentagon Papers:
"One of the inescapable conclusions of the Tet experience that helped to shape (the] decision [to change strategies] was that as an interdiction measure against the infiltration of men and supplies, the bombing had been a near total failure. Moreover, it had not succeeded in breaking Hanoi's will to continue the fight."

97 The White House was very aware of the experience of the French at Dien Bien Phu in 1954, and were more than a little uncomfortable with the obvious parallels that would inevitably be drawn. A number of memos detailing the similarities between the two campaigns appear among the documents of the period. Westmoreland, who had been reluctant to request additional forces, replied to General Wheeler that he would ". ..welcome reinforcements at any time they [could] be made available." '9 9   But three days later he requested, in far clearer and more urgent terms, an accelerated deployment of forces already programmed: "I now have approximately 500,000 U.S. troops.. .I have been promised 525,000, which according to present Library. The siege of Khe Sanh is dramatically covered in "The Dusty Agony of Khe Sanh," Newsweek, 
March 18, 1968, pp. 28-37.
Wheeler reiterated this advice in a cable sent to Westmoreland the following day: "... my sensing is that the critical phase of the war is upon us, and I do not believe that you should refrain from asking for what you believe is required under the circumstances." CJCS message dated 090021Z February (NSC History of the 
March 31
99 COMUSMACV message dated 091633Z February (NSC History of the March 31 Decision).
Westmoreland later recalled that "it seemed to me that for political reasons or otherwise, the President and the Joint Chiefs of Staff were anxious to send me reinforcements.. .My first thought was not to ask for any, but the signals from Washington got stronger." (reported in Schandler, Unmaking of A President, p. 97.) General Maxwell Taylor, when asked by the President for his comments on this cable, replied that he found it "hard to believe that this cable is written by the same man as the preceding one, 091633Z... An indication of the subtle ways in which institutional biases worked to shape policy is illustrated by the fact that, included in the troops request were 15 tactical fighter squadrons which were required to maintain the existing ratio of air support to ground forces. The underlying rationale for this ratio was never analyzed. One Air Force Official present at the Department of Defense consideration of the request in late February 1968, reasoned that the lack of careful assessment of the actual air-toground force requirements was because this " ... was a matter of some delicacy in Army-Air Force relations because it touched the boundary line between the assigned roles and Westmoreland agreed that only the first of these increments would be earmarked for Vietnam and intentionally designed the entire package to correct what, from their perspective, was a dangerous imbalance in U.S. global forces. 1 0 8   The complex generation of this controversial troop request illustrates the extent to which domestic political factors dominated Vietnam policy making. The immediate situation in Vietnam simply did not demand the numbers represented in their request; indeed, Westmoreland was optimistic regarding his prospects for success even in the absence of reinforcements (indeed, he had to be coached to submit a request at all).
But Wheeler realized that the President would never order the call-up if he believed things could be managed with current levels. Writing that Westmoreland faced serious and sustained pressure from the enemy, Wheeler observed: "MACV will be hard pressed to meet adequately all threats. Under these circumstances, we must be prepared to accept some reverses. ' 1 0 9 But the Chairman knew only too well that the President was not prepared to accept any reverses and emphasized that Westmoreland could not be expected to hold the slim advantage he currently had. Success, he argued, ultimately lay in aggressively regaining the battlefield initiative. "It is the consensus of responsible commanders that 1968 will be the pivotal year. The war may go on beyond 1968 but it is unlikely that the situation will return to the pre-TET condition. The forces committed and the tactics involved are such that the advantage will probably swing one way or the other, during the current year."
His words resonate today with an irony only history provides.
110 "MACV Force Requirements." message to the President. Wheeler felt that a healthy reserve would allow the U.S. to meet global contingencies (the worst of which, arguably, was the total collapse of the ARVN, an event which would compel the U.S. to assume the warfighting burden entirely) and give the military necessary flexibility to pursue a more aggressive strategy in the war.
But General Wheeler neglected to discuss scenarios which could develop if the situation in Vietnam became less grave, and he did not tie the request to his desire for a reconstituted strategic reserve. 1 1 1   On February 27 the President and his advisers reviewed Wheeler's cable. McNamara, in his final days as Secretary of Defense, spoke out sharply against the increase. He reminded the President of the memo he had sent in November which called for a bombing cessation, an officially declared troop ceiling and a thorough review of U.S. policy in Southeast Asia. 1 1 2 With the current force levels in Vietnam standing at 111 In an interview some years later, Wheeler himself acknowledged the omissions: "I emphasized how Westy's forces were badly stretched, that he had no capability to redress threats except by moving troops around. I emphasized the threat in I Corps [the northernmost tactical region of South Vietnam].
More attacks on the cities were, I said, a possibility. I argued that Westy needed flexibility and capability. I talked about going on the offensive and taking offensive operations, but I didn't necessarily spell out the strategic options. John B.

Clark Clifford, McNamara's replacement, later recalled how General Wheeler's message shocked the White House. 1 1 3 The optimism based on the cultivated image that the U.S. had the upper hand in the war was shattered. The report from Wheeler gave the President and his advisers the impression that disaster was all but imminent if troops in the numbers Westmoreland requested were not forthcoming. The President had to make a decision. The "Great Society," Johnson's chief domestic program, served to constrain in important economic and philosophic ways the level of commitment the President was willing to give to the war. Attempting to avoid strains on the economy and misdirected fiscal priorities, Johnson never called for the mobilization and build-up necessary to launch a war in earnest. 1 1 4 His failure to do so aided, in part, the reliance on bombing as the principal means of war fighting in the early years. Bombing was the most economical way to wage war, and economy was one of the chief recommendations of the aerial campaign.115
Persuaded by Wheeler's cable that the situation .onfronting U.S. troops was critical, the President could not afford to postpone fulfilling the request and have to face possible future charges that the defeat of U.S. forces resulted from his hesitancy at this moment. 1 1 6 On February 28, the 114 For Johnson's thoughts on the relationship between his chief domestic program and foremost foreign policy concern see, The Vantage 
Point,
116 The following excerpt from the Pentagon Papers captures the dilemma: "A fork in the road had been reached. President named Clark Clifford, the new Secretary of Defense, to head an ad hoc task force to examine the military's request for additional troops, beginning what one official account called the "A to Z Reassessment" of U.S. policy in South Vietnam. 1 1 7   The Task Force consisted of advisers from the Defense and State Departments, the White House, and the CIA. 1 1 8 At the Now the alternatives stood out in stark reality. To accept and meet General Wheeler's request for troops would mean a total U.S. military commitment to SVN [South Vietnam]---an Americanization of the war, a callup of reserve forces, vastly increased expenditures. To deny the request for troops, or to attempt to again cut it to a size which could be sustained by the thinly stretched active forces, would just as surely signify that an upper limit to the U.S. military commitment in SVN had been reached." (Pentagn Paors, IV, p. 549).
117 Pentagon Papers, IV, p. 549. Clifford recalled his mandate as somewhat more restricted than Johnson. He wrote later:
"We were not instructed to assess the need for substantial increases in men and materiel; we were to devise the means by which they could be provided.

Military victory was as elusive as ever and indeed, would take unmeasured resources and the whole of an additional five years to be achieved---if at all. Acheson went on to tell the President that his speeches were believed by no-one, either at home or abroad, and he concluded with the plain observation that the country was no longer supporting the war. Johnson indicated that he wished to discuss the general situation in Vietnam, including the progress the South Vietnamese had made on their own behalf. He also told his advisers that he intended to make a 'serious peace proposal.' 1 3 9 Debate within the group of advisers centered around the type of constructive gesture which the U.S. could take to induce the North to negotiate in good faith.
Secretary of State Rusk had proposed a bombing pause some days ago which Clifford opposed because he believed it did not go far enough. 14 0 Many members of the group agreed that it did not seem likely that a bombing pause would lead to negotiations. Considering this, and the fact that press leaks had come to be routine in his administration, Johnson had decided to excise the peace initiative from the speech.  The President slowly realized that he could no longer persist in his current policies and that a fundamental change in direction, away from combat and toward negotiation, must be made. He had been unable to sustain the domestic legitimacy necessary for his policies to be successful. The threshold of the national will to absorb nearly any costs associated with the war hovered dangerously near collapse.
Acknowledging the need for change, the task remained to define its direction.

The rigors of the previous months left their mark on Johnson, who, in a stunning epilogue to the announced policy change in the war, removed himself from the race for the Presidency in the coming 149 There was no small amount of controversy among the Presidential advisers surrounding the final draft of Johnson's speech. The language of the initial draft was considerably more bellicose than the version which was finally delivered on March 31.
In an interview, Clifford recalled meeting in Dean Rusk's office on March 28 to refine the speech. Finding no peace initiative or discussion of a bombing halt, he objected:
"The draft was a hard-nosed, stern call for a continuation of the policy of the application of force and a call for public support for a continuation of a policy that ',ould ultimately bring us out all right. I thought that was a completely incorrect approach." (Quoted in Schandler, Unmaking of a President, p. 273).

Conservatives urged more, liberals called for less. In the end, the erosion of support from the hawks did more to undermine the legitimacy of Johnson's policies than did any buildup in the ranks of the doves.

Serious questions over the purposes for which the U.S. was fighting in Vietnam and the ability of U.S. forces to achieve Chapter 4
The Decision to Negotiate, Vietnamize, and Withdraw
We have ruled out attempting to impose a purely military solution on the battlefield. We have also ruled out.. .a one-sided withdrawal from Vietnam... the settlement we seek to negotiate in Paris... [is] very simple: mutual withdrawal of non-South Vietnamese forces from South Vietnam and free choice for the people of South Vietnam.
I believe that the long-term interests of the peace require that we insist on no less, and that the realities of the situation require that we seek no more. 1 Lyndon Johnson's speech of March 1968 set the direction of the U.S. war effort; in May 1969, a few months after becoming President himself, Richard Nixon gave that direction form.
No longer would American men, money, and materiel be sent to Vietnam in an attempt to secure an end to the war forcibly.
The United States would end its involvement in Vietnam, not through victory on the battlefield, but through compromise at the negotiating table. Nixon's decision to negotiate a settlement to the war, however, did not mean that the United States would lay down its arms immediately. Much of the war remained to be fought even as the President addressed the nation on that warm evening in May. But although the There could be no further delay; if Nixon did not end the war, the issue could be taken from his hands. This chapter discusses the extent to which the President was able to sustain domestic legitimacy and political support for his plan to end the war. Nixon's decision to employ a complex strategy of negotiations, Vietnamization and unilateral U.S. troop withdrawals required that he maintain a delicate balance among domestic political pressures. But precisely because of this intricate plan, the President was able to keep the costs of the war within levels that did not animate significant constraining political opposition. Clearly Nixon's steps to end the war were taken within an international context. But that context constrained, only in a general way, the choices available to the President. Domestic political pressures accounted in a very selfconscious way for the timing, sequencing, and character of the way Nixon implemented his strategy. And the following pages demonstrate that, at times, the domestic political pressures were so strong, that the policy choices which resulted from -. esidential efforts to accommodate those requirements significantly deviated from the imperatives of structural-systemic factors which seemed to demand alternative behavior.
In the closing months of his administration, Lyndon Johnson had tried to establish meaningful negotiations with Hanoi.
His lack of success, however, meant that the Nixon administration had to begin the process as if anew.
Nevertheless, the last eight months of the Johnson presidency provide an important departure point for understanding the actions of the Nixon White House, and it is with this period that the present chapter begins. ... the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares its readiness to appoint its representative to contact a United States representative with a view toward arranging, with the American side, the unconditional cessation of United States bombing raids and all other acts of war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam so that talks may start. 3   The North Vietnamese response to Johnson's overture was an agreement to talk about the conditions under which peace 2 Administration doubts were aired in a cable sent to a number of U.S. Ambassadors in the region. Pentagon Papers, Senator Gravel Edition, 4 volumes (Boston: Beacon Press, 1971), IV, pp. 594-6. The text of the cable is contained in Vietnam:
The  bombing would result in an easing of its battlefield pressure on the South. The Communists were not forthcoming, however, and held firm to their position that all bombing be halted and the Saigon regime of Nguyen Van Thieu be replaced before they would respond positively to U.S. initiatives. By July, the U.S. delegation in Paris felt sure that little progress could be expected in Paris so long as the bombing continued.
They urged Johnson to order a complete halt, but for several reasons were unable to persuade the President to do so. 8 In an early effort to move beyond the public declarations which both sides felt necessary, Johnson authorized the U.S. delegation to pursue the possibility of secret talks.
In June 1968 William Sullivan, U.S. Ambassador to Laos, was designated to spearhead the effort, but shortly after his appointment he fell ill, and the secret channel languished. Goodman, The Lost Peace, pp. 67-8. "Vietnam: The Dissidents Walk the Plank," Newsweek,

Richard Nixon, No More Vietnams (New York: Avon, 1985)
One uses memoirs and retrospective accounts, of course, with caution as these works tend to represent events and decisions as more coherent and logically determined than was the actual case. Nevertheless, for the purposes of this dissertation, the memoirs of key figures serve an important, if limited, purpose. It is a central claim of the present work that leaders' susceptibility to domestic political factors strongly influence, in certain cases, the foreign policy choices they make. In the instances cited in this work, the personal memoirs and retrospectives of the central decision-makers relate, often with some emotion, the significance and impact of domestic political pressures on their foreign policy decision-making. This is especially striking since there are clear opportunities and strong incentives to represent one's actions, post hoc, as principally driven by the needs of the international situation and not sullied by political motivations. The fact that this memoir literature recalls in such rich detail, and with vivid emotion, the impact which domestic political factors had on foreign policy decision-making, in spite of the incentives to portray it otherwise, lends a good deal of support to the central argument of this work.
22 During the campaign, Nixon had spoken repeatedly about his commitment to end the war, though he refused to provide the details of his plan. Following the election, during the transition period at his Headquarters in the Hotel Pierre in New York, Nixon emphasized his desires to end the war as soon because of its implications for U.S. international relations around the globe. 23  23 In an interview with journalist Cy Sulzberger some months after taking office, Nixon reiterated his concern regarding the effects that the war was having on the global position of the United States.

Recognizing that Executive hold on Vietnam policy making had become precarious, Nixon knew that the American people were tiring of the war and congressional opposition which mirrored that weariness had already begun to build. This meant that the President had only a limited period of time to achieve any measure of a satisfactory settlement in Vietnam before the political support he needed to do so (particularly in Congress) evaporated completely. Nixon therefore began his evaluation of the situation in Vietnam before he took the oath of office. 24  This preliminary exercise provided the basis for the first major foreign policy review of the new administration.

Committed hawks argued that military victory, in the conventional sense, should be pursued at every and all costs.
They tied this argument to the historical basis of U.S. involvement in Indochina which stemmed from America's apprehension over the spread of Communism. 2 6 Those same hardliners who advocated military escalation, however, demanded that a change in strategy accompany the buildup.
They urged the invasion of North Vietnam, extensive bombing of the complex irrigation dike system and the aggressive mining of Haiphong Harbor in order that the increased numbers of American soldiers that they were recommending be sent to finish the job, might do so in short order.
Several factors militated against renewing the U.S. combat commitment to the war. Johnson's de-escalation announcement of the previous March had all but foreclosed significant expansion of military force on the part of the United States, and domestic polls increasingly registered strong sentiment in favor of a lessened U.S. role in the region. 2 7 Moreover, Nixon was not prepared to authorize an aggressive expansion 26 Republican Senator John Tower of Texas often took a vocal lead in advancing this position.

(February, 1969)
The President's reluctance to widen the war stemmed from the belief that he would not be able to sustain the domestic support necessary to see the war through to successful conclusion. Nixon anticipated that domestic pressure to end U.S. involvement completely, in light of the increased American casualties which would inevitably result from widening the war, would be almost impossible for him to contain long enough for the military to achieve success on 28 There is some evidence to suggest that Nixon had clearly decided against military escalation even before he had taken the oath of office.

Nixon Papers. Hoover Institution Archives. See also RNe Memoirs, see particularly pp. 347-9. By way of conclusion he writes in his memoirs:
"Since I had ruled out a quick military v , the only possible course was to try for a fair negotiated settlement that would preserve the independence of South Vietnam."

the battlefield. And nuclear weapons were not an option which the President would consider. 2 9   The policy choices which emphasized a military solution to the war did not appear to offer the President new ways in which to bring the war to a rapid and successful conclusion.
Defying those who insisted that increased troop levels be accompanied by more aggressive battlefield tactics, the President remained unwilling to widen the war in light of his plans for other aspects of American foreign policy.
Moreover, even if the United States opted to fight more aggressively, few informed observers held little expectation that the South Vietnamese would be able to withstand the pressure from North Vietnam that would surely come once the U.S. had departed. Renewed escalation did not offer a solution to the problem of ending the war as much as it held the potential to complicate the situation hopelessly.
At the opposite end of the policy spectrum lay the choice of complete, unilateral, and immediate withdrawal of all U.S.

For the United States, the greatest threat to a negotiated settlement was the time it would take to accomplish, and a lack of progress in the peace talks would engender an adverse domestic political reaction to the President's policies which In a nationally televised interview on July 27, 1969, Defense Secretary Melvin Laird observed that the President had "made it clear that our objective is the right of selfdetermination for the people of South Vietnam, not a military victory."

Mr. President, will our Vietnam involvement be reduced in your administration to the point where it will command no more public attention than, say, Korea does now? THE PRESIDENT.
Well, that is certainly our goal and I think we are well on the way to achievement of that goal.
We have a plan for the reduction of American forces in Vietnam, for Nixon persisted in the Paris negotiations despite serious misgivings.
In his mind, U.S. participation in the peace talks had less to do with the realities of the conflict with North Vietnam than they did with the realities of domestic conflict within the United States. With the decision against a military solution, negotiations had assumed an important role in U.S. efforts to end the war, serving to convince the American people that their government was expending every effort to pursue a settlement. 39 Progress in the peace talks would allow the U.S. to sustain the necessary military effort that would be required to make those negotiations meaningful.
Since the President was convinced that the North Vietnamese would not negotiate in good faith unless coerced into doing so, the U.S. would have to persist in its combat effort. 39 Nixon recalled in his memoirs: "I was rather less optimistic than Kissinger regarding the prospect of a breakthrough in the...negotiations, but I agreed that at the very least they would provide an indisputable record of our desire for peace and our efforts to achieve it."
Nixon, RN: Memoirs, p. 413. progress real could be continuously applied to North Vietnam.
The two elements were inextricably tied to each other.
Having ruled out exclusive reliance on either military or diplomatic means to resolve the war, the White House placed the burden for settlement on both. Designed with the twofold objective of extricating the United States from the conflict while securing a militarily strong and politically viable South Vietnam capable of its own defense, the administration's strategy depended equally upon negotiations and sustained combat (though at a reduced level for the U.S.) for success. Progress in negotiations---something only guaranteed by sustained combat pressure on North Vietnam--would influence the process of Vietnamization. And the better the prospects for a negotiated settlement, the greater the confidence that South Vietnam would be secure, and the faster the U.S. would be able to withdraw its forces from Indochina.
On the international front, the U.S. would attempt to isolate Hanoi by engaging in direct contact with its guardian allies--the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China.
With nearly all of North Vietnam's war making capability coming from these two Communist giants, many believed that resolution to the conflict required their involvement, or more correctly, their dis-involvement in terminating the war. That pressure would come from both conservatives and liberals who had reason to oppose Nixon's approach to terminating the war. The President had to demonstrate to the hawks that his decision to negotiate rather than fight was a 40 Nixon, No More Vietnams, p. 107. Though a retrospective comment, this observation acknowledges the polit:-cal essence of the President's Vietnam policy-making. Nixon's choices of policy substance, as well as his selection of opportunities to implement those choices, resulted from his evaluation of the domestic political repercussions of the various options he considered. Nixon's plan of negotiations and Vietnamization, by his estimates, was not only substantively sound, but also politically viable; it would lead the United States out of its war in Vietnam, without unnecessarily jeopardizing the President's political future. -As soon as agreement can be reached, all non-South Vietnamese forces would begin withdrawals from South Vietnam -Over a period of 12 months, by agreed-upon stages, the major portions of all U.S., allied, and other non-South Vietnamese forces would be withdrawn. At the end of this 12month period, the remaining U.S., allied, and other non-South Vietnamese forces would move into designated base areas and would not engage in combat operations.
-The remaining U.S. and allied forces would complete their withdrawals as the remaining North Vietnamese forces were withdrawn and returned to North Vietnam.
-An international supervisory body, acceptable to both sides, would be created for the purpose of verifying withdrawals, and for any other purpose agreed upon between the two sides.
-This international body would begin operating in accordance with an agreed timetable and would participate in arranging supervised cease-fires in Vietnam.
-As soon as possible after the international body was functioning, elections would be held under agreed procedures and under the supervision of the international body.
-Arxangements would be made for the release of prisoners of war on both sides at the earliest possible time.
-All parties would agree to observe the Geneva Accords of 1954 regarding South Vietnam and Cambodia, and the Laos Accords of 1962. 43   43 For the complete text of the address see, Public Papers:

Hanoi's rebuff prompted the President to press ahead with a plan that had been brewing in his administration since before the inauguration: the gradual withdrawal of American troops from Vietnam. The announcement that American troops were coming home would mollify domestic critics and give the administration time to pursue the prospects for serious movement on the President's May proposals at the negotiating table in Paris.
On June 8 Nixon met with South Vietnamese President Thieu at Midway Island to discuss the administration's next moves, and at that troubled meeting the American President announced by anti-war activists some months later when the first draft lottery under the new system was held in December 1969. With the effective pool of inductees who would see action in Vietnam restricted to the young men of a single year group whose birth dates were drawn in the first third of the lottery, the President's new system had anti-war leaders concerned: "'people with high priority numbers seem resigned to go in...and people who are free seem self-satisfied. Who's going to be left to criticize the draft?'" See "The Draft-The Luck of The Draw," Time, 
December 12, 1969, p. 26.
With this announcement, the White House began an inexorable and immutable process. American troops were leaving Vietnam, and it was only a matter of time before none would remain.
Nixon was well aware that Thieu strongly opposed the withdrawal of American troops. 4 5 And for his part, Thieu knew 44 Kissinger reports that Midway was chosen to avoid antiwar riots which the President anticipated. White House Years, p. 272.
See also "Confrontation at Midway," Newsweek, June 2, 1969, pp. 42-44. The anti-war movement in the United States had gained considerable momentum following a period of relative quiet during the first months of the Nixon administration. Organizers of a major demonstration against the war had targeted the early months of summer for action, but Nixon's announcement that 25,000 troops would be withdrawn effectively forestalled its execution. Later in the year, on October 15, 1969, the first major anti-war Moratorium was held, and the President tried a similar tactic to diminish the impact of the demonstration with markedly less success. See "The Strike Against the War," and "Four Faces of Protest," in Time, 
October 17, 1969, pp. 17-22.
47 Nixon recalled that troop withdrawals combined with Vietnamization had begun to appeal to him early on as a useful tool for containing domestic criticism:
"Early in the administration we had decided that withdrawing a number of American combat troops from Vietnam would demonstrate to Hanoi that we were serious in seeking a diplomatic settlement; it might also calm domestic public opinion by graphically demonstrating that we were beginning to wind down the war."
Nixon, RN_ Memoirs, p. 392 (emphasis added.) The subsequent announcements of additional unilateral troop withdrawals and the eventual abandonment in May 1971 of the official U.S. demand for mutual withdrawals offers further evidence supporting the central argument, and are examined in detail later in this and in the following chapter.
Nixon's justification in his memoirs that periodic withdrawals would demonstrate to Hanoi the seriousness with which the U.S. viewed finding a settlement is somewhat shallow, as there is little evidence that Hanoi believed involvement in the war remained as they had stood for quite otherwise about the U.S. Such a justification does, however, indicate that the President perceived a need to couch the action in terms relative to the foreign policy task at hand (negotiations) to avoid the accusation that the decision was taken principally for political reasons. Nevertheless, it is clear that in the wake of the revelations of the Cambodian operation and Hanoi's poor response to the President's proposals, domestic criticism pressed more heavily upon the administration than did North Vietnam's opinion of the sincerity of U.S. intentions. The troop withdrawals would clearly do more to alleviate the former than they would ensure the latter. some time. The views of U.S. allies were similarly static and therefore did not generate pressure for the U.S. action.
The decision to begin unilateral troop withdrawals in June 1969 is grounded in the fact that the President felt the need to deliver more than rhetoric to end the war. Troop withdrawals would go a long way toward alleviating domestic political pressures, and Nixon's June meeting with Thieu, coming some months after the South Vietnamese President expressed the belief that 1969 could see the beginning of U.S. departure from his country, provided the perfect occasion to make the first announcement. The declaration that 25,000 American soldiers would be returning home infused the President's May 14 speech with vitality and represented the first tangible manifestation of his promise to end the war.
Though the troop withdrawal announcement had achieved the intended effect on the American domestic front, the static combat situation and diplomatic inactivity in Paris (halted by chief North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho's recall to Hanoi) prompted Nixon to intensify his search for a way to generate progress on a settlement before time and events caused the negotiations to end in failure.
... unless I could build some momentum behind our peace efforts over the next several weeks, they might be doomed to failure by the calendar.
Once the summer was over and Congress and the colleges returned from vacation in September, a massive new antiwar tide would sweep the country during the fall and winter.
Then, with the approaching dry season in Vietnam, there was almost sure to be a renewed Communist offensive during the Tet holiday period in February. By early spring the pressures of the November 1970 elections would make congressional demands for more troop withdrawals impossible to stop and difficult to ignore. 48   On July 16, Nixon used an old personal friend, Jean Sainteny, as an intermediary to carry a personal letter directly to Ho Chi Minh. 4 9  In that letter Over the summer, the administration had been under constant pressure to deliver on its promise to end the war. In an article in Foreign Affairs, former Secretary of Defense Clark Clifford urged the White House to set a deadline for the total withdrawal of U.S. troops from Indochina. 5 1 Though the President waived off the idea as out of touch with the present military situation in Vietnam, he confronted many such suggestions. 52  But with little progress being made in Paris, the White House sought to demonstrate that other 51 Clark Clifford, "A Viet Nam Reappraisal," Forein Affairs 47 (July 1969): 601-22. Clifford's article, and Nixon's reaction to the pressure it generated to increase the number and timing of the troop withdrawals, received some attention in the New York Times. RMN, 1969, pp. 471-2; 476-7; and "Nixon is Accused of Overreacting," New York Times, 
June 22, 1969, p. 3.
In September, the President announced that the troop ceiling in Vietnam would be reduced to 484,000 by 
December 15, 1969.
The central question of this thesis is of course, whether these actions were primarily taken for their ability to bring the war to a conclusion or for their effectiveness in reducing domestic tensions. Because politicians are sensitive to accusations that they make policy decisions for political reasons, public justifications for policy choices 53 Between July 25 and August 3 the President traveled to 9 countries in a spectacular diplomatic effort to publicize the efforts his administration were making toward peace in Vietnam. The President stopped in Guam, Manilla, Indonesia, Bangkok, Saigon, India, Pakistan, Romania, and England. During the trip he turned aside questions regarding further troop withdrawals. For the President's comments on the status of American military forces in Vietnam, see Public Papers: 
RMN, 1969, pp. 550-6;
584-5

RMN, 1969, p. 718.
With the latest public rejection by Hanoi, the tolerance of the American people began to show signs of wear. The administration's troop withdrawal announcements had encouraged the notion in the United States that steady progress was being made to end the war, and Hanoi's intransigience in Paris threatened to put the brakes on that progress. Thus, while the relative quiescence of the battlefield and a re-energized, though veiled, diplomatic channel both served to preserve the balance of positions between the belligerents. Nixon was losing the battle for domestic political support at home. 55 As he later recalled:
55 At this time, of course, the public was not yet aware of the secret negotiating channel that had been set up between Kissinger and Le Duc Tho. And though in the United States the student unrest which characterized the Autumn of 1969 did not exclusively reflect unhappiness with the situation in Vietnam, frustration with the seemingly interminable war did serve to exacerbate tensions. Nixon was ..public support for our war effort was eroding. Our peace initiatives, the start of our withdrawal program, and our conciliatory speeches slowed the erosion, but they also whettted the appetites of the antiwar activists.
As we approached the first anniversary of the bombing halt on November 1, 1969, I knew the time had come for a bold move to mobilize American support for our military efforts... [w]hat we needed most was time... If I was to have enough time for my policies to succeed, my first priority had to be to gather as much political support as possible for the war from the American people. 5 6   Toward that end, the administration began a flurry of activity to reduce the domestic pressure. And with the knowledge that actions to alleviate domestic dissatisfaction would only have temporary effects at best, the White House renewed international diplomatic efforts to generate some movement toward ending the war. On September 18, two days after announcing the second troop withdrawal, the President addressed the General Assembly of the United Nations, and urged the member nations to pressure Hanoi to join the United States in working for peace. 57 The following day, Nixon well aware that presidential decisions regarding the war could go a long way toward reducing those tensions. He later recalled:
"During the first months of my presidency Vietnam was not the primary issue in campus demonstrations largely because Johnson's bombing halt had suspended the most actively controversial aspect of the war, and my announced plans to establish an all-volunteer Army and our reform of the draft, which made it less threateningly disruptive, also helped in this regard."

The early weeks of October were troubled ones for the President. Under fire not only for a lack of progress in the war, Nixon was fielding problems of civil rights, a controversial Supreme Court nominee, and a vitriolic public debate over the welfare system. The net effect was the impression that his administration was losing its grip. During the week of 
October 13, 1969, Newsweek, proclaimed "Mr. Nixon in Trouble,"
I had the public support I needed to continue a policy of waging war in Vietnam and negotiating for peace in Paris until we could bring the war to an honorable and successful conclusion... [a]t the same time I was under no illusions that this wave of Silent Majority support could be maintained for very long. My speech had not proposed any new initiatives; its purpose had been to gain support for the course we were already following.
I knew that under the constant pounding from the media and our critics in Congress, people would soon be demanding that new actions be taken to produce progress and end the war. 64   The White House hoped to sustain the momentum of November with an announcement in December that an additional 50,000 troops would be withdrawn by

We are in a psychological period where the greatest need is confidence...'67 Nixon's decision to withdraw additional troops can only be seen as politically motivated, particularly since the combat and diplomatic situations strongly militated against such a move. The announcement was simply designed to sustain the momentum of domestic support which the President believed he had in the wake of his November 3 address and in view of the dismal state of affairs in Paris and Vietnam.
The early months of 1970 presented few opportunities to announce additional troop withdrawals. Reports from Vietnam indicated that the Communists were planning a massive offensive, and combat on this scale threatened to disrupt the entire process of extricating the U.S. from the war, despite the fact that the President was on record as saying that the 67 Public Papers: RMN, 1969, p. 1027.
Thompson's evaluation of the relative improvement in South Vietnam uses the dismal state of affairs he reports in his book as a baseline referent.

It was vitally important that the President alleviate some of the pressure in order to gain room to maneuver.
On April 20, in a stunning departure from a long-held position that U.S. troop withdrawals would not occur on a fixed time schedule, Nixon announced that 60,000 U.S. troops would be withdrawn by the close of 1970, and that an additional 90,000 troops would depart that country in 1971. 70   70 For the text of the address, see Public Papers: 
RMN, 1970, p. 373-77.
In this April 20 speech, the President stressed that U.S. involvement in Vietnam would end despite the fact that events seemed to demand, at the very least, a continued presence.
The crisis in Cambodia, with its potential to engulf the entire Southeast Asian peninsula in war, and the widespread belief in the White House that only U.S. force had brought Hanoi to the negotiating table in the first place, strongly argued against further withdrawals. Military pressure on Hanoi was particularly important since negotiations in Paris had broken down and the North Vietnamese gave no sign that they had any incentive either to maintain appearances or pursue the substantive purpose of the talks.
an artificial time schedule, the North Vietnamese would have no incentive to negotiate---they could hold out indefinitely knowing that time was their ally. While the American people had tired of the war, the South Vietnamese were still not yet to the point where they could provide for their own security; the American presence was still required until Saigon was battle ready. While a timetable might satisfy some domestic elements, the President and his advisers believed that a majority of the domestic constituency could be satisfied with periodic demonstrations that progress was being made, and the protracted withdrawal schedule would buy the time that the South Vietnamese needed to ready themselves.
Clearly the diplomatic standoff and military crisis militated in favor of maintaining the status quo, but the unrest in the United States exerted pressure on the administration to deliver on its promises and threatened to upset the entire framework for ending the war that the White House had worked so hard to establish. The domestic criticism also shook the foundations of Nixon's political support in Congress during these early months of an election year when many Senators and Representatives strove to demonstrate sensitivity to their constituencies. The administration's desires to show progress in its efforts to end U.S. involvement in the war (particularly since a decision on aid to Cambodia that would mean widening the U.S. military commitment in the region was imminent) accounted in large measure for the timing of the announcement and the size of the troop withdrawal. In his April 20 address, Nixon told the American people that The decision...tonight means that we finally have in sight the just peace we are seeking, We can now say with confidence that pacification is succeeding. We can now say with confidence that the South Vietnamese can develop the capability for their own defense. And we can say with confidence that all American combat forces can and will be withdrawn.71 71 Public Papers:

The White House went to some pain to stress the fact that this latest development in the war was consistent with the administration's overall strategy to end the conflict. On
April 30 the President gave a nationally televised address in which he tied the Cambodian operation to the program of U.S. troop withdrawals.
A majority of the American people.. .are for the withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam. The action I have taken...is indispensable for the continuing success of that withdrawal program.
A majority of the American people want to end this war rather than to have it drag on interminably.
The action I have taken... will serve that purpose.
A majority of the American people want to keep the casualties of our...men...at an absolute minimum.
The action I have taken... is essential if we are to accomplish that goal. We have taken this action not for the purpose of expanding the war into Cambodia but for the purpose of ending the war in Vietnam... we will continue to make every effort to end this war through negotiation at the conference table 
74
Kissinger's recollection of the events surrounding the decision to invade Cambodia offers a particularly interesting discussion of the domestic political considerations which influenced the timing and nature of the key decisions. See White House Years, pp. 483-509. See also, Robert B. Semple, Jr., "'Not An Invasion'," New York Times, May 1, 1970, pp. 1, 2. the operation represented 'a virtual renunciation of the President's promise of disengagement from South East Asia.' 77 Despite the President's contention that the action was 'not an invasion of Cambodia,' the operation presented the appearance of a complete policy reversal and engendered widespread distrust of the administration's claims that the action reflected strategic necessity. 7 8

Nixon signed the final bill repealing the amendment on January 13, 1971.

Rosenbaum, "As Summer Advanced, Amendment Lobby Waned," New York Times, September 2, 1970, p. In Paris, however, the North Vietnamese rejected the President's initiative with characteristic dispatch and scorn. 8 6 The frustrating pattern of diplomatic parry and thrust re-emerged and rendered the President's offer largely meaningless. Soon, calls for the United States to set a deadline for the full and complete withdrawal of its troops 84 A New York Times editorial on October 9, 1970 called the President's plan 'forward looking' and 'flexible,' and placed the burden of settlement on Hanoi. The President did raise suspicions that the timing of his announcement was designed to diminish the impact of the nation-wide moratorium on the war scheduled for October 15, as well as to improve Republicans' chances in the upcoming November elections.

By the end of 1970 we ran the risk that our Vietnam strategy would turn into a debate about the rate of our unilateral withdrawal. Even within the administration there was tremendous weariness. The constant pressures that transformed even the most minor military action into a test of credibility, the endless testimony before Congressional committees, the incessant probing by the media...all tended to work against a coherent strategy. 87   With the Communists content, and apparently able, to wait their opponents out in Paris, the U.S. held little true bargaining strength. Hanoi had few reasons to cooperate toward settlement; discussion of the American proposals would not guarantee that the U.S. would withdraw any more rapidly that it was currently, and negotiation could result in the Communists making some concessions. For the North Vietnamese, intransigence was the best strategy. Antiwar critics in the United States took the lack of progress in Paris as a sign that the U.S. offers were somehow inadequate.
Anxious for the war to end, these critics pressured the White House to increase the numbers of troops withdrawn and decrease the time it would take to accomplish. 87 Kissinger, White House Years, p. 984. Kissinger fully attributes the decision to accelerate the withdrawal schedule that the President announced in April to the administration's response to the domestic pressures. See his discussion on pp. 984-5.
States had reached such an intense level that the President could no longer easily balance negotiations and Vietnamization in his quest for time to secure a satisfactory settlement. Convinced that further announcements of troop withdrawals parcelled out over months, or even weeks, would no longer effectively handle the increasingly strident domestic criticism, the President and his advisers decided to exert maximum military pressure on the North Vietnamese. If the Communists could be substantially weakened through aggressive military maneuvers, greater numbers of U.S. troops could be withdrawn and South Vietnam would have more opportunity to strengthen its defenses. But the White House knew that however ready the South Vietnamese became, by the end of 1971, or 1972 at the latest, American forces would be reduced to a token contingent and the war, for the U.S. at least, would end. 8 8 Thus now even military maneuvers were considered primarily for their impact on the domestic 88 Kissinger argued that the strategy of applying military pressure to North Vietnam would allow the United States to reduce the bulk of its forces and level of commitment during 1971.
If a negotiated settlement were not concluded then, they faced the sure prospect of a Communist Offensive in Spring 1972.
If that were to happen, he wrote, "The outcome of the war would then depend on whether the South Vietnamese, aided only by American air power, would be able to blunt the assault."
The war would end and peace would come, he continued, "...either at the end of 1971 or at the end of 1972---either by negotiation or by a South Vietnamese collapse."

On June 13, 1971, the New York Times began publishing installments of a classified Defense Department study which detailed the factors contributing to the early years of American involvement in Vietnam. Over the summer of 1971, the public took a rare inside look at the decision-making which had embroiled the U.S. in war half a world away. The reports fueled antiwar criticism to even higher levels and fortified objections to further U.S. involvement of any kind in Vietnam, even if it was at declining levels. The President had hoped to prevent the Times from publishing the series, but failed when the Supreme Court ruled for the newspaper. 9 3 The expos6, combined with the court battle to 93 Nixon contends that his decision to prosecute the New YkTimes stemmed from his conviction that the government has responsibility for determining what effect the release of classified documents can have on the country's national security.

Nixon's mind, the entire strategy for terminating the war was working, but the troop withdrawals was the element most responsible for any measure of progress. The President later recalled:
I doubt that we could have continued fighting the war if we had not been gradually withdrawing our troops.
Since 1969, we had been faced with the danger of Congress legislating an end to our involvement. Antiwar senators and congressmen had been introducing resolutions to force us to trade a total withdrawal of our troops for the return of our POWs. By 1972 the Senate was regularly passing these measures, and the votes in the House were getting close.
We were able to prevent the passage of these bills only because our withdrawal announcements provided those whose support for the war was wavering with tangible evidence that our involvement was winding down. 1 02   Yet the war was still far from over. Nixon remained determined that he would not concede to demands that he abruptly order a total U.S. withdrawal until South Vietnam could provide adequately for its own defense. Though disappointed in the lack of progress in Paris, the White House remained convinced that negotiation, rather than decisive military victory, was the only way that that objective might be achieved. But reality painted a gloomy

For states ending their involvement in a limited war, the decision that the war must be deliberately brought to an end, and not left to evolve to its exhausted conclusion, confronts the national leadership as the first step in war termination.
After deciding that the war must end, the next decision is one of how that end will be brought about.

In so doing, the U.S. acknowledged the significance and political strength of the NLF; something which that group had sought, but the Thieu regime, understandably, had vigorously denied. As U.S. military support began to ebb, Thieu's intransigeance on (among other things) negotiating with the NLF, cast him in the role of spoiler and only accelerated and intensified U.S. Congress opposition to further funding for South Vietnam. The irony is complete because the U.S. strongly resisted Hanoi's persistent demand that Thieu be ousted before settlement could be reached. The U.S. opposed this, in part, because many American officials were privately convinced that Thieu represented the only South Vietnamese leader sufficiently strong to maintain political power long Throughout the early months of 1972 North Vietnam remained unresponsive to all efforts to restart the stalled negotiations between Kissinger and Tho.

We have offered a cease-fire, a total withdrawal of all American forces, an exchange of all prisoners of war, internationally supervised free elections with the Communists participating in the elections and in the supervision.    45   Kissinger later observed that it was pure mythology that Nixon "for domestic political reasons" urgently sought to end the war before the election. 4 6 He marshalls the developments in the 1972 campaign and the effects of three years of troop withdrawals, which relieved much of pressure on Nixon to deliver on his promise to end the war, as supporting evidence for his claim. But Nixon began his Presidency intent on finding a resolution to the war within his first four years in office. That desire was fueled, in part, by Nixon's early 45 Indeed, as will be discussed below, the President came to oppose the announcement of a settlement in advance of the election because he feared it would both alienate right-wing supporters and appear as political pandering to the nation's doves on the eve of an election. The President was not unaware of the fact, however, that he did not have unlimited time to play out his expectations regarding an improved settlement with Hanoi. The White House clearly believed that despite the President's re-election, which seemed assured, the new Congress would move swiftly to legislate an end to the war as soon as it reconvened in January 1973. Kissinger later observed:
Going on to total victory seemed more sensible to Thieu and probably no more costly than the compromises now achievable.
Unfortunately, that was not our choice. Even if Hanoi did not suddenly accept our proposals, the new Congress [to seat in January 1973] would force us to settle on worse terms---withdrawal for prisoners---than those we would seek to negotiate.
It was understandable that Thieu would continue to demand victory, which would have required several years of further American as well as South Vietnamese exertion. But we had no margin at home for such a course.
We would be lucky if we could obtain the terms Nixon had put forward on May 8 before the Congress voted us out of the war. 49   Between August and October, several intensive meetings between Kissinger and Le Duc Tho demonstrated to the Americans that the North Vietnamese were genuinely interested in concluding the war. Beginning with the August 1 session, Le Duc Tho presented a set of proposals which appeared to represent a significant North Vietnamese step toward

Having long been certain of re-election, Nixon considered the breakthrough of October 8, combined with the urgency with which Hanoi appeared to desire a settlement, to be North Vietnam's realization, at long last, of the improbability of their position. Thus the President expected that perhaps even better terms could be achieved if the United States played the next phase shrewdly. There simply was no need to rush an agreement as long as the domestic pressures for a settlement were not expected to again become significant until after the President's second Inaugural.  71 See the discussion in Kissinger, White House Years, pp. 1446-9. Interestingly, Kissinger observes that in ordering bombing raids to force a conclusion to the war, Nixon had "reasoned, correctly, that he would pay a serious domestic price for lifting the self-imposed bombing restrictions; but it would become unmanageable only if he failed." 72 The fact that this operation came to be known as the "Christmas Bombing," obscures the small fact that no bombs were dropped on Christmas day. This fleeting pause, however, was but a brief respite for the North Vietnamese who were pounded by B-52 raids until December 30. But despite the immense amount of ordnance dropped on North Vietnam, by their own reports, civilian casualties were relatively small, ranging from 1300 to 1600 fatalities. See the account in Guenther Lewy, America in Vietnam (New York: Oxford University Press, 1978), pp. 413-4. was enormously negative. 7 3 As the bombing continued, the U.S. maintained contact with the North Vietnamese delegation in Paris, though the latter terminated talks on the technical modalities of implementing any agreement for three days on December 20 in protest over the bombing raids. On December 30, the U.S. announced that Hanoi had accepted a U.S.
proposal to resume substantive talks on the major issues and that the bombing had ceased.
In one respect, the 'Christmas' bombing of 1972 reflected the war in microcosm: serious domestic opposition to the President's policies could be contained as long as those policies yielded rapid results. But this episode differs from the wider war in another important way. While neither a sense of the kind of results nor a time frame wiLhin which 73 The New York Times editorialized: "...civilized man will be horrified at the renewed spectacle of the world's mightiest air force mercilessly pounding a small Asian nation in an abuse of national power and disregard of humanitarian principles."

Two questions persist regarding the events of the closing months of the war: Why did Nixon order the bombing? and Did the bombing 'force' North Vietnam's return to the negotiating table? Definitive answers might never be know, but nevertheless, it seems certain that domestic political factors strongly influenced both Nixon's decision to bomb and North Vietnam's decision to return to Paris.
The White House had primed the American audience for nearly two months with reports that peace was tantalizingly close.
But settlement proved elusive. Thieu's stubborn refusal to accept the terms of the agreement as it stood and Nixon's notion that he had until his second Inaugural to secure a settlement (on perhaps better terms) caused North Vietnam to retrench. By December, the White House faced the prospects of no settlement and a hostile Congress ready to reconvene and take the issue from Nixon's hands. The democratically controlled legislature would enact an end to the war, and Thus, while it seems certain that North Vietnam's military capability was significantly impaired as a result of the sustained bombing, a more likely explanation for their return to the negotiating table lies in the fact that they too, perceived that the opportunity to have the U.S. withdraw from the conflict had indeed arrived. One assessment of these events made after the Peace Accords were signed observed: For all of Hanoi's.. .troubles, it was hard for those who have watched the North Vietnamese fight doggedly against one foreign power after another for nearly three decades to imaging that the Communists were now about to give up the battle.
Instead it seemed likely that Hanoi had made a very calculated decision to shift tactics, not goals--and that, after an interval to get the U.S. off the scene, the war would go on. 7 7   Clearly the American leadership had reached the point where settlement had become the overriding motivation behind its actions. Earlier in the month, Nixon had corresponded secretly with Thieu and explicitly threatened the South Vietnamese President to cooperate in U.S. efforts to conclude the war or else face the prospect that the U.S. would act on its own to end its involvement in the war. On one of the letters in his own hand at the bottom of the prepared text, Nixon wrote:
I have asked General Haig to obtain your answer to this absolutely final offer on my part for us to work together in seeking a settlement along the lines I have approved or to go our separate ways.
Let me emphasize ... that General Haig is not coming to Saigon for the purpose of negotiating with you... [ylou must decide now whether you desire to continue our alliance or whether you want me to seek a settlement with the enemy which serves U.S. interests alone. 78   Thieu understood this to mean that since Washington was not interested in any sort of discussion with him on the acceptability of the terms of settlement as they currently stood, his cooperation at this point was simply to insure 77 "How Solid a Peace?" N, January 29, 1973, p. 20.
78 Kissinger, White House Years, pp. 1459-60, emphasis added. This December 17 letter from Nixon to Thieu appears to be the only one missing from the otherwise comprehensive collection presented in the Hung and Schecter volume. 80 The President, as well as a number of other informed observers fully expected Congressional action to end the war upon its reconvening in January. See, for example, "As the Air War Hit a Peak," U.S. News and World Report, January 8, 1973, pp. 17; "Chances for Peace-Problems Nixon Faces,"
News and World Report, 
January 15, 1973, pp. 11-12;
and "At War Over the War," Newsweek, January 15, 1973, pp. 13-15.
In the brief announcement, Nixon told the American people that the goals which he had considered "essential for peace with honor" had been been met:
In the settlement that has now been agreed to, all the conditions that I laid down [on January 25, and May 8, 1972] have been met:
A cease-fire, internationally supervised, will begin at 7 P.M., this Saturday, January 27, Washington time.
Within 60 days from this Sunday, all Americans held prisoners of war throughout Indochina will be released.
There will be the fullest possible accounting for all of those who are missing in action.
During the same 60-day period, all American forces will be withdrawn from South Vietnam.
83 On January 2 the House Democratic Caucus voted 154-75 to approve a resolution cutting off funds for the war conditional only on the release of American POWs.
In the Senate, the Foreign Relations Committee reached a consensus that if a peace agreement "did not materialize by Inauguration Day, Congress should indeed use its powers to end the war itself."
And in a lukewarm vote of confidence for the President, members of the Republican Senate Caucus voted 16-10 endorsing Nixon's effort to "end the tragic conflict in Indochina now through a negotiated settlement." "At War Over the War," Nwse, 
January 15, 1973, pp. 13-15.
In the course of trying to end the war in Vietnam, the Nixon administration recast and devalued the objectives of the war to a level that could be sustained by the conditions prevailing on the battlefield in Vietnam and at the negotiating table in Paris. Was this devaluation done consciously? Kissinger writes:
In the process of meeting the demands of our insatiable opponents in the media and the Congress, we had already reduced our terms to a level far below that which had been thought necessary to maintain the security of South Korea under much more favorable circumstances and over twenty years after the end of the Korean War.
Whereas 50,000 American combat troops were still stationed in Korea, we proposed to withdraw all our troops from Vietnam, which had much longer and much less easily defended frontiers and an even more implacable enemy.
All Thieu would get.. .was a cease-fire with an enemy who had observed no agreement since 1954.
In exchange the United States would totally withdraw, not likely to return. 85   Clearly, what the U.S. was willing to settle for was markedly In the last desperate hours before the collapse of Saigon--and in blatant violation of U.S. law---thousands of Vietnamese were evacuated to the Philippines, Guam, Taiwan and the United States; many more, however, were left behind to an uncertain fate.

But though America suffered its final indignity in Vietnam as its citizens scrambled to safety via frenzied rooftop evacuations, this was not the end of a war; it was, perhaps more significantly, the end of an era.
Despite the arguments which support April 30, 1975 as the point at which the war ended, compelling arguments remain in favor of January 1973. Principal among them is the fact that, when the United States concluded the Paris Peace Accords, the cease-fire was viewed, at the time, as the end of the war for the Americans. Newsweek magazine proclaimed "Peace," and began it's lead article with the words "and so it was over..." Time magazine called it "A Moment of Subdued Thanksgiving," and talked about a 'postwar U.S." 3 Secondly, the cease-fire of 1973 certainly put the war on a new footing. Without U.S. combat support, the South Vietnamese military shouldered the entire combat burden.

Chapter 6
Assessing the Role of Domestic Politics in War Termination
The preceding examination of America's effort to end its involvement in the Vietnam war suggests provisional answers to the questions which set this study in motion: Why do large, powerful nations sometimes lose small, limited wars?
and Why does it often take so long for great states to end such wars?
This work has argued that the major policy choices of a great state's leadership in the closing stages of an asymmetrical limited war---a war categorized by a marked power imbalance between the principal belligerents where the more powerful nation seeks only limited objectives---are best understood by looking at their domestic sources. There are many circumstances in internatio.3l relations in which the external stimulus of foreign policy accounts for only a part---and in many cases only a small part---of the substance of that policy; domestic political considerations account for the rest. The timing, character, and potency of foreign policy is often less a response to external motivations than to domestic imperatives.
To support these claims, this study undertook two analytic tasks: the first was to elaborate an instit cional conception of hcw domestic politics influences policy making in asymmetrical limited war termination. The second was to defend a domestic politics approach against the challenge of structural realism.
Structural realism assumes that the motivation behind a state's behavior in its international dealings is tightly linked to the state's structural interests. These interests include such things as the acquisition of power, maintenance of security, and a concern for reputation. The findings of this study suggest, however, that this linkage between a state's international behavior and its structural interests might not always be so tight. Contrary to the expectations of structural realism, big nations don't always win their small wars. Moreover, a clearly superior power disengaging from an undesirable war by means of a long, protracted withdrawal offers further evidence that some basis other than structural interests can motivate state behavior.
This paper has attempted to demonstrate that structural realism is hard pressed to account for the termination of asymmetrical limited wars. For powerful nations in such a war, the major decisions involved in war termination appear to be heavily influenced by domestic political imperatives.
And these imperatives can induce behavior dramatically different from that expected from an analysis of the state's structural interests. This is not to say, however, that there is no role for structural factors in asymmetrical war termination. If these factors do not form the critical basis from which asymmetrical war termination decisions are made, it appears they at least offer the opportunity for the war to end---that is, while systemic factors may not 'compel' a nation's leadership to end its war, neither do they prevent it from ending. When no structural impediments to war termination exist, the international system is permissive. Such When a party to a limited war realizes that continued fighting and additional sacrifices will bring it no closer to its objectives, or when it realizes that its objective can be achieved only by expending unacceptably large resources, or when a belligerent anticipates that the battlefield situation will turn markedly unfavorable, it will be motivated to seek an alternative way out of the conflict, through negotiations, In contrast, political will is a difficult, if not impossible phenomenon to measure with any degree of exactness or reliability. Its role in war, however, is undeniable.
Political will can be thought of as a nation's willingness to bear costs in pursuit of the objectives of a conflict.
Hence, political will reflects the value placed on achieving those objectives---i.e. the level of costs and deemed acceptable to incur on behalf of those objectives.
Understanding the role of political will in war enables us to understand better the relationship between a nation's power and the war outcome, and suggests the reason that large nations sometimes do lose small wars.
The value which a polity associates with war objectives calibrates the application of that nation's power capabilities in the war. For a society pursuing limited political objectives, the use of the nation's military to achieve those objectives is politically constrained. Indeed, over the course of the war, that polity's valuation of war oLjectives can chang , with a corresponding influence on the resources committed to the conflict, particularly as costs Conventional notions of military victory in war imply that if an opponent's military capability to wage war has been virtually destroyed, any desire on its part to continue the fight does not matter, because the means to that end no longer exist. But if we think of political will as th, willingness to bear costs in pursuit of specified war objectives, then, depending on the objectives---particularly if they are limited---that willingness may be effectively bounded. Thus, if a nation is no longer willing to bear the costs associated with continued struggle, then the power of that nation to wage war, no matter how great, becomes totally irrelevant. This relationship between will and capability offers an explanation for why large powerful nations lose wars to smaller and less powerful adversaries.
For the United States, the Vietnam War was a limited war; As the reality of stalemate began to sink into the minds of increasing numbers of those advising President Johnson at this time, the sentiment developed that the war could not be won at a price the American people were willing to pay. As more time passed, passionate criticism of the President's policies claimed that thewar was not worth winning at the price it would take to win. But for North Vietnam who perceived itself to be involved in a total war, the war objectives established a much higher cost threshold, extending, at the limit, to the whole of that nation's objective power capability. This considerable tolerance for costs associated with pursuing vital objectives dwarfed that of its opponent, despite the fact that that opponent's objective power capability (by nearly every measure) was far greater.
In asymmetrical conflicts, the political objectives of a For the United States---indeed for all belligerents---costs mounted as various strategies were tried and ultimately failed to guarantee the stability of the Thieu government.
For nations at war then, the higher the political will, the greater the costs that can, and will, be borne. Conversely, the higher the costs of the war, the greater the need for strong political will to continue to absorb those costs. In leading a nation involved in a limited war, national decision-makers must control the costs of the conflict, so as not to exceed the tolerance of the political will.
Simultaneously, they must take steps to bolster the political will to ensure that the costs being incurred or anticipated, will be supported.
This relationship between political purpose, means, and will in armed conflict offers a basis from which to consider the role of domestic politics in the termination of limited wars. As noted, if a war is fought for limited objectives, a cost threshold exists (though perhaps not easily definable at the outset), above which the will to continue absorbing costs associated with pursuing the objectives of the war precipitously declines, triggering serious efforts from within the nation to end the war. Therefore, a protracted, limited war represents a significant instance in which domestic politics heavily influences the foreign policy decision-making of the national leadership. As the costs of the war mount, domestic political groups have ever stronger incentives for attempting to influence the decision-making process, and with the extended duration of the war itself, these same groups have an opportunity to make those preferences significant to the leadership.
To understand the role of domestic politics in tne termination of an asymmetrical limited war, three focal points, or critical decisions, were used in the study to frame the analysis: a) the point at which the lea ers of the larger nation consciously decide to end the war, as opposed to continue the fighting; b) the way in which they chose to end it, and; c) their recognition that the war had indeed ended. These theoretical points translated into specific questions: When did the American leadership determine that it had to initiate efforts to negotiate an end to the war rather than let the fighting on the battlefield determine its

Insofar as the second objective is concerned, he wrote that the North "...can and will hold out at least so long as a prospect of winning the 'war of attrition' in the South exists."

7 3 In a less publicized response to Trinh's statement, perhaps to test the extent of Hanoi's sincerity, LBJ reinstituted a bombing prohibition within five nautical miles of Hanoi and Haiphong. Further, in his State of the Union Message to Congress, the President relaxed U.S. expectations for negotiations, calling for 'serious' negotiations instead of 'productive talks' as he had in San Antonio. But in that same speech, perhaps to placate Senate hawks who feared that the President was going 'soft', Johnson also cautioned North Vietnam '... not to take advantage of our restraint as they [had] in the past.'

On February 12 the President met with several key advisers to discuss the situation in Vietnam and evaluate General
Westmoreland's requirements. 1 03 Addressing MACV's need for reinforcements to handle the situation at Khe Sanh, the President ordered the immediate deployment of approximately 10,000 troops. But this was merely a stopgap measure.
Johnson knew that the time had come for a major decision, and his options appeared to be three: continue the administration's current policies in Vietnam and hope that the timing and sequencing of bombs, troops and talks would this time prove fruitful; significantly widen the war by gearing up the economy to support a war effort and ordering a general mobilization; or, as increasing numbers urged, halt the bombing, limit the troops deployments and seek a resolution to the conflict at the negotiating table.
The President was loathed to choose. He preferred to keep his options open, as the policies he had been following in Vietnam illustrated. reputation as a hawk who largely supported the President's Vietnam policies. 1 2 3 The very qualities which made him the confidant of Presidents, however, would not allow him to deny that the policies in Vietnam were failing, and his friendship for Johnson would not permit him to tell the President otherwise. Johnson did not suffer Clifford's change of heart well. He had expected his friend, particularly in the wake of McNamara's disaffection with the President's war policies, to be a steadfast supporter and Clifford's apparent defection exercised Johnson's ire. Their long standing friendship began to disintegrate.
Clifford's change of heart was only the most recent and visible sign of growing opposition within the administration, but Johnson reacted with the determination to carry on with his policies. He remained convinced that the "war was going better than most people realized." 1 2 4 Massive aerial firepower was authorized to break the siege of Khe Sanh; 13,500 troops were approved for deployment to Vietnam, in addition to the more than ten thousand just recently sent; and several unpublicized peace initiatives through Swedish, Romanian, Italian and Norwegian intermediaries were 123 Clifford later recalled:
"I supported President Johnson on Vietnam. I believed in our policy. I accepted the original domino theory...and felt we had to oppose it...Our policy seemed to be bringing us out where we wanted to come out."

Reacting to a memo from Arthur Goldberg, in which the U.N. Ambassador urged the President to halt the bombing and to vigorously pursue diplomatic means to end the war, the President exploded: "Let's get one thing clear. I am not going to stop the bombing... I have heard every argument on the subject, and I am not interested in further discussion. I have made up my mind. I'm not going to stop it."

November. 1 5 0 The juxtaposition of Johnson's move to deescalate the war and his decision to forego the race was deliberate.
By this point in the war, Johnson was genuinely ". ..ready to take the first step to de-escalate the war" and begin the process of healing his divided nation. He was, no doubt, sincere in his commitment to these goals, but his decisions also reflected the cumulation of failed efforts to accommodate the domestic political realities he confronted, and the realization that, as a result, his policies in Vietnam had lost their legitimacy.
Lyndon Johnson's decision to abandon the pursuit of a military solution to the problem of Vietnam resulted from a complex web of politics, influence and power, and of the intimate connection between the costs a society must bear in war and the willingness of that society to bear them. The decision to de-escalate clearly illustrates the strength of domestic political factors in foreign policy decision-making.
In analytic terms, Johnson's decision to de-escalate the war clearly rejected the structural incentives and advantages 150 Johnson maintains that he had been contemplating this decision for some time. See his account in The Vantage Point, pp. 425-37. See also the article by Harry Middleton, "Speech that Halted a Great Society," in the Los Angeles Times,

Over the next seven months no major troop deployments were authorized, bombing limitations remained fixed (on November 1, he ordered a complete and total halt to the aerial campaign), and formal peace talks between the U.S. and Hanoi began in Paris. But the war did not end during these remaining days of Johnson's presidency---indeed it would not end in his lifetime. came at a private negotiating session in mid-October when the North Vietnamese tacitly accepted a U.S. proposal that the bombing be halted in exchange for North Vietnam's agreement to cease its infiltration and rocket attacks across the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).14
The U.S. was encouraged, and quickly moved to press this hint of progress to advantage. Their hope that productive talks would quickly ensue vanished, however, when South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu refused to cooperate.
Suspecting that the United States was about to take steps which would seriously jeopardize his nation, Thieu informed American Ambassador Ellsworth Bunker that he had three conditions of his own which had to be met before he would agree to a bombing halt: North Vietnam must commit to deescalating the war; Hanoi must agree to negotiate directly with Saigon; and the Communists must guarantee that the NLF would not participate in the talks as a separate delegation. 1 5   had been excluded from the substantive discussions. They participated only as non-participatory observers. The Vantage Point, pp. 513-5.

We are not attriting his forces faster than he can recruit or infiltrate. The President stated that time and events had made it clear that a military settlement to the war was no longer possible and that the United States would seek a negotiated settlement with Hanoi.
Nixon then outlined the terms of agreement which he considered reasonable but generous: mutual withdrawal of American and North Vietnamese troops from South Vietnam; and internationally supervised, free, elections for the South.
The President's formula for peace consisted of the following eight points: By Nixon's own account: "My administration was only two months old, and I wanted to provoke as little public outcry as possible at the outset."

Opening with a sweeping retrospective of U.S. involvement in Indochina, Nixon acknowledged that the reasons the U.S. had originally become involved in Vietnam had changed over the course of the past fifteen years. However, there remained, he argued, compelling reasons why the U.S. should persist in its efforts to aid South Vietnam. Principal among them were the fact that a bloodbath would ensue in South Vietnam the moment the U.S. left and the fact that all Communist nations would take the U.S. action as license to expand at will. 6 0 Nixon outlined his plan to end the war and 59 See

To legitimate the objectives which the administration still believed worthwhile, the President marshalled the symbolic importance of the U.S. continuing to support the South Vietnamese. The U.S. had to remain steadfast in Vietnam, Nixon and his top advisers argued; acquiescence would signal unreliability to our friends and weakness to our adversaries.
Additionally, since the fighting began some thirty thousand Americans had lost their lives in combat and to abandon our goals at this stage would completely erase that sacrifice, as well as forfeit the lives of hundreds of American POWs.
To convince the American public that the plan to achieve these objectives would work, the administration relied on manipulating the complex relationship between negotiations, Vietnamization and troop withdrawals. The process by which the U.S. would hand over combat responsibility to the South Vietnamese conveyed cognitive legitimacy to the President's plan in very subtle and implicit ways---neither the President nor his advisers believed that they could hold the country Chapter 5

troop withdrawal was reduced from seven to six months. 9   Nixon's speech, combined with Kissinger's news conference the following day, attempted to make plain the fact that an agreement leading to the end of United States involvement was clearly within reach but for Hanoi's insistence that the political future of South Vietnam be settled first. 1 0 Aside from rejecting the U.S. offer to settle the military aspects of the conflict separately from the political issues, North Vietnam demanded that the United States completely withdraw its support for the Saigon government. The White House interpreted this as a demand that the United States "overthrow the Government of South Vietnam" and "join our enemy to overthrow our ally." 11  But even as the administration refused complicity in the overthrow of Thieu, Though the President's speech went far toward allaying domestic grumblings (coming as it did on the heels of yet another troop withdrawal announcement), it failed to motivate the North Vietnamese to resume serious negotiations. In February, with the talks still at an impasse, Nixon undertook a spectacular trip to the People's Republic of China. 1 7   In discussions with Chinese leaders, the White House hoped We have brought over half a million men home and more will be coming home. We have ended America's ground combat role. No draftees are being sent to Vietnam.
We have reduced our casualties by 98 36 Continuing through the summer, the bombardment appeared to many a gross misapplication of U.S. military superiority. The inadvertent destruction of the French diplomatic mission in Hanoi in mid-October, killing the French Delegate-General Pierre Suisini, brought the outrage to a full boil. By this time, however, the rapidly approaching Presidential election and the pre-occupation of members of Congress with their own political fortunes had diverted much of the national attention away from the details of the war.  The Congress hereby urges and requests the President to implement the above expressed policy by initiating immediately the following action:
(1) Negotiate with the Government of North Vietnam for an immediate cease-fire by all parties to the hostilities in Indochina.
(2) Negotiate with the Government of North Vietnam for the establishing of a final date for the withdrawal from Indochina of all military forces of the United States contingent upon the release at a date certain of all American prisoners of war held by the Government of North Vietnam and forces allied with such Government.
(3) Negotiate with the Government of North Vietnam for an agreement which would provide for a series of phased and rapid withdrawals of United States military forces from Indochina subject to a corresponding series of phased releases of American prisoners of war concurrently with the withdrawal of all remaining military forces of the United States by not later than the date established pursuant to paragraph (2) hereof.  with the Vietnam War, but the President's progress in ending U.S. involvement did.
Knowing that the vast majority of American people were more concerned with bringing the war to an end than they were with salvaging any vestige of the original war aims, the White House nevertheless refused to order a sudden and total withdrawal of the remaining forces. A number of explanations account for the administration's rejection of this option.  Vietnam would not permanently resolve the political differences between the two states, and violence would surely erupt again. To Thieu's mind, the only logical move at this point was to press for the total military defeat of North Vietnam. 4 8 Thieu's negative reaction to Haig's presentation revealed fundamental differences between the allies not only regarding the stakes in the war but also regarding the constraints under which each fought.
For the Vietnamese, the war was total. The political aims of the conflict had made it so. The objectives of the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong demanded the overthrow of the governmental forms existing in South Vietnam. There was no room for compromise;
Hanoi's victory required Saigon's defeat, and Saigon's survival demanded that the Communist regime in Hanoi be destroyed. For all of the Vietnamese parties, the stakes could go no higher, and thus the only constraint on the war effort that made sense to them was the material capacity of each belligerent to wage war.
For the United States, however, the war was not total.

You should try to improve it to take account of Saigon's conditions as much as possible. But most important we must recognize the fundamental reality that we have no choice but to reach agreement along the lines of the October 8 principles .... You should inform the Saigon representatives [in Paris] that all military and economic aid will be cut off by the Congress if an agreement is not reached. 6 9   68 The fact that Nixon kept these promises secret speaks volumes for the pressure the President felt to end the war. Over the course of these final years of U.S. combat involvement, Nixon sent over two dozen such secret communications to South Vietnamese President Thieu to reassure him that the United States was committed to the defense of its ally. In the letters of the weeks immediately preceding the signing of the peace treaty, Nixon explicitly and repeatedly assured Thieu that the United States would "...respond with full force should the settlement be violated by North Vietnam."
(Secret Letter from Richard Nixon to Nguyen Van Thieu dated January 5, 1973. Contained in Hung and Schecter, The Palace File, p. 392.) Nixon could not risk public knowledge of these secret promises because it would raise prospects of additional costs and U.S. reinvolvement, leading Americans to be convinced that, rather than ending U.S. involvement, the President was promising to extend it, if only in a different form.

Interestingly, Nixon penned the following postscript to this letter: "Dr. Kissinger, General Haig and I have discussed this proposal at great length. I am personally convinced it is the best we will be able to get and that it meets my asole condition that the GVN [Government of (South) Vietnam] must survive as a free country."
Emphasis original. In another letter dated November 14, 1972, Nixon wrote Thieu:
"You have my absolute assurance that if Hanoi fails to abide by the terms of this agreement it is my intention to take swift and severe retaliatory action." (The Palace File, pp. 385-8.)
Again on January 5, 1973, Nixon assured Thieu of his pledge to "[continue] assistance in the post settlement period," and he reaffirmed that the United States would "respond with full force should the settlement be violated by North Vietnam."
(The Palace File, p. 392.) And as late as January 17, 1973, Nixon pledged that the United States would 'react vigorously' to violations of the agreement (TePlc File, pp.393-395.) Nixon's reluctance to specify the nature and extent of any military response which the United States might take in the face of North Vietnamese violations of the peace agreement reveals his recognition of his very limited ability to deliver on specific promises given the overwhelming American desire to be out of Vietnam for good. But on that January evening in 1973, the President's voice did not waver and his message was clear: the war, for the United States, was over.

Gradual  But by the end of 1972, it was clear that public tolerance for the war had reached its limits. Congress threatened to wrest control over events in Vietnam from the President's hands. For U.S. decision-makers there seemed little recourse but to accept the terms of settlement that fell short of what they had pursued.
Why do domestic political considerations assume such importance in foreign policy decision-making? A provisional answer is that, in certain situations, domestic politics requires that decision-makers secure policy legitimacy for their chosen courses of action. Policy legitimacy results when the majority of a nation's polity believe that certain foreign policy objectives are desirable, and that the particular policy course chosen to achieve those objectives will work.
The public is inclined to accept a President's policies as legitimate both because the President formulates and phrases policy choices consistent with values that Americans accept, and because they tacitly acknowledge his special knowledge and expertise in national level decision-making, particularly in the area of foreign policy. The 'rally effect' and the 'honeymoon' period suggest that legitimacy for a Presidential policy is established relatively easily at the outset of an important focal issue, such as U.S. involvement in Vietnam, Congress with its power of the purse, or the Departments of State and Defense with their ability to impede the implementation of policy via bureaucratic foot-dragging) join the opposition, the President will not be compelled to change his policies.
The notion that the President need only avoid the formation of empowered opposition in order to sustain policy legitimacy while terminating a limited war represents a departure from conventional wisdom which holds that President's must actively work to sustain positive support for his policies.
To be sure, an effective support network goes a long way toward preventing effective opposition from building. But maintaining active support, especially for an increasingly costly and unpromising foreign policy is exceedingly difficult, certainly more dificult that preventing effective opposition to that policy.
Aside from attempting to construct a supporting coalition, how does the President prevent empowered opposition to a particular policy from forming? By controlling costs. Nixon attempted just this when he took office in 1969. His strategy to end the war in such a way that the United States could salvage some of its objectives fundamentally rest on controlling the costs of the war---particularly the human costs---during the time it would take to reach a negotiated settlement. The President adopted a three-pronged approach: reduce the level of fighting involving U.S. forces through Vietnamization and gradual troop withdrawals; contain domestic criticism and bolster American's political will to accept the fighting that did go on by demonstrating serious efforts to negotiate toward settlement and steady progress in The President's decision to de-escalate the conflict did not result from successive military defeats on the battlefield; the U.S. suffered no such defeats. Nor did it result from the realization that the costs in terms of men and materiel were inordinately high; fiscal expenditures on the war averaged out to around 2% of the GNP over the course of the war (reaching a high of 3.2% in 1969), and U.S. troop strength at its height in Vietnam hardly exceeded one quarter of one percent of the total U.S. population. The means to wage war were available; the material capacity to absorb more costs existed---the will to bear those costs, however, did not. Johnson was forced to redirect his policies because the consensus that had built in opposition to his approach to the war had reached a critical, and politically fatal, point. Thus, domestic politics do matter in war termination decision-making and they appear to do so for several reasons: 1) the value of a nation's objectives in a limited war importantly directs the amount of resources that nation is willing to devote to their achievement; 2) the relative values assigned to the human and material resources needed for war are determined within a polity, and consequently the amount of resources allocated to a limited war is often more nation's leadership to pln the termination process.
Because a nation's leaders have decided that a war must end they no not necessarily want it to end abruptly by pulling up stakes and departing. An action of this type could give rise to serious questions in the minds of friend and foe alike regarding the departing nation's worthiness as an ally. A hasty and ill-conceived departure might undermine whatever reputation for steadfastness a nation might have, sending the wrong signal to its adversaries. Thus a 'decent interval' becomes desirable in itself to avoid irreparable damage to one's international reputation. There may also be compelling domestic reasons for a leadership to prolong the termination process. The desire to salvage some of the war aims in order to justify sunk costs, the desire to avoid being seen as having 'lost' the war, and the need to sustain sufficient legitimacy for a particular policy in order to accomplish other important foreign and domestic policy objectives are examples of strong domestic incentives to prolong the termination process.
And finally, the United States' asymmetrical limited war in Vietnam belongs to a class of wars characterized by three things: first, the principal belligerents are dramatically mis-matched in power capabilities; large nations are fighting small ones. Secondly, the war for the more powerful state is limited, while the conflict for the weaker state is total giving the smaller state a motivational advantage. And finally, in wars of this type, the more powerful nation
