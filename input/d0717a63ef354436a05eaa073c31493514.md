Central Asia and Eastern Europe share a history replete with former Soviet Union influence.
United States' attention to Russia in the execution of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT) suggests that any actions by the United States in the former Soviet sphere of influence will face a number of daunting policy issues.
Issues such as authoritarian regimes, deep-seated corruption, ethnic fragmentation, human right violations, underdeveloped economies, as well as a host of other issues need to be considered when assessing the implications of American basing.
While some would argue that United States basing can have positive implications for such ills that plague Central Asia, others would argue that United States basing can contribute to these problems.
A major objective of this thesis is to address the positive as well as negative repercussions of United States basing on both the Central Asian domestic situations as well as United States foreign policy concerns.
