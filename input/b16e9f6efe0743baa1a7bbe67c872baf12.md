While we see continuity as most likely, we recognize that change is possible.
Energy prices could increase or decrease, which could, in turn, affect growth in the economy and Russia's defense budget and military capabilities.
Another possibility is that changes in Russia's economic growth and security strategy could occur because of shifts in relations with the West or China.
Such changes could give Russia incentives to shift priorities within its strategy for the armed forces and pursue different ground capabilities, but in general we continue to expect a prioritization of capabilities associated with strategic deterrence, regional dominance, and internal security.
