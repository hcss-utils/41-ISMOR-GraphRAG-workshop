French philosohes Pierre Bourcet and Comte de Guibert envisioned in the 1770's and 80's, a new organizational structure for the French Army and a concept of campaign that would fundamentally change the conduct of war.
Both Bourcet and Guibert saw semi-independent operational units formed from the newly created division, moving on separate axis against the enemy but remained in mutual supporting difference from each other. (
Robert M. Epstein, Napoleon's Last Victory: 1809 And The Emergence Of  Modern War, 7.)
The French Revolution provided the social and political change in the environment for the fruition of these "operational concepts" developed by Bourcet and Guibert.
Often beyond the edge of chaos and in turbulence during the Rein of Terror, the French Army by 1805 was able to establish a balance point in chaos and produced a national army organized in combined arms corps that significantly changed the conduct of war.
The organizational, command and control, and logistical changes in the French Army are examples of a complex system learning, growing, and adapting to the changing environment at the edge of chaos.
The armies of Austria, Prussia, and Russia, remaining stable in their organization and tactics were overcome by change and soundly defeated by Napoleon at Ulm and Austerlizt between October and November of 1805. (
