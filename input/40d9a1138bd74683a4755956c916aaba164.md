The case studies within this monograph demonstrate that Russian and Chinese nonlinear warfare is persistent.
Both states exploit evolving technological advances within the cyber and information domains to their advantage.
Conducting cyber and information operations against the West allows both Russia and China to distort the space between war and peace, which generates many dilemmas for military planners.
Countering Russian and Chinese nonlinear warfare is a vast challenge for the United States, which requires a concerted effort among the national security establishment to counter.
A recent publication from the US Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) finds that China and Russia "have blurred the distinctions between actions "below armed conflict" and "conflict," enabling the achievement of strategic objectives short of what the US traditionally considers war."
