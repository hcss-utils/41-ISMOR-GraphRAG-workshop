Following the Second World War, two major influences resulted in a dramatic reshaping of the international order that affected governments on every continent: the struggle between communism and democracy and the dismantling of the pre-war colonial world. Frequently, these two phenomena occurred simultaneously. Colonialism tended to reinforce or create internal elitism resulting in a disenfranchised population that was more sympathetic to communism and its idealistic promise of equality. The global upheaval of
The Second World War weakened the colonial powers' grip on their subjects, resulting in a dramatic shift in the world order that also saw the United States replace Britain as the world's police.
In addition to this new role, the United States faced myriad international crises that conflicted with domestic pressure to reduce defense spending. President Franklin D.
Roosevelt's death left a U.S. foreign policy vacuum that President Harry Truman struggled to fill. Truman relied heavily on Roosevelt's national security team and inherited an adversarial relationship with the Soviet Union that had existed before the war and had only been set aside in order to fight it. His most influential advisors insisted that the Soviets were bent on world domination and that a deterrent response was necessary. 1   Initially, the deterrent thought to be most appropriate was economic assistance to prevent the conditions that contributed to increased communist influence. As the communists became more politically and militarily aggressive, however, Truman and his advisors realized that military assistance would be necessary, as economic improvement could not be realized in the face of insurgency. 2 The United States employed military advisors to provide technical, training, planning, and operational advice to avoid committing expensive and potentially escalatory combat formations. 1 John Lewis Gaddis, Strategies of Containment: A Critical Appraisal of American National Security Policy during the Cold War (New York: Oxford University Press, 2005), 60-61. This dissertation uses the less common "advisor" (rather than "adviser") for consistency's sake, since the former is the standard military spelling. 2 Howard Jones, "A New Kind of War": America's Global Strategy and the Truman Doctrine in Greece (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 6.
Military advisors are officers and enlisted personnel deployed in a host nation to assist leaders from the tactical level up to the civilian head of the country. They are typically organized under military assistance advisory groups, defined in Joint Publication (JP) 1-02 as "a joint Service group . . . which primarily administers the U.S.
military assistance planning and programming in the host country."

and their civilian counterparts, although those relationships determine the environment in which more grass-roots military advising took place.
In addition to providing advice and assistance to their hosts, military advisors collect information and intelligence on the disposition and capability of the units they are advising. While this additional function may seem obvious, it is not the focus of most advisory checklists, guidance, or handbooks. This intelligence collection presents a host of analytical challenges that should not be neglected in judging advisory efforts. The first challenge is to evaluate the accuracy of the initial assessments. Advisors might believe their units have made significant progress, only to discover that they cannot execute in the field. Advisors might also feel compelled to report progress since failure reflects on their own performance evaluations. The second challenge is to account for the effect of compiling and filtering advisory reports by those who receive them. Although the reports themselves may provide a complete picture of the host nation army's situation, there is always the risk of losing fidelity or key points as they move further up the information chain. Finally, there is the challenge of evaluating decisions made based on advisor reports, or despite them. In Vietnam, for example, one wonders if any amount of negative reporting would have changed the U.S. position toward the South Vietnamese government. Since President John F. Kennedy had declared in his inaugural address that Americans were willing to "pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty," it is reasonable to expect that Washington would meet setbacks with greater commitment. 4   The United States has a long history of employing military advisors to foreign governments. In the 1800s, advisors frequently trained foreign armies on the technical aspects of U.S. materiel to promote arms sales. During The Second World War, U.S.
advisors supported resistance groups fighting the Axis powers. In the postwar environment, advisory efforts assisted friendly governments against their own homegrown insurgencies. These insurgencies came to be associated with a global Sovietbacked communist ideological struggle as outlined in George Kennan's famous article, "The Sources of Soviet Conduct." 5   In 1947, the Truman administration solidified its anti-communist position, and in a 12 March speech to Congress, President Truman vowed to "support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures." 6 His words referred specifically to the Greek Civil War, which pitted nationalist forces of the pre-war government against the Greek Communist Party (KKE) that had gained strength while resisting the Nazi occupation. With U.S. advisory support led by General James
Van Fleet and millions in aid, the nationalist Greeks fought and defeated the insurgency between 
February 1948 and
August 1949

Military advisors offer policymakers a seemingly inexpensive, low-risk means to achieve foreign policy in which the application of military force, or the development of military capability, is part of the picture, but not the whole picture. As such, they inhabit the space between the helping hand of typical international humanitarian aid and the mailed fist of armed intervention. In ideal cases, they effectively limit U.S. involvement in potential conflict areas. In the worst case, they risk over-militarizing the situation, provide overly optimistic assessments, or deliver advice to their host country counterparts that may make things worse. This study examines what advisory efforts did and did not accomplish across a variety of situations.
Following the successful conclusion of the Greek Civil War in 1949, for example, newspapers implied that U.S. assistance to Greece had produced a Russian defeat.

Exactly how much weight the advisory mission carried in influencing Stalin's judgment and in assisting the Greek national forces is debatable, but it certainly was not negligible.
The true extent of the U.S. commitment to Korea was less apparent. When the United States Military Advisory Group to the Republic of Korea (KMAG) began its training of the Republic of Korea Army (ROKA), it found that it had inherited a mission akin to building the American Army at the outset of the American Revolution. 14 A skeleton advisory effort achieved modest results but was hampered by indecision and paltry funding from Washington. The U.S. military withdrawal from South Korea followed shortly afterward by the outbreak of war to reunite the peninsula by force, inevitably cast doubt on the value of the advisor mission and the policy that produced it.
Only the unprecedented U.S. response to the North's invasion staved off disaster. Based on President Kim Il Sung's aggressiveness, a better-resourced advisory mission from the beginning might have mitigated the initial North Korean onslaught but probably would not have deterred it entirely. Some of the circumstances in Korea were similar to those in Vietnam. Like Vietnam, Korea was divided arbitrarily and was a nation governing itself for the first time in many decades. Furthermore, like Vietnam, its government began under a divisive nationalist leader assuming power as the nation transitioned to independence.
The Hukbalahap (Huk) Rebellion in the Philippines was an outlier among advisory missions during the Cold War because the Soviet influence there was relatively insignificant. Largely due to geography, the Huk Communists were on isolated islands without a sympathetic communist neighbor. Nevertheless, the Philippines case is a classic 12 Jones, "New Kind of War," 223. 13 Ibid., 224. 14 Robert K. Sawyer and Walter G.

Vietnam endures as the ultimate case study of a U.S. policy and strategy mismatch. 15 This dissertation does not intend to examine the reasons behind America's commitment to Vietnam, but rather the advisors' inability to build an army that could defend the country against either an insurgent threat or conventional invasion. The reasons for this failure are many, and this dissertation examines the four cases to draw some conclusions about why some were more successful than others. If leadership is a critical element, then Vietnam presents a conundrum. In the summer of 1960, Military Assistance Advisory Group, Vietnam commander, General 
Samuel Williams, received
No matter how much the advisors wanted to instill their counterparts with a willingness to fight and die for the purpose of victory, it was up to the leaders of the recipient nation's civilian and military leaders to accomplish this task. Second, recipients became 15 David Kaiser begins his study of the origins of the Vietnam War by declaring it "the greatest policy miscalculation in the history of American foreign relations," an unusually forthright statement of what is certainly the mainstream view among scholars.

Third, the idea that military advisors offer a cheap, low-risk, limited-intervention alternative to full-scale intervention may occur under ideal conditions but is a hopeful fantasy in more complex environments that risks serious miscalculations in the real-world environments in which advisors operate. Despite continuous pressure to reduce the amount of funding to them, all four situations required significant resources and commitment but still did not always deliver the results desired.
As this dissertation follows the chronology of the four conflicts, the conclusion contrasts the results of the advisory efforts in Greece, Korea, and the Philippines with the one in Vietnam. Accordingly, three prominent themes emerge that will be explored in detail. These themes ultimately cast doubt on T. E. Lawrence's famous advice to those who would study his exploits:
Do not try to do too much with your own hands. Better the Arabs do it tolerably than that you do it perfectly. It is their war, and you are to help them, not to win it for them. Actually, also, under the very odd conditions of Arabia, your practical work will not be as good as, perhaps, you think it is. 17   Advisory manuals often refer to Lawrence's "Twenty Seven Articles" when promoting best practices. Ironically, Lawrence carefully prefaced his articles with the warning that they were specific to the Bedouin tribesmen with whom he lived and fought, and that they should not be blindly applied to other environments or situations. 18   The first notable theme is the identification of leadership problems in the different armies. Frequently advisors pressured their superiors to replace senior officers with many years of service and sometimes with extensive political connections. Replacing foreign military leaders was a sensitive issue in all four cases. In Greece, for example, General 17 Thomas E. Lawrence, "Twenty Seven Articles," T. E. Lawrence Studies, Castle Hill Press,

Diem's attitude was not surprising because of the numerous coup plots against his government but made removing detrimental leadership even more politicized than in the other cases.
The second recurring theme centers on the issues of advisor selection, preparation, and tour length. The after-action reports from nearly every advisory effort include criticism of these factors. A common complaint was that advisory duty was understood to be more difficult than service with regular military units, yet advisory duty was not career enhancing. Therefore, advisors frequently went to their positions unwillingly. Until the early 1960s, advisors underwent little, if any, preparation in advising. The most that one could expect as an advisor in Korea, for example, was a copy of the "Ten Commandments for KMAG advisors," which was a one-and-a-half page list of best advisory practices. 19 Additionally, advisors faced language and cultural challenges that typically were solved only by the efforts of host nation soldiers who learned English. It was rare for U.S. advisors to communicate with their counterparts in their native language other than through interpreters.
The final recurring theme is dependency on U.S. equipment, expertise, resources, and technology. Throughout his time in Greece, General

The volume of literature on these subjects is vast, yet few studies have tied together operational level advisors across this span of time. This literature review begins with readings on the origins of the Cold War, followed by readings on the individual cases. Given the enormity of the potentially relevant literature, the discussion is not intended to be comprehensive, but simply to highlight key issues that bear upon the research presented in the chapters that follow. It must be noted, however, that the case study of the Philippines is an exception to the general rule of scholarly abundance. Both primary and secondary sources relating to that conflict are sparse.
The Cold War provides the overarching historical context for these four cases.
Literature on the origins of the Cold War is extensive but generally falls into one of three schools of thought. Chronologically, these are the orthodox, revisionist, and postrevisionist views. In From Trust to Terror, historian, former government official, and purveyor of the orthodox view, Herbert Feis, presents the post-1945 split between the wartime allies as rooted in conflicting ideological accounts of the war.

and simultaneously supply the Soviets, while free men and women fought valiantly for the rights of others to enjoy the same liberties. 24 In contrast, the Soviets, still bitter from bearing the brunt of the fighting against the German Army, saw the bravery of their people as proof of communism's superiority. 25 Feis's orthodox view generally blames the Soviets for their belligerent actions and rhetoric as they expanded their geographic control to prevent a repeat of what they had just suffered. 26 Thus, the orthodox viewpoint saw the aggressive response of the West as justified based on the real and present threat posed by the Soviet Union and its communist allies.
The revisionist perspective emerged in the 1960s and coincided with the expanding war in Vietnam. Revisionists were more critical of U.S. behavior than those of the orthodox school and blamed this behavior for creating an unnecessary conflict. In Another Such Victory, Arnold Offner, a prominent revisionist, summarizes his central theme in this comment: "Throughout his presidency, Truman remained a parochial nationalist who lacked the leadership to move the U.S. away from conflict and toward détente." 27 Offner points to numerous confrontations throughout the Truman administration during which the United States could have taken steps to reduce tensions with the Soviet Union-yet chose not to-instead establishing an adversarial relationship that lasted for nearly fifty years. 28 Offner's narrative describes Truman as a simple, naïve, unworldly country boy who blustered his way through foreign policy due to his consistent "parochial nationalism" during his two terms.

presents Washington's policy as pragmatic and focused on maintaining predominant power vis-à-vis the Soviet Union. 30 Leffler characterized this strategy's goals as creating "a world environment hospitable to U.S. interests and values . . . [and to establish] a configuration of power and a military posture so that if war erupted, the United States would prevail." 31 The Truman Doctrine and containment reflected this preponderance of power that shaped the U.S. response to communist aggression in Greece, Korea, the Philippines, and Vietnam.
Finally, the post-revisionists swung partly back toward the orthodox school, as they were more willing to recognize that Soviet motives were unclear and that a cautious U.S. response was justified in this environment. In this approach, post-revisionists were more balanced at placing the decisions made in the context of the international environment, state actions, and leadership personalities of the time-period. This school of thought is more sympathetic to the realization that the world had catastrophically underestimated the danger posed by Germany and Japan prior to the Second World War.
The natural response was to take steps to prevent a future similar situation. This conclusion meant meeting force with force, presuming aggressive intentions when signals were unclear, and maintaining larger standing armies than was typical for a postwar period. Scholars in this school include John Lewis Gaddis. In his words, "the American interest was not to dominate other power centers, but to see that no one else did either." 32   The truth about Soviet intentions and ideology will never be known without the full release of Soviet records. Clearly, the United States and other democratic countries were deeply concerned about the spread of communism long before Truman, and this apprehension likely colored his judgment. Additionally, Roosevelt's death shortly after his fourth inauguration thrust Truman into the foreign policy decision-making process after less than three months as Vice President. Truman's tendency to take the position most advantageous for the United States when the motivations of Joseph Stalin were 30 Melvyn P.

In hindsight, Stalin's behavior was understandable considering the disagreement between the East and West on the partition of Germany and the wholesale destruction of much of Russia. Likewise, it was reasonable that the Western powers were vigilant toward anyone displaying expansionist and bellicose behavior, having so recently concluded the war against Hitler. Additionally, since one of the hallmarks of U.S. foreign policy is its continuing emphasis on free global markets, Leffler's hypothesis on the Cold War's origins seems more appropriate than blaming it entirely on either side. Regardless of fault, however, the result was a simmering belligerent relationship that would be tested on proxy battlefields for the next forty years.
Historian Douglas Porch's Counterinsurgency addresses the contemporary myth that counterinsurgency (COIN) as a set of doctrinal tactics was responsible for turning defeat into victory in Iraq under General David Petraeus. Porch's book informs the framework of this dissertation in that it presents a question, albeit about a mislabeled strategy rather than the means on which this study focuses, to determine its efficacy and evolution. Porch ultimately debunks the supposition that COIN is a replacement for "a viable policy and strategy"; rather, COIN is simply the "lineal descendant" of "colonial warfare" and relies "on coercion rather than persuasion." 35 33 Offner, Another Such Victory, 253. 34 Ibid., 249.

In Arming the Free World, Chester Pach lays out the broader evolution of military assistance from its inception to its codification in national strategy with the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949. He contends that military assistance began in a haphazard fashion often with poorly or even undefined objectives and resulted in "America's arming of almost the entire 'free world'" throughout the history of these programs. 36 He concludes that this mindset persisted and by the end of the 1940s had installed a global commitment with no clear end. 37   Many Army field manuals (FMs) and other official publications address military advising from a tactical perspective and read as a list of best practices. These include Security Force Assistance (FM 3-07.1), which could be considered the primary current military handbook on advising. Its chapter on advising states that the advisor's major objective is "inspiring and influencing a counterpart to effective action" primarily by gaining "their counterparts' trust and confidence." 38 The field manual then lays out advisors' ideal personality traits and considerations, which read as a graduate course in warfare executed by a select group of perfect soldier-statesmen. Reality was far different.
The prevailing mindset among the higher leadership at the time was that any good soldier could advise effectively. Advisors at the lower levels, however, faced duty that was frustrating, lonely, and detrimental to one's career.

Vietnam. 40 Although similar in content, this dissertation focuses on how Washington viewed advisors and the contributions advisors made to the conflicts in which they were involved, rather than their role in the establishment of counterinsurgency doctrine.
As Truman's administration grappled with its response to the perceived Soviet maneuvers to expand its global power, Washington ultimately settled on a policy of containment. Fearing a deeper communist conspiracy and a strategic threat against the Bosporus Strait, Truman made his famous 1947 address to Congress promulgating what became known as the Truman Doctrine, which included a promise of military aid to governments threatened by communist subversion. Greece was one such government. In A New Kind of War, Howard Jones traces the events leading up to this new paradigm and its immediate impact on Greece and the debate surrounding the establishment and implementation of the Truman Doctrine there. He observes that Truman omitted mentioning the Soviet Union in his speech, a decision made with an eye toward avoiding escalation, but one that did not obscure that he had established a global commitment. 41   Scholars differ over the decisive factors that led to the Greek nationalist victory.
Their arguments span from focusing on the U.S. contribution almost entirely to laying blame squarely at the Communists' feet. In The Greek Civil War, Edgar O'Ballance 40 Andrew J. Birtle, U.S.

He downplays the U.S. contribution, noting that the decisive factors to the Communists' defeat depended on breaks in the internal and external communist ranks. 43 Charles R.
Shrader's The Withered Vine examines the war from the Communists' perspective, focusing primarily on their decisions and relationships with other communist states at the onset of the Cold War. He argues that the Communists lost because of "inadequate logistics" based on their decision to fight a conventional war against a numerically and technologically superior enemy without the external support they required to win. 44   This initial aid effort in Greece was significant because it set the stage for subsequent advisory missions. In The Will to Win, a biography of General James Van
Fleet, the commander of the military aid and advisory program in Greece, Paul Braim argues that Van Fleet and American aid were critical to the Greek victory over communist forces. He writes, "That the U.S. aid program had been vital to that

Quite bluntly, Harris states, "The advisors' ceaseless training, mentorship, direction, and influence led to the aggressive Greek operations that destroyed the communist threat." 48   In contrast, Christopher Woodhouse, in The Struggle for Greece, downplays the U.S. role. He points out that most of the military equipment ordered by the United States did not arrive until hostilities ended. 49 Furthermore, he directly contradicts the notion that U.S. advice was critical to effecting change in Greek Army organization and tactics. He writes, "It was the Greek high command itself which eventually, at the eleventh hour, achieved its own regeneration; and the new tactics which came near to complete success in 1948 were devised by Greek initiative." 50 Woodhouse had extensive personal experience of the Greek Civil War, first as a soldier assisting the Greek resistance, then as a diplomat, and finally as a historian of the events. Although he may have been biased, his observations call into question the prevalent mindset of the Americans at the time.
Since this review focuses on U.S. military advisory efforts, it is important to understand how U.S. leaders perceived the effectiveness of U.S. efforts in Greece. Many in Truman's administration believed that U.S. efforts were largely responsible for nationalist victory in Greece. This belief inevitably informed future policy. 47 "Memorandum by the Under Secretary of State

Concurrently, Korea faced its own confrontation with communism following the Second World War, although its situation differed significantly from that of Greece.
Korea emerged from years of foreign domination and was arbitrarily split at the 38 th   Parallel by the United States and the Soviet Union. U.S. forces occupied Korea as the Japanese withdrew and native Koreans established their new government. With the nationalists Kim Il Sung in the north and Syngman Rhee in the south, the stage was set for a conflict over reunification of the peninsula. Despite the Soviet-supported buildup in the North and a moderate insurgency that totaled 7,235 deaths of government forces and 30,000 guerrillas and noncombatants, the United States withdrew its forces except for the KMAG. 51 Millett's history of the Korean War provides excellent overall context and includes important information about the advisory effort, particularly during the period before the North Korean invasion.
From 1946 to 1950, U.S. advisors assisted the South Koreans in building a professional, well-trained army. Major Robert K. Sawyer's KMAG In Peace and War serves as the U.S. Army's official history of the KMAG effort. Sawyer's study details a Korean Army in a readiness crisis when U.S. advisors began providing assistance. 52   Sawyer argues that U.S. advisors were critical to the creation and professionalization of the Republic of Korea Army. This conclusion contrasts with his description of the early advisory period, during which the Korean advisory effort was severely understaffed with individual advisors often overseeing training for multiple units spread out across the country. 53   Another KMAG history, Bryan R. Gibby's Will to Win, complements Sawyer's book by expanding on the post-invasion KMAG efforts to reconstruct a Korean army capable of holding its own against North Korean and Chinese attacks once the front stabilized in 1951 until the cease fire was signed in 1953. In Gibby's words, "the KMAG 51 Allan Reed Millett, The War for 
Korea, 1945
Korea, -1950
partnership infused the ROKA with the motivation to fight and win." 54 Throughout the course of his narrative, however, he describes an advisory relationship unlike all others, particularly when U.S. forces arrived to defend South Korea. With this situation, the advisory effort had far more control over ROKA forces than any advisors before or since.
This factor made a huge difference in the outcome of that conflict. Gibby's history is the most comprehensive and contemporary account of KMAG's contribution to the ROKA from inception to 1953.
In contrast to Sawyer, Allan Millett argues that KMAG failed to provide adequate warning of the severe inequality in arms that the ROKA possessed vis-à-vis the north.
This lapse resulted in a defense plan, as Millett describes, based more on "matters of hope, not strategy." 55 Millett notes that Brigadier General William L. Roberts, the KMAG commander from August 1948 to June 1950, provided upbeat verbal assessments of the ROKA to his superiors that belied KMAG's written assessments. 56 These latter assessments stated that the North Korean People's Army (NKPA) was rapidly increasing its offensive capability and soon could overpower the ROKA. 57 Had Roberts been more direct in personal meetings with senior U.S. personnel, the ROKA and U.S. military might have been able to rectify some of the imbalance. By June 1950, however, it was too late to overcome this disparity before the NKPA invasion. The ROKA had to survive with the planning, training, and weapons it already had.
Much like the Greek Civil War, the Hukbalahap, or Huk, Insurrection was an internal class struggle that existed before The Second World War, resulting from the gross inequality between rural peasants and wealthy landowners. Postwar independence and an independent Filipino government that promised to continue past policies simply 54 Bryan R.

provided the catalyst that accelerated this inequality conflict. In his autobiography, In the Communist following years of indoctrination and fighting in support of the cause. He was also a senior Huk military leader, was elected to the Philippine Congress after the Second World War, and was one of the last Huk leaders to surrender. Naturally, his memoirs risk being terribly one-sided, which is apparent as he largely overlooks Huk atrocities while accusing the government of disproportionate responses. 60 He readily admits, however, that he was lulled into the false belief that the leaders of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP), who ran the Huk Rebellion, had the best interests of the Filipinos in mind when they advocated full-scale rebellion. 61 He saw his objective, which was greater democratic representation for the interests of the vast majority of Filipinos, superseded by the whims of the Party leaders in true Orwellian fashion. 62 He blames much of the movement's failure to find greater appeal among the masses on this shift in party ideology. The other Huk personality was William Pomeroy, a U.S. Army deserter turned 58 Edward Geary Lansdale, In the Midst of Wars: An American's Mission to Southeast Asia (New York: Fordham University Press, 1991). 59 Ibid., 70-71. 60 Luis Taruc, Born of the People (New York: International Publishers, 1953), 263. 61 Luis Taruc, He Who Rides the Tiger: The Story of an Asian Guerrilla Leader (New York: Frederick A. 
Praeger, 1967)
Huk. Unlike Taruc, his narrative, The Forest, reads as that of a dedicated communist with little reflection on the abuses that his side committed during the struggle. 63 His is more a tale of one-sided honorable struggle against an insidious and evil foe, but it is nevertheless useful for understanding the highs and lows of the Huk side of the campaign.
On the Philippine government side, Colonel Napoleon Valeriano, a successful Philippine battalion combat team (BCT) commander and U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel
Charles Bohannan, one of Lansdale's team members, collaborated in their book Counter-Guerrilla Operations. 64 Their study is broken down by subjects such as "Know Thine
Enemy" and "The Mission," then uses examples from the Huk Rebellion and the government's response to illustrate the points. In general, their method follows the narrative that the Philippine government failed to subdue the Huks due to inadequate organization of its forces, abuse of the population it was supposed to protect, and uninspired leadership. 65 Once it corrected these grave shortcomings, the Rebellion turned around in the government's favor.
The Huk Rebellion is perhaps the most scholarly work that allowed enough time to pass that the subject could be viewed more objectively. Writing in 1977, he focuses on the origins of the Huk Rebellion but very little on the conduct of the campaign that ended it. He argues that the Huks finally quit fighting due to "general weariness," government economic reforms, and improved Philippine Army performance. 66 In contrast to nearly every other author of this period, he downplays the role of the hardcore communists in the movement, preferring to argue that the Rebellion was a spontaneous reaction to rapidly changing economic conditions. 67 With this 63 William J.

The insight into the relationship between Diem and his U.S. military advisors that both authors provide is particularly noteworthy because it shows the difficulties advisors face in addressing fundamental grievances through the recognized government.
Rufus Phillips was one of Lansdale's early lieutenants, and his time spent focused on Vietnam was rivaled only by that of Lansdale and John Paul Vann. He maintains two themes in his memoir, Why Vietnam Matters. First, he criticizes the Washington decisionmaking that was made "in a vacuum" and "doomed the enterprise to failure." 75 Although Phillips refers mostly to decisions made by the Kennedy administration and later, these politicians were not radically different from their predecessors.

In Trapped by Success, David Anderson examines the U.S. relationship with Diem and U.S. policy toward Vietnam during the Eisenhower era. His main argument is 72 Miller, Misalliance, 325.   73 Ibid., 326.   74 Ellen J.

that "ignorance and confidence bred an illusion of success that trapped Eisenhower and subsequent U.S. presidents in a frustrating and futile effort to define and defend U.S.
interests." 77 Anderson addresses the irony in Eisenhower's decision not to assist the French at Dien Bien Phu. Eisenhower made this decision despite believing, like Truman, in the need to contain communism everywhere. Subsequently, the Eisenhower administration halfheartedly supported Diem's government with large amounts of aid but never with the conviction that reflected the importance it placed on Vietnam in public and private discourse. As Anderson chronicles, Diem experienced a small degree of success in creating a stable nation, but the administration convinced itself that the success was nothing short of a miracle. 78   81 Vann was the catalyst behind these successes, which ultimately backfired. Vann never transferred his aggressive spirit to Cao, but the battlefield successes buoyed Cao's credibility to the extent that he did not need to take more risks. 77 David L. Anderson, Trapped by Success:

79 Ibid., 208. Moreover, at times Cao countermanded Vann's attempts to achieve even greater tactical successes while blaming these events on subordinates. 82 Vann finally realized that President Diem had ordered his commanders to avoid casualties. 83 As Sheehan points out, however, what Vann failed to recognize was the political reality of Vietnam and the Diem regime. 84 The ARVN represented the primary tool for the regime's political survival, and the insurgency was a real and dangerous threat. Therefore, the ARVN's existence could not be placed at risk through overly aggressive battlefield maneuvers. At least this scenario is how the Diem regime appeared to see it, which was incomprehensible to Vann. 85   Vann's story served as a vehicle around which to tell the larger Vietnam story. In this vein, it shared characteristics with first-person accounts such as Daniel Fitzgibbon's To Bear Any Burden. As a Special Forces officer in Vietnam living with and fighting alongside a Vietnamese Special Forces (VNSF) team that in turn commanded a Civilian Irregular Defense Group (CIDG) battalion, Fitzgibbon witnessed the various hurdles in Vietnamese and American bureaucracies. For example, one of the battalion's companies consisted of Montagnards, who were considered a lesser ethnic class in Vietnamese society. The VNSF team leader feared treating them the same as his Vietnamese companies lest he be reported to his superiors and presumably punished. 86 Likewise, Fitzgibbon faced his own frustrations dealing with his higher headquarters. He was routinely chastised, for example, when the irregular Vietnamese forces he advised were not as operationally active as standard U.S. Army maneuver units. 87 This criticism illustrated one of the challenges for advisors, particularly when the scope of U.S. involvement in a nation expanded beyond a small advisory role. Since advisors typically worked in small teams and often ended up coming from different units formed in an ad 82 Sheehan, Bright Shining Lie, 87. 83 Ibid., 122. 84 Ibid., 198. 85 Ibid., 122. 86 Daniel H.

hoc fashion, they were frequently ignored in logistics planning and even harassed by the regular line formations for any number of reasons. These factors often made it more difficult for advisors to accomplish their missions.

In Throughout the advisors' time in Greece, they faced many challenges in addition to the Greek Communists. These challenges stemmed from the Greek political and military establishment that the advisors were invited to assist. First, U.S. personnel needed to establish rapport and credibility to begin a constructive dialogue to reverse 1 Braim, Will to Win; Harris, "Instilling Aggressiveness"; U.S.

Greek misfortunes. The first senior U.S. military advisor, Major General William Livesay, did not perform effectively in this role and was replaced. Second, the advisors sought to overcome entrenched cultures in institutions such as the GNA. This challenge proved insurmountable at many levels and on many topics of basic military principles.
Third, the advisors faced a GNA that became increasingly dependent on U.S. largesse for its existence, operational capability, and tactical style. The technology thought to give the GNA an edge over its enemy often meant that the GNA would not fight without it nor cease requesting more. Finally, the advisors worked to establish a sense of urgency and pride in their counterparts to motivate them to solve their own problem quickly. Advisors met with some success on this issue, but motivation was a matter for Greek leadership to address.
To trace the path to U.S. involvement in Greece, one must start with Britain.
Although not strictly part of the British Empire, Greece had long been part of Britain's strategic calculus since the Greek War of Independence due to its position in the eastern Mediterranean. Despite an unsavory dictatorial government in Greece as The Second World War opened, Great Britain stood by its ally and fought to defend against the German invasion that resulted in three years of occupation, economic devastation, and famine that claimed as many as 250,000 lives.  4 Following the German withdrawal from Greece, British forces assumed responsibility for maintaining order among the same resistance groups they had supported during the war and for reestablishing the constitutional monarchy. The communist resistance group, EAM, chose this opportunity to launch an armed revolt that the British crushed. 5 The communist resistance did not fade away, however.
In the aftermath of the Second World War, the mantle of world leadership shifted decisively from Great Britain to the United States. Great Britain responded to this shift with a policy of retrenchment, including its position in Greece. Despite Greece's economic and political struggles, London maintained a particular regard for Greece's position in its strategic landscape. Conversely, Washington debated internally its new leadership role, desiring that London would maintain much of its capability. This difference in views caused some consternation between the United States and Britain in Greece. The British hoped to extricate themselves from any responsibility there to concentrate on other pieces of their crumbling empire, while the Americans expected to supply some money and materiel, but little else. A deteriorating political and military situation in Greece, Britain's 1947 ultimatum, and a Greek Army largely dependent on outside support for its very existence ultimately forced America's hand. 6   Reflecting the tenuous economic and military situation in Greece, the British laid out their position in a 21 February 1947 message to the U.S. Department of State. The message predicted that Greece would realize "widespread starvation and consequent political disturbance during the present year

By early 1947, U.S. reports from Greece were increasingly dire. Journalist Mark F. Ethridge, serving as the U.S. delegate to the United Nations (UN) Commission examining the Greek border disputes, reported that the "[Greek] army morale [was] at lowest possible" with "two detachments going over to the guerrillas in last three days." 10   Although Washington was reluctant to be forced into a situation it did not choose, its assumption that the Soviets were bent on world domination left it little choice. Secretary Marshall's statement to the UN on 26 June 1947 clearly articulated the U.S. opinion that the Soviet Union was responsible for fostering communist revolution in Greece to reinforce Soviet dominance of the Balkan Peninsula. 11   Despite these fears-however justifiable in 1947-Stalin generally respected the percentages agreement with respect to Greece. Although he supported an established communist party that could bide its time while awaiting events to unfold, the entry of the United States into the conflict and his disagreements with Tito rendered serious Soviet 8 The communist guerrillas were commonly referred to as "bandits" by U.S. and Greek leaders throughout the war.

The Government and Communist Party of Yugoslavia, and to a lesser extent those of Bulgaria and Albania, have been carrying on activities under the direction of the USSR the purpose of which is (1) to separate Macedonia from the remainder of Greece in order to make Grecian Macedonia a part of a new Macedonian state, and (2) to set up eventually in the remainder of Greece a Communist-controlled government which would force Greece into a Soviet-dominated Balkan bloc. These activities have included the dispatch of arms and military equipment to Greek guerrillas, the training and sending to Greece of reinforcements for the Greek guerrillas and the extension of aid through many other means to the Greek subversive Communist movement." Ibid., 867. involvement a moot point. 12 Since Stalin feared a direct confrontation with the United States so close to home, he was willing to abandon the questionable Greek Communist movement to its fate. 13 Washington policymakers nevertheless extrapolated the internal Greek threat to the larger international picture and postulated future threats to Iran, Italy, Turkey, and France, who were undergoing either external Soviet threat or seeds of conflict with their own communist movements. The fear was that communist success in Greece would motivate communist organizations elsewhere. This mindset would continue for decades. with the authority to offer up to $400 million in aid to Greece and military personnel to serve "in an advisory capacity only." 14 This last stipulation inspired much hand wringing as the military situation in Greece waxed and waned. Some, like career diplomat George Kennan, believed that economic means were the primary tool against communist expansion, and that they were probably sufficient to solve the problems in Greece. 15   Congressional and State Department hawks, however, called for American combat units to address the Greek problem.
Cooler heads prevailed, however, as Secretary of State Marshall, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) concluded that U.S. forces beyond an advisory element were unnecessary. 16 Additionally, the objective of advice and assistance was to multiply the number of anti-communist forces around the world, rather than require the commitment of U.S. forces. By limiting itself exclusively to an advisory mission, however, Washington transferred virtually all control over the outcome of the 12 Peter J.

The two parties to the conflict were the Greek Communist Party, or KKE, and the Greek nationalists. 17 Since the KKE's establishment in 1918, these two entities had bitterly opposed each other with the Communists biding their time, despite being frequently targeted by right-wing groups. The Second World War and its aftermath delivered the conditions the Communists required to renew their struggle to overthrow the existing government.
The KKE was founded on 4 November 1918 on strict Marxist principles of urbanbased revolution. The Russian Revolution heavily influenced the KKE's early leadership, which viewed the subsequently established Soviet Union as its ideological leader. In 1931, Stalin appointed Nikos Zachariades to head the KKE, and under his leadership, it grew in membership and political power. 18 The result was that King George II, newly restored to the monarchy in 1935, perceived the Communists to be an imminent threat to
Greece. The king subsequently dissolved parliament, appointed General Ioannis Metaxas as prime minister, and granted him dictatorial powers to secure the state against communism. Metaxas ably neutralized the communist threat but alienated many who were previously government supporters. The communists who escaped persecution were, as Christopher Woodhouse describes, "tough, disciplined, secretive,

From 1942 to 1944, the British supported EAM and other resistance groups against the Nazis, but the results were unimpressive. As the largest group, EAM used its superior position to intimidate non-Communists and posture itself for postwar dominance.
Ultimately, this meant that the guerrillas spent at least as much time fighting each other as they did the Germans. 20 With the unpopular Greek government in exile in Cairo, it was left to those who remained behind to fight it out for postwar spoils.
The Communists had failed to win the right to rule among the wartime resistance groups. The Communists failed again-fighting in vain against the British-in the turmoil that followed the German withdrawal. 
King George II's return to the throne was short lived, as he died on 1 April 1947.
George's death turned out to be favorable for the nationalists since his younger brother Paul I-a far more personable figure-succeeded him. 23 Complicating the political situation, however, was that the Greek Parliament had been in constant upheaval since the German departure. U.S. and British diplomats helped mediate a coalition government that remained intact, although barely, throughout the civil war. These fortunate incidents 20 Doris M. Condit, Case Study in Guerrilla War: Greece during World War II (Washington, DC: American University, 1961), 74-6. 21 O'Ballance, Greek Civil War, 95. 22 Robert W. at least provided the impression of inclusion, democratic processes, and stability, which were factors unknown in Greek politics of the day.
Greek nationalist goals centered on ridding the country of the armed communist menace and, ideally, of all communist influence. To this end, the advisory effort was closely aligned with these goals. Political infighting nevertheless continued between government factions throughout the war, and the Greeks consistently complained of insufficient U.S. aid while emphasizing their own sacrifices in the great power struggle between the western democracies and the eastern communist states. 24 The nature of the conflict helps explain this attitude. Although the conflict was a national crisis that consumed enormous resources, it lacked the life and death struggle that might have forced the Greeks to unite themselves more completely. To this end, the advisors-whose mission it was to prevent a worsening situation-were incapable of unifying the political factions in a lasting way.
Early indications of nationalist chances for victory were disappointing. In July 1946, a Communist attack on an army camp in Macedonia resulted in seven GNA soldiers killed and 25 captured. 25 In October, fighting expanded throughout northern Greece and into the Peloponnese, with at least 60 killed and 53 wounded. 26 In November, under pressure from the rebels, the Greek gendarmerie abandoned 55 outposts in northern Greece, which left over 800 square miles of territory bordering Albania and Yugoslavia out of government control. 27 By December 1946, DA forces began operating in battalion and regiment sized formations when only six months before they had operated in merely platoon size. 28 The tide was shifting in the DA's favor. The GNA facing them was, as 24 Jones, New Kind of War, 187-88, 197-98.   25 DOS, "Greece and Turkey Background Material Political, Economic, Military, Budget Presentation  Fiscal Year 1949," 1948, Entry 136, Box 6, JUSMAGG, Office of the Comptroller, Budget and Fiscal File,  1948-52, RG 334, NACP, 19.  26 Ibid., 23. 27 Ibid.

historian Howard Jones describes it, "poorly led, ill-trained, undisciplined, inadequately provisioned, low in morale, and reluctant to take the offensive." 29   Although Greeks traced their warfighting roots back to antiquity, even the relatively young GNA had seen better times. Under the leadership of General Alexander Papagos, it had valiantly punished an attempted Italian invasion that subsequently necessitated Germany's invasion in 1941. 30 During the occupation, it became a mix of resistance fighters, collaborators, and survivors. Following the war, however, the GNA fell prey to the multiple factions vying for Greece in the ensuing power struggle. By late 1946, the GNA consisted of approximately 115,000 soldiers and another 35,000 gendarmerie. 31 Many units were assigned to static defense duties throughout the country, however, which made them easy prey for larger DA units, while handicapping their ability to conduct offensive operations.
A bright note for the GNA throughout the war was its chain of command architecture and force structure. Although its senior leadership faced political interference and meddling, the GNA was not diluted by the creation of large numbers of specialized units reporting to parallel chains of command. It did create elite commando units of handpicked volunteers, but these commandoes worked closely with the conventional units they supported and traced their command and control to the battalions and brigades to which they were assigned. Figure

Greece's borders in 1947 were nearly identical to those of today. Greece consisted of numerous islands and a mainland with an inordinately long coastline in comparison to its landmass. Its northern border with Albania, Yugoslavia, and Bulgaria measured more than 600 miles and was impossible to secure. These three countries provided arms and supplies to the Greek Communists and served as safe havens where Communists could rest, rearm, and refit in safety. Approximately 25 percent of Greece's land was available for farming, but poor soil conditions, mismanagement, and primitive farming methods resulted in insufficient agricultural productivity and thus a net import requirement for Greece. 32 The other 75 percent of Greece was mountainous, sparsely populated, and poorly connected by roads. The Communists established their main base areas in the northern mountains, although they launched attacks throughout the country.
Demographically, Greece had become more homogeneous in the decades leading up to the civil war. A war with Turkey in the 1920s and the subsequent population exchange resulted in an ethnic Greek population as high as 96 percent. 33 This homogeneity removed ethnic division as a significant factor in the conflict and made it more difficult for the communists to recruit support among the Greek population. Despite these factors, the Greek economy was underdeveloped, its people were poorly educated, and many were surviving on subsistence farming with little hope for a better future. 34   Thus, Greece was still a fertile territory for a populist revolutionary movement.
Vigorous U.S. involvement in Greece under the newly minted Truman Doctrine began in a haphazard fashion with questions surrounding the military mission's role. friend of President 
Harry Truman, Dwight Griswold.
Major General Livesay assumed command of USAGG shortly after its establishment. Livesay had served as a lieutenant in World War I and as a division commander in The Second World War. Even though the War Department projected his command would consist of fewer than 100 personnel, the scope of his responsibilities and the gravity of the situation required a senior officer-a common pattern in U.S. advisory programs throughout the Cold War. Although the operational and tactical level advisors working for Livesay were typically junior in rank to their counterparts, there was value in the senior advisor being of a near-equivalent grade to the senior military commander in the host nation force.
Upon arrival in Greece, Griswold and Livesay energetically began coordinating U.S. aid across the gamut of assistance sectors, including infrastructure, communications, and the military. In his initial report of May 1948, Griswold assessed the situation in Greece as particularly dire and "rapidly deteriorating" due to "guerrilla warfare" and the "heightened public fear" it produced. 37 He further observed that economic reconstruction was impossible without addressing the guerrilla problem, since it disrupted nearly all aspects of daily life, including creating a refugee problem that placed an even greater 35 U.S. Army, "USAGG Brief History, Procurement, 24 
May 47-31 Aug 49," 1949
Livesay set out to determine GNA shortcomings and began addressing them through Greek and U.S. channels. In one of his initial assessments of the GNA, he evaluated it as having an "excellent combat record," with its main shortcoming being infiltration by communist sympathizers; he also noted the improved GNA morale that appeared to accompany the public U.S. announcement of assistance to Greece. 39 This assessment was overly optimistic based on the GNA's unimpressive record. Livesay also began receiving requests from Greek leadership to increase the size of the GNA. The issue of Greek leaders viewing the GNA's size as insufficient would plague him and his successor throughout the war. In part, these requests had merit despite the significant advantage in manpower the GNA possessed. Many GNA units were deployed in static positions guarding towns and villages, and thus were unavailable for offensive action against an elusive guerrilla enemy that numbered approximately 22,000 at this point in the war. 40 Figure

any increases needed to be justified with strong arguments. Livesay resisted initial Greek demands for increasing the GNA's size, but eventually supported a growth of 10,000 to eliminate insufficient forces as an excuse for GNA lethargy. 42 Livesay and Griswold also sought to rectify the defensive mindset of the GNA by supporting the creation of a National Defense Corps (NDC) of lightly armed soldiers that could fill the routine, but necessary static security role and relieve the GNA units to pursue the DA. 43 Additionally, they pushed the Greeks to dismiss ineffective leaders-calling for the relief of the Greek First Army Commander and two of the three corps commanders-citing their lack of aggressiveness. 44 These recommendations, backed primarily by Griswold's forceful personality and deep pockets, began to force some necessary reforms in the Greek government and military.
By the end of 1947, however, the military situation in Greece had deteriorated to the point that it threatened the effectiveness of the larger aid program, which was the cornerstone of U.S. Cold War strategy. On Christmas Day 1947, 3,500 DA guerrillas attacked the 900-man garrison in Konitsa in northern Greece to establish a communist capital, which they hoped would lead to greater credibility, foreign recognition, and most importantly, greater aid. 45 Fighting for their lives, the GNA troops held off the attackers until reinforcements could break through and relieve them. Although this defensive victory served to rally deflated Greek army and civilian spirits, it still highlighted inadequacies in GNA combat performance. As AMAG Chief Dwight Griswold reported 42 Wittner, American Intervention in Greece, 227.

Washington and its representatives in Greece subsequently concluded that military and economic aid alone was insufficient for Greece to defeat the communists.
They determined that Greece needed direct U.S. military advice and directed the establishment of the Joint U.S. Military Advisory and Planning Group (JUSMAPG) under General Livesay. JUSMAPG's mission statement was "to assist the Greek Armed Forces in achieving internal security in Greece at the earliest possible date, by providing to GNA (including NDC), Royal Hellenic Navy (RHN), and Royal Hellenic Air Force (RHAF), stimulating and aggressive assistance in the form of operational and logistical advice." 47 Marshall emphasized this change in focus to Griswold noting that the "destruction [of] guerrilla forces and establishment internal security now have assumed paramount importance as necessary preliminary for American aid to Greece." 48   USAGG remained as a logistics hub for receiving equipment and supplies, but the JUSMAPG commander assumed responsibility for all military recommendations to the U.S. senior civilian representative, JCS, and the Greek Armed Forces. The creation of this new entity also required a reexamination of its chain of command. Since military operations assumed the central role, the military leadership in the United States recommended that strictly military matters rest in JCS channels versus flowing through the Department of State. Thus, JUSMAPG reported to JCS on all military matters, while maintaining open communication with embassy and AMAG leaders. 49 The proximity of The Second World War to the Greek Civil War meant that Livesay could draw from a pool of officers and enlisted who had experience in combat and training forces for combat. In January 1948, Livesay briefed the arriving U.S. officers on their duties as operational advisors. His speech to them set the tone for the difficult political and military environment they would operate in and echoed contemporary guidance and best practices on advising foreign armies. He presented the mission as "quell[ing] the riots and establish[ing] a stable Greece," with JUSMAPG personnel "advis[ing] them [Greeks] and assist 
[ing]
Despite this theme, Livesay directed the advisors to avoid directly participating in combat. For this reason, they were unarmed. Nevertheless, they were still expected to conduct themselves in a fashion that would not discredit the bravery of the American soldier. Thus, Livesay's instruction to his advisors was to "observe combat but don't get involved in it." 52   This ambiguous directive belied the urgency of the U.S. position in the Greek Civil War and seemed to place a higher value on remaining unobserved than on winning or advising effectively. Furthermore, it presented significant difficulties for advisors who were asked to instill aggressiveness in their counterparts, yet had to remain inconspicuous during times when aggressive action was needed most. During times of indecisiveness or timidity on the part of the Greeks, advisors could not play the vital role of setting a bold example that might transfer to their counterparts. Instead, they were expected to reshape 50 William Livesay, "Livesay Guidance to Advisers," January 1948, Entry 146, Folder 49,  JUSMAGG, USAG, AGS, CFU, General Decimal File, 1947-48, RG 334, NACP, 1.  51 Ibid., 2. 52 Ibid., 7.
the culture through critique and subtle suggestion. Judging from the advisors' reports, this approach did not always achieve the results desired.
In early 1948, the military situation in Greece was showing little improvement, and the expectations for rapid success from Washington were far too high.

By Van Fleet's arrival, the GNA had increased in size to 132,000 troops, and the NDC had grown steadily to 66 battalions on its way to 96 for a final strength of 48,000 troops. 56 His first realized achievement was reducing the amount of political interference and security leaks in GNA operational plans. In a meeting of the Supreme National
Defense Council (SNDC) on 26 February 1948, its members decided to remove themselves from the review process for military plans, instead granting full authority to the commander of the Greek General Staff to plan and execute military operations without interference. 57 Thus, the fruits of Livesay and Griswold's efforts began to be put into practice, although the results would not be immediate.

In January and April 1949, General Reuben Jenkins, Van Fleet's deputy, admonished the respective American advisor chiefs of the Greek B and C Corps for their corps' failure to emphasize training at every opportunity, even when some of the unit was engaged in operations. 60 Jenkins referred to the U.S. experience when he wrote, "every American Division regimental and battalion commander soon learned in WWII that a unit can conduct offensive or defensive battle and at the same time carry on some vitally needed tactical or technical training with its supports and reserves at the same time. They also learned that this combination paid large dividends." 61  In March and April 1948, the GNA launched operations with U.S. advisor support in central Greece to clear out two enemy pockets totaling 3,800 Communists. 66 The Greeks displayed significant tactical acumen during these operations, accounting for 3,140 communists killed, captured, or surrendered. 67 From these successes, it appeared that the GNA had recovered its fighting spirit and that further offensives might decisively conclude the conflict by the end of 1948. 68 In other areas of the country such as the Peloponnese, however, the guerrillas inflicted heavy losses against NDC units. 69 Despite a solid foundation in theory, the NDC turned out to be largely a failure. Its forces lacked the training and equipment to challenge communist attacks adequately, its numbers counted against overall GNA numbers, and its units did not replace as many GNA battalions as originally promised. 70 As seen in its performance in the Peloponnese, the idea that the NDC could secure areas cleared by the GNA remained in doubt. The effectiveness of the government's campaign, however, relied on each to perform its role.
Meanwhile, despite the DA's heavy losses in direct confrontations with the GNA, it still managed to find either willing or forced replacements in the northern mountain areas it controlled with populations more sympathetic to the movement. 71 March 1948 also saw the replacement of nearly the entire Greek military leadership as ten lieutenant generals were retired and replaced with newly promoted corps commanders. Other critical positions in the War Ministry, NDC, and Army were also reshuffled or replaced. 72 These personnel replacements at least showed a willingness on the part of the Greek government to address decisively the politicization of its military.
In July and August, the GNA attacked the strongest concentration of DA forces in Greece in the Grammos Mountains near the border with Albania. This area was particularly challenging since it was isolated logistically from Greece but could be supplied from across the border. 73 A successful attack on the communist stronghold would appear to be an important symbol of GNA superiority and the Greek government's ultimate victory. The terrain favored the defenders, however, and the lack of infrastructure meant envelopment by the GNA would depend on skill, leadership, and aggressiveness, three traits generally lacking in that organization. The operation commenced in a disorganized fashion against a well-fortified and determined enemy led by General Markos.
Beginning 16 June 1948, the GNA attacked approximately 11,400-12,500 DA guerrillas with the Greek A and B Corps totaling at least 40,000 troops plus air and artillery support. 74 Despite the mismatch in forces, the Communists fought well from their strong positions, and the GNA was unable to make significant headway during the early phases of the operation. 75 Moreover, the B Corps commander frustrated his senior U.S. advisor, which quickly elevated to Van Fleet's level. 76 JUSMAPG provided specific 71 Griswold, "AMAG Monthly Report," May 15, 1948. 72 Griswold, "AMAG Monthly Report," April 15, 1948. 73 Shrader, Withered Vine, 226.   74 Ibid., 227; Dwight Griswold, "AMAG Monthly Report," July 15, 1948, Entry 24, Box 21, GRDOS,  ROGTIA, 1947-1950, Quarterly Reports-AMAG-May 1948, RG 59, NACP.  75 Ibid.

The fighting had been costly for both sides. The DA lost approximately 3,600 killed, captured, and surrendered, and the GNA, 800 killed, 5,000 wounded, and 60 missing. 79 With its victory, the GNA gained mostly insignificant land to which it had to devote troops to prevent communist recapture. Additionally, since the borders were porous, the guerrillas maintained freedom of movement that the GNA could not affect.
Nevertheless, the victory displayed the value of advisors in planning and incorporating supporting arms such as artillery and airpower. Unfortunately, it also illustrated their continued inability to compel into action Greek leaders otherwise disposed to inaction and defensive measures. Only the relief of these leaders seemed to improve the situation, but this was an unwieldy method that took weeks to accomplish. 80 The GNA could not afford to waste time squabbling over personnel matters while concurrently trying to maintain the initiative during offensive operations.
In a clear attempt to encourage future aggressive action through positive reinforcement,

These reports and the succession of relatively successful GNA operations had inspired such optimism in U.S. circles that officials in Washington began inquiring whether assistance to Greece could be reduced by the end of 1948. 82 Since the Grammos operation did not destroy the defending DA force, however, Van Fleet and the new ambassador to Greece, Henry F. Grady, were forced to backpedal from earlier optimistic reports. 83 Moreover, the GNA's performance in the months following Grammos would lay bare weaknesses that advisors had been unable to fix.
Contemporary and official accounts of the advisory program generally give the impression that advisors had great impact on their Greek counterparts, and successfully instilled a spirit of aggressiveness, which was the overall intent of JUSMAPG since its inception. 84 Primary accounts of the time, however, contradict this assertion. The GNA had many methods to avoid aggressive action and responsibility by its individual commanders. One of these methods was the "double company," in which a commander would assign an objective to multiple battalions that would then cobble together a makeshift element under a commander from yet another battalion. 85 This phenomenon undermined unit integrity, unity of command, and unit interoperability training.
Additionally, it allowed the commanders to shirk responsibility since they could blame each other for any ensuing confusion in planning or execution. Clearly, the GNA improved its operational and tactical execution compared to the beginning of the war. In contrast to the spirited defense of Greece against the Italian invasion in 1940, however, the performance of the GNA was frustratingly apathetic, and the advisors were limited in 81 James

their ability to impart significant change due to entrenched culture and differences of opinion. 86   Frustration with the Greek conundrum was not limited to U.S. advisors in country. The State Department's Office of Near Eastern and African Affairs held the same view toward the Greek government and its lack of dedication to solving its own internal problems. In a memo from its chief, Joseph Satterthwaite, to the Under Secretary of State, he noted the important message that the United States sent to other nations through the assistance it provided Greece and Turkey. Despite this assistance, however, he lamented the "Greek political leaders [who] frequently seem more concerned with their own narrow party ambitions than with the urgent necessity of working together. .
.[to advance] the welfare of the Greek people as a whole." 87 The crisis did not unite Greek political rivals as closely as one might have hoped.
Another difficult problem was Greece's dependency on the United States to solve its economic and military woes. As noted by previous observers such as Griswold, the abundance of U.S. aid led "Greek political leaders to expend all their energies on attempts to increase the amount of aid from the United States, instead of on concentrated efforts to make the most effective use of available resources." 88 Moreover, the tendency of Greek leaders to blame the United States for providing insufficient aid risked making the Greek people believe that they could not overcome the Communists. 89 Washington reflected this sentiment in National Security Council (NSC) 5 in January 1948, stating, "the armed forces of Greece, both military and police units are hampered in their effort to eliminate Communist guerrilla forces by lack of offensive spirit, by political interference, by disposition of units as static guard forces and by poor leadership, particularly in the 86 Under General Alexander Papagos, the Greek Army had humiliated an Italian invasion force in 1940. This victory necessitated the German invasion to rescue the pride of their Italian allies.

89 Ibid. lower echelons." 90 Later, the NSC recommended insisting that the Greek government address its shortfalls "as a condition for the continuance of the assistance program." 91   Yet, in the next paragraphs it recommended that additional funds be appropriated for addressing the Greek problem. 92 This contradiction exposed the seemingly unavoidable conflict of interest wherein it was to the Greek nationalists' advantage to maintain at least a smoldering security problem if that meant continued U.S. support. In an attempt to conclude the civil war before December 1948, the GNA maintained its pressure on the DA, whose forces had shifted to Vitsi. On 30 August 1948, the GNA launched a clearing operation against a force of 6,000 to 7,500 guerrillas, many of whom had moved through Albania and Yugoslavia back into Greece. 94 The same systemic problems plagued the GNA in addition to general fatigue following two and a half months of sustained operations. The result was a lackluster effort on the part of the GNA that saw whatever small gains it made reversed by guerrilla counterattacks. 95 Van
Fleet lamented the GNA's poor performance in a message to Army G-3, citing "leadership, poor morale, and Communist influence in ranks." 96 The morale boost and lessons learned that the GNA should have gained from the Grammos operation did not 90 "Report to the National Security Council by the Executive Secretary of the Council (Souers), NSC  5," January 6, 1948, DOS, FRUS, 1948, Eastern Europe; Soviet Union, 4:3.  91 Ibid., 4:6. 92 Ibid. 93 General McClellan was of course relieved by President Abraham Lincoln in no small part for his reluctance to employ the Army of the Potomac aggressively and continuously requested more troops despite outnumbering the Confederate armies. 94 James Van Fleet, "Message Love 1827 JUSMAPG to CSGPO," September 20, 1948, Entry 147,  Box 114, JUSMAGG, USASG, AGS, CFU, Incoming and Outgoing Messages 1947-52, RG 334, NACP.  95 Ibid.

As fall dragged on, the Vitsi operation stalled. The longer it remained static, the greater the likelihood that the war would not be decided until spring 1949 at the earliest. This delay led Van Fleet to reassess what Greece required to prevail in its struggle against communist takeover. His recommendations belied his previous arguments that the Greeks did not need more men and firepower and brought him into conflict with the newly appointed U.S. ambassador to Greece.
After nearly a year that had seen Greece without an official U.S. ambassador, Henry F. Grady took up the post and assumed complete control over all aid and diplomatic functions. Griswold thereafter resigned after more than a year of service as the head of AMAG. In Paul Braim's account of Van Fleet's relationship with Ambassador Grady, he presents Grady as disrespectful of Van Fleet and of the military in general. 97   Grady, in his memoirs, indicates no ill feeling toward Van Fleet besides disagreement on two significant issues. 98 The first was the Greek political crisis at the end of 1948.
The coalition government that the United States and Great Britain had helped establish in 1947 was coming apart, and the king was considering appointing General Papagos as emergency dictator much like his brother did with Metaxas in 1936. Papagos' name was already under consideration by the U.S. and British missions to replace General Yiadzis as chief of the Greek General Staff because it was becoming increasingly obvious that the country required a more forceful senior military commander. On this issue, opinions among senior U.S. civilian and military personnel in Greece differed. 99   Van Fleet had established strong rapport with the royal family, and he already saw Papagos as the Greek leader most capable of leading the country through the current 97 Braim, Will to Win, 164.
98 In Grady's memoirs, Van Fleet is only mentioned on two pages. Henry Francis Grady, The Memoirs of Ambassador Henry F. Grady: From the Great War to the Cold War, ed. John T. McNay (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 2009), 143, 147.  99 Ibid., 142-44. Jones, New Kind of War, 194-96.  crisis. Grady, acting from a position of lesser influence with the king, argued that a dictatorship under Papagos would have "dire consequences" for the war effort and would not be keeping with the democratic principles that U.S. support to Greece was intended to promote. 100 Not only would there have been a loss of popular support, but it also would News of Papagos's return to active duty and assumption of command was greeted positively by all friendly parties, including Van Fleet, who lauded his commitment to "successfully terminate operations this year

Moreover, Papagos's main value was not in his operational or tactical acumen, but in his ability to push his leaders to act and to identify and relieve incapable commanders. With his authority, Papagos could act quickly on personnel matters that Van Fleet had previously had to painstakingly push through a byzantine approval process. 104   Even the removal of ineffective officers was no panacea, however. For example, following the replacement of the B Corps commander in early 1949, the senior advisor reported, "really, from an operational standpoint, except for planning, there is less going on now than there was before the change in command, if that is possible. A lot is said of patrolling, but results do not show that it is aggressive or accomplishing a great deal." 105   Unfortunately for the GNA and its leadership, they faced a spirited, resourceful, and cunning enemy in the DA forces. Fortunately, however, this motivation could only carry the communists so far as the odds were stacked against them from the outset and only became worse due to decisions made by their own leadership.
Successful insurgent movements often follow a recognizable pattern of military escalation. This escalation begins with small-scale attacks that bring support either 104 Jones, New Kind of War, 194-97.

The KKE also fell victim to internal squabbling among the communist nations to whom they looked for support. In June 1948, Stalin ejected Marshal Josip Tito's Yugoslavia from the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) because Tito did not want to subjugate his country to Moscow. 110 Within the KKE, Markos, the military commander, was pro-Yugoslavia, if only from the pragmatic standpoint that nearly all his materiel aid came from Yugoslavia. Zachariades, the KKE political leader, remained staunchly pro-Soviet. When Tito and Stalin parted ways, Zachariades used his influence to oust Markos and takeover the KKE. 111 At the time, Markos was considering returning the DA to guerrilla warfare to reduce the number of casualties it was suffering. With his ouster at the end of 1948, the KKE's military strategy remained unchanged. This factor, combined with the GNA's ten-to-one advantage in manpower and its supporting arms capabilities that the DA did not have meant that the Communists' fate was sealed.
Moreover, Zachariades's pro-Soviet stance alienated the only significant source of support, Marshal Tito, who parted ways with the Greek Communists and sealed the Yugoslavian border with Greece in July 1949. 112   The KKE's decision to transition to conventional operations prematurely drained the communist forces at a rapid rate, especially in attacks on fortified GNA positions. The Communists also suffered from recruiting problems, and often forced into service Greek peasants. Serving against their will, these Greeks were often ineffective or would desert, thus requiring additional effort spent recruiting and training. From January 1948 to August 1949, DA casualties were 61,985, compared to GNA casualties of 34,200. 113   Considering that the GNA had approximately 265,000 personnel under arms, plus a 110 The Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) was the Soviet-dominated alliance of communist parties following The Second World War intended to unite all Communist countries under the same ideology and goals.

sizeable reserve, compared to the DA's peak strength of 25,000, meant the DA could not sustain these losses. 114   Finally, the Communists were never able to gather large numbers of the Greek population to their cause. Any marriage of convenience or support the Communists enjoyed during The Second World War quickly evaporated in the postwar period.
Additionally, the KKE promised certain contested parts of Greece to Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria in exchange for their support. Even the Greek peasants were proud of their nationality and did not support their country's sale for the communist cause. The Greek government also benefitted from a Greek polity that, while politically divided among various parties, was relatively free of ethnic divisions. The peasants of the mountain areas were just as likely to be anti-communist as anti-nationalist government.
Thus, the Communists found themselves hard pressed to find any true support among the population. 115
The U.S. honeymoon over Papagos's appointment was short lived. Despite his promise for aggressive action and the U.S. hope that he would quickly put the already sizeable and well-equipped GNA to good use, one of Papagos's first actions was to issue a political curveball to Ambassador Grady, albeit one perfectly familiar from prior American experience in Greece. At a Greek War Minister meeting on 5 February 1949 billed as "announcements by the Commander-in-Chief," General Papagos used the forum to present a dire picture of the fight against the Communists and insist on a GNA increase of over 100,000 troops to a grand total of 250,000. 116 Papagos also threatened to resign if his request was not met. Grady and Van Fleet had already clashed over the issue of providing even greater support to the Greeks, with Van Fleet presiding over a volte-face from his previous stance on the needs of the Greek Army.

Fortunately for the GNA, Zachariades's emphasis on conventional operations, Markos's relief, and a reduction in external support made the communist situation that much more untenable. To its credit, the GNA also began a systematic clearing of communist pockets in southern and central Greece with the intent of pushing all enemy forces into one location in the north where they could finally be destroyed. For the first quarter of 1949, the GNA was winning the war of attrition as DA casualties reached 12,240 compared to the GNA's 4,086. 129 Although the DA had been capable of replacing casualties throughout 1948, continuing casualties and desertions and the slowly shrinking area it controlled were beginning to affect its ability to maintain its strength. From a height of 26,000 in 1948, the DA had declined to 19,450 and was trending downward. 130   The Royal Hellenic Air Force also had been playing an increasing role in combat operations. Having begun as a fledgling force of a few leftover Spitfires, it had added transport planes and Navy Helldivers before the final offensives of summer 1949. These platforms allowed the RHAF to air resupply remote units and conduct close air support, medical evacuation, interdiction, and observation. In contrast, the DA had none of these capabilities, which put it at an even greater disadvantage. 131 Additionally, the GNA had added howitzers, which were particularly useful in the mountain terrain, and 75 mm recoilless rifles, although the proper use of these weapons too often were disregarded by the Greeks, who preferred to use them however they saw fit, regardless of their effectiveness or the recommendations from their advisors. 132   Beginning in May 1949, the GNA launched the first of two operations to rid Greece finally of the communist menace. 130 JUSMAPG, "Brief History," 26.

The GNA, with JUSMAPG planning and advisory support, prepared Operation Torch to clear the guerrilla strongholds of Grammos and Vitsi in northern Greece that it failed to eradicate in 1948. The GNA arrayed four divisions numbering approximately 50,000 troops possessing close air support and two mountain artillery batteries against approximately 7,750 communist troops. 136 The DA forces, according to the official history, were "composed of a great percentage of women and abductees," and their fighting ability "was estimated to be poor." 137 Despite the element of surprise the GNA held and the uncharacteristically effective movement of forces, as much as 60 percent of the guerrillas escaped the envelopment and retreated into the neighboring communist countries. 138 The official history held that "the operations of the GNA Infantry Divisions during the Vitsi campaign were on the whole below the standards expected of infantry troops. . .too much dependence on air and artillery was displayed by infantry." 139   General Papagos, for his part, recognized that his army still needed much improvement in the same areas that Livesay and Griswold identified in 1947. 140   Fortunately, the communists had been decisively broken and scattered among the 133 U.S. Army, "JUSMAGG History," 35-36.   134 Ibid., 36.

neighboring communist countries, which were quick to publicly distance themselves from the Greek Communist movement. 141 Absent any significant source of support from their communist allies in the region and suffering from forced recruitment to replace losses, DA morale had plummeted in the summer of 1949. 142 These facts, combined with the loss of most of their war making materiel, resulted in a significant drop in communist activity in Greece. 143 The war was essentially over.
In the months following Torch, fear of a renewed communist guerrilla campaign subsided to the point where Ambassador Grady and JUSMAPG recommended a steady GNA demobilization to a more appropriate size for the remaining threat and a corresponding reduction in aid. The United States remained dedicated to intervention in Greece, however, with Van Fleet extolling its position in the eastern Mediterranean as "the keystone of the defense line from Western Europe to [the] Middle East." 144 This mindset took hold in Washington, and the United States found itself in a long-term commitment with Greece. During his last months there, Van Fleet toured the many battlefields and received praise for his contribution to the Greek victory. 145 Although the victory did not come as quickly as many would have liked, the impression seemed to be that adequate resources combined with the right U.S. personnel could assist other nations threatened by communism to achieve outcomes similar to those in Greece.

commitment to Greece that was unbounded in principle by virtue of being rooted in a policy of global anti-communism, but circumscribed in practice. Even so, the U.S.
investment required to defeat the communists in Greece far exceeded that of the communist nations to keep the resistance alive. 146 Without the large U.S. military assistance effort, the GNA would certainly have been less effective against the DA in all of its encounters. Lacking airpower and heavy artillery, and even accounting for the Communists' decision to conduct a more conventional campaign, the GNA would have suffered more casualties to achieve the same results. The Greek economy was incapable of maintaining an army of the GNA's size without U.S. assistance. Thus, the GNA would have fought the DA at much closer odds, which may not have been sufficient for outright victory. Furthermore, U.S. economic assistance helped improve the lives of average Greek peasants, thus improving overall loyalty to the elected government.
What, however, can the advisory effort claim specifically to have accomplished?
If a successful advisor is able to bend others' will to his way of doing business, then the advisory mission to Greece had a mixed record. U.S. advisors were in Greece to instill aggressiveness and improve training and execution in the Greek Army. Yet, at war's end, the JUSMAPG advisors concluded they had failed to significantly alter their counterparts' actions based on their advice. The advisors should have been motivated to show GNA improvement as a reflection of their own performance in reports. The inverse actually happened.
Greece offered favorable conditions for advisors. The Greek government was relatively stable, the language barrier was easily overcome, the opposing force made costly errors, and financial aid was readily available. To their credit, the Greeks requested and accepted the advisors at all levels, but whether commanders accepted their advice was more sporadic in practice. On a grand scale, the GNA relied heavily on operational 146 The JUSMAGG official expenditure at war's end was approximately $324 million, or $3.3 billion in today's dollars. It is impossible to know the amount of support given by communist states, but it was likely far less. At the time, Van Fleet estimated that the total U.S. expenditure was over a billion dollars, and that of the Soviets as not more than ten million.

Secretary Marshall ostensibly replaced Livesay with Van Fleet because Livesay lacked forcefulness when dealing with the GNA. The lackluster effort in Grammos in 1948, the subsequent stalemate in Vitsi, and the failed defenses of Naoussa and Karpenision nevertheless belied Van Fleet's reports of improved GNA performance.
Finally, the corps level advisory reports at the end of the war also contradicted much of the positive impact of the advisors' presence on the tactical and operational decisionmaking or execution of their counterparts. Ultimately, GNA numbers, equipment, training, and slightly improved battlefield performance proved sufficient to defeat the Communists and their panoply of errors.

With Japan's defeat in August 1945, Koreans rejoiced because that meant the departure of the despised Japanese who had occupied and colonized their land for forty years.

General Hodge was a proven combat commander during The Second World War, but he was unprepared for the complex political environment of post-liberation Korea. 8
Arriving in Korea one month behind the Soviets, Hodge began executing his orders based on the little guidance he had received. Historian Allen Millett writes that Hodge was to "disarm the Japanese, enforce the anticipated surrender terms, keep order, and await instructions on how to pass power to the Koreans." 9 A self-organized prospective Korean government in the U.S. zone, the People's Republic of Korea, presented itself to Hodge upon his arrival with the hope that he would accept it as the legitimate government. To its members' dismay, Hodge dismissed them since his mandate made his organization the sole executor of Korea's sovereignty. Since Koreans had not governed themselves in forty years, Hodge initially maintained Japanese administrators in their positions to allow time to train Korean replacements.

Conveniently divided by the 38th parallel, the two initial parties to the conflict were the North Korean Communists and the South Korean Nationalists. Both groups had emerged during the Japanese occupation, returned following the war, and established themselves in their respective zones. Coming to the rescue of their Korean Communist counterparts in November 1950 were the Chinese Communists fresh from their victory over Chiang Kai Shek's Chinese Nationalists.
The North Korean Communists came to power due to the direct intervention of the occupying Soviet forces. Although the Japanese had mostly dismantled the Korean communist movement during their occupation, the Soviets nurtured its reemergence following the Second World War and supported Kim Il Sung's rise to power. Kim's personal history is obscured by aggrandized state-directed biographical accounts of his heroism, wartime leadership, and devotion to country fabricated to justify his position as supreme ruler over the North Korean people. 14 Kim's actual story is that he spent much of his life in Manchuria and Russia, fought the Japanese before and during the Second World War, and ended the war as a captain in the Soviet Army. 15 The Soviets supported Kim's emerging totalitarian regime with advice and materiel that far outweighed what the United States provided to the South. As Allan Millett writes, the Soviets sent "as many as eight hundred advisers and administrative personnel" and supplied the NKPA with weapons to replace those seized from the Japanese. 16 As James Minnich writes, the NKPA "adopted much of the Soviets' military doctrine and tactics, incorporating combined arms operations and depending upon conventional lines of communication for 14 One among an ocean of blatant examples of state propaganda is an official DPRK history, Twenty-Year-Long Anti-Japanese Revolution Under the Red Sunrays, written by Kim Il-Sung and other North Korean leaders, in which Kim is continually referred to as "The Great Leader."

Unlike the Soviet occupation, American forces quashed attempts at Korean selfgovernance until the appropriate parties could settle the Korea question. The South faced a more diverse group of potential leaders across the political spectrum, but Syngman Rhee emerged as the dominant figure during the period of U.S. military rule. In contrast to the thirty-three year old Kim, Rhee was in his seventies and had spent much of his life in the United States. Politically, he was an autocratic nationalist who was often compared to Chiang Kai Shek, a figure of similarly autocratic bent whose personal corruption did not disqualify him as an American client. Rhee also was a constant irritant for U.S.
leaders at all levels. 21 Throughout the U.S. trusteeship, he campaigned against the U.S.
occupation of Korea and never hesitated to profit politically from USAMGIK's unpopularity. 22 When the United States began withdrawing troops from Korea in 1948, however, Rhee's attitude shifted toward insisting that the forces remain in Korea to support his weak regime.
23
China's relationship with the United States evolved alongside that of Korea's and ultimately ended in a costly war for both sides. Under such notable generals as Joseph Stilwell, Albert Wedemeyer, and George Marshall, the United States provided advice and $1 billion in military aid to Nationalist China to maintain anti-communist Chiang Kai Shek's government in power. 
24
advisors as Chiang's intransigence, poor decision making, and rampant government corruption negated any positive impact the advisors might have hoped for. Despite U.S.
efforts to appear neutral and negotiate a mutual power-sharing agreement, these efforts failed, and the United States appeared instead to be the benefactors of the corrupt, unpopular, losing side. The subsequent establishment of the People's Republic of China (PRC) ultimately was a greater blow to the Truman administration and U.S. Far East policy than some estimates had presumed. In addition to the wasted investment in Chiang's lost cause, aid to the Nationalists alienated Mao's government to the point that the United States would be fighting it directly only a year after the PRC's founding.
Domestically, the perception that the United States had lost China to communism plagued future administrations and called into question the effectiveness of military aid alone as a tool of containment.
The Korean peninsula occupies an unfortunate crossroads of the great power struggles between China, Japan, and Russia with the United States inheriting Japan's role in 1945. Korea's terrain is rugged and mountainous, particularly in the North, which led the Japanese to concentrate industrial and hydroelectric productivity there while agriculture dominated in the South. The ostensibly temporary split at the 38th parallel, described by Edgar Kennedy "as one of the worst ever devised . . . often divid

Since the Koreans had not been responsible for policing themselves during the Japanese occupation, U.S. leaders identified a national police force as the first critical security need for the U.S. zone. Thus, the Korean National Police (KNP) was created in advance of the ROKA. USAMGIK was responsible for recruiting, organizing, and training these initial peace officers, but the effort received only a handful of advisors.
Washington had little interest in bankrolling a Korean security apparatus. When General Douglas MacArthur requested permission to transfer surplus armaments and equipment to the 25,000 man KNP, the War Department approved the request only if the Koreans returned them after use, purchased them, or transferred them in some way once the issue of Korean unification was settled. 33 While the United States was readily assisting other countries to rebuild and rearm to resist communism, this treatment of the Koreans stood in stark contrast. Despite his support in securing the armament for the Koreans, MacArthur quickly soured on Korea, however. In a December 1945 memo to the JCS, he recommended mutually withdrawing forces with the Russians and leaving Korea "to its own devices and an inevitable internal upheaval for its self-purification." 34   Even though some in Washington suspected as early as October 1945 that the 38th parallel was likely to become a permanent line of separation, American leaders hoped that a unified Korea and a national army could be established. 35 A separate army for the South would only further divide the Koreans, but three factors contributed to the need for the immediate establishment of an additional security force in the U.S. zone.
First, civil unrest was increasing due to the deteriorating economic and uncertain political situation. Second, General Hodge's combat forces were ill-suited for maintaining the peace in a foreign land that could not be treated as if it were a defeated enemy. Third, intelligence indicated that the Soviets had already begun establishing armed forces in their zone. 36   33 "The Joint Chiefs of Staff to General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, at Tokyo," telegram, January 9, 1946, DOS, FRUS, Diplomatic

Provide adequate means at the disposal of the Head of the Korean Government to assist the existing Bureau of Police in Maintenance of Law, Order and internal security. 37   Hodge's staff determined that the South needed a 45,000-man army to maintain its security. The idea of distinct military services for the U.S. zone met with resistance in Washington, however, and the War Department only approved a 25,000-man force.
Furthermore, the Koreans received neither U.S. military aid nor surplus equipment for this new organization. This limitation would have drastic consequences on the speed at which the ROKA would come to exist and the measures its members took to provide for their families on the meager salary the Korean economy could provide. Political sensitivity toward the Soviets also prevented naming this organization a defense force;
USAMGIK instead designated it the Korean Constabulary. 38   USAMGIK planned to recruit and train nine regiments, one for each of the  , 1951-1965, RG 319, NACP,  3.  38 Soviet objections to terms such as "Department of National Defense" led General Hodge to change the name to "Department of Internal Security."

and "headlight" would be translated as "gun that shoots very fast" and "the rice bowl with a candle on a truck." 47 A different interpreter might invent a different phrase for the same thing. It was not until 1950 that a group of Korean military officers and translators completed a Korean dictionary of U.S. military terms. Most, if not all, copies of this dictionary were lost during the NKPA invasion. 48   Korean culture proved even more difficult to overcome. Despite Korean animosity toward the Japanese, Korean military leaders nevertheless adopted their harsh treatment toward subordinates and civilians. U.S. advisors recommended less brutal methods, but this behavior continued throughout the advisory mission and resulted in at least one mutiny. 49 The advisors also had to deal with the delicate aspect of "face" in Korean culture. 50 The ignorant or uncaring American might evoke an unwanted negative response from a counterpart or Korean civilians because of a failure to understand or respect public honor. Relationships thus violated were virtually impossible to repair. The quality of individuals assigned to Korea duty likely exacerbated this problem. General
Hodge struggled with his soldiers' conduct throughout his three-year tour as seen in a 3

The advisors also faced the miniscule funding the constabulary received. Since the weak Korean economy provided the constabulary's entire budget, food and wages were insufficient to support its members. As a result, pilferage, personal business use of military equipment, and black marketeering were important sources of income for the soldiers and a serious concern for the Americans. This behavior-a feature of many postwar occupations before and since-became embedded in the fabric of daily life and created a rift with the Americans, who naturally began to look down on the men they were to train, advise, and work alongside. Unfortunately, to maintain a reasonable working relationship and a force that did not splinter because of a lack of ability to support itself, advisors did not have much choice but to tolerate these activities.
Growth of the constabulary was anemic. By the end of 1946, it numbered only 5,000 personnel, yet it was employed immediately. 52 The division of Korea continued to fall harder on the South as the North had a more balanced economy. 53 In August 1946
General Hodge directed the KNP to collect rice from farmers to prevent a shortage and widespread hunger. This act angered the farmers, since it reminded them of Japanese behavior, and resulted in the Autumn Harvest Uprising of September and October 1946 that was in protest against the U.S. actions and occupation. In response to these events, USAMGIK relied on a patchwork of KNP, constabulary, and U.S. forces that proved inadequate for the task. Korean security forces suffered as many as 300 casualties while killing or wounding over 600 demonstrators and arresting over 5,000. 54 Further uprisings 51   54 Millett, War for

In March 1948 the Central Intelligence Agency stressed Korea's importance, stating that its loss to the Soviet sphere would "have a seriously adverse political and psychological impact throughout the already unstable Far East" and "furnish an important Soviet position threatening both Japan and the North China coast." 61 In April 1948 the National Security Council laid out its position on Korea in NSC 8 based on the principles of independence and self-determination while promising U.S. economic assistance toward Korean economic stability. 62 It assessed that the NKPA numbered 125,000 personnel and that the South Korean security establishment was incapable of defending itself against this force. 63 Despite this realization, the NSC recommended completely withdrawing U.S. forces from Korea and leaving only an advisory mission capable of preparing the South Koreans to protect "the security of South Korea against any but an overt act of aggression by North Korean or other forces." 64 The problem with this statement is that it did not address the U.S. reaction if North Korea did invade. Since Washington did not know the answer to this question, neither did the advisors who would be the only U.S. military personnel in Korea fourteen months later.
In accordance with UN oversight of the Korean problem, South Korea held elections on 10 May 1948 to determine the Korean National Assembly. It subsequently elected Syngman Rhee as the first president of the Republic of Korea, and he took the oath of office on 24 July 1948. Meanwhile, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) declared itself established on 9 September 1948 with Kim Il Sung as its premier.
By this point, the difference in the support given to each side by their respective benefactors was stark. In the North, the Soviets had established a strong, pro-Soviet totalitarian dictator; recruited, trained, and equipped an effective army capable of offensive operations; and left behind an advisory group of 550 personnel. 
65
Despite this realization, the United States, fearful that an overt military buildup in the South would provoke a conflict, rather than deter one, did little besides try to maintain order and provide economic aid in the South. Meanwhile, one of the critical requirements for exit-an effective South Korean military-was left to a grossly inadequate advisory effort for three years.
By early 1948 Washington finally had supported an increase in the constabulary to  66 The constabulary also began receiving surplus American armament including small arms, light artillery, M-24 light tanks, and armored cars. 67 The additional materiel and manpower were still insufficient compared to the Soviet arming of the North. For example, each constabulary regiment of 2,000 personnel still only had an advisory detachment of one or two officers and three to four enlisted men headed by a captain or first lieutenant. 68 Nevertheless, enough progress had been made up to this point for the constabulary to successfully tackle its next test.
The first signs of open communist rebellion occurred on the island of Cheju Do off Korea's southern coast in April 1948. 69 The island's governor was corrupt, the KNP and constabulary units on the island were at odds, and Communists had infiltrated the constabulary regiment. When discontented islanders launched attacks on government and police facilities, the constabulary forces did not reinforce the government, and some even joined the rebels. 70 Constabulary reinforcements from the mainland restored order and scattered the rebels, but the event highlighted the tenuous nature of the constabulary's loyalty. This incident resulted in a concerted effort to purge the constabulary of leftist elements and provided valuable real-world experience to the constabulary troops and its advisors. 66 This handbook began under General Roberts. His successors continued to revise it.

The next test took place on the Yosu peninsula in southern Korea on 19 October 1948. 71 The enlisted leadership of the ROKA 14th Regiment contained many communist sympathizers. Believing they could ignite a Communist rebellion in the South, the Communist cell took over the regimental headquarters, armed up to two thousand insurgents who rallied to their cause, seized the towns of Yosu and Sunchon forty miles to the north, and initiated a reign of terror against government personnel. 72 This situation was the first major emergency for Rhee's government and had to be addressed immediately and decisively. General Roberts sent Captain Hausman to be the senior advisor to a collection of Korean colonels and lieutenant colonels overseeing the employment of eleven battalions drawn from six different regiments. 73 With Hausman and the advisors providing the planning and staff expertise, the constabulary managed to break the traitors' hold on the area.
The performance of the constabulary troops during these two uprisings displayed that individual soldiers were willing to fight. Millett recounts the story of Army Lieutenant Robert Shackleton, who was the advisor to the ROKA 1st Reconnaissance
Troop. His unit led the decisive counterattack at Yosu, suffered twenty-five percent casualties, and, according to Shackleton, fought bravely. 74 Despite the individual bravery exhibited by the constabulary soldiers, their leaders exhibited significant shortcomings in tactical planning and execution. As historian Bryan Gibby points out, command and control, lateral communications, and lack of familiarity with supporting arms such as mortars and machine guns hampered the ROKA counterattack. 75 Additionally, the two sides were evenly matched in weaponry-possessing only individual small arms. It took the heavier armament of the reconnaissance troop, which was the only constabulary unit 71 The Yosu peninsula extends south with Sunchon at its northern terminus. See Figure

These uprisings highlighted the U.S. failure to appreciate that its position in Korea would not improve by continuing to neglect a security force consistent with the requirement of a permanently independent South, especially considering the imminent departure of all U.S. forces. Although General Hodge had requested a larger Korean army from the outset, the Department of State elevated the issue to a level that initiated action, pointing "out that while the Department of the Army was proceeding with plans for increasing the Korean constabulary to a strength of 50,000 men it was placing the equipping of such a force at such a low level of priority there was danger that an adequate force could not be trained and equipped in the time available [prior to the U.S. departure]." 77 Understandably, the United States had held out hope for an acceptable settlement leading to unification, but as this became increasingly unlikely through 1947, U.S. leaders failed to commit to Korea as a bastion against its communist neighbors.  78 Domestic budgetary considerations played a larger role than the strategic communist threat, however, as an arbitrary cap determined how much 76 Gibby, Will to Win, 57.

enlisted. 85 This hasty growth had a negative effect on the training and readiness of the ROKA just as combat actions against the Communists were increasing. On an inspection tour of the ROKA units in the summer of 1949, General Roberts found equipment in poor states of repair, unit leadership that was ignorant of the fundamentals of infantry tactics, and units that had accomplished little training in the previous six months due to constant anti-insurgent operations. 86 Leaders at all levels advanced quickly through the ranks to assume positions for which they were unprepared.

Kim Il Sung had been campaigning in Moscow and Beijing since at least 1949 for support to intensify offensive action against the South. Stalin rejected him in September 1949 because U.S. forces remained in the South, Mao and his Chinese Communists were still fighting their civil war, and the North's army could not defeat the South's rapidly. 98   By 1950, however, the geopolitical landscape had changed: U.S. forces had departed Korea, many of the battle-hardened North Koreans lent to Mao had returned and created new NKPA divisions, Mao's Communists were victorious and motivated, and the materiel disparity between North and South had only increased.

The materiel disparity on the eve of war between North and South was heavily weighted in favor of the NKPA, although strictly speaking the numbers of security forces in the two halves of Korea were roughly equal, at about 100,000. KMAG estimated the NKPA possessed 65 heavy T-34 tanks and 296 pieces of towed and self-propelled artillery. 109 The real number of tanks was probably closer to 150, although the official South Korean history claims 242. 110 Additionally, the North Korean air force numbered between 100 and 200 propeller-driven attack planes while South Korea's air force was virtually nonexistent. Arrayed against the North's force, the ROKA had 27 light tanks, 91 short-range mountain howitzers, and 22 training aircraft. 111 Furthermore, the NKPA outranged the ROKA artillery by 4000 meters or more and had three times the artillery in their divisions. 112 Only one troop of the ROKA 1st Cavalry Regiment had armored vehicles-the other two troops had horses. 113
WAR COMES TO SOUTH KOREA There simply had been little planning for an invasion apart from the general concept of operations that KMAG had worked out with the ROKA. 116 The only plan that had been fleshed out in detail was Operation CRULLER, which was the emergency evacuation plan for the American mission and KMAG. After some hesitation, Ambassador Muccio directed the evacuation of dependents and most of the staff, but KMAG's responsibilities remained unclear. 117 Advisors in the Ongjin peninsula, for example, were evacuated by air while their ROKA unit made its way to port facilities to 114 "The Ambassador in Korea

four infantry divisions, one armored brigade, and one armored regiment. Opposite them were two of the best ROKA divisions, the 1st and the 7th, each with two regiments on the parallel and one in reserve. As the NKPA began to gain ground despite significant casualties, the weaknesses in the lack of contingency planning became apparent. The strong point defense that the ROKA and KMAG had worked out did not make provisions for a planned withdrawal if the ROKA could not hold their assigned defensive positions.
Moreover, NKPA advances in the 7th's sector risked cutting off the 1st from its line of retreat. Even though these two organizations fought bravely, their armaments simply could not stop the NKPA tanks. 118 Sawyer and Hermes, KMAG in Peace and War, 114-15.
119 Ibid., 115-16. Chae ignored these warnings and ordered the counterattack. As might be expected, the counterattack failed due to poor coordination and insufficient forces. A more senior U.S.
personality might have been more persuasive and thus realized a more effective counterattack, although the ROKA still had no effective way of stopping NKPA armor. 120   As observed by Major Richard Crawford, the assistant advisor to the Korean Army Corps of Engineers, "the sight of tanks advancing against South Korean troops threw them into a state of complete panic." 121 Crawford further notes his failure to provide any training in anti-tank engineering tactics to his unit before the invasion. 122   The ROKA engineers nevertheless demonstrated the ability to learn while displaying bravery and ingenuity in the days that followed. 127 Ibid., 7.

38th parallel. 129 The Security Council followed up with another resolution on 27 June recommending that "the Members of the United Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area." 130   Having driven back toward the advancing enemy that was then on the outskirts of Seoul, Wright's group awaited instructions and learned that MacArthur was sending a survey team to facilitate U.S. intervention. In the early morning hours of 28 June, the ROKA decided to shift its HQ south of the Han River. KMAG learned of this move afterward and also of the ROKA decision to blow up all of the bridges across the Han, which ROKA engineers carried out while people and vehicles were still crossing. Aside from the 500-800 soldiers and civilians who perished in the blasts, this foolish tactical move was operationally devastating since the remains of four ROKA divisions were still making their way through Seoul to reestablish a defensive line south of the Han. The destruction of the bridges meant the ROKA had to abandon all of its heavy equipment and artillery, which of course fell into the NKPA's hands. Seoul fell to the NKPA on 28
June leaving ROKA survivors to straggle across the Han any way they could. Out of the 98,000 troops the ROKA began with on 25 June, it could account for only 54,000 at the beginning of July. 131   The remaining 130 KMAG members also found themselves on the wrong side of the Han and had to search for a ferry crossing. They eventually walked much of the way to Suwon where they linked back up with the ROKA HQ. Once in Suwon, KMAG learned that it now worked for MacArthur's survey team, designated Advance Command and Liaison Group in Korea (ADCOM). Due to the circumstances and lack of guidance, KMAG's main effort during the initial critical hours became its own survival, not helping 129 The Soviet Union was boycotting the UN Security Council since China's member was from Nationalist, not Communist, China. Richard Thornton argues that Stalin preferred a collective defense action under the United Nations versus a declaration of war from the United States since the former gave him greater flexibility under his treaty obligations.

the ROKA survive. This confusion contributed to the premature destruction of the Han River bridge, an ill-advised counterattack against the enemy's strongest forces, and loss of situational awareness of ROKA forces. KMAG's requirement to focus the bulk of its effort on the evacuation, lack of direction in the event of invasion, and the absence of its commander hurt its ability to integrate into the ROKA decision-making and perhaps affect the outcome of these events.

the advisory effort since it allowed MacArthur's experienced staff to make up for the ROKA that had shown a willingness to fight but lacked conventional war experience. On 25 July, Brigadier General Francis Farrell assumed command of KMAG, once again giving it the influence that a general officer could provide.
The first six weeks of the invasion saw the NKPA push aside U.S. forces in the same manner as the ROKA forces that many would later denigrate. The difference was that U.S. forces had the benefit of better coordination with their supporting arms and a clearer idea of the enemy conditions than the ROKA had on 25 June. By the end of its fifteenth day of fighting, General Dean's 24th Infantry Division could only account for 8,660 of its 15,965 assigned personnel; it had lost a division's worth of equipment, 100 miles of ground, and its division commander-who was captured-to the NKPA. 139   Fortunately for the UN command, attrition also was taking its toll on the NKPA, and its supply lines were stretching longer and longer and were susceptible to air attack. By
August 1950, with reinforcements pouring in and frantic recruiting by the ROKA, Walker's command finally managed to halt the NKPA advance around Pusan.
With the entry of U.S. forces into the war and both KMAG and the ROKA falling under U.S. command and control, KMAG could focus on its two most important missions:
advising and rebuilding the ROKA. To accomplish the former, KMAG integrated advisors into each division staff to improve staff functions and communication with other units.
Advisors in the field coordinated with U.S. supporting arms to provide close air support and artillery fires to ROKA units to help even the playing field against the NKPA units they faced. Equally as important, KMAG assisted in a massive, rapid ROKA expansion. These recruits were critical to shoring up the five ROKA divisions that remained as they took up positions along the northern line of the Pusan Perimeter. Historian T. R.
Fehrenbach credits the ROKA for having caused most of the NKPA's 60,000 casualties during its retreat toward Pusan. Kim's promise of a seven-day war had long since passed its mark. 141 With their backs to the sea and finally accompanied by adequate fire support and Truman and others tended to view Greece and Korea as similar situations. . . . The ultimate long term "solution" to the Korean problem, like that of 141 Fehrenbach, This Kind of War, 113. 142 Ridgway took command after Walker's death in a jeep accident in December 1953. 143 Van Fleet relieved Ridgway, who in turn relieved MacArthur.
Greece, was the creation of a reliable indigenous army. Van Fleet had been almost miraculously successful in Greece. Even though he had never set foot in the Far East, perhaps he could repeat the near miracle in Korea. 144   Although at least some of this praise was overblown given the Greek contribution to its own defense, Van Fleet did recognize the potential in the individual Korean soldier, and his efforts to bring this potential out would have an enormous impact on the ROKA's fighting ability.
Compared to their U.S. counterparts, the ROKA divisions were smaller, had only one battalion of artillery versus four, and were manned with a high percentage of inexperienced personnel, including officers. 145 Despite these knowable characteristics, the ROKA divisions were nevertheless assigned the same length of front as U.S. divisions. The Chinese excelled at infiltration and finding weak spots in the line. They knew from fighting American and ROKA divisions which one had greater firepower, so they chose to attack the latter. 146 It also did not help that ROKA soldiers seemed to have an inherent fear of Chinese forces. 147 These characteristics resulted in a series of disastrous retreats beginning with the Chinese offensive at the Yalu and continuing into 1951 until the front stabilized.
This problem became a catch-22 since the ROKA would retreat in the face of concentrated Chinese attacks, abandoning equipment and vehicles along the way. When the Koreans would request more artillery to aid in defense, U.S. commanders would respond that the Koreans first needed to display better leadership and training.

Stalemate at the truce negotiations over the treatment of prisoners of war (POWs) led to Chinese offensives in 1952 and 1953 to force a settlement by increasing the UN costs of continuing the conflict. The Chinese assembled their largest offensive to date in July 1953 with some of the heaviest fighting near Kumsong to reduce a salient held by the ROKA II Corps. Despite receiving nearly 400,000 rounds of artillery and suffering 30,000 casualties, the ROKA line cracked but ultimately held and inflicted over 70,000 casualties for the month. 155 A signed armistice soon followed. 151 Gibby, Will to Win, 185.   152 Ibid., 196.   153 Ibid., 200. 154 Hausrath, Problems, 28. 155 Walter G.

hesitancy to commit early to a fully-realized defense of an independent South Korea seems incredibly foolish. At the time, however, aid to China had failed to sustain U.S. policy goals there and thus portended a similar outcome in Korea. Additionally, General Roberts's optimism and intelligence reports that downplayed the likelihood of invasion gave the impression that South Korea was in a good position despite the minimal U.S. support it had
received. An advisory effort should nevertheless have the complementary military aid to counter the most likely threat. In the Korean case, the United States deemed until too late that the threat resided in the realm of subversion, internal security, and insurgency. This basic strategic miscalculation limited funding and manpower throughout the majority of KMAG's pre-war effort, during which the ROKA showed it was indeed capable of winning an insurgency and defending itself against small-scale border skirmishes. Once large-scale conventional war came to Korea in 1950, however, the two main reasons for employing advisors-cost effectiveness and escalation management-were no longer relevant. Even so, KMAG helped to keep the Koreans in the initial fight during a period when the war might well have been lost outright and helped to build a South Korean Army that could hold its place alongside the UN forces that were required to defend against the huge Chinese armies that eventually intervened to save the North from its own defeat.
Particularly during the initial North advance, the Korean War was a close-run affair.
In the final analysis, South Korea survived because its soldiers were willing to fight for their country in conditions more desperate than American policy was prepared to anticipate. Even so, it would be naïve to imagine that the knowledge, encouragement, and leadership by example afforded by American military advisors, however inadequate they may appear in relation to the ultimate challenge posed by the North, made no difference to the outcome. 
When Admiral George Dewey destroyed the Spanish Fleet in Manila Bay in 1898, the United States inherited a Philippines in upheaval. Three hundred years of a plantation-based economy under Spanish rule had given way to revolt beginning in 1896.
The revolt continued under American rule, and the U.S. Army finally suppressed it in 1902. This victory gave the United States total control over the Philippines' domestic and foreign affairs. In an effort to bring American enlightenment to the islands, the United States established schools, public health services, and the foundation for a prosperous economy. Liberation by the United States unfortunately did not result in a better quality of life for most of the population. Landowners who were newly enlightened by capitalism tried to squeeze more and more of the crop out of their tenant farmers. As Huk revolutionary leader Luis Taruc writes, "when the Americans came they made boasts about having brought democracy to the Philippines, but the feudal agrarian system was preserved intact."

The two sides to the eventual Huk Rebellion were the U.S.-recognized Philippine government and the Hukbalahaps of central Luzon. Key members of the former were the elite landowners, the small middle class, and peasants who were unwilling to take up arms against the government. Hukbalahap roots rested in the pre-war discontent with deteriorating conditions for a large percentage of the population. The Japanese occupation allowed them to become a formidable and motivated fighting force.
In response to the Japanese aggression, Filipino Communists dedicated themselves to resisting the invaders. Their apparent commitment to country contrasted sharply with that of the Quezon government, which fled into exile, and with the senior American representative General Douglas MacArthur's relocation to Australia.
Following some early small-scale successes against the Japanese, the Communists established the Hukbalahaps as their armed resistance wing and named Luis Taruc, a Socialist Party leader and staunch peasant supporter, as its commander. 8
United States Army Forces in the Far East (USAFFE) formed other guerrilla efforts consisting of Filipinos and U.S. soldiers who had evaded Japanese capture. Their attempts to coordinate resistance efforts with the Huks were generally fruitless-and 7 Kerkvliet, Huk Rebellion, 56-57.
8 Greenberg, Hukbalahap Insurrection, 
13-16.
Since there was little U.S. doctrine for guerrilla warfare, the Huks turned to
Communist Chinese writings to learn how to organize and fight. Without outside support, however, the Huks lacked the armament, numbers, training, and mobility to defeat the Japanese. Furthermore, MacArthur had ordered the U.S.-led guerrilla groups to avoid armed conflict and focus instead on gathering intelligence for an eventual U.S. operation to liberate the Philippines by conventional invasion rather than guerrilla tactics. 10 Thus, the Huks spent the majority of their time before 1945 consolidating their political position, which led to occasional armed clashes with USAFFE guerrilla forces that were wary of Philippine Communist ambitions.
The Armed Forces of the Philippines consisted of the Philippine Army (PA), Philippine Navy (PN), and the Philippine Air Force (PAF). Before 1949, the Philippine Constabulary (PC) stood apart from the AFP under the Department of the Interior as a paramilitary national police force. 11 The PC and PA entered the Second World War with distinct missions: the constabulary was responsible for state policing and the Army was 9 Smith, Hukbalahap Insurgency, 35; Greenberg, Hukbalahap Insurrection, 18-20.
10 Smith, Hukbalahap Insurgency,., 42-43. 11 The constabulary was called the Military Police Command (MPC) from 1945 to 1948, but for consistency, this chapter will call it the constabulary throughout. It was originally established in 1901 to complement the U.S. Army occupation force and then provided much of the Philippine Army's initial manpower when it was established in 1935.
responsible for national defense. Both organizations fought against the Japanese, and their members were killed, imprisoned, or scattered. The Japanese reestablished the PC under its puppet Philippine government to assist in maintaining order, but it was ineffectual since its members were poorly armed and generally avoided combat with other Filipinos. 12 Furthermore, as historian Robert A. Smith writes, "it was a common saying that the Japanese had emptied the jails to fill up the constabulary." 13 As a result, the PC entered the postwar environment in a rather pitiful state but found itself as the lead force fighting the Huks since the government considered quelling the rebellion an internal police function. In contrast, the Huks had a cadre of indoctrinated fighters, an established support base near the capital, and a history of evading forces sent to eliminate them.
The Philippines consists of over 7,100 individual islands of which Luzon and Mindanao make up two-thirds of its total landmass. 14 In 1950 the population was approximately twenty-one million, with 75 percent of Filipinos working on small farms. 15 The Philippine population was relatively homogeneous with the vast majority claiming Christianity as their religion, but the Philippines was home to at least eight major dialects that were not mutually intelligible. Thus, language differences and regionalism helped prevent the spread of communism that occurred in other countries after 1945.

Dolan, 4th ed. (Washington, DC: Federal Research Division, 1993)
Although poor, abused tenant farmers comprised a large share of the Filipino population, only the area around Manila significantly cultivated the Huk movement.
Mount Arayat dominated this low-lying region, and other mountains and swamplands provided refuge for guerrilla forces. The movement's proximity to Manila gave it distinct advantages including a large population base from which to recruit, relative ease in gaining intelligence on government activities, and tactical position to constantly threaten the capital. The Communists also rallied support by highlighting the contrast between the comparatively modern area of Manila and the extremely poor areas further afield, a visible symbol of the elites' exploitation of the poor. At the same time, however, proximity to the capital also ensured maximum attention from government forces. 17
The Philippines exited the Second World War in a poor socio-economic state. As historian Ray Hunt writes, Loyalty to America and resistance to the Japanese cost the Filipinos dearly: 5 percent of them were killed; millions were terrorized by unbridled Japanese torture and rape; and scores of thousands were crippled permanently. They were impoverished from wholesale theft and destruction of their resources, and their capital was laid waste more thoroughly than any cities on earth save Hiroshima, Nagasaki, and Warsaw. 18   Accordingly, Washington prioritized economic reconstruction and generally left the Huk problem to the Filipinos to sort out.
As Washington moved toward full Philippine independence by 4 July 1946, it secured two controversial agreements with the incoming government that served as targets of anti-colonial protest. The first was an expansion of the 1934 Tydings-McDuffie Act that allowed the United States to establish bases wherever it deemed necessary for mutual security. The second was the Philippine Trade Act of 1946 that guaranteed the United States preferential trade treatment, pegged the Filipino peso to the dollar, and 17 Greenberg, Hukbalahap Insurrection, 45-48, 53. 18 Ray C. Hunt and Bernard Norling, Behind Japanese Lines: An American Guerrilla in the Philippines (Lexington: University Press of Kentucky, 1986), 71. granted U.S. entities equal rights alongside Filipinos to exploit the country's natural resources. 19 In exchange for these agreements, the United States promised hundreds of millions in aid, which provided ample fodder for anti-government elements whose message revolved around the government's sale of Filipino sovereignty. 20   The Huks nevertheless made seemingly honest attempts to affect the political process legally by participating in the April 1946 national elections. The Huk candidates won seven seats in the House of Representatives, but the new president, Manuel Roxas, refused to allow the Huk candidates to take their seats. In May, Huk guerrillas ambushed a government patrol and killed ten, while Roxas's forces struck out at Huk leadership and followers in an intimidation campaign. 21 These events marked the beginning of the Huk Rebellion.
Following his inauguration, President Roxas initiated an uncompromising policy toward the Huks and directed the constabulary to eliminate them by force. Stating this objective turned out to be far easier than implementing it. The PC numbered only about 24,000 poorly-armed national police personnel while the Huks may have numbered as many as 10,000 to 15,000. 22 The result was a disorganized effort that failed to eliminate Huk forces or reduce popular support in the major Huk areas. As Taruc writes, "when the soldiers rounded up the barrio people, they would drive them at gun point to the nearest town"; meanwhile, government soldiers looted the barrios and blamed it on the Huks. 23   In contrast, the Huks made community outreach central to their strategy and slowly grew their base of support as their helping hand contrasted sharply with the government's mailed fist. 24 Poor operational security, clumsy maneuvers, and good Huk intelligence 19 Philippine Trade (Bell Trade Act)

In June 1947, the Huks adopted a new name for their army, Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan (HMB), which translated to "People's Liberation Army" in recognition of its leaders' solidarity with the global communist community. They maintained their regional command structure and their political arm responsible for indoctrinating the peasants in communist teachings. This period marked the beginning of the movement's shift toward hardcore communist doctrine that even included the liquidation of members deemed to be bad Communists. Although this adherence to communism was meant to unite the peasants in common cause, Filipinos were slow to embrace its more radical tenets.
To maintain the relationship between the U.S. and Philippine militaries, the United States established the Joint United States Military Advisory Group to the Republic of the Philippines (JUSMAGP) on 18 December 1947 under U.S. Army Major General Albert M.
Jones. JUSMAGP's stated mission was to furnish advice, supplies and equipment, and training opportunities at U.S. military institutions. 26 With an authorized strength of only fifty-five officers and enlisted, it initially focused on technical training and the transfer of equipment but became increasingly involved in the assessment of the anti-Huk campaign 25 Smith, Philippine Freedom, 145-46. Roxas's government reported on numerous occasions that it was on the verge of victory, but it never managed to end the fighting, and Roxas's sudden death in April 1948 set up a new phase in the struggle for Filipino rule. 28 Upon taking office, Roxas's successor, Vice-President Elpidio Quirino, enacted an amnesty period to reconcile with the Huks and put the rebellion to rest. It allowed rebels to receive a pardon in exchange for registering their weapons, but it was littered with problems. Throughout the amnesty period 
(21 June to 15 August 1948)
The end of the amnesty period and the continuation of hostilities coincided with the first indication that any senior U.S. official was taking serious note of the Hukbalahap problem. In August 1948 the U.S. chargé d'affaires inquired of President Quirino as to "the present and immediate future policy of [the] Philippine government toward the Hukbalahaps." 29 Quirino responded optimistically that the Huks would surrender their arms, although actually there was little incentive for them to do so. 30 Additionally, Quirino assured the U.S. mission that his forces were holding back to allow for a peaceful resolution to the situation, but less than a month later Quirino launched a major operation against the Huks centered on Taruc and his group. As Taruc recounts, "the terror immediately launched by Quirino exceeded by far the worst of the Roxas brutalities.
Murder, torture, raping, looting and wholesale evacuations ensued across Central and Southern Luzon." 31   In April 1949, the Huks assassinated President Quezon's widow in her car on the pretense that she symbolized the worst of the Philippine elite. Quezon was popular during his presidency-even while in exile-and had remained so in death. 32 The average Filipino citizen saw the targeting of his wife as a despicable act that symbolized Huk ruthlessness. 33 It even sowed discord in the Huk ranks as their members wrestled with their communist beliefs versus their Catholic upbringing and nationalist sentiments. 34   The Philippine government's response to this assassination also gave the first indications of what changes needed to be made to the Filipino security apparatus so it could effectively combat the Huk threat. Quirino ordered a reprisal operation involving four thousand Filipino troops who managed to destroy a Huk regional command after two weeks of combat operations. 35 This attack showed that larger units could realize measurable success against the Huks. In August 1949 Quirino reported to Truman that the Huk movement had been eliminated, in part to assuage concerns over U.S. personnel stationed at bases in the Philippines. 36   Quirino's assertions proved to be exaggerated, however, and conditions in the Philippines continued to deteriorate. The Huk's high-water mark came in March 1950 with attacks on multiple towns and cities that netted vital arms and equipment while placing Philippine forces on their heels. The offensive culminated in August with an attack on a PA base resulting in twenty-five soldiers killed and the massacre of patients and nurses in the base hospital. By this time, the Huk concentration around Manila was becoming so dense that it began to be called "Huklandia" as seen in Figure

Throughout the Huk Rebellion in the Philippines, Washington saw that the solution centered on improving the country's economic conditions. U.S. congressional outlays from 1945 to 1952 reflected this assessment, as economic aid was four times as great as military aid. 37 Nevertheless, the political-military position in 1950 was such that money spent rehabilitating the Philippine economy meant little if the security situation around the capital continued to deteriorate. Thus, from Washington's perspective, proactive measures to shore up Quirino's increasingly corrupt government were necessary even if distasteful. Additionally, the recent successful advisory effort in Greece shaped people's recommendations. U.S. leaders looked to General Van Fleet's successful mission in Greece for recommendations on JUSMAGP's force size and personnel with advisory expertise to achieve the same results in the Philippines. 38 Even though the strategic picture was significantly different, the idea that duplication of the input in Greece would achieve similar results elsewhere would persist in U.S. civilian and military leaders.
Quirino government as a worthy recipient of U.S. aid. Despite $1.5 billion in aid since its liberation, he lamented that "Philippine ineptitude and wastefulness" resulted in a Filipino economic situation far short of what they should have attained. 39 Acheson's lack of confidence in Quirino was so grave that he even considered recommending his removal via unspecified means. 40 The U.S. Embassy further assessed in April 1950 that the Philippine armed forces' persistent inability to eliminate the Huk threat and its increasing alienation of the population could "prove fatal-unless . . . remedied." 41 The embassy recommended increasing the size of the JUSMAG to provide better instruction in anti-guerrilla operations and perhaps drawing on "officers having similar experience in the recent operations in Greece," and moving additional U.S. units into bases on Luzon to protect the installations. 42   Major General Jonathan Anderson, JUSMAGP commander, had already been pushing the Philippine government to reform and reorganize its method for prosecuting the anti-Huk campaign. He identified two key objectives. First, Philippine security forces needed to concentrate on internal versus external security. 43 The lightly-armed constabulary was fighting the Huks, while the smaller but more capable Army focused on national defense. Since the United States had already committed itself to the Philippines' external defense, an outward focus was unnecessary; regardless, the PA had little capability to defend the country. Second, Anderson thought that the Philippine economy needed to be made capable of supporting the necessary forces on its own as quickly as possible. 44 This latter objective fit with overall U.S. goals to achieve a Philippines that was economically and militarily stable for the minimum U.S. investment. Failure to appreciate the Huk threat had led the United States mostly to ignore it and had led the Philippine government to delegate the defeat of the Huks to the constabulary, which had shown itself unsuited to the task.
At least as early as March 1950, JUSMAGP recognized that the PC was not the ideal force for combatting the Huks. It was organized in ninety-nine-man companies and focused on internal policing duties. These companies were further divided into platoon- sized elements that were "scattered all over the Islands." 45 This dispersion allowed the Huks to avoid, harass, or cutoff PC units and attack them piecemeal, which often led to a "larger than life" fear of the Huks since they maintained the initiative. 46 Furthermore, the small PC units were often subject to executing the whims of the provincial officials where they were stationed, as opposed to aggressively seeking out the enemy. The PC also began its campaign armed as a police force with "billy clubs, side arms, and carbines." 47 Only later did it gain the weapons it needed to meet the Huks on an equal basis or to decisively outmatch them. Most importantly, however, the PC had earned a reputation for treating the citizenry poorly. 48 As a result, JUSMAGP recommended significant changes to the entire Philippine security construct. First, the constabulary needed to shift the bulk of its personnel to the army. These forces would assist in the establishment of battalion combat teams (BCTs) and provide the capability to engage and destroy Huk units, rather than simply exchange operationally insignificant retaliatory harassment. Second, it recommended shifting command of the PC from the Department of the Interior to the AFP to ensure a combined, coordinated effort against the Huks. 49
The onset of the Korean War in June 1950 increased Washington's apprehension toward its position in the entire Far East and unlocked billions of dollars in military aid for a vast region that, up until that point, had received just a trickle. The JCS stressed the need to ensure the Philippines was not a point of weakness in America's Far East defensive perimeter. 50 It assessed that the 33,000 Filipino troops should be able to crush the 10,000 to 15,000 Huks in one year. 51  Ultimately, JUSMAGP resisted a significant increase in military involvement-a resistance that was fortuitous at a time when every available fighting man was needed to stave off a communist takeover of Korea. The military advisors ended up being the voice of reason during these months. They determined that the AFP's deficiencies were obvious to all parties and had already transmitted their corrective recommendations to the highest Philippine authorities. What was needed was an aggressive Filipino to implement the recommendations.
The succession of events that brought Ramon Magsaysay to the office of Secretary of National Defense is the stuff of legend in the Philippines. While some argue that he owed his success primarily to his friendly relations with the United States, it seems that most of his celebrated reputation was justified. As late as June 1952, retired

Magsaysay's predecessor, Ruperto Kangleon, was by no means Quirino's incompetent lackey. Ambassador Cowen described him "as a man of unusual honesty and sense of duty" but saw that he was handicapped "by the fact that ranking officers of the Armed Forces frequently by-pass him, appealing direct to the President, and by the 66 Smith, Philippine Freedom, 151-55. 67  circumstance that the President encourages them to do so." 70 Due to his relationships with his military cronies, Quirino had sidelined Kangleon to the point that he could not make the military reforms necessary to fight the Huks more effectively. Even as Kangleon left office, he remarked disparagingly about Quirino's failure to follow his advice and relieve ineffective officers. Magsaysay recognized this negative interference and demanded a free hand to do what was necessary to address the Huk threat effectively. 71   Magsaysay wasted no time reforming the military. Within days of taking office, he recommended the retirement of thirteen older and underperforming officers including the Philippine Air Force commander. 72 He also began to clean up the military's reputation for abuse of the peasantry by addressing the past behavior of its members. For example, in February 1951, Magsaysay ordered a Filipino lieutenant colonel to return from the United States to face a court martial for his and his unit's behavior while he was in command. 73 He disciplined intelligence officers who had abused prisoners and warned his commanders that they would be held accountable for being afraid to go into the field. 74 He further oversaw the final reduction in PC forces to seven-thousand and assumed command of these forces from the Department of the Interior.

It is impossible to describe the U.S. role in the anti-Huk campaign without discussing the contributions of Colonel Edward Lansdale, whose naturally outgoing personality, initiative, curiosity, and ability to relate to people were his signature strengths throughout his military career. Perhaps only T. E. Lawrence's reputation surpasses that of Lansdale in the chronicles of twentieth century military advisors.
Lansdale appeared to have an above average ability to empathize with the cultures in which he lived and seemingly could make friends with virtually anybody. movement and that its unstated goal was to "win a popular revolution which would put a handful of communists in power, to run the country afterwards as ruthless dictators." 78   Ironically, the Huks saw themselves as having battled a small group of ruthless Filipino landowning dictators for years with U.S. support.
After Lansdale left Manila in November 1948, he continued to follow events in the Philippines, especially when he began working for the CIA. In 1950, Lansdale met Magsaysay during the latter's trip to Washington, and advocated within the CIA for his 77 Currey, Unquiet American, 39-45. 78 Edward Lansdale, "Counter-Guerrilla Operations in the

Biographies of Lansdale give the impression that he was an omniscient counterinsurgent who understood the relationship between government responsiveness and the needs of the people better than any of his peers. 81 As such, historians have credited him with being the genesis for economic reform in the Philippines as a way to combat the Huk message. This version of the story shortchanges the multitude of State Department and military personnel who had worked on U.S.-Filipino relations since 1945. There was no confusion among U.S. decision makers that economic recovery, fighting corruption, and civic action were the prescriptions for alleviating unrest and 79 Lansdale, Midst of Wars, 13-14. 80 Currey, Unquiet American, 72. 81 As Jonathan Nashel lays out, there is much debate over the significance of Lansdale's role in his relationship with Magsaysay to the numerous reforms and ideas that helped the Philippine government defeat the Huks. Jonathan Nashel, Edward Lansdale's Cold War (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 2005), 227-28. As Jose Abueva chronicles, Magsaysay had been active on many reform issues during his first term in congress from 1946 to 1948. Abueva, Ramon Magsaysay, 110-14. Douglas Macdonald takes issue with a common legend that Lansdale "'invented' Magsaysay," calling it "an incorrect, ethnocentric, and rather arrogant interpretation" in contrast to Lansdale's own words and Magsaysay's consistent beliefs and actions. Douglas J. Macdonald, Adventures in Chaos: American Intervention for Reform in the Third World (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1992), 145. Douglas Blaufarb reinforces Abueva and Macdonald, arguing that "the major initiatives and strategies were Magsaysay's, and various myths that made of Lansdale a puppet-master and Magsaysay his puppet were wide of the mark." Blaufarb, The Counterinsurgency Era, 39. Richard Slotkin argues that the Lansdale-Magsaysay relationship worked because it "was balanced; and Magsaysay, as both a native leader and an expert on his own political culture, shaped the objectives and overall course of policy." He further argues that "by interpreting the victory over the Huks as the product of Lansdale's professionalism and genius, American policy-makers blinded themselves to the real dynamics of that counterinsurgency operation." Richard Slotkin, Gunfighter Nation: The Myth of the Frontier in Twentieth-Century Ameica (New York: Atheneum, 1992), 442-43. The final arbiter is Lansdale's inability to repeat the success with which he was credited in the Philippines when he went to Vietnam and worked with Ngo Dinh Diem. If creating a popular, charismatic, successful leader was so easy, there would probably be more than one example in America's history. See Currey and Phillips for a better appreciation of those who either served with or studied Lansdale for many years. Currey, Unquiet American; Rufus Phillips, Why Vietnam Matters: An Eyewitness Account of Lessons Not Learned (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2014). building the economy in the Philippines. 82 The problem was not a failure to understand Filipino problems, it was convincing President Quirino to address them effectively. It took a more patriotic, altruistic person like Magsaysay who would place country above self-interest to make serious changes.
What seems to be universally accepted is that Lansdale had an infectious personality that allowed him to quickly gain Magsaysay's trust. In his role as personal advisor and roommate to Magsaysay, Lansdale served as an objective source of advice that was untainted by Filipino politics. 83 The American was a committed anti-communist who believed in the American ideals of democracy and respect for civilians-ideals that also rang true with Magsaysay. 84 Lansdale biographer Cecil Currey overwhelmingly credits Lansdale for ideas that Magsaysay implemented or operations that he ordered like the October 1950 raid that captured nearly the entire Huk Politburo and for the improved treatment of civilians by the AFP. 85 Currey's version of the former has Lansdale "coordinating a plan with Magsaysay and the Philippine military intelligence people" to surprise and arrest over one-hundred senior Huk personnel. From what appears to be the more likely version, a Huk deserter gave the information to the government that allowed the operation to be so successful. The Lansdale-centric narrative even saw him referred to as "Ed Lansdale of Philippine fame" in 1954 state department correspondence between two high level diplomats. 86   This narrative discounts Magsaysay's early successes in business, as a guerrilla leader, and as a freshman congressman, which all occurred due to his ability and well before his first trip to the United States in 1949. He knew his country's problems, and his service in congress taught him how to effect change, which he used to seek support for 82 "Memorandum from the Secretary of State to the President,"

Likewise, Syngman Rhee in Korea was particularly compliant when his country was in grave danger. When he was not happy with the deal being worked out in Kaesong, he took measures that threatened to reignite the conflict because his goals had diverged from U.S. goals. In the Philippines, the United States got lucky. Furthermore, if Lansdale had discovered the secret formula to turn anyone into a popular, charismatic leader, then his next assignment in Vietnam would have likely turned out differently.
Lansdale's real talent came in making friends, understanding the minds of the Huk enemy, and devising schemes to conduct psychological operations through various means that the less technologically advanced Filipinos might not have even considered.
By the end of his tenure in the Philippines, Lansdale had displayed such valuable insight into all aspects of the Filipino political and military scene that he was one of the most qualified Americans to transmit thoughts on these subjects to U.S. decision makers.
Lansdale displayed this expertise in a detailed five-page memo to Ambassador Raymond Spruance, outlining the political-military situation in the Philippines shortly before the 1953 elections that brought Magsaysay to the presidency. 89 87 Abueva, Ramon Magsaysay, 121-25. 88 Ibid., 88.

Despite their military successes in 1949 and 1950, the Huks made a series of decisions that significantly weakened their strategic position. The Huks had always consisted of a larger group of disenchanted peasants who simply wanted a fairer distribution of crop production from the land they worked. In contrast, the group's senior leaders were committed Communists who sought the type of revolution seen in China and Russia. For this Bolshevik side of the movement, there was no room for compromise with the government on concessions as an acceptable alternative for revolution. For them, the bourgeoisie were evil and had to be liquidated for the sake of the revolution, democracy, and freedom. In 1950 the Communists estimated that the unpopular Filipino government was ripe to fall, and that the United States was sure to undergo retrenchment due to an impending severe recession. Furthermore, the party assessed that their efforts to expand their influence had resulted in absolute revolutionary loyalty by the peasants of these areas versus grudging acceptance of the Huk presence and their communist ideology. Finally, the Communists chose to break away from other opposition parties whose goals were similar but who were not sworn to the Communist cause. All of these estimates were severe miscalculations. 90   Additionally, Magsaysay's influence on the AFP's conduct resulted in better treatment of Filipinos compared to the Huks. As the government troops improved their behavior, the Huks often had to resort to coercion to maintain adequate supplies. 91 This shift caused the Huks to slowly lose support of the peasants. Furthermore, despite the U.S. belief that the Huk Rebellion was connected to the global Communist movement, Taruc writes, "no direct organizational link existed with either Russia or China during my years in the Party." 92 The Huks had labeled themselves communists but did not benefit from any connection to the global communist movement. 90 Kerkvliet, Huk Rebellion, 219-33; Taruc, He Who Rides the Tiger, 73, 169. 91 Greenberg, Hukbalahap Insurrection, 145. 92 Taruc, He Who Rides the Tiger, 33.
The Huks also never consolidated military command in one overall leader.
Although Taruc was nominally the head of the Huk army, in practice, the Politburo retained overall control and moved influential commanders around to prevent them from consolidating power. 93  
Magsaysay had two main challenges as Secretary of National Defense: improving the effectiveness of the security forces and reducing the Huk support base. Fortunately for him, he inherited changes that JUSMAGP had already convinced Quirino to begin implementing in April 1950. These changes involved a wholesale restructuring of the army and constabulary that recognized the Huk Rebellion as the most important and immediate security threat to a stable Philippines. JUSMAGP had advocated reducing the PC to seven-thousand personnel and shifting the remainder to the PA to establish fifteen BCTs of approximately 1200 soldiers each with all of the necessary supporting arms to 93 Taruc's title was "Supremo," as in the supreme leader of Huk forces, but he never appeared to have the mandate or the communications ability to truly coordinate all the far flung Huk cells for an effective campaign.

locate, isolate, and destroy Huk concentrations. 95 Furthermore, these BCTs were assigned a sector to secure and reported to the Army Chief of Staff through military commanders versus to the provincial civilian leadership. 96 Finally, the PC retained its role of being responsible for law and order, but all forces fell under the Secretary of National Defense for prosecuting the anti-Huk campaign. 97 There was no dilution of effort; each BCT was a self-contained unit that was not dependent on cobbling together disparate elements that reported to a separate organization or provincial leader. Thus, the chain of command was clearly defined and uncluttered by other interfering parties like the PC had experienced throughout its time prosecuting the anti-Huk campaign before this reorganization when provincial leadership sometimes interfered with military operations for local reasons.
The BCTs also received intelligence capability because of JUSMAGP recommendations. Decentralized intelligence gathering and analysis were critical to the anti-Huk campaign. This addition significantly improved the BCT performance against the elusive Huks. This large reorganization did come at a cost, however. JUSMAGP reported that unit cohesion had been damaged by breaking up all of the PC units to form BCTs. 98 Nevertheless, in the months that followed, these changes proved their worth against the Huks. With the United States providing the equipment for these BCTs and the Huks receiving nothing but what they could scrounge or steal from depots, the Huks were outmatched from that point forward.
Fortune shone brightly on Magsaysay within a few weeks of his appointment as Secretary. Perhaps unbeknownst to him, the Huks had decided to strike Manila on 95 JUSMAGP, "Brief Resume of Dissident Situation and Status of Armed Forces of the Philippines,"

Christmas 1950. 99 Shortly after taking office in September, however, Magsaysay gained intelligence on a woman who was the courier to all of the communist leaders in Manila. 100 By following her delivery route, his forces marked suspect locations and arrested nearly the entire Huk Politburo, 105 personnel, in one lightning operation on 19
October 1950. 101 Although the Huks elected new membership shortly thereafter, the movement was never the same. William Pomeroy, an American deserter turned Huk, describes his feelings when he learned of his comrades' arrest: "ours is the feeling that divers have when their air hoses are cut deep down in the jagged caverned coral reefs, or that men have in mines when the tunnel behind them caves in and the choking dust rushes through the dark hole underground." 102 He further laments that "it is the worst possible news, for the whole direction of the struggle was in the hands of those arrested."

JUSMAGP's recommendations to reorganize, U.S. support in equipping the BCTs, and, most importantly, fresh leadership began to turn the tide in the stalemated effort.

Valeriano writes, "Magsaysay issued a statement to the armed forces declaring that every soldier had two duties: first, to act as an ambassador of good will from the government to the people; second, to kill or capture the Huk. Nothing else, he said, really counted as far as he was concerned." 106 Magsaysay also changed the government's message toward the Huks to "All Out Friend or All Out Force." With this motto, he promised aggressive action against those who chose to continue fighting against the government and conciliatory action toward those who chose to give up the fighting and rejoin the lawabiding Filipinos. 107   Providing written guidance to his troops and producing catchy slogans was one thing, but Magsaysay enforced his standards with an indefatigable work ethic that saw him visiting his troops in the field constantly. He was quick to praise those who maintained high standards and to criticize or relieve officers who took a lackadaisical approach toward their responsibilities. Magsaysay was not about to accept less than 100 percent from himself or his subordinates, and it began to show in the improved performance of the AFP. As Taruc writes, "the new discipline he [Magsaysay] imposed within the army, his good public relations, and his treatment of Huks who had surrendered or had been captured and who were willing to turn over a new leaf, seriously threatened the morale of our rank and file, which had, incidentally, been at its peak during the period of the 'mailed-fist' and terrorist policies."

On strictly military terms, however, Lansdale's advice was perhaps not as fruitful.
He proposed the creation of an airborne BCT that he thought would be especially useful as a mobile force to help block retreating Huk formations. He managed to obtain the necessary equipment while in Washington and assisted in the BCT's formation and 112 "The Ambassador in the Philippines (Spruance) to the Department of State," March 6, 1953,  FRUS, 1952-1954, 12, pt. 2:530.  113 Greenberg writes that as many as 1,500 guerrillas utilized the program by 1955.

As the anti-Huk campaign subsided, President Quirino began to begrudge Magsaysay's popularity among the people and U.S. officials. As the war concluded, the United States shifted support to Magsaysay in the 1953 elections since Quirino had failed to take the necessary steps to address the root causes of the country's problems. Despite Quirino's attempt to recruit Magsaysay as his vice president, Magsaysay resigned as Secretary of National Defense and handily won the election against Quirino due to his charisma, the respect he had won from the people, and perhaps some help from his U.S.

The United States resisted the temptation to intervene directly in the Philippines or even to significantly grow the size of JUSMAGP to provide field advice to individual battalions. This decision was understandably more difficult in the wake of the communist invasion of South Korea that was perceived as perhaps the beginning of a larger global communist expansion by force of arms. JUSMAGP recognized the Filipino soldier's potential and contributed adequate military aid to outfit the BCTs formed under U.S. advisors' guidance. A combination of proper military command and control by placing internal security under the Philippine Army, adequate-sized individual units for the mission, and a change in defense leadership that started with Magsaysay but filtered down to key subordinates combined produced success in the anti-Huk campaign.
American advisors provided critical insight into the shortcomings of the military effort, and the Filipinos began acting on them even before Magsaysay arrived in the Secretary's office. His arrival provided a sense of urgency and energy to the endeavor that had not existed at any point since liberation. Since the United States would not allow its bases to be attacked or its long-standing position in the Philippines to be threatened, it was willing make an even larger investment than what was actually required. Like in Greece and Korea, the Philippine government shouldered a heavy load for supporting its army. Major become his country's best-loved President."

The American experience in the Philippines represented an almost ideal environment in which advisors could be expected to succeed with reasonable certainty.
From serious implementation of advice to the end of major resistance took about 18 months while scattered resistance lasted until 1956. Success depended heavily on the fortuitous coming to power of the right individual, Magsaysay, at the right time. With a lesser individual, the advisory mission likely would have had to grow so its members could spend more time in the field with their units. Attempting to overcome incompetence at the top by building competence at the bottom was unlikely to have had the same effect in such a short time. Fortunately, additional manpower was unnecessary, and the United States was able to realize its foreign policy goals in the Philippines with only a fraction of the advisors that other efforts required.
In 1950 the United States, increasingly committed to preventing the spread of communism, above all in Europe but also more generally, began supporting France's effort in Vietnam to defeat the communist Viet Minh forces under Ho Chi Minh. 131 The purpose of this support was twofold: to prevent a communist expansion into Southeast Asia and to reinforce the U.S. position in Europe where France was one of the key pillars for resisting Soviet aggression. 132 Up to that point, Washington had remained generally detached from Southeast Asia, but it calculated that French failure there risked further losses in the region and even greater repercussions in Europe. Despite the precariousness of their position, however, the French were also wary of the generally anti-colonial coloration of American policy in Asia, and they were unwilling to countenance any significant outside involvement in what they considered their rightful sphere of influence.
Thus, U.S. military advisors became an avenue for support that was both essential and grudgingly accepted. They were present from the very beginning of U.S. participation in Vietnam under the Military Assistance Advisory Group, Indochina.
From 1950 to 1954, U.S. advisors were obliged to support a French strategy that had little hope of success. France's objective-hegemony over Vietnam-ran headlong into burgeoning Vietnamese nationalism, which France's defeat in 1940 had allowed to flourish. The Viet Minh were the most significant and determined of Vietnam's postwar 131 Viet Minh is an abbreviation of Viet Nam Doc Lap Dong Minh Hoi, or League for the Independence of Vietnam. 132 As early as March 1945, General Charles de Gaulle argued that without U.S. support in Indochina, France risked "'falling into the Russian orbit.'"

Overt U.S. support for France's effort risked alienating other Southeast Asian countries, who would view the United States as a new colonialist. Yet Washington also saw Ho Chi Minh as part of the global communist conspiracy it was confronting in Greece, Korea, and a blockaded Berlin.

Described by Stanley Karnow as "a Gallic version of MacArthur," de Lattre reinvigorated his troops and, with the help of timely U.S. assistance, blunted a major Viet Minh offensive in early 1951. 156 At a minimum, de Lattre's arrival gave hope that American assistance would not be thrown away to no purpose.
The MAAG's mission was "to insure full coordination of military plans and efforts between the French and Vietnamese forces and to supervise the allocation of materiel." 157 In contrast to the advisory missions in Greece and Korea, the mission statement did not explicitly mention providing advice, yet U.S. leaders expected General
Brink to make suggestions to the French if he had insights to offer and to report back to his superiors on the use or misuse of U.S. equipment. Although the French were eager for U.S. assistance, they had little interest in establishing a peer-level advisory relationship like that of previous U.S. advisory efforts. 158 They viewed the Americans chiefly as an equipment delivery service.
Even in this limited role, the MAAG still found the French to be extremely difficult allies. Equipment inspections required two months' advance notice and were only approved if the French determined that the amount of equipment was "sufficient to warrant a visit," and if the unit would be "free from tactical operations." 159 The result was mutual animosity that saw American MAAG personnel meticulously scrutinize French equipment requests, and, as Colonel Donald Dunn recounts, the MAAG members would often cross out "the whole thing [the request] and say you're not allowed to have this, it's not . . . in the (perview)

The United States realized early that defeating the Viet Minh would require an effective native army that could one day take over the fighting from the French. Limited as it was to volunteers, the native French contribution to the French Expeditionary Corps in Vietnam was always fewer than 100,000, hardly enough to defeat the estimated 300,000 Viet Minh forces they would eventually face. 161 French and "Associated State" forces in Vietnam would eventually number over 400,000, but 88 percent were sourced from outside of France proper. 162 Furthermore, the two sides remained closely matched in numbers of forces facing each other in Tonkin throughout the war. Brink's assessment shortly after his arrival underscored the operational situation: "It must be assumed that, in general, [the] French are fighting in unfriendly territory in all their military efforts in Vietnam." 163 He further warned that the "formation of [the] Vietnamese Army is still under discussion, and [is] not likely to become [a] consolidated force within a year, and will not have any appreciable military value before 1952." 164 Thus, began a string of projections for a time when the VNA would be prepared to relieve the French from the bulk of the fighting, especially since it numbered only 16,000 in May 1950 and lacked the senior leadership, staffs, and institutions necessary for long-term independent sustainment. 165 French resistance in building a capable Vietnamese Army was an everincreasing source of friction between the Americans and the French. At one point, Vietnamese forces consisted of 240,000 troops split evenly between the national army and the French army. 168 Yet, Brink reported that there were only 35,420 regular VNA troops and 27,000 National Guard in February 1952, and that they were incapable of defending themselves against the Viet Minh without French assistance. 169 French duplicity on this point simply contributed to the overall spirit of distrust between the two parties. Furthermore, the French allowed little contact between U.S. and Vietnamese troops. Thus, the MAAG could only give a rough estimate of 50 percent effectiveness across the board for "Associated States" military forces. 170 Brink also disparaged the lack 165 Spector, Advice and Support, 131. 166 Dunn, interview, 11.

of effective Vietnamese leadership at anything higher than company level. 171 The creation of a capable Vietnamese army with native senior leadership threatened the French position in Indochina; thus, the French neglected to cultivate it even though it was necessary for victory. 172 Likewise, there was little incentive for Vietnamese with any sense of nationalism to serve in the VNA since victory meant the continuation of French rule.

In their constant search for influence, U.S. leaders saw their advisory mission in Korea as a possible model for the French to emulate in developing the VNA. Upon U.S. invitation, French Marshal Alphonse Juin visited Korea at the end of February 1953. 182   His reaction to this trip was politely appreciative but ultimately dismissive. He presented a myriad of reasons why U.S. training and organization methods from Korea would not work in Vietnam. He disparaged the Vietnamese soldier as being more difficult to train than South Koreans since "the Japanese had given a military tradition to Korea while there never had been such a tradition in Indochina." 183 This statement ignored that Ho Chi Minh's Vietnamese troops were fighting well and winning. The official French report from the trip was a somewhat incoherent set of reasons why the French could not adopt the KMAG model in Vietnam. These reasons centered on the difficulty of conducting training during an ongoing insurgency and of adapting to a division versus a battalion-179 "Letter from General Trapnell to

It is nevertheless surprising that the French were either unable to see the tactical usefulness of or were simply too stubborn to try a larger tactical unit than the rather limited battalion. Despite what seemed like an inferior organizational structure, the MAAG considered the French to be effective fighters with high morale, but the benefit they would have gained from being organized in regiments or divisions still would not have turned defeat into victory in their war with the Viet Minh. The difference of opinion 184 French reasons were, "(a) No stability of front or security of rear areas exists in Indochina; (b) Indochina war is not 'classic' combat; (c) Basic combat unit is battalion rather than division; prohibitive cost of establishing 'soldier factory'; and (d) French and Vietnamese temperaments are not adaptable to specialization, regimentation and subordination since these methods do not consider the personality of the individual."

Eisenhower shared the sentiments of General Trapnell-the French had to be coerced into aggressively pursuing victory in Vietnam. As a result, he insisted on a plan for victory before he would send additional aid. For their part, the French had begun to question why the Americans refused to consider negotiations or partition with Ho Chi Minh while they were concurrently negotiating with the Chinese and North Koreans over the outcome of the Korean War. 192 Eisenhower's position nevertheless led the French to draft hastily a plan named after the French high commissioner for Indochina at the time, Jean Letourneau. Presented orally, it lacked detail and seemed more of an attempt to present something that would satisfy Eisenhower's requirement, rather than a plan that was likely to be enacted or that would feasibly accomplish its objectives. 193 In summary, it called for the VNA's expansion by approximately 100,000 recruits in 1953 and 1954.
These new forces would secure the rear areas as the regular French and Vietnamese forces cleared the Viet Minh out of the country from south to north in three phases by the end of 1955. 194 General Trapnell expressed disappointment regarding the slow timeline but recommended the United States support the plan since there was no U.S.-centric option. 195   May of 1953 saw the arrival of another French commander, General Henri Navarre, whose Navarre Plan promised to reverse French fortunes in Indochina. 196 The 192 Logevall, Embers of War, 316. Paradoxically, the French had used Indochina's position in the global communist menace to win U.S. bankrolling of their efforts there, but by July 1953 the neutralists in France were using the phrase "trading French blood for American dollars" to attack the French party that favored a continued effort in Indochina. This sentiment was similar to what JUSMAPG faced under Van Fleet.

If success were simply a matter of pushing the Viet Minh out of the areas it controlled militarily, the French would have already accomplished that in the preceding eight years.
Viewed in this light, the Navarre plan, which focused on the provision of local security by indigenous forces, was not a novel concept. Neither was it feasible, given the near parity between the two sides. 200 In any event, the change in French leadership did not fundamentally alter the MAAG relationship with the French in Vietnam. The French continued to shut the MAAG out of operational planning, as evidenced by their failure to 197 To illustrate the precariousness of the French position in Tonkin, under General de Lattre the French had constructed the De Lattre Line, which was a series of almost 1,000 forts around the Red River Delta to make it an impregnable barrier against infiltration. This barrier consumed 80,000 to 100,000 troops. Nevertheless, in 1953 Bernard Fall estimated that only 31.2 percent of the 5,780 villages inside the line were "under effective Franco-Vietnamese administration." The Viet Minh even controlled areas abutting the vital Hanoi to Haiphong road on either side.

199 As Russell Volckmann writes in the Army manual on countering guerrilla operations, "the force assigned to combat guerrilla forces and to establish control over an area must be adequate. . . .To assign insufficient forces may later necessitate the employment of many times the original number."

Finally, it exposed American hubris with respect to training and advising the Vietnamese.
The French had not done it right, so the Americans would show them how to do it. 202   O'Daniel's plan called for U.S. advisors to reorganize the current VNA battalions into eight VNA divisions, establish an effective Vietnamese high command, and train 86 new light battalions in six month. 203 Using previous advisory efforts as a guide, O'Daniel would have done well just to have the manning and facilities in place to accomplish the task in under six months, much less have the training completed. He then expected these new units to begin operations against veteran Viet Minh forces beginning in Cochin Chin and then push them north out of Tonkin. Drawing on historical success, the plan states, "Operation REDLAND follows the 1949 plan employed by the Greek National Army in their war against communist guerrillas. The political and military situation in Greece then parallels in many ways the current situation in Indochina." 204 Describing the situations in Greece and Vietnam as similar was optimistically or ignorantly exaggerated. Force ratios between friendly and enemy forces in the two conflicts were far different, the total population in Greece was one-third of Vietnam's, and the Viet Minh enjoyed far greater support than the Greek Communists. 205 A better comparison would have been the Chinese Revolution, but since that scenario did not end well for the U.S. side, O'Daniel may have chosen Greece instead. Ironically, in February 1950, W. Walton Butterworth from the State Department had warned that economic and military aid were not the "missing components" that would prove decisive in Vietnam. 206 At the time, the French were using the Greek example to argue for U.S. support to their effort in Vietnam.
Butterworth warned that any attempt by the French to draw an analogous line to the successful U.S. intervention in Greece was a "dangerous delusion." 207 Four years later, U.S. commanders were making the same deluded analogies.
The French defeat at Dien Bien Phu made O'Daniel's plan a moot point, but he would carry the thoughts forward when he relieved General Trapnell as MAAG Chief in April 1954. Confusion and indecision characterized the U.S. position toward Vietnam in the first months of his new tour. The French pleaded for U.S. intervention to save their besieged outpost but stubbornly clung to maintaining their special relationship with Vietnam. Washington debated intervention, even including the use of nuclear weapons, to try to save the French, but ultimately decided to stay out, and the fortress fell on 7 May 204 MAAG-I, "Campaign Plan Redland," Annex E. 205 The Greek National Army maintained a ratio of approximately six to one against the Greek Communists (Democratic Army). Even with the additional forces O'Daniel proposed and the French maintaining their full contingent, his plan might have managed a ratio of two to one.

The human cost for both sides during the eight-year conflict ending in 1954 was steep.

The United States inherited France's failure in 1954 and began fixing what it perceived were the French mistakes. Historian Frederick Logevall characterizes the American attitude toward the French effort in Indochina in 1954: "They [the French] had fought badly in Indochina and deserved to lose. Americans, on the other hand, were the good guys, militarily invincible, who selflessly had come to help the Vietnamese in their hour of need and would then go home."

Hawkish only months earlier, Washington suddenly had second thoughts on the extent of this support, however, finally deciding to fund a South Vietnamese Army wholly insufficient for the threat it might face. Meanwhile, dysfunction between the U.S.
Ambassador and the senior military advisor, lessons ignored from previous advisory experiences, and unfavorable southern geography set the conditions that would allow a renewed communist insurgency to gain a toehold in the South.
confidence, given that Vietnam's internal situation was so problematic. 6 Despite the new enthusiasm the French displayed for U.S. involvement in the wake of Dien Bien Phu, the excitement subsided as the reality of the upcoming Geneva talks set in, and the two sides failed to reach an agreement on the extent of U.S. involvement and French concessions. 7
As a result, little activity took place on the issue until the Geneva Conference was concluded.
While the great powers were debating Vietnam's future in Geneva, the most controversial Vietnamese figure to feature in the U.S. effort in Vietnam-Ngo Dinh Diem-stepped off a plane in Saigon in June 1954, as newly appointed prime minister to Bao Dai. Diem faced a daunting task: the VNA was crumbling, the Vietnamese army chief of staff was jostling to seize power; hundreds of thousands of refugees soon would be moving from north to south; the Cao Dai, Hoa Hao, and Binh Xuyen sects were in control of large areas of the south; the future status of French occupation and U.S. support was unknown; and French and U.S. officials had mixed feelings about him. The CIA estimated that even with U.S. support, the likelihood of a strong, anti-communist government establishing itself firmly in the South to counterbalance the North was low and that the Viet Minh would win the 1956 elections outlined in the Geneva Accords.

It was not until August that the training mission again came under serious discussion, and the JCS recommended four preconditions be met before the United States should assume the training role: "a reasonably strong, stable civil government in control," a formal request for training and materiel support, full independence granted by France, and that "the size and composition of the forces . . . be dictated by the local military requirements and the overall U.S. interests." 15 The JCS, particularly General Matthew Ridgway, became the primary source of the paralysis surrounding the formulation of a way ahead in Vietnam, which contrasted sharply with the importance the United States had 11 Lansdale's PSYOPS group appealed to Catholics using slogans such as "The Blessed Virgin Mary is moving south" and to all groups with promises of land and money awaiting refugees in the south.

As 1955 opened, Diem was headed to a showdown with the religious sects and their militias, specifically the Binh Xuyen, whose power base was in the capital. Unwilling to form a more inclusive government, Diem lost the support of General Collins, and his anti-French sentiments also alienated the French. Collins traveled to Washington to argue against continuing to support Diem, but in a masterful stroke, Diem gained the army's loyalty and defeated or incorporated the sects. 32 This action cemented Diem's support from Washington and made him momentarily safe from his rivals in Vietnam. During this incident, Diem had also openly defied Bao Dai and lost his support, which led to his final act of 1955: challenging Bao Dai in a national election. Although the election reeked of voting fraud, by November 1955 Diem was the new President of the Republic of 29 MAAG-I, "Minutes of Conference at MAAG, 29 Nov 54," November 29, 1954, 3, Entry 12, Box 2,  USFSEA, 1950-1975, MAAG-V/AGD, SCGR 1950-1961, 092 Indo-China Country Statement 1954 thru  350.09 Redland Campaign Plan 1954, RG 472, NACP.  30 Ibid.

experience with KMAG had shown that a much larger organization was required to staff the schools and units with adequate advisors for even the ARVN's modest size, but increasing the MAAG manpower was problematic. 39 Even though the United States was not a signatory to the Geneva Accords, the Departments of State and Defense disagreed on the legalities of increasing the MAAG's size under the restrictions that the accords placed on reinforcements. 40 The State Department won, arguing that the size could not legally be increased. To circumvent these restrictions, Washington created the Temporary Equipment
Recovery Mission (TERM) on 1 June 1956. TERM was ostensibly a separate unit from the MAAG, and its mission was to process the large amount of materiel leftover from the war.
In reality, TERM primarily augmented TRIM's manpower, bringing TRIM closer to the size necessary to provide adequate numbers of advisors to all of the units. TERM also duplicated many staff functions since it was supposed to appear as a separate entity, which

The MAAG advisors faced the same challenges as their predecessors. As in Korea, few advisors possessed Vietnamese language skills. Vietnamese interpreters mitigated this problem, but operational security risks increased with communist infiltration, and the increase of U.S. personnel put a premium on good interpreters. Also like Korea, cultural concern with the preservation of personal status and dignity ("face") created problems between the advisor and his counterpart. General Samuel Myers, chief of the MAAG Army section, recounts a story in which he upbraided a Vietnamese captain for the filthy conditions in his hospital; the captain committed suicide an hour later. 42 Advisors dealt with corruption and black marketeering within the ARVN, which again were seen as part of the culture as in Korea. Short tour lengths, as few as six months, meant frequent turnover and time wasted as each new advisor figured out his job, established rapport with his counterpart, and figured out how to make himself useful. Finally, there was little advisorspecific training or selection. As the 1980 BDM Corporation study notes, advisors were not selected based on their aptitude for advising, "but rather on the basis of military occupational specialty and availability for and vulnerability to an overseas hardship tour." 43   For the most part, however, advisors had met and overcome these challenges in previous missions. There is no indication that the advisors in Vietnam had greater problems 41 "Memorandum from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs

Williams responded to this plan realistically, stating that "the lack of Vietnamese training, field command structure and logistic balance in effect increases the Viet Minh superiority above the 2 to 1 ratio." 70 Rather than accept the informed opinion of the senior military advisor in country in good faith, Radford took offense at his plan being questioned, telling Williams's boss, "I have grave doubts as to

Prior to assuming the prime minister position, Diem had established a personal relationship with Wesley Fishel of Michigan State University. As a sovereign nation, the RVN contracted in May 1955 for a Michigan State University Group (MSUG) to provide academic instruction to improve the South Vietnamese government and police. 72 The volunteers found themselves arriving in the midst of the post-sect fighting with harrowing tales of being caught in anti-communist riots, random terrorist attacks, and one member's kidnapping all occurring within their first few months in country. 73  Williams wanted an additional paramilitary force under DOD to avoid using the army to fight insurgents at all costs, stating it was "exactly what the communists want us to do." 75   Durbrow intimated that the Civil Guard could either fall under the DOD and be subject to the army manpower limitations or fall under the Department of the Interior and be subject to limitations on its weaponry and training. 76 The MSUG maintained its viewpoint that the Despite this unfinished debate, Williams and his MAAG personnel continued to organize and train the Vietnamese. Working with the Vietnamese leadership, the MAAG divided Vietnam into military regions and assigned ARVN units to each one. Williams disbanded TRIM after the French departed in April 1956 and replaced it with the Combat Arms Training Organization (CATO), which was responsible for all advisory efforts. He placed his deputy in charge of inspecting ARVN units on a rotating basis to help determine the state of training and readiness and developed a 31-week training plan for each unit to complete. What he found was not surprising for a brand new army in a developing country, but the rate of improvement for basic infantry skills and the lack of emphasis on training in some units were causes for concern. The disparity between units often was stark. For example, one of the best units, the 2nd Field Infantry Division, was rated as "barely satisfactory in training" in March 1957 due in part to its participation in security duties. 80   In March 1958, however, it received a rating of superior. 81 Furthermore, its leadership had acted quickly on deficiencies, with nearly all of them corrected prior to the next MAAG inspection three months later. In contrast, the 13th Light Infantry Division showcased one of the worst examples of the ARVN. During the MAAG's first visit in December 1956, the deputy was told that the division had completed no training since it was operationally fighting the insurgency. 82 This claim was fabricated; the unit was actually training for a parade. 83 Over a year later, the division had accomplished virtually nothing and was rated as "barely satisfactory in training" and as possessing a poor combat potential. 84 The MAAG deputy continually pressed the units he visited to stop conducting security operations so they could focus on training, but this request ran the risk of allowing the security situation in the countryside to deteriorate. Clearly there was a balance between security and training, especially considering the ongoing debate over the Civil Guard, but 80 MAAG-V, "2nd Field Infantry Division Training Report," March 31, 1957, Entry 16, Box 2,  MAAGV AGD, Training Visit Reports, 04/1956-12/1958, RG 472, NACP.  81 Ibid. 82 MAAG-V, "13th Light Infantry Division Training Report," December 31, 1956, Entry 16, Box 2,  MAAGV AGD, Training Visit Reports, 04/1956-12/1958, RG 472, NACP.  83 Ibid. 84 MAAG-V, "13th Light Infantry Division Training Report," March 31, 1958, Entry 16, Box 2,  MAAGV AGD, Training Visit Reports, 04/1956-12/1958, RG 472, NACP.  Additionally, the North had a 235,000 man paramilitary force to "conduct internal security, defense, and guerrilla functions." 91 Facing this formidable force, the MAAG counted on an ARVN of 140,620 personnel who were still battling the forces of the religious sects as late as December 1957. 92 The MAAG assessment stated that "the Viet Cong ground forces are well trained, highly indoctrinated, and have the capability of executing sustained and highly effective operations through all types of terrain with minimum logistical support." 93 The force disparity and difference in quality was reminiscent of Korea, but the limits set by Washington remained unchanged.
Even with the South's force disparity vis-à-vis the North and an internal security plan dependent on the underequipped, undertrained Civil Guard, the year 1958 ended on a relatively positive note. ARVN divisions and regiments had three to four officer advisors, each headed by colonels for the former and majors for the latter. Although Williams had resisted the diversion of ARVN units to fight the slowly increasing guerrilla movement, Diem launched a major effort that seriously weakened the Viet Cong in the southern provinces. 94 The security situation began to change rapidly in 1959, however, and the advisory effort's early mistakes and issues it could not fix would be magnified greatly by a renewed and highly motivated communist insurgency. 91 MAAG-V, "Narrative Study," August 24, 1954. 92 MAAG-V, "Country Statement for Vietnam as of 31

War with no serious impact on the North's ability to infiltrate men and supplies into the South. 7 This engineering marvel was made possible by the same fervent dedication displayed by the troops who would travel its length over the next 14 years to fight the increasingly formidable RVNAF and its American backers.
In May 1959 the CIA reported that the Communists numbered only 2,000 active guerrillas in the South, yet it warned that the Civil Guard and Self-Defense Corps, who bore the brunt of anti-guerrilla activities, were "inadequately trained and equipped for the job, and units from the armed forces have continued to be called in to meet special This chapter will frequently use anti-guerrilla, counter-guerrilla, and counterinsurgency interchangeably. The first term is typically used to describe defensive measures against guerrillas, the second is typically for offensive measures, and the third is a comprehensive civil-military approach. In the early 1960s, these terms were often mixed in documents and communications. 9 MAAG-V, "Memorandum To: Chief of Staff and Each Division Chief,"

Unlike in Korea, or even Greece, where a greater state of emergency existed, the communist threat grew slowly in Vietnam. Thus, even though the chain of command was functioning poorly, there was less pressure on the senior U.S. advisor to insist on the removal of weak officers at the highest levels as Van Fleet had in Greece and Korea. For example, General Ty, who the MAAG identified early as a poor choice for Chief of the JGS, served in that role until his health forced him to retire in 1963.
As communist pressure increased in 1959, Williams sought a way to provide greater assistance to the ARVN that struggled against the VC as a result of "inadequate planning, logistical snarls, lack of aggressive execution of plans, failure to use proper chain of command, [and] lack of aggressive leadership." 21 The ARVN seemed to be holding its own only a year earlier but was suddenly having problems combatting a rather weak enemy. Citing common practices in the Greek Civil War, Williams requested permission to send U.S. advisors on ARVN operations to assist in mission planning and to provide better combat reports to assess ARVN effectiveness and the communist threat more effectively. 22 Williams's superiors initially balked at the idea of U.S. forces directly participating in ARVN combat operations, arguing that in 1947 conditions in Greece had deteriorated to the point where U.S. advisors were required to be "the behind-the-scenes director of the operation

As VC attacks increased, Diem searched for innovative ideas that would halt the deteriorating situation with the least possible effort. 25 Against MAAG advice, he directed the creation of an elite force of 10,000 commandos (later Rangers) and requested that the MAAG provide anti-guerrilla training for the rest of the ARVN. Diem communicated these thoughts to Durbrow in February 1960. 26 They caused significant anxiety within an already divisive civil-military relationship in Saigon. Ambassador Durbrow, who had long resisted the arming and training of the Civil Guard to the standards that General Williams desired, then championed anti-guerrilla training. He used the ARVN's poor performance to criticize Williams's insistence on withholding the ARVN from internal security operations and training and organizing it primarily for defense against a northern invasion. Williams argued against the commando units since he felt it was either a veiled request for more forces when the United States was already footing most of the RVNAF's bill or an ill-conceived plan that would absorb many of the best soldiers from an already underperforming army and complicate operations that were already being executed poorly. 27 Ultimately, the commandos were an elite unit of sorts, and were probably the best fighters in the ARVN, but their creation was a distraction from more fundamental problems.
Diem's request launched what has become a perennial debate over the type of army that the United States built, which continues today. For example, historian Max Boot argues that in Vietnam, U.S. advisors failed to create a constabulary force as in previous advisory efforts, instead organizing "a miniature version of their own armed forces, complete with heavy armor, artillery, air force, navy, marines, [and] rangers," because the advisors believed that " the most likely threat would come from a Korean 25 See Spector for a narrative and map of major VC actions between 1957 and 1959.

The cost was poor coordination and reduced effectiveness against what was still a small communist insurgency. What was needed was a single commander with the authority to direct the counterinsurgency effort as in Greece and the Philippines, but this sort of authority was not forthcoming. It would be up to Williams's replacement to change the course of the war, but the events of the second half of 1960 would further cement Diem's obstinacy with respect to personal loyalty and centralizing power. 
Ngo Dinh Diem may forever remain an enigmatic figure, at least in Western eyes.
Never married, monastic in his personal habits, Catholic in a sea of Buddhists, and devoted to Vietnam, he has been judged an effective ruler by historians such as Mark Moyar, and by others as having maintained his power due only to American support. 38   Having solidified his power, Diem set about transforming his country. One of his most serious challenges was his lack of competent officials since the French had dominated the government administration. Unlike in Korea where the U.S. occupation force gradually turned over government administration to trained Korean replacements, the sullen French 38 Moyar, Triumph Forsaken, xiv.  left the Vietnamese wholly incapable of running their own country. 39 Thus, Diem had little choice but to rely on those he knew and trusted, an action toward which he was already inclined. A lack of other competent Vietnamese gave him an excuse to maintain this attitude or rely on Americans or holdovers from the French regime, which made him look less connected to the Vietnamese he supposedly served. 40 Diem's concern was to reform South Vietnamese society into a modern, independent country while simultaneously warding off communist influence and infiltration. His policy combined classic counterinsurgency techniques of economic reform and population control with a military response to attempt to separate the peasants from VC elements trying to recruit them.
To address peasant grievances and compare favorably to what was happening in the North under Ho, Diem initiated land reform in the South. He lowered rent payments in 1955, and in 1956 he limited landowners to owning no more than 300 acres, and allowed peasants to buy land on credit. 41 The effect of this reform was minimal. After six months, only 2,000 peasant families had availed themselves of 12,000 acres total. 42   Furthermore, in many areas, the Viet Minh had seized land during the French War and signed it over to the local southern peasants who now considered it theirs. In many cases, the Government of Vietnam (GVN) simply reclaimed such land and offered it for sale to the same peasants.

express their support for Diem and an anti-communist South Vietnam. Thus, absent any influence on the real problems plaguing the ARVN, the plan offered no innovative solutions.
As Eisenhower turned over the presidency to John F. Kennedy, he emphasized the deteriorating situation in Laos and did not mention the events in Vietnam. 74 Kennedy, who had made lofty promises to support allies in his inaugural address, nevertheless reviewed the situation in Vietnam, with Lansdale in attendance, in January 1961. Asked for his opinion following his recent visit, Lansdale pointed out three criteria for success:
First, the Americans in Viet-Nam must themselves be infused with high morale and a will to win, and they must get close to the Vietnamese; secondly, the Vietnamese must, in this setting, be moved to act with vigor and confidence; third, Diem must be persuaded to let the opposition coalesce in some legitimate form rather than concentrate on the task of killing him. 75   Lansdale did not elaborate on the feasibility of the second and third criteria, which were clearly the most important and were issues that Lansdale himself had proven unable to affect. The question was not what needed to happen but rather how to make it happen.
This critical point was either ignored or simply not considered by the others in the room.
In the ensuing weeks, Kennedy considered replacing Durbrow with Lansdale but was ultimately dissuaded. 76 Anxious to attack the problem despite a lack of GVN support and his own concerns about "whether the situation [in Vietnam] was not basically one of politics and morale," Kennedy approved the CIP in February 1961. 77 An early champion for all things special, including Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs, Kennedy would 73 "1.

Furthermore, in May 1961
McGarr's "First Twelve Month Report" reflected his optimism about what the MAAG had been able to accomplish. It had taken over six months for his recommended 20,000-man increase of the RVNAF to be approved, but that was quickly followed by an additional 30,000 in conjunction with Johnson's visit. Meanwhile, the November 1960 coup, the situation in Laos, and the new administration served to delay attention on other necessary changes. He claimed to have streamlined the chain of command and ensured that Field Command, the position between the Joint General Staff and the army corps, "became the overall tactical headquarters . . . charged with the coordination and direction of all, countrywide, counter-insurgency operations." 94 Field Command, created in 1959   before McGarr arrived, ended up being a largely ceremonial post to appease U.S. demands rather than the type of counterinsurgency czar position that Magsaysay had held in the Philippines, and General Alexander Papagos in Greece. Other successes included better coordination between different military branches during operations, improved intelligence capability, and a successful national presidential election that saw Diem reelected without significant communist interference. 95 Regardless, the Kennedy administration had other plans for providing support to South Vietnam. The MAAG's days as an independent, limited support element to Diem's regime were soon coming to an end.
In October 1961 President Kennedy sent General Maxwell Taylor to Vietnam to assess the Viet Cong threat and the current U.S. and GVN efforts to combat it. In his report from the mission, General Taylor proposed "a shift in the American relation to the Vietnamese effort from advice to limited partnership." 96 Taylor explained that the limited partnership "requires change in the charter, the spirit, and the organization of the MAAG in South Vietnam. It must be shifted from an advisory group to something nearer-but not quite-an operational headquarters in a theater of war. The objective of this shift is clear. The U.S. should become a limited partner in the war, avoiding formalized advice on the one hand, trying to run the war, on the other." 97 Taylor proposed this nebulous relationship alongside a menu of recommendations including sending 8,000 combat troops as a symbol of U.S. commitment, increasing the MAAG to 2,400 personnel, and sending combat support assets like helicopters and light aviation assets. 98   Taylor's mission report tacitly admitted that all attempts to advise the highest echelons of Diem's government had failed. It proposed a new relationship that was poorly defined, not agreed upon by the host nation, and emphasized a bottom-up approach to advising that presumably would affect the fighting more directly by placing advisors with battalions and province chiefs. The mindset was that the advisors would succeed at the lower levels and that this success would bubble up to the higher levels to solve the RVNAF's fundamental problems. This thought process was contrary to the experiences of the MAAG's predecessors in Greece, Korea, and the Philippines. 
Van
Lansdale, as a member of the mission, recommended a radical shift in U.S. practices. He proposed for example, declaring sub-limited war, employing mobile U.S. civilian-military teams to pacify the villages, and embedding U.S. counterparts in the GVN who "would give the firm guidance of a friend to the Vietnamese official in that position," yet remain "very much in the background and encouraging Vietnamese initiative." 99 These ideas did not receive much follow-on discussion, perhaps because they were so fanciful.

Nevertheless, with little precedent or reflection on how to accomplish objectives so far unrealized with similar methods, the president signed National Security Action Memorandum 111, which offered additional helicopters and airplanes, intelligence assets, patrol boats, advisors, and economic aid-but no U.S. combat formations-to South Vietnam. In exchange, it called on Diem again to broaden his government's base of support and reform the military. Most significantly for the MAAG, it authorized a new organization tasked with the vague mission, "to carry out the other increased responsibilities which accrue to the U.S. military authorities under these recommendations."

In an attempt to better prepare its advisors for the expanded mission in Vietnam, the U.S. aerial observation, which were inherently more force-heavy than advisors, who only numbered a few, at most three, per battalion. 114 The number of support personnel would balloon in the coming years to far outnumber the advisors. In response to Krepinevich's argument, the majority of the actual advisors in Vietnam had attended some sort of advisor training prior to their arrival.
The influx of advisors to battalions and provinces had mixed results, which seemed to be far more dependent on the Vietnamese unit commander than the limited partnership model under which the advisor was supposedly operating.

In contrast, the report's assessment of the Strategic Hamlet program was a reason for optimism. It recognized the reckless overzealousness of the program's construction schedule but nevertheless credited it with shifting 160 villages and over a million South Vietnamese from VC control to RVN control. 129 On the surface, it appeared that U.S. and RVN leaders had found a formula that had some prospect for eventual success despite the increased pressure that North Vietnam had been placing on the South. Unfortunately, the events of the second half of 1963 left the question unanswered as to whether the advisory effort had turned a corner in Vietnam.

Any hope that replacing Diem would result in a significant improvement in the security environment in South Vietnam was overly optimistic. Foreign Service Officer Frank Scotton recounts:
We installed and collaborated with a family dictatorship and later embraced a cabal of generals who were previously French sergeants.
Finally, the Washington perspective seemed, even then (to me), clouded with doubt, second guessing, scarcely any knowledge of the Vietnamese we supported, and no understanding at all of the national communist party. Almost every American falsely thought of the communists as an intrusion by North Viet Nam into South Viet Nam. Failure to recognize that the party was national in character and generally central Vietnamese in leadership, with grim commitment to unification, was (looking back) inexcusable. I was thinking, at the beginning of January 1964, that if our policy was to consolidate and preserve an independent South Viet Nam, that mountain was a lot higher and steeper than it had seemed in 1962. 134   The official U.S. Army history notes that following the coup, ARVN "morale dropped to a new low by mid-1964," and "two successive coups created numerous changes in the command structure and seriously impaired the administrative and military efficiency of the Army." 135 Its fighting performance also decreased.

There are many reasons why the advisors could not achieve their goal of a South Vietnamese Army that could adequately defend South Vietnam from internal and external threat. The two reasons at which the advisors worked on a daily basis were devotion to country and leadership. As Vice-President Nixon had suggested in 1954 while the anti-communist Vietnamese were fighting for the French, the Vietnamese lacked a cause around which they could rally. In his way, Diem tried to unite his country, but neither he nor the military junta that followed was able to develop the level of nationalistic fervor that the North did. It would be a mistake, however, to adopt the point of view of Paul Kattenburg, an East Asian specialist in the State Department, who wrote years later, "The real weakness was the Vietnamese didn't want to fight. I mean they never did, at any time. They had chosen comfort and easy living over the miserable existence of the Viet Minh and the Viet Cong." 156 The RVNAF suffered 110,000 killed and 500,000 wounded. 
157
The most tangible reason for failure was the senior military leadership. earned President Diem's trust, but neither one ever forcefully argued for Diem to relieve his cronies and replace them with proven fighters. Once the generals took over, they continued the practice such that in December 1974, on the eve of the North's final offensive, the CIA was still disparaging the poor quality of RVNAF commanders. 159   From the beginning, internal security was the besetting problem in Vietnam, by which both popular apathy and official incompetence were piteously exposed. The guerrilla forces in the South were only estimated at 7,000 in 1960. 160 The Greeks, in the Philippines and Greece were largely successful, while the mission in Korea built an army that was adequate for internal defense, but found itself outmatched by a more heavily armed North Korea. In Vietnam, the advisors entered a military and political labyrinth in which both subversion and aggression fueled and reinforced each other in ways that proved impossible to disentangle. In the end they were unable to build a South Vietnamese Army sufficiently effective to sustain an anti-communist regime in Saigon.
Despite signs that advisors there were not achieving U.S. goals, successive administrations stuck with them until the conflict reached a point at which the United States had to commit its own combat forces if it was not to suffer outright political defeat.
In advance and in practice, it is not easy to recognize the conditions under which an advising effort is likely to succeed, though there is obviously value in trying to do so to the greatest extent possible. There are many cautionary statements about advisory efforts, particularly those concerning the U.S. experience in Vietnam. A postwar study concluded that "aid and advice, especially when based on misconceptions, cannot provide a client state with the requisite leadership, determination, and cohesion to defeat a pervasive and sophisticated insurgency." 
1
effort in Iraq, Walter Pincus wrote, "Vietnam should have taught the U.S. that as an outside power-with no common language, culture or history-Americans cannot bring about national unity in other countries." 2 If examined in isolation, these observations seem accurate enough, and certainly proved true in Vietnam, which is offered as the exemplary case. Korea, however, presented a different, more successful scenario that somewhat belies Pincus's conclusion. The Americans in Korea faced all of the same challenges in language, culture, and history as those in Vietnam but still created an effective force relative to its original mission, which was to provide internal security. The same can be said for the Philippines and Greece. In Korea, in contrast to Vietnam, it was the success of counterinsurgency in the South, rather than the failure, that induced the North to choose general war.
It would be irresponsible and historically ignorant to discount advisors altogether based on their achievements in these cases and others. The challenge is recognizing where advisors might be effective, and, once committed, whether they are actually achieving U.S. objectives. It would also be irresponsible to suggest a strictly formulaic approach to advising; that is, if conditions a, b, and c are met, then advisors will succeed.
Peter Murphy suggests this approach in his article on the success of Chinese assistance to North Vietnam while simultaneously pointing out that "the U.S. continues to have difficulty finding similar success" in its assistance efforts. 3 Murphy argues that even though the "Vietnamese Communists consistently demonstrated more motivation to fight . . . the Chinese must have done something right in their military assistance efforts." 4 He then discusses three reasons why the Chinese were successful: they had a shared historical relationship with the Vietnamese, their support was appropriate for the North's infantry-centric army, and the Vietnamese Communists did not become dependent on Chinese assistance. 5  Presumably, the United States failed in Vietnam because it got these three things wrong, but this argument implies that if it had gotten them right, the outcome would have been drastically different. Furthermore, while America could choose where it intervened, it could not choose the circumstances of the political and military environment prior to its intervention. Although many Americans disdained their Vietnamese counterparts and the equipment provided to the South created a dependence on continued American support, Murphy's factors were far less important than the much larger shortcomings of poor leadership and will to fight in the RVNAF, whose inclination and ability to accept the assistance being offered was a crucial requirement of success. Without Chinese aid, the North would have continued fighting with whatever it had, but without U.S. aid, the South would have collapsed much earlier than it did. Furthermore, in Greece, Korea, and the Philippines, the United States did not meet all of Murphy's criteria either, yet it still met with varying levels of success.
A comparable parallel to Murphy's scenario was the support that the United States provided to the Afghan mujahedeen in their war against the Soviets in the 1980s.
There, the United States found itself in something like China's role in Vietnam, supporting an ideologically committed, independent ally of sorts who, like the North Vietnamese, would have fought the Soviet occupation with whatever it had. Thus, successful Chinese advising in Vietnam was far more dependent on the North's devotion to its own cause than on any secret advising formula that the Chinese implemented.
Northern leaders developed this cause, and it resulted in superior leadership and national will in the North versus the South. These two elements were clearly the most important in all four cases.
Other factors do matter, however, and to the extent that they can be identified or understood at an early stage, will go a long way in contributing to the success or failure of an advising mission. The following elements are by no means prescriptive, but they do represent some of the most observable and influential factors that advisors face. They are presented in logical order, conceptually speaking, but their relative significance in practice will obviously shift depending on the given situation.
The most decisive trait for a host nation force is its willingness to fight and die for its cause. For advisors, this trait is also the most difficult to influence, and a lack of it may be a major reason why an advisory mission was formed to begin with. Furthermore, the friendly side's motivation must be judged relative to that of its enemy. It is not enough to be somewhat motivated if the enemy is passionately committed. In the four cases here, the Communists' willingness to fight was well established and allowed them to hang on for as long as they did, or win in Vietnam's case. In the Philippines and Korea, U.S. advice and assistance provided the small push needed to overcome internal conflicts within those governments and armed forces. The Koreans, with the habits they had learned from the Japanese, had to be restrained, if anything. The Filipinos, at a stalemate when Ramon Magsaysay took over, were plenty willing to fight Huks, but lacked the organization and leadership to do so effectively. Greece and Vietnam saw the greatest disparity of will between the host nation force and their communist enemies. In the former, the advisors overcame the difference through changes in leadership, increased materiel, and poor decisions made on the communist side. In the latter, the advisors had little influence over any aspect of the environment-besides delivering military equipment-that would have contributed to an improvement in South Vietnam's will.
U.S. support raised morale, especially in the short term, but in none of the cases did the U.S. support diminish the requirement for the host nation force to prove it could ultimately fight and win on its own.
Where advisors have the greatest potential for exercising a positive influence on the host nation force is in the development of its leadership. In Greece and Korea, General James Van Fleet played a key role in pressing for the relief of weak leaders. The advisors in Korea had an even greater influence since they were present from the birth of the ROKA and helped select its initial leadership. Ramon Magsaysay filled this role in
From the standpoint of what Washington can influence directly, the selection of the senior military advisor is the single most important decision to get right, assuming a decision to intervene in the first place. Since big decisions matter most, the higher the level of real influence, the greater the impact of that advice. It is equally true that the wrong person will have less influence than the right one. For example, in Greece the queen personally requested General Van Fleet, and his influence there was significant.
Likewise in Vietnam, President Diem repeatedly requested Edward Lansdale's return, but internal U.S. politics precluded this. Whether it would have had the results desired will never be known. Instead, Washington depended on Generals Lionel McGarr and Paul
Harkins, neither of whom possessed Lansdale's track record and personal credibility.
Van Fleet's outsized influence in Greece helped save that nation from whatever the communist insurgency might have won, but it also nearly derailed the political process and stunted the necessary military leadership when he supported General Papagos as emergency dictator, in contrast to the recommendations of Ambassador Henry F. Grady. In Korea, the advisory effort received short shrift until it finally came under the command of a general officer in 1948, which placed it almost three years behind its northern adversary. General Roberts's overly optimistic reports might have given the impression that the South was in no danger. When war came, Roberts' absence from the country, as he was on his way to retirement, placed the advisory effort and its advisees in an even worse position than the neglected one they were already in. In the Philippines, the role of the senior advisor was relatively insignificant since Magsaysay was such a forceful personality and enacted all of the significant changes necessary to turn the situation in the government's favor. In Vietnam, the succession of questionable commanders invites the question of how they were selected or left to remain for so long.
Of the factors affecting advisory operations, terrain and geography seem almost too banal to consider. Yet they are also the easiest to appreciate, even with only a rudimentary knowledge of the host nation's people or politics. A simple glance at a map gives a feel for the challenges that could be faced prior to committing any forces. In Greece and Vietnam, the long, shared borders with neighboring countries, which either sheltered known communist supporters or were incapable of serving as a barrier to infiltration (e.g. Laos), frustrated efforts to rid the country of communist insurgents. In contrast, Korea and the Philippines benefitted from easily isolated terrain that allowed their forces to choke off the guerrillas effectively. Although U.S. leaders recognized the challenges in Greece and Vietnam, there was little they could do about them. The neutralization of Greece's borders depended almost exclusively on internal bickering within the communist bloc, while the mountainous inland terrain in Vietnam was a recognized communist refuge that was never effectively neutralized.
External support, or the absence thereof, played an important role in all four cases. The U.S. ability to affect it was largely a function of geography. In Greece, the 
The four cases here generally saw a good working relationship with the host nation government, although Vietnam saw an increasingly strained partnership in the year preceding the coup against Diem. Rather, the critical factor is whether the host nation government has the support of the people through whatever means necessary. As such, a cult of personality can supersede actual government effectiveness. In Greece, the king and queen actively sought public venues and opportunities to visit the troops to build that, at least on the margins, Congress may be inclined to view military advising as a form of crisis management, rather than of long-term capacity-building. It is fact when immediate tactical pressure recedes that conditions are best suited to establish credible forces through advising. The result in Korea, and perhaps Vietnam before the U.S.
buildup, was an insufficient army vis-à-vis its opponent. This failure to invest resulted in far greater expenditures than might have been required if made earlier. The notion that advisory efforts are cost-effective does not mean that they will feel cheap at the time.
Often they will feel like the sort of long-term investments that are all-too-easily shortchanged.
Dysfunctional civil-military relationships among the senior Americans assigned to a host country pose a risk to the advisory effort and require constant review by Washington leadership to ensure that U.S. objectives are not undermined by personality conflicts that are directly under U.S. control. In Greece and Vietnam there were serious disagreements between senior civilian and military representation. In Greece, Ambassador Grady and General Van Fleet disagreed on General Papagos's possible appointment as emergency dictator and on Van Fleet's proposal for another GNA manning increase following the inconclusive 1948 campaign. In both cases, Grady won out, which probably turned out to be better than the alternative.
In Vietnam, the poor relationship between Ambassador Durbrow and General
Williams could hardly have benefitted the advisory effort. With Durbrow taking a much stronger position toward Diem than Williams, the two were never able to apply adequate pressure for the most critical changes that the South needed. Civil-military disagreement within a country team is not a bad thing in itself and is no doubt inevitable to some extent, but if it creates deep chasms of lasting discord, then it is detrimental to the mission and should be addressed by replacing one or more of the individuals involved.
The way the host nation organizes its forces is one of the key issues on which advisors should provide insight for their counterparts. The natural tendency for U.S.
advisors was to build institutions similar to those in the United States and provide instruction based on U.S. Army tactics. Critics like Andrew Krepinevich and others have criticized this mirror-imaging approach, but the recipients of this advice showed themselves capable of adapting it to the environments in which they operated. In Greece, for example, U.S.-supplied equipment such as artillery and aircraft was relatively plentiful, even though the United States would only support a 145,000-man Greek National Army (GNA). Also, since the Greek Communists decided to directly confront government forces, the GNA did not require much in the way of special formations to defeat the communist Democratic Army. The Greeks did develop small numbers of commandos for special missions and the National Defense Corps to garrison cleared areas, but they fell under a unified chain of command and had clear responsibilities. 9 The advisory efforts in Korea and the Philippines were likewise streamlined, with the Filipinos specifically adapting their battalion combat teams to the requirements needed in the jungles and hills of Luzon.
In contrast, the Vietnamese approach to defeating the Viet Cong was the 10 At various points, there were the ARVN, the Civil Guard, the Self Defense Corps, the Gendarmerie, the National Police, the special forces, the Republican Youth, and the Hamlet Militia. Robert G.

Army Counterinsurgency Doctrine,

Much was made of the U.S. failure to properly organize the ARVN to conduct counterinsurgency-that it was organized to conduct conventional combat against an invasion from the north, which rendered it incapable of defending against VC attacks. This argument is overly simplistic, and worse, implies that there is a magical organization that will ensure success against an insurgency. U.S. advisors regularly used standard U.S. infantry doctrine to instruct their counterparts, which had been sufficient for previous advisory efforts. The Greeks, Koreans, and Filipinos showed that they were not hindered by following U.S. organizational advice as they successfully defeated their internal threats. Likewise in Vietnam, the ARVN's formal organization was less important than its operational employment. General Williams constantly pushed for the ARVN to stay out of the counter-guerrilla fight and leave it to the paramilitary and police forces on the notion that this was a lesson learned from Korea. Had the Koreans followed the same advice and concentrated uniquely on maintaining border security, the communist-inspired internal unrest likely would have grown and might have even made the North's 1950 invasion unnecessary. Advisors need to ensure their advice emphasizes the immediate threat, especially when, as was the case in Vietnam, the United States is willing to defend an ally with combat forces.
When it comes to advising, few subjects receive as much attention as advisor selection and training. Proponents like John Nagl argue for a permanently established advisory capacity, with Nagl himself proposing a dedicated advisory command of 20,000 personnel under a lieutenant general.

According to historian Benedict Kerkvliet, the traditional landowner-peasant relationship during Spanish rule meant the landowners were responsible for the well-being of their tenants, which included free loans of rice and other assistance during the hard years. In return, the tenants were expected to reciprocate as the landowner might request. This relationship began to deteriorate with the introduction of U.S. capitalist "enlightenment," as landowners became more concerned with profit-making and less concerned with the welfare of their tenants.Kerkvliet, Huk Rebellion, 8.

Office to implement all non-warfighting activities. 109 These included many ancillary services that were meant to address grievances and reduce Huk influence in their strongest areas. Magsaysay made his military judicial system available to adjudicate land disputes. He established a direct line for everyday Filipinos to send messages directly to his office for a very small fee and medical care to civilians hurt during government operations against the Huks. Finally, and most controversially, he opened a land redistribution program to reformed Huks. 110   While the military actions of attacking and eliminating Huk forces and safe areas were the decisive effort, civic actions played an important role in showing that the elected government could address many long-standing peasant frustrations. They gave the Huk rank and file a reason to quit the organization and return to a normal life, perhaps in an even better condition than they had been in before. Magsaysay took liberties as Secretary of National Defense to establish some of these programs even though he did not specifically have the authority to spend defense dollars on domestic programs. He saw them as necessary to counter Huk messages of agrarian reform and land redistribution.
The most renowned of these efforts was the Economic Development Corps (EDCOR), which was a resettlement plan with land grants and pardons for Huk prisoners who promised to renounce fighting the government and become peaceful farmers. This plan consisted of land set aside on Mindanao and settled by retired Filipino soldiers into which the government introduced a small percentage of reformed ex-Huks. This program gave Huks the choice to achieve what they were ostensibly fighting for while offsetting the humiliation of surrender. Despite its promise, the EDCOR resettlement program was never an overwhelming success. Perhaps only two hundred Huks relocated to the farms, and fewer than half of those surveyed had even heard of it before surrendering. 111   Furthermore, it served as ammunition for Magsaysay's opponents in the 1953 presidential 109 Lansdale, Midst of Wars, 70-71. 110 Blaufarb, Counterinsurgency Era, 31-34. 111 Currey, Unquiet American, 99; Alvin H.

Good fortune seemed to surround Magsaysay in nearly every endeavor. His rise to prominence in Filipino politics, including his rapid ascension to head of the Committee on National Defense despite possessing zero experience before 1946, was remarkable.
Magsaysay, whose personal qualities included an ideal balance between ambition and benevolence, came to the attention of U.S. decision makers at the right time, which may have helped him advance to the post of Secretary of National Defense. Immediately following his appointment, at least some luck intervened to allow his forces to develop the intelligence and operation that netted nearly all of the Huk communist leadership in one masterful stroke. That he survived, despite an overwhelming desire among the Huks to assassinate him, was merely the final impossible act of his success against the Huk enemy. Valeriano and Bohannon assess the differences between the two most prominent leaders: "Luis Taruc, most influential of the Huk, achieved that position because of his love for his fellow men and his distorted view of a society in which he was unable to work his way through school. Ramon Magsaysay defeated him because of his love for his fellow men and his clear view of a political system that enabled him eventually to 129 Pierson reports that of the 417M peso budget, 180M pesos went to national defense.

As the Second World War wound down, France moved to resume control of its pre-war colonies in Indochina. 136 President Roosevelt, rhetorically a staunch anticolonialist, declined to take a definitive stance against this move, stating that a decision on Indochina's future was "a matter for post-war." 137 His death in April 1945 removed this potential external impediment to France's reassuming its position in Vietnam, and the following month Washington assured Paris that the U.S. government had no record of ever "questioning, even by implication, French sovereignty over Indo-China." 138 France had won the tacit approval of the most important postwar power to resume its station in Vietnam.
Following the Japanese surrender, Chinese Nationalist and British troops occupied north and south Vietnam, respectively.  149 The combination of negative factors-an unpopular colonialist occupying power, the lack of a Vietnamese alternative to the Communists, a large and motivated enemy force, and a shared border with another communist countrywas more daunting than at the outset of any previous advisory effort.

The outbreak of the Korean War in June reinforced the fear of a general communist ascendancy in Asia and led to the commitment of even greater resources for Indochina. 154 U.S. leaders initially debated providing aid directly to the Bao Dai government in recognition of its supposed independence, but French leaders protested vehemently. In the end, Washington capitulated and provided aid directly to the French. This decision meant that French politics would dominate Washington's foreign policy in Indochina through 1954.
In the months prior to the MAAG's establishment, the Viet Minh had pushed the French out of their fortifications along the Sino-Vietnamese border, allowing unfettered infiltration of men and materiel from Communist China and crushing a large French force 150 "The Position of the United States with Respect to Indochina," report,

Improvements in advice or assistance that could be learned from America's KMAG experience would not change this critical difference.
January 1953 brought President Dwight Eisenhower to the White House. He had run on a party platform that lambasted President Truman's administration for abandoning Eastern Europe and China to communism and withdrawing forces from Korea "in the face of aggressive, poised for action, Communist military strength on its northern border." 188 Additionally, he pledged fiscal responsibility in foreign policy in contrast to Truman's large "sums [of money] incompetently spent for vague and endless purposes." 189 These conflicting aims met in NSC 148, which set as its goal "reducing the organized forces of the Viet Minh" through "increased aid to the French and Vietnamese." 190 Despite his campaign rhetoric, Eisenhower's foreign policy position toward Vietnam remained unchanged from that of his predecessor. In his first State of the Union Address in 1953, President Eisenhower called the war in Korea "the most painful phase of Communist aggression throughout the world" and assessed that it was "clearly a part of the same calculated assault that the aggressor is simultaneously pressing in Indochina and in Malaya." 191 This statement reinforced the idea that all communist and anti-colonialist movements were interconnected, both materially and ideologically.
Following Dien Bien Phu, the French leaders' position on U.S. involvement in training the VNA suddenly changed from haughty rejection to enthusiastic invitation. 2   Acting on this change in attitude, O'Daniel began preparing to assume the VNA training role and to build an army that reflected a combination of Trapnell's light division idea and his own Redland campaign plan. Accordingly, he recommended the creation of four light and five medium VNA divisions. 3 He also recognized the need to increase the size of the MAAG since it had never numbered more than 100 personnel. He recommended an increase to 492 personnel and made a point to note its relationship to other advisory groups, (e.g., "larger than JUSMAPG (Greece) . . . and considerably smaller than KMAG (Korea).") 4 In contrast-and more realistically-the JCS estimated that a training mission of 2,250 U.S. personnel was required to build the type of force that Vietnam required to face the Viet Minh at its current strength. The Philippines had a stable government with regular elections, had an established army that outnumbered its enemy, was geographically isolated from outside communist support, and had no external threat. Vietnam had none of these attributes. Thus, deploying Lansdale as a sort of mythical cleanup man was a testament to his talent but was in many ways naïve.
Lansdale nevertheless quickly gained the ear of Diem and became one of his biggest supporters and most frequent American confidants.
As he demonstrated in the Philippines, Lansdale's talent was psychological warfare, and he assisted Diem in the promotion of and the media impact of Operation Passage to Freedom, the voluntary movement of Vietnamese between North and South following Geneva. To win the media war against communism, it was useful to show a mass migration 9 John Foster Dulles was Secretary of State, and his brother Allen Dulles was the Director of Central Intelligence.

Vietnam. 33 He subsequently established the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) in December. French and U.S. differences in Vietnam, Diem's anti-French sentiments, reduced U.S. funding for French forces, and French troop requirements in North Africa led to the withdrawal of nearly all French forces from Vietnam in 1956. The United States and Vietnam were on a shared path to wherever Diem's actions might take them.
In this tumultuous political environment, Diem's brother, Ngo Dinh Nhu, emerged as Diem's closest confidant and as the most important actor for events taking place behind the scenes. Judging from his memoire, Lansdale was unaware of Nhu's involvement in the same activities that Lansdale was undertaking for Diem. For example, Lansdale chronicles Diem's request in 1955 that he coordinate with Trinh Minh Thé, an important Cao Dai militia commander, to aid in bringing Thé over to the government's side to help break the sects' power. 34 In Lansdale's version, he is the single mediator, and he coordinates Thé's shift of allegiance and 2,500 militia troops to the government side. 35 In actuality, Lansdale and the CIA may have supplied the money necessary to bring Thé over, but Nhu and Diem conducted the critical negotiations. 36 Nhu was also the leader in the creation and growth of the Can Lao party, which essentially made South Vietnam a single-party state. Despite Lansdale's caution that silencing opposition through intimidation would be ultimately detrimental, Diem allowed his brother to continue, and a culture of fear and suppression began to grow in the South. 37 Frustrated with the Ngo brothers and the Embassy staff who tended to restate the U.S. position of supporting Diem, Lansdale left Vietnam in 1956. He had helped to install Diem in power amidst a quietly emerging insurgency, and he never returned for more than a few weeks until after Diem's death in 1963. Lansdale remained one of Diem's most ardent supporters due to their friendship but was unable to steer the stubborn president in what he considered to be the right direction. Even America's most 33 The elections were held on 23 October 1954, and Diem declared the creation of the Republic of Vietnam on 26 October. For more on likely voting fraud, see "Despatch

Although Washington had approved a Vietnamese army of fewer than 100,000, it was apparent by mid-1955 that the 170,000 soldiers remaining after Geneva would never shrink to the size that Washington had approved. The original concept was that the reduction in manpower would be accompanied by an improvement in quality by retaining the best soldiers, but VNA leaders simply did not reduce the organization's size as Collins had directed. 49 Diem's efforts to gain control over the sect forces by moving them into the VNA created additional upward pressure on the army's final numbers. Thus, in June 1955
the MAAG recommended and the new ambassador, Frederick Reinhardt, concurred with a 170,000-man army that eventually would be reduced to 100,000 by the end of 1956 when conscription would be enacted. 50 Conscription would have allowed for a reserve force to be trained, and conscripted soldiers would be paid less than volunteers. This larger army was to consist of four field divisions, eight light divisions, thirteen territorial regiments focused on internal security, and an airborne regiment. 51 While this force represented a more realistic appraisal of the military imbalance between north and south, it was still insufficient for the potential threats it faced.
In October 1955 Lieutenant General Samuel Tankersley Williams replaced O'Daniel as Chief of MAAG and went on to serve the longest tenure of any senior U.S.
military commander in Vietnam. 52 Williams had a colorful background. He was relieved of his position as assistant division commander of the 90th Infantry Division shortly after D-

with President Diem suffering a failed assassination attempt during a visit to the Central Highlands on 22 February 1957. His narrow escape did not seem to faze him immediately, but it did signal that the Communists were already able to strike virtually wherever and whenever they chose. Speaking later, Williams described the VC soldier as "capable of undergoing hardship . . . clever, cunning, and utterly ruthless," and as someone who would
"not hesitate to behead a village Mayor and place his head on a stake in the center of the village." 64  While the Civil Guard awaited a U.S. decision on its future, it made do with the weapons it could acquire. These weapons were often turn-of-the-century French rifles with ammunition that was just as old. Furthermore, the Civil Guard often found itself guarding the most remote posts while the army kept the posts closer to civilization and markets. 78   Thus, the force least able to defend itself due to its poor weapons and training was also the least likely to be quickly reinforced if under attack. As VC activity began to increase, especially in 1960 and beyond, the Civil Guard naturally suffered more attacks and greater casualties. 79  the right balance was never fully resolved. For his part, Diem often took action on the training reports, relieving junior officers whose units were found to be lacking. 85 Notably, he did not hold higher-level officers like colonels and generals accountable in the same manner out of fear of making powerful enemies. 86   Diem's relationship with senior military leaders was a reason for concern looming over the ARVN, and it resulted in a lack of qualified senior officers since they were promoted due to loyalty, rather than competence. For example, when Williams pressed him to assign a permanent army chief of staff, Diem selected General Le Van Ty. Ty had been a captain in the French Army prior to service in the VNA and simply wanted to retire when Diem appointed him to replace Hinh in 1954 as the interim chief of staff. 87 According to his U.S. advisor, Ty could not speak Vietnamese very well, was not a keenly intelligent officer, and had the maximum potential of company command. 88 Other problems dealt with officers sent to the United States for professional training. Although they were supposed to be gaining military knowledge to bring back to their fledgling army, many senior officers spent more time in leisure activities like shopping and sightseeing. The younger officers who excelled in U.S. schools were often sent to other jobs, instead of returning to their units where they could pass on their knowledge. Thus, the effectiveness of the officer corps suffered, and the education it received did little to contribute to the ARVN's combat ability. 89   In August 1958, the MAAG estimated that North Vietnamese forces consisted of "268,000 regular army troops organized into 14 infantry divisions, 1 artillery division, 1
anti-aircraft artillery groupment," and multiple independent regiments and support units. 90  supported coup against the Diem regime and the transfer of power to the same ARVN leaders that had proven incapable of defeating the Communists.
Following the Geneva Accords, the number of Vietnamese Communists remaining in the South was probably between 10,000 and 15,000. 2 While Ho Chi Minh and the northern communist leaders held out hope for a reunification through elections, they nevertheless decided in 1955 to implement a five-year plan that focused on consolidating power in the North, recovering economically, and expanding the People's
Army of Vietnam (PAVN). 3 Communists in the South focused on laying the groundwork politically for renewing the struggle to unite all of Vietnam but refrained from fully committing to revolutionary warfare. 4 By early 1959 there were fewer than 5,000 party members due to Diem's 1958 anti-communist offensive. 5 Diem's government was winning the near-term battle. Who would win the long-term war depended on the North's willingness to expand the struggle.
In what would become a historical milestone, the Communists met in 1959 in
Hanoi and decided to liberate South Vietnam. 6 To support this goal, they also decided to 2 Duiker cites 10,000-15,000. Khuyen cites as many as 50,000 remained. William J.

This chapter generally uses Viet Cong (VC) when referring to communist forces in the South, North Vietnamese Army (NVA) when referring to forces in the North, and Communists when referring to Vietnamese Communists. 4 The official North Vietnamese history calls it "armed propaganda," which consisted of proselytizing the party message and opportunistic anti-government acts of violence.

By the end of 1959, the ARVN consisted of the seven new standardized divisions, an airborne brigade, four armored battalions, a marine group, a helicopter squadron, three corps headquarters, a Joint General Staff (JGS), and a field command that ostensibly directed the three corps to free up the JGS from warfighting. 13 These elements were layered on top of as many as six military region headquarters, including the capital region, and a system of province chiefs that all wielded or attempted to wield control over the forces assigned to them or that operated in their area. The Civil Guard (CG) and Self Defense Corps (SDC) forces typically fell directly under the province chiefs, who reported to the Ministry of the Interior. This reporting structure handicapped the paramilitary CG and SDC interoperability with ARVN units. The RVNAF had recreated virtually the same divided chain of command that failed in the Philippines. With a professional senior officer corps, this convoluted chain of command would have been less of a problem, but the steps that Diem had taken since 1954 cemented dysfunction into the very core of the RVNAF leadership.
Having faced down General Hinh's prospective coup in the latter half of 1954, Diem favored loyalty over military ability in selecting his highest ranking officers. 14 As Thomas Cantwell writes, the result of these early decisions was that "factionalism, mistrust and envy, not unity, soon became a permanent part of the army at its highest levels and represented a fundamental problem which [the] ARVN never solved." 15 The problem was that the Vietnamese leadership did not always recognize its shortcomings and maintained a dismissive attitude toward some of the MAAG's most important recommendations. 16 As General Williams continually pointed out even at the end of his tenure, there was a general attitude that training was secondary to virtually anything else. 17 Diluting control over the armed forces by anyone but Diem contributed to the regime's stability, but resulted in paralysis, miscommunication, increased possibility of fratricide, and loss of situational awareness during military operations. 18 It also further contributed to commanders ignoring orders, because a conflicting order might soon follow from some other source. As a 1960 U.S. Army study illustrated, "an example of conflicting and duplicating channels of command is where a division commander receives orders from both the corps commander . . . and the region commander in whose region his division is stationed. Another example is where the President, by means of his SCR-399 radio net (NCS in a radio van in the garden of the presidential palace) sends operational orders to a regiment direct[ly], bypassing the Department of National Defense, the general staff, the field command, the corps and the division." 19 This tangled web resulted in poorly coordinated operations and multiple battlefield seams that the Communists could use to their advantage. 20   16 One advisor recounted a story in which a Vietnamese corps commander returned from visiting the ROKA in Korea. Asked about what he had learned from the Koreans, the Vietnamese major general replied that he learned that he should visit his troops in the field. General Williams was upset that the U.S. advisor had not passed this basic leadership point on to his counterpart. The general's U.S. advisor had recommended that action on numerous occasions, but the Vietnamese general simply ignored the advice. Brigadier General Charles P. Symroski and Nathaniel P. Ward, Interview by Ronald Spector,

In April 1960 after realizing that the ARVN was in worse shape than he originally thought, Durbrow requested that Williams answer a series of questions concerning the ARVN's ability to conduct the type of warfare that it was becoming increasingly obvious needed to be waged. Broadly-speaking, Durbrow accused Williams of resisting antiguerrilla training for the ARVN, of misleading him as to the amount of training being completed overall, and of making the ARVN less capable of fighting guerrilla forces due to his elimination of the light divisions. 30 Williams, in a clear sign of frustration with Durbrow, and perhaps with the ARVN's poor performance as well, responded with a vehement defense of his plan and his organization's accomplishments. He noted that the division reorganization followed a period of intense study and testing and resulted in divisions suited to fight either internal or external aggression. He argued that the ARVN 28 Max Boot, The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power (New York: Basic Books, 2014), 288. Tom Ricks makes virtually the same argument, stating that Williams created "versions of the U.S. Army divisions of World War II-that is, regular forces designed for regular, stateon-state war." Ricks omits the part of history where those divisions fought Japanese forces that employed guerrilla tactics in their campaign to retake Pacific Islands. Thomas E.

was more interested in moving people to otherwise unused land, rather than redistributing the land in the areas where they already lived. 44 In this fashion, Diem drew on his own extensive knowledge of Ramon Magsaysay's EDCOR program in the Philippines, which used unoccupied land to control population density and build a spirit of accomplishment among the population. By relocating loyal South Vietnamese and giving them land, Diem hoped to create a "human wall in the depopulated area near the three frontiers

Secretary of State, which were larger government reforms similar to those laid out by the Caravelle Group in April. 63   Even though the August 1960 CIA report had predicted that Diem's government was in no immediate danger, on 11 November 1960, ARVN paratroopers surrounded his palace and called on him to reform his government. 64 The coup leaders' demands were essentially the same as those laid down in the Caravelle Manifesto seven months earlier.
In a disingenuous maneuver to buy time, the Ngo brothers agreed to the rebels' demands while they coordinated with nearby loyal units to move to the capital. These units included armor, and within 36 hours, the coup was over. The Ngos were still in charge, and Diem wasted no time rescinding any agreement to reform. 65 Throughout the affair, both Durbrow and McGarr worked with the coup plotters to calm the situation and 61 CIA, "Special National Intelligence Estimate 63.1-60 Short-Term Trends in South Vietnam," CIA (August 23, 1960), 1, http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0001166419.pdf. 62 "190.

Even at its height, the Americans would not have the authority to make the drastic changes the ARVN required to win.
McGarr then lists the strengths and weaknesses of guerrillas, in terms generally favorable to the Viet Cong. For example, he notes "lack of coordinated firepower" as a weakness for the VC, but dismisses it since ambush and withdrawal tactics do not require additional firepower. 70 McGarr's plan involved a number of fanciful and mutually contradictory concepts, such as populating the entire length of the border with loyal Vietnamese, or conversely, removing the entire population along the border to create a five-to-ten mile wide free fire zone in which anyone wandering through could be targeted and killed. He does go on to prescribe some important tactical improvements that the MAAG could reasonably affect, such as improving tactical air control and pushing counterparts to conduct more night operations. About the only thing he really gets right is his assessment of the guerrilla when he writes, "to understand the success of Partisan-Guerrilla Warfare, we must go to the very basis-the wellspring of its power. This is MOTIVATION-the imbuing of a people and a cause with a sense of PURPOSE!" 71 January 1961 brought Edward Lansdale back to Vietnam to assess the situation at the same time that the Saigon Embassy's Counterinsurgency Plan (CIP) arrived for Washington's review. Drafted apparently without any GVN involvement, the majority of its most critical recommendations depended on the GVN to perform them. These recommendations meant significant changes in current GVN organizations and processes.
In summary, the recommendations were largely the same as those made many times before to strengthen popular support. 72 In the military realm, it concurred with McGarr's 20,000-man increase in the ARVN and prescribed vague measures like "take 70 McGarr, "Anti-Guerrilla Operations," 5.

use Vietnam as the testing ground for a revamped strategy of containing communism through surreptitious and inexpensive means. 78 When presented with the CIP, Diem was hesitant to commit, which was likely due to the actions the plan required him to take.
What followed was a weeks-long disagreement between McGarr and Durbrow over the preferred method to persuade Diem to support the CIP, with Durbrow supporting coercion and McGarr recommending persuasion. 79 At about this time, the CIA estimated that Viet Cong strength in the South had reached 8,000-10,000 and that the Communists controlled "one-half of the entire rural region south and southwest of Saigon." Over 2,600 civilians and government officials were assassinated in 1960. 80 The McGarr-Durbrow disagreement-never truly resolved-coincided with the approval of Durbrow's replacement, Ambassador Frederick Nolting, who assumed his post on 10 May 1961.
While the administration was contemplating action in Vietnam, it was simultaneously coping with the Bay of Pigs disaster and the crisis in Laos that Eisenhower had warned about. These events, along with the increasingly dire intelligence reports, likely contributed to a growing sense of urgency within the Kennedy administration, which formed a Presidential Task Force on Vietnam and began considering the introduction of U.S. combat forces. 81 The U.S. takeover of the Vietnam problem had begun in earnest. As a result of this renewed emphasis on Vietnam, in April 1961 Kennedy approved a 100-man increase in the MAAG to 785, an ARVN increase to 170,000, and a Civil Guard increase to 68,000. 82 He took these steps despite his special counsel's, Ted Sorensen, noting the day before in reference to South Vietnam, that "there is no clearer example of a country that cannot be saved unless it saves itself-through 78 Robert B.

In Korea, the massive U.S. infusion of men and materiel created a natural separation that allowed the MAAG to continue its separate duties. In Vietnam, the support assets were relatively minor-two companies of helicopters, intelligence assets, and light aircraft.
With a four-star general in charge, at least four other generals on the staff, and an implied mandate not to copy McGarr's wait-and-see approach to the South Vietnamese insurgency MACV had to at least appear very busy and make progress. 108  The new plan also readdressed the ARVN chain of command problem, but it proved to be a final effort in futility. ARVN Field Command, established ostensibly to centralize the war-making effort, never actually wielded that authority. MACV's recommended reorganization in November 1962 eliminated Field Command and established four corps zones as the primary organizations responsible for security in their zones. 110 The reorganization did little to address any of the ARVN's fundamental problems such as favoritism, nor did it result in the removal of the recalcitrant generals known to be plotting to launch a coup. Conventional advice had met its limit in South Vietnam, and it is doubtful that a more intrusive method would have had better results.

William Westmoreland ultimately rejected the idea due to concerns over security of sensitive intelligence, the political requirements associated with managing the national requests for specific positions on the staff, and possible communist accusations of imperialism. 143 Although the complications would have been significant and the likelihood of communist infiltration increased, it was probably the only way for the United States to have a chance to have a positive impact on the ARVN's most obvious weakness. 144 An unimpressive ARVN incursion into Laos in 1971, and the North's 1972
Easter Offensive led to some notable leadership changes, but often those replaced simply moved to higher positions where they wielded even more influence. 145 By then, of course, it was far too late for such changes to matter. As the official MACV history concludes, in 1975 "Saigon's forces still were plagued at the end by the same problems of weak and corrupt leadership, high desertion rates, and uneven tactical performance that had afflicted them at the beginning." 146 These were aspects that advisors had addressed for 18 years and had proven unable to fix. 147 In contrast, the North's ineffective generals were dead or had been replaced by a regime of iron ideological determination, which feared defeat more than it feared its own soldiers.
When the final hammer blow came in 1975, South Vietnam fielded an ARVN of 450,000 soldiers, 325,000 Regional Forces (previously the Civil Guard), and 206,000
Popular forces (previously the Self Defense Corps). 148 These ground forces were backed 143 Cosmas, MACV Escalation Years, 349.
144 As an example of what might have been possible regarding ARVN leadership, the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) mission was able to secure the relief of many provincial level officials. There was no corresponding effort in the RVNAF.As Moyar writes, from 1968 to 1971, CORDS contributed to the relief of 14 of 20 provincial chiefs and 84 of 124 district chiefs.

The decisive thrust came directly at Saigon, like the Easter Offensive three years earlier, which the ARVN had only stopped with the help of massive airpower and advisor support. With these two assets no longer available due to Washington's decision to reduce support for Vietnam, the Vietnamese could not hold. Throughout this final campaign, the South Vietnamese resistance was wholly unimpressive. 151 The 18th Division at Xuan Loc east of Saigon stood apart as a unit that put up fierce resistance, and there were many acts of small unit and individual suffering and bravery. 152 There simply was not enough of it.

North Vietnamese at every opportunity. 153 This resistance did not happen, either out of fear, apathy, or outright support for the Communists. These were characteristics that the advisory effort as envisioned by 
Eisenhower, Kennedy, Taylor, McNamara, Lansdale,
The United States' twenty-five year relationship with Vietnam's anticommunist struggle began and ended with military advisors. Generally impotent during the French Indochina War, the advisors shouldered the heavy responsibility of creating a South
Vietnamese army that could withstand the larger, better-led People's Army of Vietnam, and a Northern strategy that featured internal subversion instead of overt invasion as the primary means to undermine South Vietnam's government. 154 The RVNAF's effort to combat this threat saw peaks of apparent success as in the late 1950s and valleys of abject failure in the early 1960s, which finally led to the introduction of U.S. troops and unprecedented airpower in an attempt to save the situation. 155 Even this relief did little to solve the South's critical shortfalls. In response to diminishing U.S. public support and general war weariness, President Richard Nixon's administration carried out Vietnamization, a euphemism for a complete turnover of the war effort to the South Vietnamese and the departure of all U.S. forces. The war's waning days saw advisors and air support play critical roles in support of the ARVN's attempt to fight off the NVA's
Easter Offensive in 1972. When the advisors departed in 1973, there was nothing left, 153 The last Chief of the Joint General Staff, General Cao Van Vien insists that, "from the beginning to the end, the RVN leadership had always been determined to fight against the Communists and refuse to accept them into the South Vietnamese community through coalition. . . . Thus, despite accumulated losses, political disturbance, social malaise, and war weariness, the people of South Vietnam continued to fight against the Communists in order to live in freedom." Cao nevertheless abandoned his post in the days before the fall of Saigon and fled to the United States like many other senior commanders. Cao

the Philippines with American backing, ridding the army of political generals and promoting fighters like Napoleon Valeriano. In Vietnam, a succession of senior U.S. military advisors recommended organizational changes to the army but placed little emphasis on finding higher level commanders whom Diem trusted and who were competent. The pressure to solve this problem fell ultimately on State Department civilians, who opted for Diem's removal, rather than continue to urge reforms that failed to result in substantive change.
The transformation evident in the Greek Army following General Papagos's appointment to head the anti-communist campaign shows the potential for influence on this factor, but U.S. selection of allied leadership has great potential for unforeseen problems. If Washington gets in the habit of selecting other countries' leadership, advisory efforts will lose their veil of providing assistance to allies and assume the role of puppeteer that communist and Islamic militant propaganda labels the United States. 6   Furthermore, the U.S. eye for foreign talent is dubious. Even General Papagos initially proved to be problematic as he demanded a huge increase in the army as the price for an offensive. In Vietnam, the United States identified the generals who replaced Diem as worthy successors, but they proved to be just as susceptible to cronyism. The most that could be reasonably expected is to push for the replacement of political generals with proven combat leaders and to recognize when the leadership problem is beyond repair.
The mistake in Vietnam was doubling down on an advisory mission with some additional military technology that would not solve the military's fundamental problems of poor leadership and mediocre will. In Greece, Korea, and the Philippines, the advisors were able to effect meaningful change at the highest levels, which then improved the entire advisory effort. support for the Nationalist cause. Likewise in the Philippines, Ramon Magsaysay tirelessly moved around the countryside to engage with the population as a benevolent, concerned member of the government. In both cases, the actual reforms that the Greek and Filipino governments were able to make in the short time span of their respective wars was relatively minor.
In contrast, President Diem was more reclusive but enacted more reforms during his time as president. If he had coupled these programs with greater efforts to reach out and secure public affection and confidence for himself, perhaps he would have maintained greater support for his government. Although he had a deep concern for the peasantry, he never seemed to appreciate the value of establishing himself as a charismatic figure. It is obviously wrong to imagine that the solution to all political problems resides with a man on horseback, but in circumstances in which a country becomes visibly dependent upon powerful outsiders, it is especially important that it possess leadership capable of embodying the nation's hopes and symbolizing its identity.
Exactly how this can be done must vary with individual cases. But it will always be important.
U.S. Domestic Politics: Advice Is Free. Advisory Missions Are Not.
Throughout the period addressed in this study, U.S. domestic politics played either a supportive or limiting role in the execution of military advising. The separation of powers in the U.S. government means that, while the president and cabinet may decide to employ military advising to advance American policy, they are dependent on Congress to fund it. In all four of the cases studied here, the annual appropriations cycle injected uncertainty into the amount of money that would be available for assistance, which meant ambassadors and senior advisors would submit requests in December for the next fiscal year, which began the following October. 8 Furthermore, there was almost always downward pressure from Congress on the amount of military aid that it was willing to fund. This pressure was particularly intense during non-crisis periods, which suggests techniques. Further, the tour of duty for advisors should be of sufficient duration to be effective and to assure continuity." 16   While these recommendations seem like common sense, they imply that the advisors' shortcomings were mostly to blame for the failure to build an effective RVNAF, rather than the RVNAF's own impossible-to-overcome weaknesses. Of course, testing the BDM proposal will likely never happen since highly trained specialists take years to create and require either knowing in advance where they will be needed or creating them for every country. Moreover, by the 1970s, there were many U.S.
personnel with years of experience in Vietnam, including John Paul Vann, Edward
Lansdale, and Rufus Phillips, but they did not seem to make any difference. Considering Lansdale and Phillips had been involved in Vietnam from the beginning of U.S.
intervention, there is little reason to believe that a more highly trained group of advisors would have been any more effective at overcoming the South's internal politics. Also, the other three conflicts resulted in effective armies with what the BDM study would consider to be a group of amateurs. A conflict that hinged on the cultural sensitivity and language skills of the advisors versus the quality of the advice and whether it was adopted by the leadership and aggressively acted on, would be an extreme statistical anomaly. Surely better training is always preferred, but a highly trained group of advisors is just as dependent on the host nation for success as a group of amateurs. Better training
is not a substitute for bad decisions made elsewhere. These recommendations also imply that better tactical-level results can somehow make up for poor strategic decisions.
Advisory efforts are no different from regular warfare in that respect. Expecting a bottom-up approach to revolutionize an army is wishful thinking.
Scholars and practitioners point to current advisory efforts in Colombia and the Philippines as successful models for limited U.S. intervention in another country's internal conflict where a larger U.S. presence might be detrimental or prohibitively 16 BDM Corporation, Strategic Lessons Learned, VI-31.
