Knowing that partisan activity, guerilla, irregular, and hybrid warfare have been and will forever continue to be relevant methods of combat to wage war, it seemed to me that Russia was implementing something new and different.
As I researched what many (but not all) scholars and Russian experts refer to as "non-linear warfare," 1 I realized the significance of the threat posed by non-linear warfare coupled with the will and intent of Russia's leaders.
I conclude in this paper that as much as we would like to believe Russia will eventually become a responsible, open, and democratic nation, this is not the goal of Russia's current leaders.
I identify one specific and tangible step that the US should take to counter Russia's increasing and relatively unchecked belligerence-increasing the size and capability of military forces in the Baltic States.
