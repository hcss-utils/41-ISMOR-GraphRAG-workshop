The difference between "Lessons Recorded" and "Lessons Learned" is institutional attitudes toward learning.
If the artillery community continues to just write down lessons rather than learn from them, there will be a steep price to pay if the United States ever has to fight a peer or near-peer adversary, especially one that uses artillery as its main effort.
Through innovative thought, better technology, and relevant doctrine, U.S. artillery can support maneuver and ultimately defeat any threat that may present itself in the future.
This is a common goal everyone in the military should understand and ultimately work to achieve.
Russia learned many lessons written in blood in unconventional and conventional wars in Chechnya, Georgia, and Ukraine.
The United States has been out of the conventional realm for some time now and cannot afford to learn those same lessons in blood.
The U.S. should take the time to learn from the lessons of the Russians and implement them into a U.S. framework, so the United States military does not have to suffer casualties to improve.
