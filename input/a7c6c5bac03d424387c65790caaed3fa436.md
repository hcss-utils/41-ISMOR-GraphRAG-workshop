Arguably, cyber has begun to change how the U.S. we fights, or at least how we think about future wars.
However, we military professionals have not yet codified new doctrinal concepts that drastically deviate from conventional combined arms maneuver.
This is largely due to the pace of technological advancements.
For example, in the time that a technological exploit is realized a reaction and counteraction are developed.
This makes it difficult to determine, with precision, the trajectory that technological innovations will take.
Technology will have to stabilize to give doctrine a chance to codify and achieve validation.
Future research should analyze Russia's use of cyber in its limited wars against Estonia, Georgia, and their current adventures in Ukraine and Syria.
