The Army leadership development model in use today emerged from the late-19th century Army reforms and proposals made by Major General Emory Upton.
In the 1870s, he conducted an exhaustive survey of military organization and doctrine in the armies of France, Germany, England, Persia, China, and India.
Upton identified the primary challenge facing the U.S. Army as the need to create and foster a profession of arms in a society that had long valued the citizen soldier as the centerpiece of its national security.
Borrowing heavily from the models he found in Prussia, Upton proposed the creation of a standing general staff, a formal process for officer examination and promotion, and the creation of a number of professional schools to teach military science.
One of the most important reforms that Upton proposed was the concept of lineal promotion.
