the period from 1970 to 2015, from changes to U.S. military policy that resulted from the Vietnam War through years of persistent conflict following the September 11th, 2001, terrorist attacks. In spite of significant changes in the strategic context during this period, the fundamental laws underpinning U.S. military policy remained largely unchanged. Military policy did evolve through Army policy changes and congressional appropriations, although these generally reinforced the existing tripartite structure of the Army. To deal with the strategic, domestic, and financial constraints of the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Defense adopted the Total Force Policy. In its implementation of the new policy, the Army adapted the force mix within its three components to, when combined, fulfill the demands of war plans. The Regular Army was designed predominantly around combat forces to meet contingency timelines, while increased reliance was placed on support forces in
The current institutional arrangement of the Army, which comprises a Regular Army and two reserve components-the Army National Guard of the United States and the U.S. Army Reserve-has been the same since 1940. As a result, a conventional wisdom has developed that this structure is appropriate to the time and unchangeable. When debating the Army's size, appropriate roles and functions, and the laws required to authorize, empower, and govern the Army, U.S. policymakers often think about evolutionary institutional modifications and rarely question the underlying assumptions that led to this structure. It is easier to tinker with the existing Army than to consider fundamental changes to the Army's statutory foundation. This four-volume history of U.S. military policy argues that little about the Army's organization is unchangeable or constitutionally mandated, a fact that should give policymakers license to explore a wider range of options for the Army of the future. 1  The National Commission on the Future of the Army (NCFA), which Congress established as part of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015, is a case in point.

The notion of a coherent and constant traditional military policy stretching from the earliest days of the Republic to today is, however, a myth. U.S. military policy evolved substantially between the writing of the Constitution and 1940, and very little has changed since. Indeed, the term military policy was not used in the United States until the late 19th century, when Brevet Major-General Emory Upton introduced the term to Army thinkers. As used by Upton, the term military policy connoted matters pertaining to the U.S. Army, such as the laws that govern the institution and the policies for wartime expansion. Today the term continues to refer to Army matters to the exclusion of the other Services. The term traditional military policy first appeared in the 1940 Selective Service Act.
We highlight the etymology of the term to underline the fact that today's military policy is not the result of a coherent tradition but rather the distillation of over two centuries of debates and compromises between various competing interests, many of which arguably reflected the political and cultural debates of the day at least as much as the need to meet the military requirements of the nation's security. For each generation since the writing of the Constitution, ideology, political culture, and institutional momentum have limited the discourse on military policy and constrained the range of options available for serious consideration. Indeed, the current force structure is strikingly different from anything the Framers of the Constitution imagined. Although the notion of doing so was once considered anathema, the United States now entrusts its national security in part to a standing, professional force-its Regular Army, augmented by two largely part-time yet highly professional standing reserve components. Once organized to defend a growing nation protected by two oceans, the U.S. Army today is postured to deploy globally on very short notice.
One important example of how the use of the term traditional military policy can be misleading is the current Title 32 of the U.S. Code, which states that "In accordance with the traditional military policy of the United States, it is essential that the strength and organization of the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard as an integral part of the first line of defenses of the United States be maintained and assured at all times."

One of the more fundamental developments explored in this series of reports is the subtle yet significant shift in the constitutional basis upon which the Army is built. Simply put, the Constitution includes one clause that empowers Congress to "raise and support Armies" and two other clauses that provide for "calling forth the Militia" of the states, as well as the authority to organize, arm, and discipline them "as may be employed in the Service of the United States," for the purpose of executing the laws of the Union, suppressing insurrections, and repelling invasions. The formulation assumed-accurately, at the time-that the states maintained their own militias or at least the means to raise them, even through conscription. Thus, the basic formula was for the country to rely on the "raise and support Armies" clause to maintain a small, standing federal army, but otherwise rely on the states and their militias to provide the bulk of the Republic's fighting forces. The militias evolved, as did their relationships with federal and state governments. In brief, the missions and personnel of militia referred to by the Constitution are not the same as the missions and personnel of what eventually became the National Guard. The evolution of the latter had less and less to do with state governments (and the Constitution's militia clauses) and more and more to do with the federal government (and the "raise and support Armies" clause).
In this four-volume series, we seek to establish an authoritative foundation for the debate over the best design for the future Army force. Drawing on archival research of primary sources and a survey of the historical literature, we trace the emergence of the laws that govern the Army today. This history has policy relevance because it shows that change in military policy is both possible and perhaps appropriate. When senior political and military leaders design Army force structure, thinking should not be constrained by such historically and politically loaded terms as traditional military policy. When imagining a future force, senior political and military leaders should recognize that current statutory foundations could be further defined and refined to enhance the Army's ability to meet the nation's dynamic security needs.

Along the top of the figure, we provide the strategic context across five periods-emerging America, the Civil War and the war with Spain, the World Wars, limited wars, and the Global War on Terror-as well as the nature of the Army in these periods. Along the bottom of the timeline, we highlight the specific historical

In Volume I, The Old Regime: The Army, Militias, and Volunteers from Colonial Times to the Spanish-American War, we trace the history of military policy from the colonial era through the Spanish-American War. This period is critical for understanding the genesis of the basic structure of today's Army and the various factors that informed that structure. For a combination of strategic, cultural, economic, ideological, and political reasons, the Republic decided against establishing a standing army large enough to handle a major conflict and instead relied on a variety of mechanisms for raising volunteer units and marshaling state militias to expand or augment the Army. There was a basic split between proponents of a professional federal force, who judged the state-provided militias as militarily ineffective and too often contributing to an irresponsible loss of American lives, and those who opposed or feared the idea of a standing federal force (and its costs) and wanted to rely on "the people at arms," i.e., the citizenry organized by the states as militia units. The result was a compromise-an increasingly professional yet small Regular Army and various kinds of volunteer forces and state militias upon which the federal government would rely when the Nation needed to field a much larger force. However, authorities and responsibilities between the federal government and the states regarding the militias were not well established, nor were any mechanisms to ensure that the militias were ready and well trained when "called forth." Nor was there any mechanism to ensure the militia forces from one state were organized, trained, and equipped like the forces of another state to facilitate their integrated employment.
Problems with military effectiveness and recruitment contributed to an evolution in the militia system. The state militias shifted over the course of the 19th century from a colonial-era compulsory force (more compulsory in some communities than others) of all able-bodied white males between certain ages to entirely volunteer units with ambiguous relationships to their state governments. States that provided funding to their community militias tended to exercise more oversight and control. The compulsory militias were all but defunct by the time of the Mexican War (1846-1848), and volunteer militias provided much of the bulk of the Union Army during the Civil War. Postwar, those same volunteer militia units-increasingly referred to as "National Guard"-began to receive more support from state governments (with some federal assistance) and evolved into today's National Guard. Still, their status remained vague, as did their relationship with the federal government and the Army. Mobilization remained largely ad hoc, and the country still lacked anything resembling the large and rapidly expandable militaries fielded by France and Germany in 1870.
The Spanish-American War (1898) was a major turning point. The nation mobilized much as it had for the 1846 Mexican War, using a combination of Regular Army troops, volunteers from states and territories, and state militias. Small Regular Army units were rapidly assembled from small outposts distributed mostly throughout the central and western states, where they rarely trained for any contingencies other than fighting any remaining Native Americans who had not been pushed out of the way and onto reservations and preserving the local peace. Because of concerns associated with the constitutional limitation of militia use beyond the nation's borders, some individual state militia units voted to decide whether they would be mobilized (federalized) for the war with Spain. Some agreed, and some declined. If the unit agreed, the militia unit was brought into federal service as a volunteer unit. Other units were raised purely as federal volunteers (e.g., Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders), bypassing the state militia system entirely. A large-enough Army was eventually raised under the "raise and support Armies" clause, but profound problems were identified across the force. All elements of the Army were largely unprepared for fighting as larger organized units. Many units were ill-equipped, the Army's logistical capabilities were inadequate for deploying and sustaining forces overseas, and the tiny Medical Department was overwhelmed by infectious diseases that spread quickly through the ranks. The Army's difficulties were so bad that, in spite of winning the war, the Secretary of War was dismissed.
The volunteer militia units varied considerably from state to state, with little consistency in terms of readiness, quality, equipping, tactics, etc. Interoperability among or between them and the Regular Army was far from assured. There was, moreover, no established mechanism for generating forces to serve overseas for lengthy periods of time. This became a problem when the United States found itself occupying the Philippines and then fighting an insurgency there. Now the nation required an expeditionary capability, and it needed a force large enough to sustain a long-term occupation.
Heavily influencing the military policy of the late 19th century and early years of the 20th century was the maturation of the National Guard as a political force. Influential members of the Guard in 1878 created a lobby group, the National Guard Association, that enjoyed considerable sway with the public and in Congress. Because of the Guard's political influence, military policy debates and the relevant legislation passed in the 20th century often represented political compromises between the National Guard and the National Guard Association, the Regular Army and War Department, Congress, and the President.

Volume III, Another War and Cold War, covers the period from 1940 to 1970 and examines how the Army, while retaining the basic legal underpinnings established by 1940, evolved in light of the radically different security requirements associated with the nation's emergence as a superpower and the need to maintain forces overseas and to rapidly respond in support of alliance commitments. Through this period-marked above all by the wars in Korea and Vietnam-there were vibrant debates regarding how best to generate the required forces, as well as different attempts by policymakers to balance military requirements with political concerns. These experiences led ultimately to the development of Total Force Policy, which was an effort to eliminate the need for conscription, except in special circumstances, and to further professionalize U.S. military forces.
of initiatives to leverage more fully the capacity of the American people. The Women's Army Corps, for example, brought women formally into noncombat positions in the Army. As it had during World War I, men who did not qualify for active service joined stay-behind state Guard forces to assume traditional National Guard state roles, such as responding to local unrest and disaster response.
The end of the war brought strategic changes, including the advent of the nuclear age and new views about America's role in the world. In the short term, however, strong public pressure again led to rapid demobilization, which nevertheless left the postwar Regular Army for the first time larger than before the war and larger than the National Guard.
In the years that followed World War II, U.S. political and military leaders tried to make sense of the new environment and what it meant for the size, mix, and employment of the Army's three components. On the one hand, many hoped that nuclear deterrence would allow the United States to maintain a smaller, less costly Army. At the same time, developments such as nuclear weapons, airborne operations, and longerrange bombers suggested that war, including attacks on the homeland or against allies overseas, could occur more quickly. To many military leaders and policymakers, these developments meant that the United States would need an Army in peacetime that could respond much more quickly than in previous decades. The United States would ostensibly no longer have the luxury of spending a year mobilizing forces for a major conflict, requiring the Regular Army to be larger, better trained, and better equipped at the outset of any conflict. In spite of this, postwar mobilization plans channeled the previous two world wars and assumed that the United States would once again have time to expand the Army through mass conscription, volunteerism, and mobilization of the Army's reserve components.
Two other issues, discussed in Volume II, reemerged during and immediately after World War II. First, thinkers such as retired Brigadier General John McAuley Palmer revisited the question of whether universal military training (UMT), which had been adopted in many European countries, could produce a sufficiently trained manpower pool of citizenry to allow for a smaller standing Regular Army. National Guard Generals Ellard A. Walsh and Milton Reckord, both former presidents of the National Guard Association, were among the most vocal of those who worried that UMT posed a direct threat to the National Guard. Others worried that UMT would militarize society without improving military effectiveness. Second, another plan called for reorganizing the National Guard and the Organized Reserves into a single reserve force entirely under federal control. The National Guard Association of the United States (NGAUS), Walsh, and others staunchly opposed such a plan, which would have undermined the Guard's peacetime autonomy as a state-based institution. Ultimately, neither proposal was adopted and the prewar statutory structure remained, but the debate revealed that the nation still had questions about whether this new era demanded changes to prewar military policy.
The North Korean invasion of South Korea in late June 1950 not only surprised the United States, it also demonstrated that the postwar demobilization had left the Army at a low state of readiness. As in earlier postwar periods, defense budget cuts had left the Army without sufficient men, training, or materiel. The 82nd Airborne, located in the United States, was the only Regular Army division deemed combat-ready by 1950. National Guard divisions were typically at about half strength. The initial U.S. force that rushed to Korea from occupied Japan, a makeshift battalion-sized formation from the 24th Infantry Division known as Task Force Smith, was unprepared for combat. It had hastily deployed from Japan to Korea with just 120 rounds of rifle ammunition per man and two days of rations, and few of its soldiers were combat veterans. In the face of North Korean assaults with superior numbers and weaponry, Task Force Smith suffered heavy losses and conducted a disorganized retreat. The United States relied on mass conscription during World War II, as its geographic isolation and powerful allies already in the fight provided much-needed time to assemble such a force. In Korea, however, the United States decided to come immediately to the aid of the militarily weak Republic of Korea, leaving no opportunity to mobilize as it had in the past.
President Harry S. Truman sought to reduce the risk of provoking a wider war with China or the Soviet Union. Believing full mobilization would signal wider U.S. ambitions, Truman only partially mobilized the National Guard and Organized Reserves. For the first time in the 20th century, the nation went to war without mass conscription. As no plan existed for mobilizing quickly for a limited war, American military and political leaders relied on ad hoc decisions. Congress approved a plan to mobilize Organized Reserve Corps individuals and units to fill holes and replace losses in deployed and deploying Regular Army units, as well as the cross-leveling of personnel, predominantly among Regular Army units. Second, the administration decided not to call up soldiers for the duration of the war. The resulting rotations of individual soldiers affected both morale and military effectiveness throughout the war. The Korean War experience demonstrated that to fulfill the new, more active U.S. role in the world, the United States needed a Regular Army that could deploy at any time, as well as selected reserve forces at higher readiness levels.
President Dwight D. Eisenhower's New Look national security policy sought to avoid limited wars like Korea and rely on the threat of nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression. After the Korean War, therefore, the U.S. Army began to reorganize to make the most of its smaller force structure in an era of austerity. With the Pentomic restructuring starting in 1957, it aimed to create smaller, highly mobile units capable of utilizing tactical nuclear weapons and fighting independently. Although the National Guard began reorganizing into Pentomic divisions, it also resisted other aspects of Army plans. Most notably, the National Guard sought to keep a large, undermanned force structure rather than fewer, fully manned units that would remain at a high state of readiness.
xviii The Evolution of U.S. Military Policy from the Constitution to the Present, Volume III
The Kennedy administration believed that the New Look policy and the Pentomic divisions were overly reliant on nuclear deterrence, which could not address all U.S. national security concerns. Problems with mobilization during the 1961 Berlin Crisis reinforced the administration's desire to build an Army that could respond to a wider range of threats around the world. The new Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) abandoned what was supposed to be a single standard division structure and instead sought flexibility by returning to a range of division types-infantry, armor, airborne, and mechanized-as the United States had had in earlier periods.
Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara also pursued a number of other reforms to make the Army more efficient. First, unlike others before him, he succeeded in reducing the number of National Guard and Army Reserve units, while generally preserving personnel end strengths and increasing readiness. Second, McNamara sought to fold the Army Reserve into the Army National Guard. Unlike previous plans for a single federal reserve, he wanted to keep the dual-status combined force rather than seeking total federal control. This plan, vehemently opposed by the Army Reserve, was abandoned after President Lyndon B. Johnson began calling up more forces for Vietnam.
Rather than activate units and members of the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve, President Johnson expanded U.S. forces in Vietnam by growing the Regular Army through volunteerism and conscription until 1968. He took this decision partly in a failed attempt to sidestep political debate about the expanding U.S. role in Vietnam at a time when he was also attempting to create and sustain an ambitious domestic agenda (e.g., the Great Society). Public backlash against the war, conscription, and an unfair system of deferments and exemptions grew over time.
Johnson's decision affected the Army National Guard in two important ways. First, the National Guard became a haven for draft dodgers, although some National Guard leaders protested the perception.

The Vietnam War and the way the Army expanded to fight it left a deep imprint on the institutions of government and the American public. Richard Nixon ran for the presidency in 1968 on a platform that included a pledge for peace in Southeast Asia. Upon entering office, President Nixon asked a commission to begin studying the idea of creating an all-volunteer force. This would be the first of many consequences of the war, which are discussed in more detail in Volume IV.
Volume II of this series described a series of laws adopted between 1903 and 1940 that substantially changed U.S. military policy and laid the statutory foundation for its evolution over the ensuing decades. The National Guard of the United States was statutorily recognized as a reserve component of the Army in 1933. However, National Guard units continued to be organized within states and accountable to their respective governors in peacetime, establishing the Guard's dual status, which continues today. In the same period, the United States also established the federal Organized Reserve Corps, which included the Organized Reserves, the Officers' Reserve Corps, and Enlisted Reserve Corps. The 1917 Selective Service Act gave the President the authority to draft men directly into federal service "for the period of the existing emergency," rather than going through state governors.

This volume considers 1940-1970, a period of substantial change for both the Army and the nation. The United States fought in a second world war, facilitated the advent of the nuclear age, and took on a much more active global role. Shifts in congressional appropriations and executive action led to a larger Army and evolutions in its organization. In spite of this changing environment, there were strikingly few alterations to the statutory framework for U.S. military policy that had been established by 1940.
Chapter Two describes how the United States expanded the U.S. Army to fight in World War II. The final wartime military mobilization by Americans along 19th century lines, the nation employed a small professional Regular Army, augmented by its National Guard and Organized Reserves, and expanded by mass conscription and volunteers.
Chapters Three and Four show how the war reignited discussion of plans for Universal Military Training and analyzes attempts at consolidating the National Guard and Army Reserve into a single, federal reserve with reduced ties to the states. Such proposals would likely have led to significant legal changes to U.S. military policy. Ultimately, however, none of these plans were adopted, at least partly due to objections from the politically powerful National Guard and Organized Reserves and the public's war weariness.
Chapters Five and Six discuss how the advent of nuclear weapons, the Korean War, and crises with the Soviet Union led to changes in Army organization; force structure; and the roles of, and resource allocation between, the Army's three components. Importantly, the need to respond to crises and limited wars led the nation to increase the size and readiness of its standing force, as well as the readiness of portions of the reserve components. Moreover, during the Korean War, President Harry S. Truman decided to expand the Army mostly through conscription, volunteerism, and mobilization of individuals, rather than fully mobilizing the reserve components in an effort to avoid provoking a wider war with the Soviet Union.
Chapter Seven discusses how the use of conscription on a relatively small scale in the Vietnam War (compared with U.S. conscription in the two world wars) still affected American society and the Army. This chapter also explains how the war in Southeast Asia launched debates about how the Regular and Reserve components of all services might be better organized, trained, and equipped. The emergence of the Total Force concept, as it relates to the Army, is discussed in greater detail in Volume IV.
In 1940, on the eve of American entry into World War II, the U.S. Army was premised on a small professional Regular Army core. Reinforcing the Regular Army were two reserve components: a comparatively larger National Guard organized into units, and a loosely skeletonized Organized Reserve that maintained a large pool of officers trained through the Reserve Officers' Training Corps program, as well as a much smaller pool of enlisted reservists. 1 Two legal changes in the interwar years gave the President and Congress a much better defined set of legal mechanisms and policies with which to mobilize the existing Army forces and the nation for war. The legal structure that existed before World War I had not allowed the Army to plan for mobilization of its reserves prior to the declaration of war. Legislation passed in 1916 and 1933 gave the President and Department of War new authorities. In execution, as a result of the 1916 National Defense Act, when federalized the National Guard would be part of the Army under the "raise and support armies" clause of the Constitution, as were the Officers' Reserve Corps and the Enlisted Reserve Corps. 2 The act's 1920 amendment combined the Officers' Reserve Corps and the Enlisted Reserve Corps into the Organized Reserves, which were trained by the Regular Army during peacetime in preparation for quick mobilization in a time of war. The act's 1933 amendment further clarified that the Guard existed as a reserve component of the Army, as did the Officers' Reserve Corps, including the Organized Reserves and the Enlisted Reserve Corps. 3  The government no longer needed to await a formal declaration of war to "call forth" the Guard, as the President could use the provisions of the 1933 act to order into the active military service of the United States "any or all units and the members thereof of the National Guard of the United States" after Congress had declared a state of national emergency and authorized the use of armed land forces. Together these laws allowed the federal government to begin planning to order the National Guard to join the Regular Army and Organized Reserves in active federal service as war loomed in the late 1930s, before the actual declaration of war in December 1941.
World War II brought new strategic realities that led to a change in the postwar force structure. After the war, the United States rapidly demobilized the Armed Forces, as was the tradition. Civilian leadership decided to maintain an unprecedentedly large peacetime establishment, however, in part due to military occupation responsibilities in Europe and Asia, although training and modernization suffered significantly in the immediate postwar euphoria. 4 This postwar change reflected the nation's role as a leader in global affairs and the reality that it would no longer have the luxury of more than a year's time to mobilize forces for a major conflict.

The American war machine began rumbling to life two years before the United States declared war in 1941. In 1939, Congress repealed the ban on the sale of materiel to nations at war. The subsequent avalanche of orders from France and Britain gave the 4 By 1948, the U.S. military numbered around 1.5 million, roughly four times the size of the interwar military at its largest. Despite a precipitous drop in manning levels-from 8 million personnel at its wartime height to only half a million by the late 1940s-the Army still remained its largest ever in peacetime following World War II.

With Germany's rapid annexations, invasions, and occupations of multiple European nations beginning in 1938, American fear of war increased, and with it the population's support for military preparedness and peacetime mobilization of reserve forces.
Simultaneously, Congress and the Roosevelt administration were working out the details for a peacetime draft, what would eventually be signed into law on September 16 as the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940. This act authorized Roosevelt to induct young men between certain ages for 12 consecutive months of military service, but also authorized the President to defer induction "of those men whose employment in industry, agriculture, or other occupations or employment, or whose activity in other endeavors, is found . . . to be necessary to the maintenance of the national health, safety, or interest," among other deferment categories.

Given the increasing likelihood that the United States would become involved in World War II, greater coordination of the air arm, the Army Air Corps, was needed. In March 1941, Secretary of War Henry Stimson directed that it be organizationally streamlined, ultimately leading to a reorganization that created the Army Air Forces on June 20. 20 By the close of 1942, the Army Air Forces consisted of 35 air groups, with numerous supporting units still in training. 21  By the spring of 1941, many activated Reservists, Guardsmen, conscripts, and volunteers alike were halfway through their anticipated 12 months of service and growing restive. Training was proceeding apace, but events in Europe and Asia had reached a lull, and it did not appear to some as though U.S. intervention would necessarily be required. 22 The first troops ordered to active duty in September 1940 anticipated their release in October 1941, in spite of dilatory congressional debate over whether their service should be extended, and in spite of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau's May 1941 recommendation that their active duty be extended indefinitely. 23  Despite military policy over the preceding decades that aligned the National Guard more closely with the Army, the discordance between professional federal and 19  Kreidberg and Henry, 1955, pp. 574-574; Weigley, 1984; Kent Roberts Greenfield, Robert B.

A businessman with many years' knowledge of the Army checked in here last week jittering about our mobilized National Guard. "They don't know what they're doing," he said. "They haven't learned it takes a lot more than a uniform to make a soldier. . . . The basic trouble," he says, "is that the Guard doesn't realize it is in the Army now. The regulars do, and they are working their heads off. . . . We thought the Guard and the Reserve would fill the gaps when expansion time came, but if they're going to fill it the way they're doing now they'd better stay home."

We have the basis for protective action in the Selective Training and Service Act to meet this threat. There we have the foundation of the entire matter. The whole issue at stake is simply this: Is the situation critical? Is there an emergency? I say distinctly that such an emergency now exists. 37   When questioned as to whether he believed that the security of the United States might be imperiled without the continuation of service for more than 12 months, Marshall responded, "I do, emphatically, believe that it is quite possible, that the safety of this country might be imperiled." 38  Major General Milton Reckord, former NGAUS president and Adjutant General for the State of Maryland, and at the time commander of the recently activated 29th Division, backed Marshall's argument. "I have conferred with many of my officers upon the subject," he told the Senate committee. "Without exception they all feel-and it does not suit the convenience of some of them to remain in the service indefinitely-without exception, gentlemen, the thought is that the National Guard should be kept in the service as long as the emergency exists." 39 Since the National Guard Association is for officers only, one senator queried the general on the feelings of enlisted personnel, to which Reckord stated: I think with 90 percent of the men, that is true. There is always the minority in everything, but there is no so-called militant minority. There are certain individuals who feel that they would like to get out, get back home, but let me invite the attention of the committee to this fact: The law provided that every officer and 37 U.S. Senate, Retention of Reserve Components and Selectees in Military Service Beyond Twelve Months: Hearing Before the Committee on Military Affairs, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, July 17, 18, 21,  22, 23, and 24, 1941, pp. 3, 6.   38 Quoted in U.S. Senate, 1941, p. 6.   39 Quoted in U.S.

Only sergeants and corporals who were married and had dependents. Very few officers, but there were some weak sisters who just could not stand the gaff; they could not give up their work at home to go out in the field, and they asked to be relieved. 41   The Chief of the National Guard Bureau would subsequently provide the nationwide facts associated with the 1940 discharges in his 1941 annual report, noting that 1,816 Guard officers and 94,227 enlisted Guardsmen were discharged in lieu of peacetime mobilization for a variety of reasons.

1941, and even then by only one vote in the House of Representatives. 43 The events of 
December 7, 1941
The Army's mobilization efforts had been temporarily spared a potentially ruinous disruption, and planners doubled down on training. They scheduled the largest peacetime maneuvers in Army history for the fall of 1941, involving 500,000 soldiers. In spite of supply problems-equipment shortages still existed, and some soldiers found themselves using broom handles and logs in lieu of rifles and machine guns-the exercises proved extremely valuable. Not only did they help to identify both gifted commanders and substandard leaders, but the exercises also acted as learning opportunities for individuals and units while the young Army studied the complicated orchestration necessary in modern warfare. According to Lieutenant General McNair, the maneuvers were a crucial "combat college for troop leading"-they allowed novices to make mistakes in a simulated environment rather than battle. 44   The Army at War On December 7, 1941, Japanese forces attacked Navy ships and facilities at Pearl Harbor-home to the U.S. Navy's Pacific Fleet-and Army Air Forces at Hickam, Wheeler, and Bellows Fields, catapulting America into war in the Pacific. Claiming unbearable provocation, Germany declared war against the United States four days later, on December 11. The United States responded with its own declaration that same day. The attacks put to rest most public articulations of isolationist sentiment, and American anger over the attacks prompted the War Department to begin working at a frantic pace. Army planners anticipated the eventual mobilization of a staggering 213 divisions. Such a force structure, along with its supporting forces, would require a total of 8.8 million men. As it happened, their estimates for personnel were not far off, although the number of combat divisions were eventually capped at 95. 45  U.S. entry into the war put an end to the debates about extended service tours. Within a week of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Congress voted that all soldiers, including those currently active and those to be activated or conscripted, would remain in the war for the duration plus six months. The 1942 Annual Report of the Chief of the National Guard mentioned one result of the legislation:
. . . it appeared undesirable to permit citizens to enlist in the National Guard in their States for service under the State when other means and channels were available for all needed service to the Nation. Therefore, on December 31, 1941, the Chief of the National Guard Bureau instructed all State adjutants general that effective immediately all enlistments and reenlistments in State detachments or for units of the National Guard in active Federal service would be discontinued. 46   Of the 111,000 Officers' Reserve Corps personnel eligible by mid-1941, more than 57,000 had been activated, increasing to more than 80,000 by the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor. 47 In February 1942, President Roosevelt's Executive Order 9049 put the Organized Reserves into service for the duration of the war plus six months. This was mostly a public relations document, however, given the fact that the vast majority of Reservists were already on active service. 48 By the end of that year, 142,000 Officers' Reserve Corps members were on active Army duty; roughly 12,000 had not received orders for various reasons, though, including advanced age and disability. 49 Many of these officers wrote letters demanding active duty, noting their acute embarrassment at having to explain repeatedly to friends and co-workers that they were doing everything they could to be activated. Brigadier General Edward Smith, the Executive for Reserve and ROTC Affairs, admitted to one petitioner that "It has been a problem with the War Department to place on duty all of our high-ranking Reserve officers." 50 Indeed, two years later, the number of Officers' Reserve Corps members still not placed on active duty was only minimally lower. 51  Mobilized National Guard units deployed to the Philippines to reinforce U.S. Army and Philippine forces already there. The 200th Coast Artillery, 192nd Tank Battalion, and the 194th Tank Battalion arrived between September and November 1941. 52 U.S. and Filipino forces fought bravely against the Japanese invasion on December

During World War II, U.S. political leadership was careful to balance military requirements with public expectations, as must any democracy that is engaged in fighting a war. Following the Allied victory over Japan in August 1945, however, a war-weary American public demanded that a return to normalcy take place as quickly as possible. 61 Therefore, in the immediate postwar, the Army transitioned from a war machine to a peacetime establishment more suddenly than many Army leaders would have preferred.
The War Department had anticipated this public pressure long before the end of the war. In December 1942, Marshall had observed that postwar planners should assess the possibility of having to demobilize soldiers as quickly as possible, pointing out that there would be great pressure for their return home. 62 Retired Brigadier General John McAuley Palmer-whose work on postwar planning will be explored more thoroughly in the following chapter-agreed. However, he also advanced his own preference for maintaining what he termed an "emergency force." Smaller than the wartime Army but larger than the prewar peacetime Army, it would be responsible for "mopping up" during the transition period between the end of hostilities and the onset of the military, social, and economic conditions commonly understood as characteristic of peacetime. This would also allow the War Department to assess more accurately the requirements of the peacetime military. It was Palmer's preference that such an emergency force be created through legislation allowing the President to retain the necessary personnel. Not until this transition period would "it be possible to digest 60 Stewart, 2010, p. 126.   61 Members of Congress soon after V-J Day became the most vocal critics of the pace of the Army's postwar drawdowns. As historian John Sparrow points out, moral and economic motivations turned political. Congressional pressure to accelerate demobilization efforts increased as family members of servicemen threatened to make their dissatisfaction felt at the polls in future elections. Despite loud protestations from many congressmen, however, by the end of 1945 no new legislation on demobilization had managed to leave any committees

And indeed, despite the War Department's preference for slow and orderly demobilization, pressure from the public, Congress, and the troops themselves quickly resulted in an accelerated schedule, just as it had after World War I. Both the U.S. Navy and the Army felt this pressure, but as the service that had relied the most on conscription, the Army felt it more. By the end of 1945, the Army had released 4 million soldiers-half its entire strength, including Army Ground Forces, Army Service Forces (about 5 million combined), and the Army Air Forces (around 3 million). 65  Roughly 2.5 million of these soldiers were from the Army Ground and Service forces. Responsibilities in the Pacific, and especially in postwar Germany, meant that demobilization could not continue at this pace, and the beginning of 1946 witnessed a slowed release rate, which resulted in protests from many of the remaining troops. 66 Admitting defeat, the Army released an additional 2 million soldiers by June 1946. 67  The Army's own preference, driven by concerns about a potential future conflict with the USSR and institutional desires, had been to maintain a postwar strength of roughly 1.5 million soldiers, with a reserve force of around 2.5 million, but this was not to be. 68 The 1947 War Department budget determined that the maximum Army strength would be roughly 1 million soldiers. This represented a significant diminution of existing strength; Congress responded by ending the draft, releasing all draftees, and reconfiguring the Regular Army as a volunteer organization of roughly 684,000 ground troops and 306,000 airmen, setting the stage for the "hollow Army" force structure of the immediate postwar years. By mid-1946, the Army had cased the colors of 73 combat divisions, from a wartime high of 89 full-strength active divisions down to 16. At the end of the following year, when demobilization had completed, 12 active divisions remained. 69 A large number of maintenance personnel were also released, which meant that equipment soon deteriorated. 70 Units were routinely understrength, and the troops comprising them, many of whom had joined after the war, were undertrained. The Army's own historians would later characterize postwar Army units as "shadows of the efficient organizations they had been at the end of the war." 71  While the Army grappled with drawdowns and new global responsibilities, civil and military officials made fundamental changes to the national security system with the National Security Act of 1947. 72 Looking to reorganize both the foreign policy and military establishments, reformers attempted to streamline decisionmaking at the highest levels and enhance the coordination of the armed forces and government. The act created the National Security Council (NSC) to advise the President and coordinate issues related to military and foreign policies. It also combined the War Department and Navy Department into a single National Military Establishment-renamed the Department of Defense two years later-and created a layer of civilian authority between the military and the President by subordinating the service secretaries to the Secretary of Defense. The Army Air Forces became an autonomous and equal service to the Navy and Army with the creation of the Department of the Air Force. Now with a statutory charter, the three military chiefs formed the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) inside the Office of the Secretary of Defense. Among its varied duties, the JCS advised the President and the NSC and Secretary of Defense, formulated joint plans, and gave strategic direction to various commands around the world. Most of the National Security Act's provisions took effect in September 1947, signaling a watershed moment for the nation as U.S. foreign policy became militarized and the lines between military policy and foreign policy became increasingly blurred. 73  Despite profound changes to the structure of the foreign policy and military establishments, the act resolved few of the national security problems. Given the swift and dramatic postwar drawdown, early planning stressed containment of the USSR and dictated that if the Soviets invaded Western Europe any remaining American forces would rapidly retreat. American ground forces would not play a significant role in the early phases of a Soviet attack. Instead, planners laid out guidance for destroying Soviet industrial and political centers through strategic bombing and nuclear attacks. 74  Planners assumed that, as in past American wars, if needed there would be time to mobilize the citizenry for a large ground army, but atomic weapons would be the primary military force to deal with a Soviet offensive. 75  The possibility of war with the Soviet Union guided strategic thinking in the years following the war. President Truman regarded nuclear weapons as the nation's main means to deter potential Soviet aggression, and this view, coupled with his fear that a swelling defense budget would cripple the postwar economy, led him to decrease Army funding. 76 All military services shrank in size, except for the newly independent Air Force, whose Strategic Air Command mission insulated it from cuts. 77 Indeed, airpower, costly though it might be, came to be viewed as economical because it diminished reliance on even more-costly ground forces. By 1950, further cuts to the Army had decreased the size and the capabilities of the ground service. 78 The Regular Army shrunk to 591,000 soldiers organized into ten undermanned divisions-including soldiers deployed to occupied Germany, this number rose to 11-and five regimental combat teams. The Army National Guard augmented the Regular Army with 325,000 men organized into 27 undermanned divisions, and the Organized Reserves added another 186,000 soldiers in skeletonized divisions. 79   
Prior to World War II, U.S. Army planners had assumed that in the event of war the National Guard and Organized Reserves would reinforce the Regular Army, which would expand through mass conscription and volunteers. Time and industrial mobilization was required to mobilize, train, and equip the expanded Army. A peacetime presidential executive order in August 1940 began to mobilize National Guard units for 12 months of training. In September, Congress authorized the President to increase the size of land and naval forces and their training for 12 consecutive months, capping this conscripted land force at 900,000 soldiers and establishing limitations on its geographic deployment. This peacetime action was crucial to jump-starting U.S. mobilization efforts, although the Pearl Harbor attack still caught the nation's armed forces largely unprepared for war in distant theaters.
As the next chapter discusses, arguments over postwar military policy, often inspired by parochialism, had begun well before mobilization was complete and would continue throughout the war and beyond, presaging many of the issues that the Army, National Guard, and the Organized Reserve Corps/Army Reserve would confront repeatedly over the following 30 years. These debates were varied and complex: How much should the Army rely on reserve components? Was it pragmatic to maintain multiple reserve components? How should these reserve components be structured? What form should augmentation by the reserves take? While some participants did indeed seek to alter or shift the existing legal framework, they were met with remarkably fierce resistance, and while important details of the reserve structure would change over the 25 years following the end of the war, no fundamental alteration to their essential form succeeded.
The 1933 National Defense Act defined the Army as consisting of "the Regular Army, the National Guard of the United States, the National Guard while in the service of the United States, the Officers' Reserve Corps, the Organized Reserves, and the Enlisted Reserve Corps."

Europe experienced a rapid escalation toward war in the late 1930s. Despite numerous international peace agreements, Adolf Hitler's Third Reich decided on war. The German Army invaded Poland in 1939, the Scandinavian countries in April 1940, and France and the Low Countries in May. Most shocking to U.S. leaders was the quick capitulation of France. German armor avoided the French defensive network of the Maginot Line and swept instead into northern France through the Ardennes Forest in Belgium. By June 25, 1940, France had fallen and the British Army had evacuated the continent. With Britain facing a German invasion, the British Parliament lost confidence in Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. On the very day of Germany's invasion of France, Chamberlain resigned and veteran Tory politician Winston Churchill became prime minister. In just six weeks, Hitler had conquered Western Europe. Britain stood isolated, and Germany seemed poised to make the jump across the English Channel. The Soviet Union was a de-facto Axis ally as well, having signed a nonaggression pact with Germany in 1939 and taken part in the invasion and occupation of Poland.
In Asia, Japan continued to expand its power, conducting a war of conquest in China and signing treaties with the European Axis powers. President Franklin Roosevelt attempted to pressure Japan into ending its aggression, placing an embargo on arms sales to Japan in 1938, extending the embargo to scrap iron in 1940 and oil in July 1941, and freezing all Japanese assets in the United States. On December 7, 1941, Japanese naval forces attacked Pearl Harbor, the base of the U.S. Navy's Pacific fleet, as well as Army Air Forces installations at Hickam, Wheeler, and Bellows Fields, catapulting America into war. The American military scrambled to reform and strengthen itself to fight a global conflict in multiple theaters. 2  Just prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, General George C. Marshall asked Brigadier General John M. Palmer to return to Washington from his home in New Hampshire. Events in Europe made it increasingly obvious to the chief of staff and his planners that the United States would have a role to play in the war. With Marshall's time and efforts dominated by Army expansion, he asked Palmer to return from retirement to begin planning for postwar military policy.
In providing Palmer with his initial guidance for his task, Marshall wrote to Palmer that:

In Palmer's own description of Marshall's request, he candidly admitted:
I was in no sense qualified to advise on the purely military aspects of organization. . . . He called me back to active duty because he knew that I had given many years study to the evolution of political-military institutions of the United States . . .

As a result, Palmer vacillated between two different legal approaches for his mass citizen wartime Army. The first would keep the National Guard as a dual constitutional force with ties to the militia and armies clauses. The second would be to alter the current legal status of the Guard by organizing it solely under the armies clause of the Constitution and removing its legal ties to the states, transforming it into a federalized reserve.
Within these two fluctuating views, Palmer consistently advocated for a citizensoldier presence within the Army. He recognized that such a feat would not be easy. His solution, as he argued in the years after World War I, was universal military training (UMT). Under Palmer's definition, UMT tied military training to virtually every young and able-bodied American male. Of course, this notion did not originate with Palmer. He had long been an admirer of European nations that made military service a requisite of citizenship. Additionally, much of his early analysis sought to link concepts of UMT to the founding fathers. Yet, utilization of the system in America had many detractors, and among them were members of NGAUS, along with representatives from American political, academic, and social circles. Political leaders worried about the cost of training such an enormous manpower pool and then managing it afterward. Certain social leaders argued that training would disrupt vast numbers of American men at a time when they should be entering college or the workforce. Others were concerned about the effect of Army camp life on the morality of America's male youth. 
7
As long as Palmer was calling for UMT while simultaneously accepting the National Guard's dual constitutional status, the Guard was generally in agreement with Palmer. When he argued for removing its link to the militia clause while at the same time advocating for UMT, however, tensions arose. The conflicting visions came to a head in April 1942. Palmer profoundly alienated the Guard and its leadership when, speaking during the annual Adjutant Generals Association Conference he told the audience:
[A] single citizen army should be formed under that provision of the Constitution which gives the Government power to raise and support armies, and that it should be practically a merger of the National Guard and the [wartime] National Army. 
8
Once fully aware of the import of his statement, Palmer took pains to specify that it had been a personal opinion only, not official War Department policy, but this did little to mitigate the damage. His close relationship with General Marshall, once a source of comfort for the Guard, now made its leadership wonder what other personal opinions Palmer might share with the chief of staff. 
9
Nor does there appear to be any good reason for dividing the reserve forces into two separate echelons. After the present war, there should be but one territorial reserve. The citizen officers who entered the present war army from the National Guard and those who entered it from the Organized Reserves should both be eligible as charter members of this new force. It should be organized under the army clause of the Constitution as an integral part of the Army of the United States in peacetime as well as in wartime. 
10
Later that year, however, Palmer decided to give up on his efforts to organize the Guard under the Constitution's armies clause as politically impossible, not to mention a distraction from more-urgent priorities, such as the requirement for the Guard to be commanded by competent officers, who in turn must be supported by competent staffs. Additionally, the question of postwar force structure and the possibility of instituting a requirement for UMT had begun to surface. 12
General Marshall and others in the War Department had learned from demobilization following the armistice in 1918 and sought to avoid a similar performance. In July 1943, Marshall established the Special Planning Division (SPD), a staff section in the War Department dedicated solely to postwar policy planning for the Army. 13 The SPD was composed of about 50 officers and directed by Brigadier General William F. Tompkins, with Palmer serving as an adviser to the agency. Given his professional stature, the SPD tended to echo many of Palmer's policy ideas. Due to his close relationship with Marshall, Palmer acted as a conduit between the SPD and the chief of staff, which almost by default meant that much the agency's work reflected many of Marshall's own views. 14 The division's mission was to prepare demobilization plans for the War Department's military and industrial activities, and along with that any legislation, regulations, and or other procedures necessary to implement demobilization.

Similarly, Palmer mapped out his own plans for the postwar Army with UMT in mind. Only months after the establishment of the SPD in July 1943, he spoke with them regarding his early vision for this training. He recommended one year of training for every able-bodied man, whereupon each citizen-soldier would join a local unit of the Organized Reserve for "a reasonable period." 16 The SPD's response was not favorable. Its officers conceded that the instruction would be useful but believed that the trainees would be better aggregated in a "general pool of trained manpower," which Palmer interpreted as a grotesque expansion of a peacetime standing Regular Army, not only philosophically inconsistent with American ideals but also anathema to the National Guard and Army Organized Reserve Corps. 17 Palmer considered the concepts of the Founding Fathers to be applicable in the modern era, most notably the ideas of George Washington. He argued throughout his work that Washington and others called for a smaller peacetime fighting force that could be rapidly expanded during war by the trained citizenry who would man the bulk of the war Army and lead it as well.
Concerned about American willingness to underwrite the expense of a large peacetime Army, Palmer, and eventually Marshall, argued forcefully that UMT would serve as a cost-saving measure. "The most expensive element in our peacetime military system is the permanent or regular establishment," Palmer contended in 1943. "With great numbers of trained reserve officers and men immediately available, this regular establishment will be capable of rapid expansion." 18 He wrote to the director of the SPD in 1944 to say its "cost will be largely if not entirely offset by great resultant economies in our military budget." 19 Congressman James W. Wadsworth, Jr.-an old friend of Palmer's after the two worked closely on the National Defense Act of 1920 when Wadsworth was the chair of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs-had been following these arguments with interest. In 1943 he introduced a bill, supported by Senator John Chandler "Chan" Gurney, that left the Army Reorganization Act of 16 Palmer, 1945c. 17 Palmer, 1945c. 18 Palmer, 1943b. 19 Michael S.

The National Guard Pushes Back Against Palmer's Plan NGAUS disagreed. Palmer decided to speak at the 1943 NGAUS annual conference in the hopes of allaying their fears, but found spears rather than olive branches. He had chosen a poor time to act as an ambassador. Major General Ellard Walsh was inaugurated as president at the 1943 convention, marking the "birth of a vigorous and vocal lobby" and the foundation of the "modern National Guard Association," according to political scientist Martha Derthick. 22 His incumbency also began an era of amplified tension between the Regular Army and the National Guard. Sensing artifice and subterfuge in most Regular Army actions and proposals, Walsh's aggressive defense of his institution, oftentimes using alarmist rhetoric, did little to weaken the ferocity of political battles to come.
To members of NGAUS, Palmer had omitted the Guard's critical roles as a defender of domestic soil and their charge of quelling insurrections in the service of their given state. National Guard Major General Milton Reckord-who had commanded an infantry regiment in Palmer's brigade in World War I before serving as president of NGAUS from 1923 to 1925-responded bluntly to Palmer's address. Even though the National Guard was the organized militia when federalized, he questioned how long Congress would support the National Guard when there was already an organized reserve "strictly and wholly under Federal Control" and staffed with Regular Army officers. Reckord was dubious that many citizen-soldiers would come back to the Guard after serving two years in the Organized Reserve Corps. Therefore, he declared, he would "oppose this piece of legislation if it is the last thing I do officially. It is bad legislation. It will accomplish what I say it will accomplish whether the proponents" believed or not that it did. 
23
As the National Guard, organized under the Militia Clause of the Constitution, is primarily an aggregation of state forces subject to but limited control in time of peace, it is inherently impossible to develop it into an effective first reserve available, in whole or in part, for the immediate reinforcement of the Regular Army. 26   Palmer stated flatly at the 1943 NGAUS conference that
[O]ne of the questions to be raised when we come to the settlement of a future military policy is whether or not the National Guard is the first reserve of the United States and, whether the National Guard as such first reserve shall be in its same status or organized under the Army clause of the Constitution. 27   Unlike the previous year, when he had hastened to reassure a rattled Guard that his dislike of their dual status was merely a personal opinion, he did not qualify this statement.
A year later, the SPD was still mulling over the Guard's postwar role. An April 1944 memorandum from the SPD director to the Chief of the National Guard Bureau instructed him to consider whether the Guard would be well suited for manning coastal and anti-aircraft defenses, resisting surprise attacks against the United States, or becoming "essentially a State Guard, charged with the mission generally of reinforcing State authority and police powers . . ." 28  None of these functions aligned with Walsh's emphatic insistence that the Guard remain part of the nation's "first line of defense," capable of fighting as part of the Army as enacted in the 1916 and 1933 National Defense Acts. Proving that Palmer was not the only one who could marshal historical evidence to support an argument, Walsh's 1944 annual report to the NGAUS conference framed the issue as a century-old constitutional struggle. "Those opposed to the Militia System seemingly are obsessed with the idea that the Army Clause of the Constitution is an instrument to be invoked at will while the Militia Clauses may be ignored with impunity," he caustically observed. He then went on to differentiate between the two schools of thought that had thus 26 "Special Planning Division Memorandum Furnished to General Palmer," Palmer Papers, Library of Congress, Box 14, Folder 2,

29
Walsh went on to critique sharply the second school of thought, that of his contemporary and recent opponent John M. Palmer. Although Walsh characterized Palmer's 1940 book America in Arms as "outstanding," he took issue with the work's historical arguments. "[T]he fact seems inescapable that the historical viewpoints distants 
[sic]
31
Although Walsh had embraced the militia tradition as a counterpoint to Palmer and others, he did not do so unreservedly. As noted earlier, he stood firm in his belief that the Guard as an institution must exist as a fully professionalized force, able to be integrated with the Regular Army as part of the first line of the nation's defense. To Walsh, the Guard's dual status was not only constitutional, it was practical. Moreover, his examination of the historical record was in some ways as parochially selective as he had accused Palmer of being. As discussed in Volume I of this series, the Supreme Court ruled in 1917 that the raise and support armies clause of the Constitution overruled the militia clause and that the militia clause did not, in fact, impose limits on Congress's ability to raise armies.
Walsh recalled that the idea of UMT had been proposed before, namely in the 1916 Continental Army scheme and the 1920 plan, which Congress had rejected. He was not hopeful about Palmer's odds of successfully implementing such a requirement: "The temper of the American people would not permit the adoption of such a [UMT] plan in 
1792, in 1916, in 1920, and
More to his own point, Walsh dramatically mentioned that the previous two efforts to implement this plan "sought to eliminate the National Guard root and branch," 34 and that the present-day plan was no different:
In a suggested outline for a post-war military establishment prepared by General Palmer, he advocates a system of universal military training and the establishment of a great territorial reserve, organized under the Army Clause of the Constitution-freed from the hampering complications of a militia status, with its units filled under a system of universal military training and utterly divorced from the forty-eight separate State sovereignties, and ironically enough suggests that it might be fittingly called the National Guard in recognition of a century of patriotic effort to achieve a high ideal. 35   32 Quoted in National Guard Association of the United States, 1944, p. 30. 33 The relevant provision is Section 111 of the 1916 National Defense Act (Public Law 64-85), "National Guard When Drafted into Federal Service." 34 Quoted in National Guard Association of the United States, 1944, p. 30.   35 Quoted in National Guard Association of the United States, 1944, p. 31. After the war, Walsh mused on the changes to the military establishment that had been proposed, on NGAUS's role in stopping them, and on NGAUS's decision to deactivate itself for three critical years during the war:
The G-1 (Personnel) Post War Military Policy Planning Group, whose purpose was to devise an enduring military policy for the United States once World War II ended, concurred that UMT would be necessary after the war. Just as Walsh had feared, though, it advocated that the large pool of citizen-soldiers the system would produce should be formed and led by Regular Army divisions. Palmer actually disagreed with this plan as G-1 articulated it, believing that the Regular Army should not divide its attention between maintaining a state of general readiness and shouldering responsibility for UMT, which would require a great deal of time to train recruits. He also balked at G-1's preferred course of action, which likely would have used UMT-trained personnel to fill out federalized Organized Reserve divisions, and not the Guard. Palmer's entire philosophical argument in favor of UMT was based on his belief in a wartime Army of civilian soldiers.

Palmer's characterization of the second option was more aspirational:
The second type of military institution . . . is based upon the conception of a professional peace establishment (no larger than necessary to meet normal peacetime requirements) to be reinforced in time of emergency by organized units drawn from a citizen army reserve, effectively organized for this purpose in time of peace; with full opportunity for competent citizen soldiers to acquire practical experience through temporary active service. . . .
As with a properly organized citizen army reserve, no officers or men need be maintained in the regular army to perform duties which can be performed effectively and in time by reserve officers and reservists, the dimensions and cost of the peace establishment, under such a system, are necessarily reduced to a determinable minimum.
And finally, as all our great wars have been fought in the main by citizen armies, the proposal for an organized citizen army reserve in time of peace is merely a proposal for perfecting a traditional national institution to meet modern requirements which no longer permit extemporization after the outbreak of war. This is the type of army which President Washington proposed to the First Congress as one of the essential foundations of the new American Republic. 40   Palmer's bias is evident, as is his incomplete and inaccurate characterization of President Washington's proposal for a peacetime military establishment. Regardless, General Marshall approved its publication as a War Department Circular to guide initial thinking for the postwar organization.
Throughout the course of his work for General Marshall, this was a theme to which Palmer returned over and over. His professional papers reveal that he pondered this argument countless times. George Washington, he maintained, had admired the Swiss military system of universal military training, and Palmer characterized Washington's 1790 request that Congress establish a militia as a sort of retroactive blessing for the idea of universal military training. Indeed, Palmer's 1930 book Washington, Lincoln, Wilson: Three War Statesmen devoted considerable space to a very specific characterization of Washington's 1783 Sentiments on a Peace Establishment. In effect, he reconstructed key arguments to make it appear as though Washington's wished-for plan served as the starting point for a "traditional military policy" which continued, unaltered and unbroken, to the 20th century. As Palmer described it, this policy was one in which a large citizen army, comprising the bulk of the nation's fighting force and greatly outnumbering the professional nucleus of the Regular Army, would respond when called forth by the President in time to defend the nation. As pointed out in Volume I, however, Washington had devoted roughly an equal share of his 13-page plan to the Regular Army and to the militia, regarding them as both necessary for national defense. Palmer, like Reckord and Walsh, chose to employ history selectively to emphasize his desired approach.
Yet, at the same time, Palmer also acknowledged that Washington believed the Swiss system to be incompatible with the United States, as it existed at the end of the 19th century. The Swiss had no standing army; America's need for one was nonnegotiable, "subject to prompt re-enforcement by all, or any necessary part, of a nationwide citizen army reserve composed of citizen soldiers . . ." 41  From political and fiscal necessity, Washington had called for a small but highly professional Regular Army that would be backed up at a time of emergency by a "wellregulated" militia force. Palmer, too, envisioned an affordable professional force, sized to fulfill specific functions in peacetime and able to be rapidly reinforced by wellregulated militia units when required. However, what the two men had in mind were on radically different scales. Washington simply was not considering the mass mobilization of citizenry, or the kind of professionalization of the citizens that Palmer was 40 War Department, Circular No. 347, Washington, D.C., August 25, 1944, pp. 5-6.   41  calling for. There was an important difference in scale and nature between the militia system of Washington's day and the 20th century vision of a large, UMT-trained Reserve or Guard force.
The worldview of Washington and his fellow Federalist Framers of the Constitution was very much focused on a military establishment that would be used only for the defense of the United States and responding to internal rebellion or insurrection, as with the Whiskey Rebellion and Shays' Rebellion at the end of the 18th century. The idea of employing an army to fight major wars in Europe and Asia-let alone expand it with professionalized citizens-would have been unthinkable to Washington and his philosophical allies in their time. Washington's assessment of the militia during the Revolutionary War is well established, even if peculiarly ignored by Palmer and others. Palmer's use of Washington's 1783 and 1790 plans to promote his recommendations for American military policy in the 20th century therefore distorted the historical record. Palmer unreasonably articulated his recommended policy as being one and the same with Washington's plans, as he claimed the "War Department's plan for a postwar military organization based upon universal military training is a modern adaptation of a plan prepared by General Henry Knox, our first Secretary of War." 42 A fairer reading and use of history by Palmer would have noted the significant contextual differences between his plan and Washington's and, more importantly, the substantive differences between the two. 43 Lastly, of course, was the fact that Walsh had bluntly noted in his remarks earlier that year: Congress had declined to authorize the Knox Plan, and at no point afterward had the United States adopted any similar undertaking.
Historical distortions aside, however, public and political response to Circular No. 347 was extremely positive. Palmer was encouraged by expressions of popular support he received after its publication in August 1944, believing that the American opinion of obligatory military service had shifted. For the time being, perhaps it had. As the war continued, its effect on public perception was such that UMT likely appeared a lesser evil than conscription made uneven by its many deferment categories. Neither Palmer nor his audience could know whether and how that perception might change at the war's end.
Driving this discussion was a pervasive belief in the War Department and the Army that the nature of modern war had changed significantly since World War I.

Today it is evident to all thinking people that the evolution of new weapons may determine not only the outcome of battles, but even the total strategy of war. That has always been true to some extent, but today the rate of evolution of military weapons is much more rapid than it has ever been in the history of human conflict. . . . In the past, the pace of war has been sufficiently slow so that this nation has never had to pay the full price of defeat for its lack of preparedness. Twice we have just gotten by because we were given time to prepare while others fought. 
45
In addition to a wide array of weighty issues, the House Select Committee on Postwar Military Policy-known colloquially as the Woodrum Committee after its chairman, Clifton A. Woodrum-investigated the question of how the postwar Army should be structured. 
46
June 15, 1945
From a planning standpoint the War Department wants to make it crystal clear to this committee that it does not recommend or desire that trainees be inducted into the Army for military service. They should be inducted into training organizations for training purposes only. 50  In other words, inductees would be trained as all new inductees, volunteer or conscript, were trained upon entering the Army. When that training was complete, however, they would automatically become a member of the reserve pool, unless they volunteered for service in the regular establishment. Training would shorten the timeline in the event of conscription and mobilization.
A new military policy was therefore needed that would rely on a somewhat larger, albeit still relatively small, force in being, ready to respond to crises around the world, and reinforced by a trained reserve and expanded by volunteers and conscripts. 
51

Planning for the post-World War II era again revealed sometimes contradictory visions of the military policy required to secure the nation, especially that of where the National Guard would fit in the military establishment. NGAUS president and Minnesota adjutant general Ellard Walsh supported the dual responsibility of the National Guard as both a state and federal force, based respectively on the militia and armies clauses of the Constitution, as outlined in the 1933 National Guard Act. He opposed suggestions, such as those offered by Brigadier General John M. Palmer, to align the Guard solely under the armies clause. Achieving Palmer's goal would not be easy. Not only did he need to perceive the type of standing army that American society would tolerate after the war, he also needed to advocate for his vision in an environment characterized by numerous competing self-interests. The Regular Army's preference for fundamental policy changes that allowed for rapid responses to global threats directly conflicted with the view of Guard representatives that the answer to the nation's postwar needs was in preserving the status quo of a dual-status National Guard. The Organized Reserve Corps took only a small part in these conversations, but they remained an active part of the reserve components, and would play a greater role in the decades to come.
Further, not only Palmer, but also the Army and the War Department were obliged to balance all of these concerns while trying to determine the extent to which, if at all, modern warfare would shift in character over the years following the war's conclusion.
The force structure options that all parties explored were informed by their perceptions of how wars would be fought in the future. In spite of the abrupt conclusion of World War II after the detonation of atomic weapons over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, consensus steadily built that future conflicts would largely resemble past wars. To that end, planners eventually settled on a force consisting of a somewhat larger Regular Army, augmented by the rapid mobilization of reserves, volunteers, and conscripts. The concept of universal military training had gained considerable popularity in some political circles, but also had powerful detractors.
In the years following the war, Congress would further investigate this proposal in an effort to determine whether the peacetime United States would continue to support the idea of UMT as it had just before the close of hostilities. War Department Circular No. 347 may have garnered enthusiasm upon its release, but arguing the benefits of UMT for all able-bodied young men during the much-desired "return to normalcy" was a different matter entirely.
The concept of universal military training did not spring fully formed from the brows of policy planners during the last year of the war. Even before the United States officially entered the conflict, issues that underlay UMT drew some attention; during NGAUS's 1940 conference, Frank McCormick, vice president of the National Collegiate Association, observed that at the close of the previous war, "little, if anything, was done relative to the physical fitness or the training of our civilian population."
2
As the war drew to a close, the concept of UMT found sufficient support in Congress and among the public to merit further investigation. UMT was a potentially critical aspect of American military policy because it could provide a necessary manpower base. Palmer's proposed policy in War Department Circular No. 347-a standing army "no larger than necessary to meet normal peacetime requirements," reinforced by "organized units drawn from a citizen army reserve"-for example, would not work without UMT. The House Select Committee on Postwar Military Policy held hearings on UMT in June 1945 to determine the level of interest from veterans, civilians, and various educational and professional organizations. While testimony revealed there was not unanimous support for the prospect of UMT and its attendant costs, the majority believed it would enhance both the nation's military preparedness and be a useful tool for enhancing American democracy.
Colonel Jay Cooke, president of the Citizens Committee of Military Training of Young Men, not surprisingly endorsed UMT, based on his experiences during both world wars:
In 1918 my division went overseas with 40 percent of its personnel 2 weeks from civilian life. . . . In 1941, my division entered Federal service in January. We will never forget the Carolina maneuvers that summer-trucks with signs on them reading "tank" and "antitank gun," and makeshift equipment of all kinds . . . believe me, I should have preferred a year's training when a young man than 6 years' service in the Army during two emergencies. 
3
If, at that time, we had been prepared, if we at least had had a pool of trained men in our country to draw from, the Japanese understood that, as they would have had to understand it-I question seriously whether they would ever have dared to attack. 4   During the hearings, representatives from the American Legion reported that the majority of Americans supported UMT. On 
November 17, 1943
[F]irst, in view of the possible extension of selective service, such action was not necessary at the time; second, our long-time military needs were not known; third, our commitments in maintaining the peace were not known; fourth, the proposal was in conflict with American military tradition; fifth, the young men fighting the war should have a voice in a decision of such moment; and, sixth, such action might adversely affect international cooperation for the maintenance of the peace. 6   Colonel Cooke was correct that many American conscripts during World War I and World War II were unready for combat. It is possible that UMT might have addressed the perceived requirement for a common baseline of training and expertise among the citizenry who would be called to serve in the next war. Brumbaugh had highlighted a major criticism of UMT detractors, that during peacetime UMT was not part of the American political or cultural tradition. Equally important was his observation that UMT applied the mass mobilization theories of the past to future conflicts, whose characteristics were yet unknown and for which mass mobilization might be an entirely inappropriate response. In this, he gave voice to many UMT critics who had perceived that the atomic explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki had fundamentally changed the nature of war, shaping it into a new configuration whose lines were not yet fully discernable. If this was the case, did it make sense to press for UMT when it seemingly clashed with modern American culture and whose benefits were doubtful?

The National Guard is what is known as the second line of defense, our first line is the Regular Establishment. The National Guard, unless there is an emergency declared and they are ordered into the Federal Service, remain within the domestic borders of this country, at least that has been the law in the past, and I assume it will be in the future. 
10
Not surprisingly, NGAUS President Major General Walsh took strong exception to this view and was not hesitant to voice it to 
Congress in 1945:
12
As this discussion took place, a larger question arose about whether modern atomic war had obviated the notion of a civilian-based Army reserve. During the waning months of the war, Palmer had repeatedly and enthusiastically evangelized that UMT would provide the same kind of mass army that the nation had used in the past and would be still relevant for the future. "The present War Department plan contemplates nothing more than the revision of the National Defense Act to meet modern requirements," he remarked to the Council on Foreign Relations in March 1945. "It is based on universal military training in order to make sure that our country shall never enter another war with an empty reservoir of trained manpower as it did in World War I and World War II." 
13
However, even following Japan's surrender, individuals such as Palmer and Marshall continued to advocate vociferously for UMT as crucial to a civilian-based Army reserve, arguing that such a force was entirely in line with American political culture. Palmer, in fact, believed that modern warfare necessitated eliminating the dual status of the National Guard and bringing it solely under federal control. While the Army's old organization was based on defense against a seaborne invasion force, he pointed out well before the end of the war, in December 1943, that the greatest threat now came from the air: Bombers and paratroopers could strike deep inside the continent, hitting vulnerable and strategically significant points. Therefore, the military would need to mobilize immediately, something not possible unless a civilian army was formed under the Constitution's army clause. Palmer argued that he did "not see how a force organized like our old National Guard into conventional territorial divisions, under amateur divisional commanders and controlled in peacetime by forty-eight separate states can have any place" in the type of reserve system necessary in the age of airpower.

By 1946, War Department insistence on 12 months of training had shifted; sensing the changing political climate, the director of the SPD now insisted that no fewer than six months would do. In a March conference, however, representatives of NGAUS, the Reserve Officers Association, the American Legion, and similar groups advocated for a four-month training period, believing that the American public would prove unwilling to allow for longer training times now that the war was over and pressing military need had abated. The War Department held firm on six months, however. By the fall of that year, the possibility of passing UMT legislation seemed ever more remote.
Congressional leaders made it clear to the Guard that they had no intention of voting for the six-month version of UMT the War Department now advocated. 
22
In an attempt to create a revised military policy for the new era, on November 20, 1947, Secretary of Defense James Forrestal tasked Assistant Secretary of the Army Gordon Gray with conducting a study of the status and organization of the civilian components of the armed forces. Among their many conclusions, the six-member Committee on Civilian Components-known more commonly as the Gray Board-suggested in their June 1948 report that the Guard's dual loyalties to both the states and the federal government, as ensconced in statutory law, and interstate disagreements on the training of units across state lines, were unsuited to possible Cold War conflicts:
These expedients, resulting from dual control, produce a constant turmoil of bickering, recrimination, factionalism and stalemate. . . . The present organization of the National Guard does not repose authority where basic responsibilities rest. None of the State and Territorial Governors has any direct responsibility for the national security and none is answerable to the national government. It is a tribute to their integrity that the system has worked as well as it has. 
23
Its recommendation that urged the Guard and Organized Reserve Corps-later renamed the Army Reserve by the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952-be merged into a single federally controlled organization to be known as the National Guard of the United States, and that its dual constitutional role be abolished, was especially controversial, though similar recommendations were made with regard to the Departments of the Navy and Air Force. This naturally resulted in immediate and strident pushback from the Guard itself, NGAUS, the Reserve Officers' Association, and some members of Congress. "[The Department of Defense] and its satellite, the Gray Board, could far better employ their time and efforts than in wasting six months laboring mightily to bring forth the vain and wishful recommendations for the destruction of the National Guard," Ellard Walsh observed years later. 
24
The States and the National Guard will condemn this report as it should be condemned. We have too much faith in the Congress to swallow such drivel. While we shall remain ever vigilant and keep our powder dry. . . . I say to you that the Gray Board report is already as dead as the dodo. 
25
26
In response to the reality that UMT would not happen, and shortly after the Gray Board had made its recommendations, in June 1948 Congress passed a new Selective Service Act requiring all men ages 18 to 26 to register. The act gave the President authority "from time to time, whether or not a state of war exists, to select and induct into the armed forces of the United States for training and service . . . [for a period of 21 consecutive months] . . . such number of persons as may be required to provide and maintain the personnel strengths . . . of the respective armed forces." This period of active duty, if less than three years, would be followed by transfer to a reserve component for an additional five years. The act exempted men who were currently members of the National Guard and Organized Reserves for training and service, but not registration. Men who joined the National Guard or Organized Reserves before reaching 18 and a half years of age were also exempted from induction for training and service.
The 1948 Selective Service Act did not provide the immense and robust force envisioned by the advocates of UMT, but it also did not raise the cultural and political controversies that the idea of UMT did. 27 Rather, it authorized the President, "whether or not a state of war exists," to induct young men for training and service for up to 21 months. The act also provided safe havens from training and service for those men already in the National Guard and Organized Reserves, as well as men who joined a reserve component before 18 and a half years of age. ceived place within the military establishment. The potential expense, as well as America's traditional postwar apathy regarding military preparedness, also played central roles in UMT's failure. As the debate progressed, it became increasingly clear that universal military training, while a means of providing a mass army for conflicts such as the two world wars, may not have been the ideal means of building a fighting force for a post-World War II world whose outlines were not yet entirely clear. The United States, previously protected by the security of two great oceans, was now theoretically within range of potential adversaries employing the technological advancements of the preceding decades; the Soviet Union's rapid acquisition of atomic weaponry showed that the United States could not rely on maintaining technological superiority in all realms.
If nothing else, the drive for UMT provided a framework for postwar policy debates. The idea of codifying UMT into law allowed the Military Departments, the National Guard and NGAUS, the Organized Reserves, Congress, and the nation itself to articulate arguments in favor of and against such concepts as universal service, mass mobilization, and how the first lines of defense should be defined and conceived. These were conversations that could take place largely because the major questions of how the Army should be governed had already been settled in the years following World War I. Although all sides presented their own arguments, the only instance when anything approaching a fundamental question of law emerged was when Palmer's preference for a single-status National Guard became public in 1942. Even then, there was only a marginal chance that legislation would alter the Guard's favored dual status-not once had NGAUS previously conveyed its displeasure to Congress so forcefully. 
28
On June 24, 1950, North Korean troops invaded South Korea, with 150 Soviet-made T-34 tanks leading their assault. 1 The invasion was a rude surprise in a number of ways, but one thing it made painfully clear was the U.S. Army's lack of readiness. The American forces that rushed to Korea had been on occupation duty in Japan, their organization and mission tailored to maintaining law and order and demilitarizing the country rather than combat. Task Force Smith-named for its commander, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith-and other advanced elements of the 24th Infantry Division illustrated well the emergency nature of the early days of the war. These units were neither sufficient in size nor adequately equipped to stop the North Koreans, and they were forced to beat a hasty retreat after sustaining heavy losses. "No More Task Force Smiths" would later become a catchphrase for lack of preparedness and being caught off guard. 2 Indeed, American forces in Korea were to suffer a series of defeats over several weeks, making it evident that the Army had deteriorated from the force that had helped vanquish the Axis Powers during World War II. It was disorganized, badly trained, and almost completely unprepared to meet any threat that did not reveal itself months in advance. The advance of Communist troops down the Korean peninsula obliged the Army and the Truman administration to scramble to generate the forces required to meet the challenge. Their eventual response would represent the emergence of an altogether new way of thinking about Army expansion. 1 North Korean troop-strength estimates vary widely, as low as 90,000 to as high as 165,000. 
All mobilization plans in the five years before the start of the Korean War had been made for an all-out war reminiscent of World War II. Congressional and public debate about what the postwar Army should look like had been heavily influenced by the United States' use of atomic weapons at the close of the war, and the conviction that future conflicts would require a "totally different" type of Army. No plans existed for the limited war that Korea was to become, and no plans were in place to create quickly a force that could meet the challenge of a limited war. Indeed, when North Korea first invaded its southern neighbor, vestiges of immediate postwar thinking still lingered. Some hoped U.S. involvement could be limited to "air, sea, and logistical support, leaving the ground combat to the Republic of Korea," and that U.S. participation in ground warfare could be safely relegated to a bygone era. 3 In the past, such a plan might have worked; after all, the United States had been able to keep its allies in the fight during World War II by supplying extensive material and logistical aid. Such assistance acted as a bulwark against an overpowering German war machine and afforded the United States time to prepare for its own mobilization on a years-long timeline. The world had changed since 1939, however. The poor combat performance of the Army of the Republic of Korea during the opening days of the war, in addition to its near-total lack of armor, quickly ended any hope that the Americans would have the luxury of time to prepare for this particular fight. Indeed, part of the challenge of Korea that made it distinct from most of America's previous wars was a lack of time that oceans and allies had formerly provided. Army units needed to deploy to the combat zone in days and weeks, not months and years. 4  The Truman administration judged that the crisis in Korea should not be elevated to such a level as to trigger mass mobilization of the citizenry along the lines of the world wars; the President would need a declaration of war from Congress or declare a national emergency to react to North Korean aggression in force. Truman preferred instead to avoid escalation by crafting a measured response to the crisis.

Manpower, however, was the most pressing issue. The Regular Army had ten combat divisions with an authorized strength of 630,201, but it boasted an actual strength of only about 591,000 men. Around 360,000 of those were in the United States, making up two infantry divisions, one and two-thirds airborne divisions, a single armored division, one regimental combat team, and an armored cavalry regiment. Around 231,000 men, most of whom were on occupation duty, were overseas: about 108,500 in the Far East, nearly 95,000 in Europe, 7,000 in the Pacific, 7,500 in Alaska, 12,200 in the Caribbean, and several thousand more in various military mis-  , 1959; Casey, 2008, pp. 233-265.   7 For histories of the first year of the war, see Allan R.

Within weeks, the Army was in dire need of combat replacements. Up to that point in time, the Regular Army had provided the manpower as a matter of expediency. The General Reserve in the United States was now depleted, going from 140,000 men to 90,000 only one month into the war. Infantry units such as the 3rd Division and the 7th and 14th Regimental Combat Teams were 600 men under cadre strength. Over half of the armor strength was already deployed, and the remaining armor units were 100 men short of cadre requirements. The Reserve's total infantry strength dropped to 40,000 men by early August. Only the 82nd Airborne, the 3rd Cavalry, and some antiaircraft artillery units remained intact enough for immediate use in other contingencies. The overall result was a decline in the fighting quality of combat units and decreased morale. The loss of many of the most qualified men who normally would have trained draftees and reservists in the later phases of mobilization also directly impinged on the Army's ability to expand. 15 In a strategic sense, raiding the General Reserve for its manpower meant that for up to a year before the reserve was replenished the United States had no effective means of responding to emergency situations elsewhere in the world.
In the initial weeks of the emergency, planners focused on the immediate response to the situation in the Far East. Relatively soon, they faced the difficult matter of decid- 13 Thomas E.

Broadly speaking, federalizing the National Guard units mostly took some pressure off of the General Reserve as it rebuilt from the deleterious effects of the first weeks of the war. The Army, however, still faced the immediate need for individual replacements, mostly junior officers and enlisted men. A logical source was the Organized Reserve Corps, many of them veterans of World War II who could ostensibly receive refresher training with weapons and equipment the same or similar to what they had employed only five years earlier. Like the rest of the Army, the lack of congressional appropriations and Army oversight in the immediate postwar period resulted in an Organized Reserve Corps that was not well prepared for war. Only half of its numbers were assigned to organized units, meaning that the other half of Organized Reserve Corps members had likely not received active-duty training since their demobilization after World War II. Additionally, organized units diminished the replacement pool, as Army policy held that officers and enlisted men in units would remain together in case of emergencies elsewhere in the world and thus would not be used as individual replacements in Korea. 23 To come to full strength, the Organized Reserve Corps required an additional 146,000 officers and 956,000 enlisted men. The fiscal year 1951 budget funded only 73,500 officers and 181,500 men, which the Army had not achieved by June 1950. Yet, combat losses and the developing situation in Korea meant that FECOM required 82,500 individual replacements by September 1950 to bring its units to wartime strength.

Despite the induction of individual fillers, though, this would not alleviate the manpower situation immediately, as it took six months for replacements to complete basic training and other tasks, and be deployed to the combat zone. After four major recalls, by mid-1951 more than 43,000 Reserve officers had been recalled, and the available supply had been exhausted at year's end. 27 The Officers Candidate School and Reserve Officers' Training Corps, however, were capable of picking up the requirement and alleviating the strain. Enlisted shortages remained a problem. Around 100,000 entered active duty in two phases in 1950, with an additional 25,000 recalled in 1951. 28  Deferments meant that the enlisted Voluntary Reserve pool had been exhausted after the third recall, forcing the Army to turn to Selective Service and the Guard. The Army set a quota in the first half of 1951 for 340,000 men, and the Selective Service System provided 25,000 above that demand. Since it had already reached its fiscal year goal, the call in the last half 1951 was for only 143,000. 29 Given the manpower drain on the Regular Army, the cadres who normally would have conducted training were sent to Korea as replacements, necessitating National Guard divisions take over the training role for initial inductees. 30  Given that the political, military, economic, and strategic situation was far outside what peacetime planners had anticipated, the Joint Staff mobilization plan was an ad-hoc scheme to meet an unforeseen challenge. 31 The fundamental balance of mobilization shifted. From the Revolutionary War to World War II, the United States had relied on a small Regular Army, reinforced by volunteer units and individuals and units from the National Guard-or its equivalent in the state militias-and Organized Reserves, all expanded into a mass citizen army through conscription. In Korea, the sudden emergency and reliance on a partial mobilization meant that the Army leaned on trained manpower, utilizing the Regular Army and civilian components as much as practicable, while attempting to preserve the capabilities and capacity to respond to larger and more important threats elsewhere, should the need arise. It is telling that this first incarnation took place as a result of impromptu action by the Joint Staff rather than planners in peacetime. In this sense, the philosophical shift necessary to move away from the nation's customary approach to mobilization and fix this new course of action as routine had not yet taken place. Indeed, the old way of thinking, based on outdated assumptions about the nature of war and the time available for mobilization, persisted well into the 1960s as President Lyndon B. Johnson's decisions about mobilization for Vietnam would prove. Korea, however, was the first step.
As the Army rapidly expanded and brought in thousands of individual fillers from the Organized Reserve Corps, it also recalled selected Organized Reserve Corps and National Guard support units. By the start of August 1950, the Army had recalled 202 Organized Reserve Corps and 134 Guard units and began the process to bring these up to authorized strength through recruiting volunteers, recalling reservists (active, inactive, and volunteer), and conscription. 32 All told, by the end of the first year of fighting, the Army had grown from 590,000 to more than 1,530,000, including more than 172,000 soldiers from the Inactive and Volunteer Reserves, 34,000 organized reservists, and 95,000 National Guardsmen. The Army found further sources of manpower through the draft and voluntary compulsion, inducting 550,000 draft-ees and 175,000 volunteers by mid-1951. 33 Since nearly all Army units, regardless of component, were short personnel and equipment when the war started, the Army also redistributed personnel and equipment to deployed and deploying units to fulfill the combatant commander's request for Army forces. By the end of 1950, the Guard had turned over a number of its tanks, light aircraft, and tactical vehicles to the Regular Army; after a year of fighting, nearly $200 million in equipment had been transferred. 34 The Chief of the National Guard Bureau reported that "Requests for equipment were screened by the National Guard Bureau to ascertain the effects of losses on the training program. Although losses resulted in limitations, the training program was not hampered critically." 35  Of the four Guard combat divisions initially mobilized, two were destined for Japan-the 40th from California and the 45th from Oklahoma. The manning levels for the two divisions when they were alerted for mobilization had been just 51 and 44 percent, respectively. Upon mobilization, both received thousands of new members in several increments, typically recalled individuals from the Volunteer and Inactive Reserves or untrained conscripts. Even though the two divisions were only partially trained, General Douglas MacArthur pressured for their shipment to Japan to strengthen the defenses there, since the Regular Army division on occupation duty had been deployed to the Korean peninsula. The Secretary of Defense consented to the request in February, but MacArthur was specifically directed that the divisions would remain in Japan and not deploy to Korea. 36 By April 1951, both divisions had arrived in Japan, where they continued training and remained for nine months on occupation duty until finally reaching roughly 100 percent of their authorized men and equipment.
MacArthur's replacement in April 1951 as supreme commander of United Nations' forces in Korea, General Matthew B. Ridgway, wanted to leave the 40th and 45th in Japan on occupation duty, wishing instead to use their trained personnel as individual fillers for units fighting in Korea. Army Chief of Staff Collins refused, claiming "such a move would bring down the justifiable wrath from the National Guard Association," which had already made known its vehement disagreement with any dismantling of its units. 37 Additional personnel were needed soon, however, to backfill Guardsmen, Reservists, and conscript fillers whose enlistment contracts were set to expire or who had earned enough points to rotate out of the combat zone. Collins disagreed with Ridgway's plan to leave the 45th and 40th in Japan, believing that not employing the two divisions in combat invited recriminations from Guardsmen and their supporters in Congress, possibly worsening Army-Guard relations and implying that the Army's training program had failed. For these reasons, the Army rotated the 1st Cavalry and 24th Infantry Divisions from Korea to Japan and deployed the 40th and 45th Divisions into combat. 38 Soldiers in the 1st Cavalry Division who had not earned sufficient points to rotate out were transferred to the 45th Division as it arrived in December 1951. This battlefield influx of 36 officers and 2,411 enlisted men from the 1st Cavalry finally brought the 45th to full strength for its officers and somewhat overstrength in enlisted men. The 40th followed two months later. 39  Thus, nearly 18 months elapsed between activation and the divisions entering combat in Korea. By spring of 1952, there were virtually no original Oklahoman Guardsmen left in the 45th, with mostly recalled Reservists, Regulars, volunteers, and conscripts providing the bulk of its manpower. 40 After less than one month in Korea, some of its members became eligible to return stateside and bid farewell to active duty. The experience of the 40th and 45th in terms of post-mobilization preparation time was similar to the other activated National Guard divisions. The 28th and the 43rd went to Europe to bolster the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance in November 1951. 41 The last four remained in the states as an emergency reserve.
Planners realized that unless units and soldiers were deployed for the entire war some unit or individual rotation system would be required. The Truman administration and the Department of Defense (DoD) decided not to follow the example of World War II, where soldiers served "for the duration plus six (months)." Planners were wary of burning soldiers out by keeping them in-theater for the duration, as had been the case in World War II. As a result, the Army instead devised a system whereby it would maintain eight combat divisions in Korea-six Regular joined by two Guard divisions after nearly 18 months-with the burden spread between a rotating cast of individual Regulars, Guardsmen, Reservists, volunteers, and large numbers of conscripts. Such a system was not unprecedented. Individual replacements had been common during World War II, and would continue during the limited reserve mobilization that took place in Vietnam following the Tet Offensive in 1968. Truman extended the Guard call up from 21 months to 24 in the summer of 1951; all others were subject to a point 38 William M.

Partial mobilization and a considerable reliance on the reserve components brought attendant difficulties for the Army, including scrutiny at home about the Department of the Army's manpower choices. Because of post-World War II neglect, both congressional and military, many of the smaller units of the Organized Reserve Corps that deployed to Korea took anywhere from seven to nine months to prepare for combat. The 1948 Selective Service Act had allowed men to enlist in the Guard without active-duty training to avoid the draft. Partly as a result, the Guard divisions that mobilized in 1950 reported that between only a quarter and a half of their personnel were military occupational specialty-qualified, and many of the youngest Guardsmen had no active duty experience at all, apart from the two weeks of annual training. 46  A post-armistice congressional report also found that a lack of training was systemic. On average, National Guard units required an extra year of training before they were "combat worthy." 47  Nor were these problems limited to the Army. Senator Leverett Saltonstall, chairman of the Committee on Armed Services, found that many reservists-which includes Guardsmen and Reservists from all services-served in absentia:
Thousands of non-pay reservists, who were recalled, however, were not actively participating in any Reserve [all Services, Guard and Reserve] training program. They were merely names carried on a roll. The calling of these men for Korea in preference to those paid members of an active unit who remained at home is the most frequent criticism leveled at the Armed Forces Reserve program…The vacuum in the Reserve forces caused by the Korean recall has not been overcome in the past 2½ years. 48   The Organized Reserve Corps faced its own problems. It was composed of both units and individuals. The individuals in the Volunteer Reserve and the Inactive Reserve were mainly World War II veterans who had not trained or been paid for many years. The Volunteer Reserves, as their name suggests, expected to be called when needed. The Inactive Reserves did not expect to be called, except as part of a full mobilization. Contrary to what would appear to be common sense in hindsight, the Army first called on the Inactive Reserves and then the Volunteer Reserves to fill deploying and deployed units, and individual vacancies created by combat casualties, before activat- ing organized units. As one might expect, this caused significant friction in the force. A congressional report filed by House Armed Services Committee Chairman Overton Brooks argued that the Korean War proved beyond doubt that our present Reserve system is wrong; at least the Reserve Program is not geared to the needs of the times. Further, since the partial mobilization of the reserve components, it has been proven that they were not in a sufficient state of readiness. . . . [T]he Reserve Program is not geared to the needs of the times. 49   The spectacle of activating these unpaid and untrained World War II veterans sooner than paid and trained organized units provoked considerable controversy and attracted congressional attention. 50 In 1952, Chief of Staff Collins testified about the strain and obstacles of mobilizing, deploying, and then demobilizing reserve component units:
If we replace our active units with other Reserve units, the procedure would be both vastly expensive and terribly inefficient. When a National Guard or Organized Reserve unit is mustered out it takes considerable time to reconstitute it and make it as effective as when it was mustered in. . . . [I]t (is) imperative that we maintain the strength and effectiveness of our active forces. By far the most efficient and economical way to do that would be to retain the active units which we now have. 51   Congress subsequently directed the release from active duty of all recalled members of the Volunteer and Inactive Reserves who had served at least 12 months in World War II and 17 months of active duty for the Korean conflict, with some exceptions for critical skills. This resulted in the discharge of nearly all such recalled Reservists by Christmas 1951. Looking back on the Korean War in 1965, Congressman William Bray commented that, "[b]ecause of these inequities and the lack of a genuine mobilization capability of our Reserve Forces during Korea, it was evident that additional legislative action was required by Congress." 52 Regardless, the nation did not have a system of reserve activation in place that fit the needs of the time.
Armistice talks commenced in November 1951, but the peace agreement was not signed until July 1953, after a year and a half of defensive combat along the 38th Parallel that often resembled the destructiveness of trench warfare in World War I. The new Dwight D. Eisenhower administration, well aware of the war's unpopularity with the public, had made it a priority to bring the war to a quick close and communicate its unwillingness to be drawn into such limited wars in the future. 53 To that end, and with the aim of downsizing ever-ballooning federal budgets, in 1954 Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles introduced the "New Look" in American foreign policy. In theory, no more would the United States involve itself in unpopular and intractable limited wars that taxed understrength Regular Army and reserve component divisions. Now, the focus would be on avoiding wars through the deterrent effect of immediate and massive nuclear retaliation: In other words, a return to the post-World War II worldview that "everything about war had changed." 54 However, as we shall see later, not everyone in the Armed Forces agreed with the New Look approach, perhaps especially Army Chief of Staff Matthew Ridgway.
In 1952, Congress passed the Armed Forces Reserve Act, which created the modern United States Army Reserve out of the Organized Reserve Corps, and defined the types of reserve forces that would be maintained. 55 The act set the maximum enrollment at 1.5 million soldiers for the Ready Reserve-which consisted of personnel and units of the reserve components "who are liable for active duty either in time of war, in time of national emergency declared by the Congress or proclaimed by the President, or when otherwise authorized by law"-and mandated that they be "maintained for the purpose of providing trained units and qualified individuals to be available for active duty in the Armed Forces of United States in time of war or national emergency, and at such other times as the national security may require, to meet the requirements of the Armed Forces of the United States in excess of those of the Regular compo- 53 Eisenhower put the Korean War at the top of his list of priorities when campaigning for the presidency, part of his "K1C2" formula for victory: Korea, Communism, and corruption.

The overall focus of the 1952 act was to improve the readiness of the state Guards and federal reserves and to codify the requirement to mobilize members of units with their units, "Insofar as practicable." The 1952 act further stated that "This shall not be interpreted as prohibiting the reassignment of personnel of such units after being ordered into the active military service of the United States."
A 1955 amendment to the Armed Forces Reserve Act targeted specific problems identified in congressional reports issued throughout the course of that year. 61 Senate reports from January and December 1954 noted that the 1952 act had not resolved many personnel problems. Army reserve forces, in particular, were plagued by too many officers and too few enlisted personnel, many of whom left the reserve components at the end of their active service due to the ambiguity of what might await them. "The sudden call to active duty which confronts reservists operates in many instances as a hazard to the planning of their lives," a Senate report from January 1954 observed. 62 Turnover, too, was an issue for all reserve components, with some units reporting 50 percent in the course of a year. 63 This improved somewhat by the end of 1954, but the subsequent report in December recognized that the Army National Guard in particular continued to suffer from high turnover, which contributed to significant problems maintaining a high level of skill in its enlisted ranks. 64  Additionally, Congress found that the activation of unpaid reservists who participated in no reserve training programs, rather than paid members of active reserve units, created "distrust and resentment on the part of the nonpaid reservists." 65 The Senate observed that "These men were World War II veterans who joined the Reserves to retain their rank with the thought of service only upon the declaration of war. They concluded that only units on a drill pay status would be subject to being called first in the event of an emergency declared by Presidential proclamation." 66 However, the Truman administration supported a limited war with limited objectives and, therefore, partial mobilization. Truman explicitly wanted to avoid communicating panic to the

Typically, the Army levied National Guard units for Regulars, volunteers, reservists, and conscripts that had been assigned to the unit upon/after mobilization, leaving Guardsmen in Guard units. Truman and his advisers were reluctant to utilize the units of the Organized Reserves, as they were the strategic reserve that would face potential Soviet aggression in Europe. In retrospect, the Department of the Army chose the only available option: calling up veterans from the Volunteer and Inactive Reserves, at least until adequate conscripts had been inducted and trained. Yet, the Senate report characterized this policy as "inexplicable," and observed that the "vacuum in the Reserve forces caused by the Korean recall has not been overcome in the past 2 1/2 years." 
67
The 1955 legislation, known as the Reserve Forces Act, therefore, sought to remedy many of these problems. It increased the Ready Reserve ceiling from 1.5 million men to 2.9 million, although it did not explain how previous policies that failed to create a Ready Reserve of 1.5 million would now be able to create a Ready Reserve nearly twice that size. It also authorized the President to order up to 1 million reservists in time of emergency. He could do so without having to wait for congressional consent, a major shift from prewar policy, which provided for no such partial mobilization and allowed either full mobilization for a national emergency or nothing at all. It was also a significant shift in that it located this power in the office of the President, rather than allowing it to remain with Congress as it had in the past. Further, the act defined more clearly the obligations that those entering the Ready Reserve had to participate in drills and annual training, and established ways of compelling such service from the obli-gated. Finally, it reduced the scope of military obligation from eight to six years. 
68
At the conclusion of the Korean War, the Regular Army consisted of more than 1.5 million men in 20 combat divisions with a budget of nearly $13 billion, although it was in the process of falling to just $8.7 billion by 1956.

During the 1950s, the Regular Army was much larger than the Army National Guard, as defense planners and policymakers discerned the need to have large forces at a relatively high state of readiness to counter a Soviet assault into Western Europe or thwart Soviet expansion elsewhere. The Regular Army averaged nearly 1.2 million soldiers, while the Army National Guard averaged just over 330,000. This amounted to an important shift in Army organizational structure and expansibility-during the 18th and 19th centuries, the Regular Army was significantly smaller than the militia. From 1903 to 1940, the difference narrowed, but the Regular Army remained the smaller force. In 1939, for example, the Regular Army stood at 130,000 and the National Guard at 180,000.
Thus, within the first 15 years of the Cold War, the relative size of the Regular Army and the Army National Guard had flipped, and they have stayed that way since World War II. This change reflected the historical evolution of moving away from relying on the militia clause of the Constitution as a means of augmenting and expanding the Army in war. The reforms of the National Guard, started in 1903 by Elihu Root and then continued in the subsequent changes in statutory law from 1903 to 1940 that organized the Guard as a reserve component of the Army under the armies clause of the Constitution, sounded the death knell of the older militia tradition. 77  At the same time, DoD spent several years pressuring the Army National Guard of the states and territories either to bring their divisions up to full strength or to com- 76 Stewart, 2010, p. 261. bine them with the intent of halving the overall number. NGAUS President Walsh resisted strenuously. He clearly understood the political influence of many Guard divisions across the country, regardless of their authorized manning levels, and the many general officers who would be required to lead those divisions. Bringing all divisions up to full strength was likely impossible-i.e., states and communities could not provide twice the personnel-in addition to being quite costly, and a number of administrative problems were entailed in combining divisions manned at 50 percent, which Army Guard divisions in the 1950s were. As he asserted in a 1954 address to the adjutants general:
On February 3, 1954, the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower and Personnel emphasized that the National Guard, Army National Guard, had to be made stronger by being brought up to full strength in order to be ready immediately for combat. When he was questioned as to how he proposed to accomplish this in the absence of a system of national security training and the probable refusal of Congress to appropriate more money . . . he replied by compulsory inductions by Selective Service and, if necessary, he would go so far as to combine two divisions in order to bring one up to full strength . . . Relative to the matter of combining two divisions . . . it was pointed out to the Secretary that this would accomplish precisely nothing, as the degree of maturity or experience would remain precisely the same, since the personnel of one division was identical with another, and the net result would be the loss of one division and the rendering of some 900 officers surplus.

Eisenhower's "New Look" national security policy, centered on an air-delivered nuclear capability instead of a conventional military, gathered much of its appeal from its costsaving measures. The administration relied on the threat of employing nuclear weapons in the event of any provocation-otherwise known as "Massive Retaliation"-to deter Soviet belligerence, as well as to provide a cost-effective means of response if deterrence failed. The policy found approval with a public that had spent several years underwriting an expanded military to fight global war. In line with the policy's goals, DoD sought to trim and restructure Army ground forces.
Additionally, there still existed a perception that nuclear weapons had fundamentally altered the nature of war. We have seen how this impression affected postwar attitudes with respect to the question of universal military training. Nuclear weapons also forced alternative thinking about ways of war, as the upper echelons of military leadership not only in the United States but also in Moscow began contemplating new approaches to warfare. Soviet Marshal of Armored Forces Pavel Rotmistrov promoted such thinking in 1958, arguing that troops now needed to group quickly to attack and then disperse rapidly to avoid becoming the target of a nuclear counterattack. "High mobility of troops on the battlefield is one of the most important features of modern combined arms warfare," he advised.
80
Within a year of the armistice in Korea, the writing was on the wall for a downsized Army. After an unsettlingly inconclusive end to the war, in the halls of the Pentagon and in popular opinion the utility of ground forces was seriously in question. The White House, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Secretary of Defense were all proponents of nuclear deterrence, and thus opposed a large Army. NATO chose to transition to Massive Retaliation in 1954, abandoning conventional rearmament for nuclear deterrence. In the minds of Army Chief of Staff General Matthew Ridgway and his successor General Maxwell Taylor, however, Massive Retaliation was inherently inflexible, as it supposed that the deterrent power of nuclear weapons would prevent any war from occurring. Army leadership began articulating a countervailing vision, one that stressed a balance between conventional and atomic forces to meet threats with a commensurate response. 81  To meet the demands of limited warfare in the nuclear age and a potential major ground war with the Soviet Union in eastern Europe while functioning under austere defense budgets, General Taylor ordered a series of studies intended to determine the best way to maintain combat strength despite budget reductions. These efforts resulted in the formation of the "Pentomic" division to meet better the perceived challenges of nuclear warfare. Each division consisted of 13,500 soldiers, some 3,500 fewer than the triangular divisions they replaced. They would also now comprise five self-sufficient battle groups rather than regiments ostensibly capable of operating independently. In 1957 testimony before the House Armed Services Committee, Taylor harkened back to his experience as an airborne commander during World War II when explaining the virtues of the new organization:
. . . all Army units must be trained for all-around combat in the same way we trained and fought our airborne divisions in World War II. . . . The [five Pentomic] infantry regiments . . . are administratively self-contained, air-transportable units organized essentially like the groups in the airborne division. 82   The proposed divisions were to have artillery and missile support, both conventional and nuclear. Each division would be able to concentrate quickly, execute its mission, and then disperse before a nuclear counterattack, similar to the proposal of Soviet armor commander Pavel Rotmistrov. 83 The new formation would potentially capitalize on improvements in communications equipment (which allowed commanders better control over their units), armored personnel carriers (which would allow greater mobility and greater exploitation of targets of opportunity), and tactical aircraft (which would provide crucial battlefield surveillance as well as rapid aerial mobility). 84 Thus, the Regular Army shrank from about 1.6 million men personnel in 1952 to around 860,000 in 1959, and 15 Regular divisions, compared with the 19 it maintained at the end of the Korean War. 85  Reorganization to Pentomic divisions met with some resistance from senior Army officers who were doubtful as to whether the new equipment could live up to its promises. General Taylor overruled all objections, however, and pushed forward with a test case of the 101st Airborne Division at Fort Campbell in 1956. He announced a year later that all infantry and airborne divisions would reorganize under the new structure by 1958 and embarked on a campaign to shift the thinking of skeptical officers. 86  Taylor believed that the new structure would allow the Army to meet the challenge of the atomic age-both in combat and on Capitol Hill when it came time to battle for its share of the defense budget-and act as a catalyst for new technology and doctrine. In his mind the reorganization would allow the nation to fight smaller, non-nuclear, limited wars such as Korea, providing flexibility of response where nuclear deterrence had provided none. "To support the deterrent philosophy," he argued in June 1956, "the Army-indeed the entire national military program must be suitable for flexible application to unforeseen situations, not frozen to any one concept of future war." 87  The new structure, however, soon showed serious cracks. Some appeared comparatively minor, but had great symbolic importance-the disposal of regimental affiliations, for example, which left soldiers without unit identities that had existed, in some cases, for generations. Some posed more immediate concerns. The technology that Taylor had relied on for communications and rapid dispersal-the radios and armored personnel carriers-was available only in short supply due to austere budgets, leaving company commanders uncertain as to how to either attack or defend their positions. Pentomic units lacked tactical mobility, as well, making maneuver difficult.
More troubling, however, was the way in which exercises held in Europe by the Seventh Army revealed the extent to which the use of nuclear weapons would actually alter the nature of warfare. Exercise Sabre Hawk, held in February 1958, instructed that each corps should plan for the evacuation of 2,000 casualties per day. Exercise operators were unable to comply with this directive, as they would not have had adequate resources remaining to complete the actual exercise. Not only did the new structure not provide enough transportation capabilities, but division artillery also lacked sufficient conventional or atomic firepower. 88 Exercise Bounce Back, held in December

Apart from these larger considerations, the exercises also revealed more prosaic flaws in the Pentomic structure. With intermediate brigades or regimental echelons removed in the name of sleekness and flexibility, division commanders were now directly tasked with the command and control of up to 16 subordinate units. 91 Moreover, although the new design had been intended to provide for both conventional and nuclear conflicts, exercises showed that the Pentomic divisions' ability to meet a conventional threat was greatly diminished. The reorganized divisions were designed almost solely for nuclear war. Many soldiers and officers never really accepted the new Pentomic organization. Criticisms abounded in tactical units where soldiers recognized they did not have the mobility or communications they required.
In keeping with its operating philosophy of mirroring the structure of the Regular Army, the Guard was impatient to reorganize along the same lines. "The Army National Guard has been anxious, in fact, we urged long ago that our units be reorganized into the type of units necessary to complement our active Army," NGAUS president Major General 
William Harrison said in September 1958. "

that there be no unreasonable delay in the application of the Pentomic concept to our divisions." 
92
The Army National Guard spent some time in the 1950s shifting divisions and personnel to consolidate units across states. Some state Guards reported gains from these actions. North Carolina, for example, which had previously shared the 30th Infantry Division jointly with Tennessee, received the entire division for itself in 1953, boosting its numbers with members from nondivisional units.

Congress in the fiscal years 1950 and 1951 limited the strength of the Army and Air National Guard to 399,500. . . . For the fiscal year 1954, the Bureau of the Budget has limited the year-end strength of the Army National Guard to 303,000, exclusive of (divisions) in active Federal service. 96  Dryly characterizing these troop allocations as "unduly optimistic," Walsh went on to detail how from 1946 to 1949, the Guard was able to organize fully 5,150 units "with a strength slightly in excess of 350,000," as required by the Department of the Army. In an Army that was unable to avail itself of the UMT-trained pool that planners had counted on, the Guard would continue to resist pressure to streamline its structure. 97 In 1958, NGAUS president, and the Massachusetts Adjutant

The Army's first post-World War II mobilization revealed critical weaknesses in the policies that had evolved since the end of World War II. While the concept of a larger Regular Army augmented by reserve components-as opposed to an Army largely based on mass conscription-eventually proved to be a solid one, the low state of readiness across the Army, largely a result of public and political disinterest and inadequate funding, caused considerable trouble at the war's outset. Fighting a limited war in East Asia soon after a decisive world war while maintaining high readiness levels in other potential theaters of the Cold War constituted a significant challenge. Additionally, Korea set the stage for many future conflicts in the immediacy of its requirements: The United States did not have the luxury of months or years to gather and train its soldiers. In many ways, Korea was the first "come as you are" war of the 20th century, not including the expedition into Mexico in 1916-1917, and the difficulties with mobilization reflected that. 
102
While the Army's reorganization into the Pentomic structure remained incomplete, the experiment with the new divisions, and the subsequent exercises, demon-strated that ultimately it was intellectually and philosophically impossible for the Army to plan for nuclear war the same way that it planned for other contingencies. The characteristics that made nuclear retaliation an act to be avoided at all costs-its very unthinkability-were the same characteristics that made nuclear war nearly impossible to plan for. Nuclear war theorists such as Albert Wohlstetter and Herman Kahn built careers conceptualizing the broad strokes of nuclear war and nuclear deterrence. Army planners, however, were tasked with figuring out how to perform maneuver and fire, communications, logistical supply, and casualty evacuation on a nuclear battlefield. Exercises showed that these tasks were almost impossible to execute during nuclear scenarios.
Not everyone believed that the New Look aided U.S. security. High-profile Army leaders like Generals Matthew Ridgway and Maxwell Taylor, both former commanders of the Eighth Army in Korea and Army chiefs of staff, retired in the 1950s and publicly expressed their concerns about the deleterious effects that the emphasis on nuclear deterrence had on the Army. The influential Lieutenant General James Gavin resigned in 1958 as director of Army Research and Development, citing disagreements with defense policy. In the run-up to the 1960 presidential election, Ridgway, Taylor, and Gavin all wrote books outlining their views on national security, including their opposition to a near-exclusive reliance on a nuclear deterrence. 103 President John F. Kennedy and his Secretary of Defense, Robert S. McNamara, would soon embark on a bold series of reorganizations intended to enable the Army to meet any threat, regardless of where it fell on the force spectrum. Their concept, called Flexible Response, would soon be tested after Kennedy's inauguration. 103 Free to express their frustrations as civilians, Ridgway and Gavin offered the most acidic evaluations of the Army's poor state due to the national security policies of the day.

Mobilization for the Korean War had exposed great flaws in the planning assumptions that drove the postwar organization of the Army-among them, that the reserves would be fully trained and ready to deploy when needed. A different Army, however, entered the 1960s, reorganized to meet the threat of nuclear war. Its Regular forces outnumbered its standing reserve forces for the first time in modern American history. Those standing reserves had been the subject of considerable legislative effort, intended to provide for standardized training levels that would allow them in the event of an emergency to deploy with considerably fewer headaches than during the mobilization for Korea. Congress had striven to clarify service obligations as much as possible, not only for the benefit of DoD planners but also so that their constituents would better be able to plan their own lives; the public's distaste for the activation of unpaid reservists vice paid reservists for Korea had left a deep impression. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that mobilization for the Berlin Crisis of 1961 proceeded more smoothly than Korea's. While some problems remained,

Secretary of Defense Robert S. McNamara emerged from the Berlin Crisis with a new vision for how the reserve forces should look. Believing it clumsy and inefficient to have two separate reserves-a National Guard beholden to the states and an anemic and understrength Army Reserve-he set about trying to combine the two into a single state-based entity that would, in deference to the Guard's historical role, be known as the National Guard. To McNamara, the plan was sensible on its face; it would save valuable taxpayer dollars and streamline the existing structure of the reserve forces. However, he did not count on the extent to which the existing legal structures had become entrenched. While the National Guard had no particular objection to the merger-largely because it would continue to exist under the same name, augmented by personnel from the newly dissolved Reserve-proponents of the Army Reserve fought back with every tool at their disposal, just as the National Guard and its lobbying arm, the National Guard Association of the United States, had opposed for several decades any changes to the Guard with which they disagreed. To his chagrin, McNamara eventually yielded to the stubbornness of a force structure designed some 40 years prior.
The Berlin Crisis was the first semi-serious test of the Army's training and readiness levels since the Korean War. In 1961, Soviet Chairman Nikita Khrushchev renewed demands originally made in 1958 that Western forces withdraw from West Berlin, and threatened to renege on the Soviet postwar agreement to allow continued Western access to the city. In response, President Kennedy authorized the July 1961 call-up of up to 250,000 members of the Ready Reserve. The crisis continued throughout the summer and into the fall, with refugees from socialist East Berlin streaming to the western side of the city. The Soviet-backed German Democratic Republic answered this with the construction of the Berlin Wall. By September, Kennedy decided to augment American troops in Berlin with additional ground and air units. To replace Regular Army divisions that comprised the strategic reserve, Kennedy ordered to active duty for training the 32nd Infantry (Wisconsin) and 49th Armored (Texas) National Guard divisions, the 100th USAR Training Division (to establish a new training center at Fort Chafee to increase Army basic training capacity of conscripts), and other nondivision units from the reserve components. In total, 84 National Guard and 166 Army Reserve units were mobilized.

It is not hard to convince an aggressor that an all-out nuclear attack on the United States would produce an all-out response. But a second type of deterrence is more complicated-deterrence of extreme provocation or aggression which nevertheless does not involve a direct attack on the United States. When the Soviets contemplate an extreme provocation or aggressive act, they must evaluate whether it would lead the United States to strike at Russia. Hence, a situation in which we are trying to deter extreme provocation is also a situation in which the Soviets are trying to deter our direct attack upon them in retaliation. . . . There is . . . a school of thought which maintains that retaliatory and mobilization measures merely accelerate the conflict; that such acceleration could lead to nuclear war; and, hence, that any such measures should be avoided. 9   As with Korea, the U.S. President elected, sensibly, to resolve the crisis with measures short of nuclear war. As with Korea, he also elected to mobilize portions of the reserve components, but in this case none were deployed overseas.
The response to the Berlin Crisis indicated that measures well short of nuclear war could serve as a valuable tool in America's foreign policy kit. In keeping with the continued shift away from the New Look, Secretary of Defense McNamara was determined to reorganize the Army away from the Pentomic divisions. In keeping with the concept of Flexible Response, divisions themselves would be reorganized to provide more conventional firepower and maneuverability while offering flexibility in operation types and environments. While in theory the Pentomic structure had ostensibly Md.: Johns Hopkins University

The Reorganization Objective Army Division (ROAD) concept required four types of divisions: infantry, armor, airborne, and mechanized. The standard ROAD division would contain three brigades (plus headquarters and support units), shifting its composition to reduce infantry, add armor, or adjust composition as necessary to meet the terrain and threat: more or less, the same structure that the Army had used in World War II and Korea, with additional flexibility built in for infantry units. 10  This reorganization proceeded much more smoothly than the shift to Pentomic divisions, partly because many units had not changed to the Pentomic concept, and partly because the Army had actually successfully tested the concept in 1962. Division conversions began in 1963 and all Army divisions were converted by the middle of the following year. 11
The Berlin Crisis mobilization had been a success in the sense that Kennedy had called the Soviet bluff. The experience, coupled with the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, however, alarmed McNamara. These two events added to the urgency with which he approached reorganization, but they did not precipitate it. On

McNamara wanted to increase the responsiveness and readiness of reserve component units. In addition, he looked to reduce lengthy delays between mobilization and deployment for combat that had been the norm during mobilizations for World War I and World War II. McNamara believed that changes in the reserve component structure were needed "to bring manpower and equipment into balance with each other and with our contingency war plans" in order to "increase combat readiness and streamline management." 15  McNamara was not the only one concerned with manning levels in the reserves. The Chief of the National Guard Bureau reported that from September to December 1961 Department of the Army policy did not allow for procurement of non-prior service personnel under 20 years old. On November 21, 1961, this policy was changed to allow for the procurement of personnel under 22 years old at the time of their enlistment. 16 This apparent effort not to undercut conscription efforts complicated Guard recruiting. In November 1961, the president of NGAUS wrote that:
It will not, in my opinion, be possible to maintain authorized strengths of organizations remaining in the States unless we are permitted to recruit young men at least through age 21. . . . We no longer can live from crisis to crisis. It is imperative . . . that with the strengthening of our Active Forces, there must be no lessening of the strength and readiness of the Reserve Components. 17 16 Annual Report of the Chief of the National Guard Bureau, 1962, Washington, D.C.: Department of the Army and the Air Force, National Guard Bureau, June 30, 1962, p. 41.   17 Colonel Allan G.

It was DoD's intention, McNamara concluded, "to eliminate that waste." 21 The Guard, for its part, objected to the Secretary's characterization. It pointed out that its portrayal as hidebound and resistant to change was unfair, that it had uncomplainingly adopted the ill-fated Pentomic structure (and had lost 900 units in the process), and that it accommodated Army requests for change "almost on a week-to-week basis." 22 This contrasts with the Chief of the National Guard Bureau's annual report for fiscal year 1962 in which he characterizes the Pentomic structure as "light, mobile, hard hitting . . . ready to fight on nuclear or conventional battlefields." 23 The Guard did indeed make profound alterations to its structure upon Army direction; it added units, dropped units, and reconfigured divisions in the years since the close of World War II. However, it did so in exchange for significant federal funding and recognition that it did not enjoy before it became a reserve component of the Army.
Shifts such as the adoption of the Pentomic structure had left the Guard's fundamental composition unchanged. The configuration of those divisions may have altered, but their numbers remained the same even with the reduction of 900 units, and their peacetime manning levels remained low by design. However, the Guard asserted that manning levels were not necessarily a good indicator of readiness. Major General Harrison inexplicably argued that greater manning could lead to less readiness, claiming that somewhere between a 10 or 15 percent increase in manning levels "will add very slightly to the levels of readiness. This increase would be offset . . . by greater demands on the commander's time and on the administrative staff." The result would be that "less time would be available for training and the preparation of training." 24  As laborious as the Pentomic reorganization had been, it was mere window dressing compared with the elimination of Guard divisions wholesale, and to the merger of remaining divisions into more fully manned entities. McNamara's plan represented a significant shock to an organization accustomed to a certain amount of deference in these matters. 25  In the end, although McNamara did not get everything he wanted, the objections of the Guard were not convincing. As we shall see, by the close of 1968, McNamara had completed the most sweeping reforms of the Army reserve components since 1940. 21 U.S. House of Representatives, 1965a, p. 3576; Crossland and Currie, 1984, p. 148.   22 Colonel Allan G.

Harrison, Jr., "What Do We Mean by Ready?" The National Guardsman, Vol. 16,  No. 8, August, 1962, p. 2.   25 The Guard would not be mollified for some time. In March of 1963, upon notification that six Guard divisions would be given elite status, the editor of The National Guardsman rather snidely observed that "It's nice to know that the "realignment" and discard of four Divisions supposedly is balanced by the elevation of six Divisions among those remaining" (Colonel Allan G. Crist, "The Gap Between Plans and Actuality," The National 
Guardsman, Vol. 17, No. 3, March 1963, inside cover)
As his generals arranged their 1962 ROAD test cases, McNamara floated a plan that would have eliminated four National Guard divisions and four Army Reserve divisions. The cuts would eliminate 58,000 personnel from a force of 700,000 and leave 29 divisions, with the aim of their being ready to deploy with between eight to 34 weeks of mobilization. The six high-priority divisions, deployable in eight weeks, would be manned at 100 percent, or close to it, with 462,000 soldiers. The low-priority units would be manned at much lower strength, with a total of around 180,000. Congress, however, was hostile to this plan, largely because it believed McNamara had bypassed Congress's constitutional duty of raising and supporting armies, including the organization of the reserve forces. 26 A subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee-known as the Hébert Subcommittee after its chair, Representative F. Edward Hébert of Louisiana, who had signed the "Southern Manifesto" in 1956 opposing racial integration of public spaces in response to the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education-examined McNamara's proposed reorganization and issued sharply critical recommendations in August 1962. While it acceded to McNamara's proposition that the Army eliminate undermanned units, it also recommended that it not deactivate any divisions in the Army Guard or Army Reserve until the ROAD structure was fully implemented within the reserve components. Further, it pointedly advised "That the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the military departments utilize the advisory boards on reserve matters in the establishment of reserve policy as originally intended by Congress" [emphasis added]. 27 The subcommittee went on to detail bitingly its concern that the bodies it had established as part of the Armed Forces Act of 1952, originally with the intent of providing advice and guidance on precisely these matters, now found their influence deteriorating because the offices intended to consult with them were not doing so. Some state governors also opposed McNamara's plan, primarily because the reductions in strength would have reduced the number of Army Guard units nationwide from 8,734 to 8,017. Governors articulated their distaste for what they perceived to be both a diminishment of the Guard itself and lessened capability for the local duties that they relied upon the Guard to perform, even though historical usage of National Guard troops for state missions strongly suggested that the recommended smaller force 26 "It offers no concrete solution to the equipment problem which was so manifest during the recent mobilization," the Subcommittee on Military Reserve Posture observed as part of its critique

Undaunted by congressional dislike of his 1962 plan, McNamara tried a different approach in 1964, announcing at a December press conference that he intended, on his authority as Secretary of Defense, to merge the Army Reserve into the National Guard. Convinced that the Guard/Reserve management was duplicative, and wishing to eliminate 15 Guard and six Reserve divisions "for which there was no military requirement," 31 McNamara determined to subsume the remaining Army Reserve units under the Army National Guard in an even more ambitious action than his original plan to eliminate four divisions from each.
The Guard, not surprisingly, had no objections to this plan, as it would eliminate their principal competitor and assure additional federal funding. "This is certainly the most drastic move yet toward attainment of maximum combat readiness," NGAUS president Major General James Cantwell observed mildly, endorsing the plan as the natural continuation of postwar hope that M-Day units-technically "mobilization day," but the term colloquially refers to non-active duty soldiers and unitswould be located almost exclusively within the Regular Army and the National Guard. NGAUS's magazine The National Guardsman published a sanguine article in January 1965 detailing how the Guard would absorb Reserve units. 
32
Our proposal to transfer the Army Reserve units to the Army National Guard should not be interpreted to mean that we consider the former inferior to the latter. Rather, our selection of the Army National Guard is based on two major considerations. First, each of the States has a continuing need for a military force responsive to its Governor. . . . Second, the State National Guard organizations, as the lineal descendants of the State militia, are deeply embedded in our constitutional tradition and in our country's history, and are entitled to preference as the senior Reserve component.

The reason is very fundamental-they are oriented to the Army, not to the States. Many of them acquire valuable technical skills and are employed in important jobs in industry with good pay. They are willing to serve their country in event of national emergency but they simply cannot afford to jeopardize their civilian jobs by subjecting themselves to frequent callups for police duty by the States, or the Federal Government, for that matter. . . . 39   It is self-evident why a lobbying organization would appear before Congress to testify that the entity for which it lobbies should not cease to exist.

Although chagrined by the loss of so many divisions, Johnson's decision not to mobilize the Army National Guard for Vietnam left it in an odd and uncomfortable position. 53 NGAUS president Major General Cantwell wrote in April 1966 that the force had "been cast in a role, in the Viet Nam emergency, to which it is not accustomed. It has been kept on the sidelines, in a backup status, while the Active Forces have been augmented the slow and difficult way, with untrained draftees."

intensive training to meet prescribed standards."
57
During this biennium, nation-wide attention was focused on the National Guard of the United States: first, because of a proposed merger with the Army Reserve which was discarded in favor of a reorganization of the Guard and Reserve separately . . . 58   As an example of what ensued, the North Carolina Army National Guard would go on to lose a medical detachment, a special forces group, and a signal detachment, comprising 65 officers and 337 enlisted men. By 1970, it would consist entirely of its state headquarters and headquarters detachment, some major elements of the 30 th Infantry Division (acquired in the 1950s), and the nondivisional troop command. 59
McNamara's plan to reorganize the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve was similar to the Department of War plan in 1915-militarily, analytically, and fiscally sound, but politically ill-considered. The Berlin Crisis served as an example both of the virtues of Flexible Response and of the problems inherent in relying on the reserve components for rapid wartime expansion, especially those significantly undermanned, underequipped, and undertrained in peacetime. While the 1961 mobilization was much smaller and proceeded somewhat more smoothly than that which took place during the Korean War-it could hardly have gone less smoothly than Korea's-and ultimately resulted in the desired outcome, it still did not produce the type of forces that could deploy quickly with relatively short notice that were so necessary in this new world of smaller, limited warfare. McNamara's point that "we could start from scratch" and create a more efficient and sensible reserve system may have been sharply phrased, but it contained some truth; although Colonel John Carlton of the ROA made good arguments during his testimony about the federal orientation of the Army Reserve, as opposed to the state orientation of the Guard. Still, McNamara's reorganization had effectively weakened the Army by sowing organizational confusion into units that rendered them less effective.
The effort to consolidate the reserve components ultimately foundered on what could be characterized as the intractability of the existing political regime. The United States of the mid-to-late 1960s was very different from that of the 1920s, with completely transformed security concerns. Yet the reserve structure, conceived in the years following World War I, had had four decades to accumulate support in Congress and among state governors, foster familiarity on the national public landscape, and undergo entrenchment in DoD. As Secretary of Defense McNamara found, to his irritation, it was nearly impossible to formulate a restructure that did not disturb one or more of these elements. Indeed, as we have seen, although he was finally able to win the day on some restructuring, the final plan was not nearly as transformative as his original vision of merging the two components.
As U.S. involvement in Vietnam increased, as draft calls continued to rise, and as the reserve components continued to remain havens from the draft, McNamara's points would be illustrated in ways that no Reservist or Guardsman wished. "These men are being wasted," the Secretary had told Congress in 1965, force-in-being arguments notwithstanding, "and the funds that are being expended to support them are being wasted." 60 Johnson's refusal to activate these components for the very purpose for which they were created would lend greater weight to McNamara's words than probably even he had intended. The consequences of that refusal would have grave implications for the Regular Army, for the Army's reserve components, and for the country as a whole. 60 U.S.

Although the American military had been serving in Vietnam since the 1950s, the gradual escalation of the American engagement there during the mid-1960s required more ground forces. 1 In 1965, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara favored augmenting existing forces with 235,000 members of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve. South Vietnam's Army of the Republic of Vietnam experienced several defeats in May and June 1965 at the hands of the communist North Vietnamese Army and its Viet Cong allies in the south. As a result, General William Westmoreland, commander of U.S. forces in South Vietnam, requested more American troops in early June 1965. In turn, McNamara issued a recommendation to President Lyndon Johnson following a fact-finding mission to Vietnam to expand "promptly and substantially" the American troop commitment to Vietnam. The Secretary's plan would increase immediately combat battalions in-country from 15 to 34 and raise the number of American troops from 75,000 to 175,000 by the end of the year. Continued deployments would increase the number to 275,000 by early 1966.

[w]e felt that it would be desirable to have a reserve call-up in order to make sure that the people of the U.S. knew that we were in a war and not engaged at some two-penny military adventure. Because we didn't think it was going to prove to be a two-penny military adventure by any manner of means. 4
The Draft, the Army National Guard, and the Army Reserve Johnson decided early on not to activate reserve forces for the American engagement in Vietnam. Although he would eventually authorize a very limited partial mobilization after the Tet Offensive in early 1968, in his memoirs he articulated his concerns that a call-up would impose too much of a burden on the American public, financially and otherwise. He also recalled the Berlin Crisis and was wary that a call-up might communicate too much aggression to Russia and China and risk a wider war, as had occurred in Korea. Historians have also made the valid argument that the President resisted activating the reserves primarily out of political concerns. Johnson hoped to avoid a public debate on whether the nation should intervene in Southeast Asia at all. The decision was politically selfish, but astute, given that some congressmen were reporting heavy pressure from families potentially affected by reserve activation. 5 Johnson informed the JCS that, if he were to characterize Vietnam as a dire situation or declare a national emergency, it would lead to antagonism at home that would make him a "lonely man." As such, the military was to limit the "political noise level" of the war's escalation. Johnson instead relied on a limited draft and large numbers of volunteers to expand the Army to fight the war. 
6
With the uncertainties of today, it seemed desirable to us to add temporary units to our structure which could stay on to active duty for more than a year, to make it unnecessary to call up Reserve Forces which might have to be released after a year. 7   Instead, the President decided to use the limited draft as authorized in the 1948 Selective Service Act to expand the Regular Army so it could fight in Vietnam. Monthly draft calls were doubled, from 17,000 to 35,000 as the Army progressively increased the size of its force in Vietnam. 8 Ultimately, however, it did not insulate Johnson from public debate on American intervention in Vietnam. Indeed, the war, and especially the drafting of American young men to fight it, became a major issue on college campuses across America, resulting in waves of protests that quickly embroiled the public. 9
The Draft Conscripts, bound to the Army for two years of active duty service, were given no choice as to their assignments and were therefore disproportionately funneled toward armor, infantry, and field artillery-the most hazardous duties. While every American male between the ages of 18 and 26 was eligible for the draft, a 1967 study by the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service found that, in practice, anywhere from a third to a quarter of draftees proved ineligible due to educational deferments or physical deficiencies. 10  Inductions of conscripts rose sharply through 1965 and 1966: 102,600 in the former year, 339,700 in the latter. 11 Voluntary enlistments across all branches increased at the same time, largely because volunteers received a greater say in their military occupational specialty than did conscripts and could therefore avoid the infantry. Johnson's decision not to mobilize the reserve components resulted in a considerable training backlog; as the Army was unable to mobilize already-trained reservists, it needed to grow nearly 25 percent to meet escalating needs in Vietnam. Much of this expansion of capability was drawn from European units, which lost most of their officers and NCOs along with some equipment by early 1966. Training facilities operated nearly at full capacity, and eventually even the reserve components felt the pinch as Regular recruits and conscripts claimed priority for training, leaving reserve volunteers idle until the congestion lessened.
A report from the President's Task Force on Manpower Conservation in early 1964 found that one-third of America's young men soon to turn 18 would be unfit for military service-half of this number would fail for medical reasons, while the other half would not meet mental requirements.

McNamara touted Project 100,000 as a means by which underprivileged men could receive training and education, a stepping stone to civilian careers otherwise unreachable. Roughly 350,000 "New Standards" men were accepted for military service from 1966 to 1969 under the program. Seventy percent were draftees rather than volunteers, and most of them were bound for the Army. More than a third went into combat arms, and thus their military training was not readily translatable into the civilian world. Given that one of the stated purposes of the program was to prepare them for more productive lives after returning to civilian life, this was a distressing reality, especially when the median Armed Forces Qualification Test score for the participants was only 13 out of 100. 15 Very few-only about 3 percent-ended up washing out, largely because the Army was the service branch least particular about its recruits, be they volunteer or conscript. 16  The U.S. Army's Center of Military History found that volunteers who could choose their own assignments oftentimes elected for the technical specialties, while draftees "were more likely to be shunted to combat assignments." Of the Army's battle deaths in 1965, around 28 percent were draftees. This number rose to 34 percent the following year and rose to 57 percent by 1967. 17 Of the 29,150 Army personnel deaths due to hostile action in Vietnam from

Johnson's decision had come as a shock to some in the Guard, and a relief to others. In January 1965, several months before the call-up, National Guardsman magazine published a long article entitled "Is the Draft Doomed?" arguing that "No one in Washington . . . would be surprised if he

On the contrary, in 1965 McNamara authorized 18,500 new billets for the Army National Guard as part of the new Selected Reserve Force of 150,000 soldiers, to be manned and equipped at full strength levels. The Guard promptly began aggressive recruiting for the new Selected Reserve Force, competing with the Regular Army for volunteers. Not surprisingly, many draft-eligible men chose the Selected Reserve Force to avoid the draft and combat duty by remaining stateside. By September 1966, 80 percent of the Selected Reserve Force was composed of Guardsmen, a fact that NGAUS president Major General James Cantwell spoke of proudly at the time. The Guard would develop a different perspective on this issue as the war in Vietnam stretched on-by 1970, the National Guard Association was claiming that draft-motivated volunteers had reached upward of 90 percent in some units.

In light of increased international tensions and the 1968 Tet Offensive, President Johnson consented to deploy a very small part of the Army reserve components, relative to their size, with the stipulation that deployment would last no longer than 24 months and be kept as small as possible, which became just 19,874 personnel of the more than 2.7 million Americans who served in Vietnam. As a result, while 76 Army Guard and Reserve units mobilized, 43 went to Vietnam and 33 remained in the United States as part of the strategic reserve. 42 Similar to mobilization during the Berlin Crisis of 1961, the reserves fell short on training and equipment; most did not meet readiness objectives when activated. Units that had been maintained with 100 percent manning and equipment authorizations were available within 48 to 72 hours, deployable with "minimal" time and effort; units that had been maintained at less than 100 percent required "considerable time"-weeks or months-to reach deployable status. 43 The call-up ended by December 1969, and all units were placed back on reserve status.
In assessing the effectiveness of the 1968 call-up, DoD issued a mixed verdict. The political climate in 1968 was considerably different from that during the Berlin Crisis, the last time reserve elements had been activated. Congress issued a joint resolution in favor of the 1961 call-up, an action that it did not repeat in 1968. "[T]he 1968 callup was affected by the United States involvement in the Vietnam conflict which was becoming unpopular with a large segment of the population," the Secretary for Reserve Affairs noted dryly in his 1969 annual report, adding that domestic civil disturbances had placed an additional burden on the Guard, constraining DoD planners. 44  In spite of the hostile political climate and the strain that riot control and civil defense put on the Guard (discussed in more detail in the following section), DoD considered the 1968 call-ups with hyperbolic assuredness as "the best our Nation has experienced," proving beyond a doubt that "there is a direct relationship between support provided reserve units and their readiness time for deployment subsequent to mobilization." 45   The Guard and Vietnam President Johnson's unwillingness to call up the National Guard for duty in Vietnam, apart from the very limited 1968 call-up, resulted in a severe body blow to both the Guard's reputation and its morale. We have already seen that, as early as 1966, the Guard was beginning to question why the President would opt for what was perceived as the "hard way"-increased conscription-over mobilization of somewhat-trained volunteers for duty in Southeast Asia. As the war progressed and General Westmoreland called for ever-increasing numbers of soldiers, the Guard's discomfort with its awkward position intensified. NGAUS president James Cantwell wrote an emotional piece in early 1967 listing a number of keenly felt insults to the National Guard's honor:
A national magazine devotes several pages to a feature which suggests that favored persons use the National Guard as a "safe haven" from the Draft.
A Nationally-known columnist inserts a gratuitous jab at the National Guard in an article on the Army's fine performance in Vietnam.
The U.S. Senate approves a proposal to draft men out of Guard units, thus challenging the concept of unit integrity. . . . One Senator, in a speech, even makes uncalled-for and inaccurate reference to Guard units "which neither train nor guard."

This political rationale was a fairly neat inversion of Truman's and Kennedy's logic during the Korea and Berlin emergencies. Each had independently arrived at the conclusion that activation of the Army National Guard and Army Reserve sent a convincing message that the United States was serious about its commitments to its allies. In the case of Vietnam, the President argued instead that not activating the reserve components, in this particular instance, sent the message that they remained available for duty elsewhere, deterring adversary action. This may have been the case, but, as always, negatives are hard to prove. At the very least, no other contingency arose during Vietnam which merited activation of the reserve components. In 1970, Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird reinforced this rationale when he issued a memorandum referred to in a speech by Major General Joe Moffitt of the Colorado Army National Guard:
He said very clearly that the Guard and other Reserve forces will be our first recourse in any future emergency. He directed the Services to base their planning . . . on that policy, and to provide the reserve components with the support and resources that will make them first-line forces in fact as well as in name. 48   This rationale may have served to placate the Guard, who did not volunteer for service in Vietnam, and the families of conscripted soldiers toward the beginning of serious U.S. engagement in Southeast Asia. However, as the 1960s wore on, as more draftees were called up and television reports of combat in Vietnam made their way into American living rooms, the idea of the reserve components serving a crucial role as a force-in-being was wearing thin. Some Guardsmen did volunteer for duty in Vietnam. Their paths are difficult to trace, as any Guard member who enters active service, by definition, is no longer a Guardsman and is therefore not identifiable as such in reports. However, some served with great distinction; Captain John Dieckmann, for example, volunteered out of the Ohio National Guard and posthumously received the Distinguished Service Cross following his death in action in 1966. 49 Many others followed similar paths; as of March 1968, at least 23 Guardsmen had been killed in action, and another was missing in action. 50  It was during the American engagement in Vietnam that Army National Guard returned to its civil disturbance role that was so unpopular in labor disputes in the previous century. During Vietnam, it was primarily riot control resulting from racial tensions and popular opposition to the Vietnam War. Significant civil disturbances in the late 1960s overwhelmed local police departments, even those in such major metropolitan areas as Newark and Detroit. More than 150 cities experienced some degree of lawlessness during the first nine months of 1967. 51 In response, state governors called out Army and Air National Guard units, and in some cases Regular Army units were sent in by the President to restore order. This was not a new role for federal forces, as the Regular Army had answered similar calls from the executive during times of strife over civil rights in the Eisenhower and Kennedy presidencies. 52 When calling out reserve forces, however, this duty was particular to the Guard, of course, as the purely federal Army Reserve had no legal authority to perform local law-enforcement duties among U.S. civilians at the behest of state governors. The Guard's dual status-the very status that it had spent the past 60 years working so diligently to preserve-made it ripe for this role, and it was under the militia clause of the Constitution that state governors exercised their authority to press Army Guardsmen into riot control duty or to deny civil rights to minority Americans.
The events for which Army National Guard units were called out across the country had widely disparate origins. Some, such as the 1967 Newark riots, resulted from racial tension. Others, such as the 1968 Akron disturbances, were union demonstrations that turned violent. Still others, such as the infamous encounter at Kent State University (discussed in detail below), grew out of antiwar protests. Guard units responded as best as they were able to these events, but little to any of their training had focused on law enforcement practices. The previous decades had seen National Guard units respond to natural disasters within the United States, but as was usual for the Guard, military training and education had made up the bulk of their time. Riots in Detroit, Watts, and Newark in 1967 made clear that this would need to change. "In the gunfire and flames of Detroit and Newark, mistakes inevitably were made," conceded Major General Cantwell. 53 Army National Guard units took part in riot control and civil disturbance training during August and September 1967, and took delivery of "special civil disturbance equipment" that had not previously been authorized for Guard use: Gas agent dispersers, grenade launchers, and sniper rifles were some of the items distributed. 54 Some believed that charging the Guard with the responsibility to maintain law and order posed a greater challenge than counterinsurgency in Southeast Asia. A retired Guard colonel argued in early 1968 that "We are fighting a similar war in Viet Nam today, but the swamps, jungles, and mountains out there are simple compared with what urban guerrilla warfare could offer in the Continental USA." The manufactured environment, he posited, is "more formidable than nature's, if determined rioters and guerrillas choose to use it properly." 55 The real challenge, however, was restraint. The Army National Guard understood the necessity of using nonlethal force in the face of violence and disorder. Just as the environment posed a great challenge, so did the psychological strain. The Guard colonel offered that "Guardsmen have shown time and again that they can adjust mentally to distasteful riot duty." Given the "kind of organized conflict which they now face," though, required "even more careful, thorough psychological conditioning."

On May 4, 1970
The governor obliged immediately, calling in the 107th Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 145th Infantry Battalion and declaring martial law. Later that month, Newsweek reported: . . . Rhodes all but took personal command of the guardsmen. Without consulting top guard officials or the university administration, he reportedly ordered that all campus assemblies-peaceful or otherwise-be broken up and said that the troops would remain on campus 12 months a year if necessary. 
57
About 25 minutes after noon, out of tear gas and still confronted by angry unarmed protestors, the Ohio Army National Guardsmen began firing into the crowd. Some later said that they were responding to sniper fire, although a subsequent FBI investigation found no such evidence.
58
Although a Gallup poll would later reveal that 58 percent of Americans placed the blame for the shootings on the students-only 11 percent blamed the Guardsmenthe event was nevertheless a catastrophe for the Guard's reputation. Two years later, the President's Commission on Campus Unrest could not confirm that the Guardsmen sent to Kent State had been briefed on civil disorder procedures, as per Ohio Guard procedure, 59 and questioned the decisions of Guard leadership on that day: . . . [T]he Guard's decision to march through the crowd for hundreds of yards up and down a hill was highly questionable. . . . Guardsmen had been subjected to harassment and assault, were hot and tired, and felt dangerously vulnerable . . . . When they confronted the students, it was only too easy for a single shot to trigger a general fusillade. 60   The commission further found that, while the actions of some of the protesting students were "violent and criminal," the "indiscriminate firing of rifles into a crowd of students and the deaths that followed were unnecessary, unwarranted, and inexcusable." 61 The commission further faulted the National Guard for failing to adhere to law enforcement guidelines regarding the issuance of loaded weapons to those charged with this type of disturbance control, and noted that the Guardsmen had met perceived danger to themselves with completely disproportionate and lethal force. All of these findings would reflect poorly on the Army National Guard for years to come, and remain in the memory of many Americans.
Richard Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign included a promise to reform substantially, if not end, the draft; keeping his word, shortly after his inauguration he commissioned a series of studies to determine which goal he should pursue and how he should go about pursuing it. Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird issued a statement in September 1969 announcing the President's intention to move forward on certain elements of draft reform, most notably reducing the period of prime eligibility from seven years (ages 19 to 26) to one (ages 19 to 20). H. R. 14001 did just that, and Nixon signed it into law in November 1969. 62  Nixon also formed the Gates Commission, headed by former Secretary of Defense Thomas Gates, to examine the question of whether an all-volunteer force was desirable or practical. The commission's first meeting took place in

Mobilizing existing National Guard and Reserve forces and cross-leveling their personnel and equipment to create fully manned and equipped units would have been the easiest approach for the Army during Vietnam. Most members of the Ready Reserve had at least some training, although many were still nondeployable until they completed their Initial Entry Training, and would have been easier to fully train than draftees. This would have reduced the intense pressure on training facilities which struggled to train hundreds of thousands of conscripts. Additionally, as most of the reserve structure was combat support, failure to mobilize them required the Regular Army to create a duplicate support force structure to compensate for their absence. And, indeed, following the American withdrawal from Vietnam, part of this additional support force structure was placed into the reserves.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the Army National Guard and the Army Reserve faced a significant amount of institutional embarrassment because of the President's political unwillingness to mobilize the reserve components, although the President did not inhibit volunteers from the Ready Reserve from stepping forward. A view had evolved that the Guard, and to a lesser extent the Army Reserve, "became havens for those seeking to avoid active military service in that war."

As noted at the beginning of this volume, the U.S. Army as it existed in Vietnam was, in many ways, a very different institution than what had existed during World War II. Both relied heavily on the draft and volunteers, but with significant differences. Con- 70 Major General James. F. Cantwell, "Manpower Problems Mount," The National Guardsman, Vol. 24, No. 4,  April 1970, inside cover.  scripts in World War II, for better or for worse, were bound to serve for the duration plus six months, although in many cases they were demobilized well before the war had been over for six months. Vietnam-era conscripts, on the other hand, served limited tours, a concept first devised during U.S. involvement in Korea. Limited tours had the result of not only increasing the need for more draftees to replace those lost when their rotation ended, they also greatly diminished the aggregate experience level resident in junior U.S. combat troops. Army NCO casualties significantly reduced the quality of the NCO corps over the course of the war. As a result of mobilization policies and the loss of so many seasoned Army NCOs, the combat experience of the Vietnam War was largely retained in the Regular Army's officer corps.
It is difficult to overstate the impact of President Johnson's decision on both the Army and the American public. An Army that had developed the personnel and infrastructure to absorb a certain number of conscripts each year under the Selective Service Act of 1948 was suddenly required to absorb many times that number, creating not only the aforementioned training problems but also discipline problems once the conscripts arrived in theater and did not have sufficiently experienced NCOs and officers to guide them, especially in the later years of the war. Mobilization of the reserve components may have temporarily alleviated this problem and many others, although likely creating other problems both at home and overseas. And while Johnson may have avoided a national debate on Vietnam in the early years of U.S. commitment in Southeast Asia, as he wanted to keep the nation's attention on his domestic agenda, the ever-expanding draft meant that the debate was only deferred indefinitely. When it did emerge, both the President and Secretary of Defense McNamara were shaken by the vehemence, and sometimes rage, expressed by those opposed to continued involvement in Vietnam and those who did not wish to go in the first place-not all of which were readily dismissible, even to senior policymakers, as 1960s counterculture foolishness. As Secretary McNamara reported to Congress in 1968, 590,000 officers and enlisted men volunteered for military service in Fiscal Year 1967, while fewer than 300,000 were required to be drafted. He expected these general trends to continue in 1968, which meant that the military was largely being manned by volunteers, not draftees, when opposition to the draft was reaching its peak.
Counterfactuals are not generally a productive use of the historian's time. However, it is difficult to see how Johnson's heavy use-some would say abuse-of the draft could have led to anything but its diminishment and eventual dismantlement. This process will be covered in detail in the following volume, but it is sobering to realize that an American tradition which had for decades been accepted as a means of expanding the military in time of war could, in five short years, be so ill-used as to render it undesirable-so much so that recommendations should be issued for its abolition.
It would take the Army about a decade to recover from Vietnam, most notably the rebuilding of its NCO corps. Senior officers of the mid-to-late 1970s would repeat over and over their unwillingness to go to war in the future without the reserves-although, as we shall see, not necessarily for reasons of ensuring broad public support for American military intervention.
At the end of World War II, the United States faced a fundamentally new strategic context and a more expansive view about its role in the world. Although these changes led to important debates about U.S. military policy, ultimately, there were no significant changes to the fundamental laws governing U.S. military policy. Instead, policymakers made refinements and adjustments to U.S. military policy primarily through resource allocation, force structure, and executive action. It is, in retrospect, rather remarkable that the prewar legal structure had so fundamentally settled questions that had bedeviled Army planners since the American Revolution.
The Korean War revealed that the United States needed to be able to quickly deploy large and capable formations. The mechanisms in place to generate new forces or to train and prepare existing Army National Guard and Army Reserve units were too slow responding to this type of crisis, especially if they were to be undermanned and underequipped in peacetime. After the shock of the Korean War, the Army's plans for expansion changed from the mobilization of the mass citizen base along the lines of World Wars I and II to a new one that relied primarily on the Army's two reserve components, supported by a draft. However, these plans were not ultimately followed. Instead, as with the Korean War and the Berlin Crisis, the sitting President decided not to mobilize the reserve components en masse. President Lyndon B. Johnson stayed his hand to avoid congressional and public debate about U.S. involvement in Vietnam, and to keep the American public focused on his domestic agenda. As a result, the Regular Army, augmented heavily by conscripts, carried the Army's load in Vietnam.
As Volume IV will discuss in greater detail, the consequences these mobilization decisions are difficult to overstate, and continued to influence the psychology and decisionmaking of Army components for decades. As the Vietnam War came to an end, so too did the tradition of universal male conscription. The degree to which conscription was used to form the bulk of the fighting force initiated a nationwide conversation on the justness and utility of a draft in the modern era. In 1970, the Gates Commission, a group convened to examine the possibility of transitioning to an all-volunteer military, found that not only would it be possible to do so, but also that the Armed Forces would likely be of a higher quality than one that relied on conscription. The commission's report did not end the debate. Many, both in the Army and out of it, still believed the draft to be crucially important to defense planning. However, the group's recommendations substantially advanced the idea throughout the nation that an all-volunteer force was well within the realm of possibility.
Established in federal law by the 1916 National Defense Act, the ERC comprised prior enlisted men from the Regular Army and new enlistees who would receive specialty skills training in the Regular Army. It was similar to the Officers' Reserve Corps in that it was intended to provide a manpower replacement pool of enlisted soldiers with special skills for Engineers, Signal, Quartermaster, and Medical Corps to expand the Regular Army when needed. But, like the Officers' Reserve Corps, the law allowed the President to assign ERC members as reservists to the Regular Army or to form new reserve organizations. Only a handful of men came into the ERC.
First-line defenses and second-line defenses: First-line defenses refers to U.S. ground and naval forces that will first meet an enemy of the United States in combat. Secondline defenses refers to follow-on forces that will take much longer to mobilize and prepare for battle. For example, in the 19th century, the first line of ground defenses against an invasion from a foreign power was the small Regular Army scattered throughout the country alongside the state militias. The second line in this context would have been a larger volunteer army that would be mobilized by the several states and provided for federal service. In the 20th century, which ground forces were in the first and second lines of defense became the subject of debate among the War Department, Regular Army, and National Guard proponents. Guardsmen saw their organized state militia units as being a part of the first-line defense with the Regular Army. In their view, the Regular Army would respond first but would be quickly joined by ready National Guard units. In this view, the second line would have been the larger volunteer or conscript army. Many Regular Army officers contested this view, arguing that the first-line defenses ought to comprise only the Regular Army and a federal reserve force. The second line of defense, in their view, would have been the larger militia and volunteer army that would take time to mobilize and train. In this view, the state National Guards would be dedicated to state missions, and not typically part of the larger war army, which many Regular Army officers believed must be under the command of one commander-in-chief, namely the President, and not subordinate to state governors, as were the state National Guards. National Guard: The National Guard evolved out of the volunteer uniformed militias that developed prior to the Civil War. After the Civil War, starting in the 1870s, volunteer uniformed militia units increasingly called themselves National Guard or National Guards. Until the early 20th century, these National Guard units were state entities unto themselves with little or no federal oversight or authority. With the Dick Act in 1903 came federal recognition of the National Guard units as the "organized militia" of the several states. Over the course of the 20th century, the level of federal funding for the National Guard increased to the point that, today, virtually all of the funding for the National Guard comes from the federal government. See also Army National Guard and Army National Guard of the United States.
Officers' Reserve Corps: Established in federal law by the 1916 National Defense Act to facilitate the rapid expansion of the Army, the Officers' Reserve Corps was to consist of men who had volunteered to be in it, had received the appropriate level of training as further stipulated by the 1916 act, and would be liable to be ordered by the President to federal service to fill out and expand the ranks of the Regular Army. The Officers' Reserve Corps was premised on the armies clause. Its historical use was generally during the period between 1916 and 1941.
Organized militia and unorganized militia: The first use of the term organized militia in federal law was in the 1903 Dick Act, which recognized the National Guards of the several states as the "organized militia" and premised on the militia clauses. This statutory term should not be confused with various militia units in 18th and 19th century America that were organized, either under compulsory service or volunteerism.
The term unorganized militia was first stipulated in federal law in the 1903 Dick Act to refer to men between ages 18 and 45 who were not members of the state National Guards or "organized militia." Defense Act for organizational purposes, because when World War I ended in 1918, the Department of War intended to maintain in peacetime an organized Army reserve, under the armies clause, that had actual "in being" corps, divisions, regiments, etc. A big difference from the National Guard was that the Organized Reserve units were of skeletal strength, consisting only of officers. Importantly, the 1920 amendment designated nine corps regional areas in the United States responsible for training and recruiting for the Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve divisions in it. The 1920 amendment stipulated that each corps area would have one Regular Army division, two National Guard divisions, and three Organized Reserve divisions. This force structure would become the nucleus for a greater Army expansion in World War II.
In continuous existence since 1788 as stipulated in federal law, the Regular Army is the full-time, standing component of the Army. The term active duty is often used as being synonymous with the Regular Army, but it is not. The confusion comes from the premise of the Regular Army being a full-time "active" force. Reserve components: As codified in 1994 in 10 USC 10101, reserve components is the collective term for the seven individual reserve components of the U.S. military: Army National Guard of the United States, Army Reserve, Marine Corps Force Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air National Guard of the United States, Air Force Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve. Under 10 USC 10102, the purpose of the reserve components is to "provide trained units and qualified persons available for active duty in the armed forces, in time of war or national emergency, and at such other times as the national security may require, to fill the needs of the armed forces whenever more units and persons are needed than are in the regular components."
The ROTC was established in statutory law by the 1916 National Defense Act. The law authorized the President, under the armies clause, to establish ROTC detachments at U.S. colleges granting four-year degrees. The law also mandated ROTC detachments at U.S. colleges and universities that were established by the 1862 U.S. land grant (Morrell Act), which provided federal land to newly formed states to build colleges and universities. A provision of the Morrell Act directed that military tactics and sciences be taught at these land grant institutions. Hence the connection between the 1916 National Defense Act establishing the ROTC and the 1862 Morrell Act.
A term created by an important Army reformer of the first half of the 20th century, John McAuley Palmer. Palmer first used the term in a report he wrote for the Secretary of War Henry Stimson in 1912. In Palmer's view, the "traditional military policy" of the United States was to have a small Regular Army in peacetime that would be expanded by mobilizing the mass of the citizenry into a war army that was also led by "citizen soldiers." Palmer also began, in the years prior to World War I, to add an additional tenet of this "traditional military policy," which was to have this citizen army in place in peacetime so that it could be equipped and trained. In 1940, Congress applied the term traditional military policy in statutory law to the National Guard, by stating "in accordance with the traditional military policy of the United States, it is essential that the strength and organization of the National Guard as an integral part of the first line defenses of the United States be maintained and assured at all times . . ."
The term Army refers to the totality of the U.S. Army at any given time in U.S. history-that is, the Regular Army and whatever type of force has been added to expand it. It is incorrect to assume that the term Army is synonymous with Regular Army; Army refers to the Regular Army and the actual or potential means to expand it. For example, one could use the term Army during the War of 1812 to mean the Regular Army, compulsory militia units provided by the several states to expand the overall size of the Army, and volunteer militia units from the several states. Or, by way of another example, the term Army in 1944 meant units of the Regular Army, Organized Reserves, the National Guards of the states and territories, and the Army of the United States. As a more recent example, the term Army, as stipulated in Title 10 of the U.S. Code, means the Regular Army, the Army National Guard of the United States, the Army National Guard while in the service of the United States, and the Army Reserve (i.e., the U.S. Army Reserve). The Army recognizes its birthday as occurring in 1775, when the Continental Congress established the American "Continental" Army.
The 1952 Armed Forces Reserve Act, a major piece of legislation reforming all of the military services' reserve components, largely based on the experience of the partial mobilization during the Korean War, replaced older terms for the Army, such as Organized Reserves and Organized Reserve Corps with the new term Army Reserve. It is important to note that this legal title should be used in singular form and not in the plural-Army Reserves-since in its singular form, as stipulated in law, it refers to the individual members and units of the Army Reserve. At the Department of Defense (DoD) level, it is typical to refer to the reserves (plural and lowercase) when referring collectively to the Army Reserve, Navy Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Forces Reserve, and Coast Guard Reserve-but, importantly, not the Army National Guard. When referring to the Army Reserve as a reserve component of the Army, the term reserve component should be used; the Army reserve components are the U.S. Army Reserve and the Army National Guard of the United States.

Despite its size, however, in the early Cold War era the Regular Army was not the efficient and capable organization it had been at the end of World War II. In peacetime, it lacked trained specialists, and its Regular units remained understrength and filled with under-trained recruits(Stewart, 2010, p. 205).
The intense demand for combat munitions caused American sales to skyrocket. Between 1935 and 1939, U.S. production totaled only $300 million. In 1940, the figure swelled to $1.5 billion, and in the following year production tripled to $4.5 billion. Even in peacetime the United States kept pace with the German war machine, which managed $6 billion in combat munitions production in 1941. No nation could match the potential or the capabilities of the American arsenal of democracy, however. The first full year at war saw American munitions sales grow to $20 billion in 1942, soaring to a staggering $42 billion in 1944 (Mark Harrison, "Resource Mobilization for World War II: The U.S.A., U.K., U.S.S.R., and Germany, 1938

A New York Republican and son-in-law of U.S. diplomat John Hay, Wadsworth had served as a private in a volunteer unit in Puerto Rico during the Spanish-American War. When Elihu Root decided not to run for reelection, Wadsworth won the empty seat and remained in the Senate until 1927. He spent his entire legislative career principally concerned with national security issues, including his time in the House of Representatives from 1933 to 1951. A Republican senator from South Dakota, Chan Gurney was deployed overseas as a sergeant in the Army during World War I and acted as the first chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services from 1947 to 1949.

The committee's existence was the doing of James Wadsworth. General Marshall had hoped that the first item on the agenda would be UMT. After hearing that the reorganization of the War and Navy Departments took precedence, he found it "unfortunate, but to be accepted as unavoidable." Marshall was concerned that inter-departmental relations might suffer once discussions about reorganization began, creating controversy that would affect the war effort at a time when "harmony between the Army and Navy is of paramount importance." Sending Palmer to present the historical background on military policy, as well as others discussing similar issues, would hopefully "keep the affair on a high level" and "result in burning off most of the long grass in the way

NGAUS remained on alert for a long time for any hint of inclination that the War Department or Congress intended to strip it of its dual status. A 1949 article in the National Guardsman magazine warned darkly that "the old sword of Federalization continued to hang over the National Guard" ("The Battle ofWashington," The  National Guardsman, Vol. 3, No. 4, April 1949, p. 14).

In an August 1955 statement, President Eisenhower expressed reservations with the way the Reserve Forces Act of 1955 addressed training: "I am, however, concerned by the failure of the bill to afford the same guarantees of prior training for the National Guard as it has done for the Reserves" (Dwight D. Eisenhower, "Statement by the President Upon Signing the Reserve Forces Act of 1955," Washington, D.C.,

Indeed, in 2007, when Congress changed the law such that the President would be able to take control of a state's Guard without the governor's consent, all 50 governors signed a letter to Congress opposing the change.

It could be argued that the Army had actually engaged in "fight tonight" conflicts during the previous century-the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, and many engagements of the Plains Wars all began far more abruptly than did the world wars. However, the Army experienced significant difficulties at the outset of those wars, and expectations for 19th century conflicts were no longer in line with conditions that existed during the mid 20th century.

The article did caution that "More sweeping and controversial than any since the Gray Board proposals to Federalize the entire Guard in 1948, (the plan) needed selling to Congress, though Mr. McNamara emphasized a savings of $150,000,000 a year in addition to producing increased combat-readiness" ("One Reserve Force: The Army National Guard," The NationalGuardsman, Vol. 19, No. 1, January 1965, p. 16).

Or he may not have pressed it. Walsh was a canny assessor of public appetite for this sort of debate, and he may have stood down in the interests of avoiding an argument that could have ended badly for the Guard, and would have been very unpopular with the many Guardsmen who had explicitly joined the Guard to avoid the draft for Vietnam.
Although, when talking among itself, Guard leadership expressed its dissatisfaction with the compression candidly, if sometimes confusingly. "DoD is obdurate in its intention of reorganizing the Reserve Components along lines that blend with its strategic plans," Major General Cantwell wrote in 1967, turning a fairly self-evident statement of fact into a rather peevish complaint (Major General James F. Cantwell, "Defense Drops the Other Shoe," The NationalGuardsman, Vol. 21, No. 6, June 1967, inside cover).

As quoted inMcMaster, 2007, p. 316. Along with not calling up the reserve components, the White House limited funding for deployments to the $1 billion already included in the defense appropriations for 1966 rather than the $12.7 billion the JCS estimated the escalation would cost.

  13  An ugly racial tone overlay the objections of Senator Richard Russell, from South Carolina, who did not wish large numbers of African-American would-be soldiers trained and educated at Army expense. He changed his mind in 1965, telling the President to lower induction standards and keep the "damn dumb bunnies" from avoiding the draft(Drea, 2011, p.  
266).14  This was the exact rationale under which the Women's Army Corps had been established in 1941: to place women in all possible noncombat positions in order to "Free a Man to Fight," as one of their early recruiting slogans put it. The WAC soon retired this slogan, as it engendered ill will among male soldiers in noncombat jobs who did not necessarily wish to be freed to fight.

The subcommittee accepted Vance's recommendation that these volunteers be ordered to begin training within 120 days of their enlistment, but refused to suspend enlistments when training space was unavailable, reasoning that McNamara himself had informed the Senate Appropriations Committee that training capacity for fiscal year 1967 would be vastly expanded.

Active component: This term is often used as a substitute for the Regular component of any of the military Services, and is often confused with active duty.
The term active duty means full-time duty in the active military service of the United States. The term includes full-time training duty, annual training duty, and attendance, while in the active military service, at a school designated as a service school by law or by the Secretary of the military department concerned. The term does not include full-time National Guard duty (10 USC 101(d)(
