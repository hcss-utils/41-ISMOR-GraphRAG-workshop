For more than 25 years, our military has been focused on conventional warfighting and counterinsurgency operations.
Furthermore, nearly 95 percent of today's military personnel entered service after September 11, 2001.
Consequently, they did not spend years studying how to fight a near-peer adversary and assessing how to prevent a nuclear exchange or massive chemical attack as a possible outcome of the conventional operations they were planning or executing.
During that same time, Russia, China and other potential adversaries have modernized their strategic forces, expanded their CBRN capabilities, honed their tactics, and pursued asymmetric means to counter our conventional dominance.
They are openly challenging the international order through aggression, coercion, subversion, and deception.
Concurrently, regional and global actors seem to have established an acceptance for limited use of chemical weapons and openly threatening nuclear use against the United States.
