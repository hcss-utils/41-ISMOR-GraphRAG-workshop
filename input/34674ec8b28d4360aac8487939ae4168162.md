Previously, the Russian military divided responsibility amongst ten Military Districts that Russia consolidated into five OSKs.
The Western and Southern Joint Strategic Commands are significant as they encompass the near abroad of Eastern Europe and the Caucasus Region of Eurasia.
These two areas were host to the two most recent conventional conflicts in which Russia engaged with ground forces-Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine beginning in 2014.
These OSKs are akin to the fronts as organized in the Great Patriotic War but are now joint service entities.
The composition of the Western OSK-oriented on Russia's European frontier-includes three armies of ground forces, two air defense and aerospace armies, the Baltic Fleet and 11th Army Corps.
