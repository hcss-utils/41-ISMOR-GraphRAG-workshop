Through NGW, Russia has brought war back to Europe in a hidden, undeclared, and ambiguous form.
Also, despite Russia's use of military operations and the breaking of treaty agreements, neither the U.S. nor its European allies have responded militarily.
Thus, the information war was successful at all levels.
The Ukrainian defense was confused and isolated.
Russia's denial program in the West was also successful in moving war into the cognitive dimension.
