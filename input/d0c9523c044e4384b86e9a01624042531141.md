The United States used a mixture of diplomatic ventures, propaganda, armed proxies, foreign aid, and sanctions as it waged the Cold War, just as Russia and Iran use many of these same combinationsalbeit with somewhat different flavors-in Ukraine and Syria, respectively, today.
ISIL, too, combines propaganda and economic subversion (although more defensively to acquire weapons and resources than as a form of leverage against others abroad), along with terrorist activities in its quest to expand its influence.
