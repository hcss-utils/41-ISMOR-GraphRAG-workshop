Upon completion of the domestic phase of its reforms, Japan immediately began the foreign policy phase to create an empire.
Japan colonized its neighbors to stabilize failing states in the belief that only with stability and economic integration could they all prosper.
Japan and Russia simultaneously became interested in the same territory.
In the third quarter of the nineteenth century, Russia conquered the khanates of Central Asia and in 1891 began construction of a Trans-Siberian Railway that promised to overturn the balance of power in Manchuria, when Russia alone would be able rapidly to deploy troops.
Like the Qing dynasty, Korea's Yi dynasty became ever more dysfunctional with each passing nineteenth-century monarch.
Similarly, Korea faced the largest peasant rebellion in its history.
Before Russia could use the railway to dash Japan's plans for empire by dominating northeast Asia, Japan fought two wars of Russian containment: the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and Russo-Japanese War (1904-05).
It won both and gained not only Korea, but also Taiwan, the Pescadores, and southern Manchuria.
Initially, the West extolled Japan's transformation into a great power and its constructive participation in the maritime global order.
