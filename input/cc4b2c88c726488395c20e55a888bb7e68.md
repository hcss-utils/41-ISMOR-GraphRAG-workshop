Ukraine crisis provided Russia with a golden opportunity to insert itself into the fray.
The annexation of Crimea, along with provoking ethnic grievances in Eastern Ukraine, served to promote Russia's grand strategic goals: to return to prominence on the geopolitical stage and to diminish the West's political and ideological influence within Russia's traditional spheres of influence.
However, to achieve its strategic goals, Russia believes it must turn to nonlinear warfare to avoid the conventional military strength of the United States and NATO.
To accomplish this, Russia chooses to remain "formless" and hide its true intentions from the West, using subversive measures to realize its geopolitical objectives.
