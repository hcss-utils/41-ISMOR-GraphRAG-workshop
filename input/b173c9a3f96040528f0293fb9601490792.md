Furthermore, it is important to note that although many in the West date the "Russian threat" and Russian aggression to 2014 and the war in Ukraine, many of the Russian leadership's concerns have roots that date back a decade or more, and are the consequence of Western adventures in Kosovo, Afghanistan, Iraq, Libya, and Syria.
This also throws important light on what has become known in the West as a "new Russian way of war"-often misleadingly called "hybrid war"-as deployed in Ukraine.
As seen from Moscow, this is, in effect, the result of what they have learned about the changing nature of war as deployed by the United States and NATO.
The difference in views is made stark: first, by the suggestions of the Russian leadership that the West itself is mobilizing; and second, by the idea that while the West anticipates expansive Russian aggression, the opposite is the case in Moscow, which appears to be preparing for a war that the Russian leadership thinks will be foisted upon it.
