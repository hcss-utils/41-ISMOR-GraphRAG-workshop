Although the number of casualties during the operation could not make Russians rethink their operational concept in Grozny, they nevertheless made them rethink some tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).
Russia was traditionally less averse to casualties compared to other nations and, therefore, casualties should not have influenced the operational concept as much.
Nevertheless, in the case of Chechnya, the relationship between the belligerents was asymmetric because Chechens fought a total war for survival while Russia fought a limited war for limited aims.
This asymmetry, in theory, brings constraints in terms of military resources for the side fighting a limited war.
