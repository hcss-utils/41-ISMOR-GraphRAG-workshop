Though the exact size of Russia's Armed Forces is notoriously opaque, the number of personnel in Russia's military was well over 2 million after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.
This figure shrank to 1.2 million in 1999 but largely appears to have stayed in the range of 1.1-1.3 million in subsequent years.
