After what is now known as "9-11," the resulting conflicts in Afghanistan and then in Iraq featured rapid-paced military operations, but in both cases they transitioned to extended and unforeseen stability and counterinsurgency operations against non-state armed groups.
The U.S. also pursued a largely kinetic approach towards Al Qaeda and affiliated groups in other locations around the world.
The U.S. adapted its approaches and developed new capabilities to better target these non-state armed groups in the two decades since 9-11.
However, in that time, while the U.S. pursued largely irregular warfare, peer competitors such as China and Russia worked to erase technological advantages held by the U.S. military.
