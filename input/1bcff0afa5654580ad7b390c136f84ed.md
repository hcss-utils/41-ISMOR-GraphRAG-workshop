The Iron Hand of War When General P
From Georgia to FM 3-24   On November 15, 1864, one of the most celebrated and controversial campaigns of the American Civil War began when sixty thousand Federal troops under the command of General William Tecumseh Sherman marched out of the burning city of Atlanta into central Georgia. Disregarding conventional military wisdom that an advancing army should not break contact with its line of communications and supply, Sherman had ordered his troops to evacuate the city they had only recently captured and sever the Western & Atlantic Railroad link that connected them to the Union's nearest supply depot at Chattanooga, Tennessee. Apart from the reduced provisions his soldiers carried with them, Sherman's army was now dependent for its survival on what they could take from the local population in the hostile Confederate heartlands of the Deep South.
Sherman's destination, though few of his soldiers realized it at the time, was the city of Savannah, three hundred miles away on the Atlantic coast, where he hoped to be resupplied by the Union Navy and then proceed northward into Virginia to assist his great friend Ulysses Grant, whose armies were locked in a brutal deadlock with Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia at the Confederate capital, Richmond. But Sherman also had very specific strategic intentions regarding Georgia itself. For more than a month, Sherman's army marched through the state known as the granary of the South, seizing or destroying vast quantities of food and provisions, demolishing and burning public and private property, and leaving a trail of devastation fifty to sixty miles wide. On December 21, Sherman's army captured Savannah in a triumphant conclusion to the "March to the Sea." In February the following year, Sherman led his army northward into South Carolina.
Here the destruction was more extensive and more explicitly punitive, as his soldiers burned and looted their way through the state that they regarded as the spiritual home of secession before moving on to North Carolina, where the march finally came to a halt in Goldsboro on March 23, 1865. On April 16, the Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston surrendered ninety thousand troops to Sherman at the Bennett Farm near the state capital, Raleigh, thus removing the last major Confederate army from the Civil War. By that time Sherman's seven-hundred-mile rampage had already begun its transformation into a military legend. In the North, it was acclaimed as a strategic masterstroke that transformed Sherman into a national hero. In the South, Sherman was vilified as a brutal military destroyer, a nineteenth-century Genghis Khan who violated the principles of "civilized warfare" and chose to make war on civilians and noncombatants. This image of Sherman as the Great Destroyer has been handed down to posterity and reinforced in films, such as The Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind, as part of the "Lost Cause" mythologies of Southern victimhood, which present Sherman as the iconic symbol of Yankee barbarity. Today Sherman's army is still remembered throughout the South as the instrument of vengeful destruction described in the narrative voice-over spoken by Waylon Jennings in the Paul Kennerley song "They Laid Waste to Our Land": "With hate in their hearts, they moved in a line, cutting a scar through God's blessed country fifty miles wide / Burning, looting and gutting our land like vultures." Sherman's sinister reputation is not confined to the Civil War. More than any military campaign in history, Sherman's March has become a byword for wartime devastation and cruelty. "In the twentieth century the name of Sherman has taken on an incantatory quality; speak it, and all the demons of destruction appear," writes the cultural historian Charles Royster.

In his study The American Way of War, Russell Weigley described the Civil War as a transformative moment in U.S. military history, in which Sherman's "strategy of terror" in Georgia and the Carolinas complemented Grant's "strategy of annihilation" in Virginia.

The elevated moral aura that so often surrounds American war making is not merely the result of propaganda or deliberate obfuscation, though it may fulfill both purposes. But physical destruction in American warfare is often seen as a necessary precursor to a more positive Americanized future-a tendency famously summed up by the response of a U.S. officer to a question about the bombardment of the village of Bến Tre during the Vietnam War: "It became necessary to destroy the village in order to save it." During the American occupation of the Philippines, U.S. soldiers were building roads, schools, and medical clinics in one part of the archipelago while simultaneously razing "insurgent" villages in another. Even as U.S. bombers were incinerating Japanese cities and killing tens of thousands of civilians during World War II, the U.S. armed forces were preparing one of the most progressive military occupations in history. More recently in Iraq, the United States launched a war that was supposedly intended to transform a dictatorship into an exemplary American-style democracy, in which the U.S. military was killing, arresting, and in some cases torturing real or imagined Iraqi insurgents by night, while teams of soldiers instructed Iraqis on local democracy and the formation of neighborhood associations during the day.
In recent years, the belief that American military power is a force for good and that what is good for America is good for everyone else has been called into question by a succession of wars that have generated a great deal of destruction without producing the positive outcomes that were predicted when they began. In two invasions and occupations, in Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. military power has failed to achieve decisive victories against militarily weaker opponents, and these less than satisfactory results have prompted an ongoing debate within and beyond the U.S. military establishment about the way in which America fights its wars. On one hand, there are the "population-centric" counterinsurgency (COIN) doctrines propagated by General David Petraeus and the Marine Corps counterinsurgency manual FM 3-24, which challenge the military to concentrate less on the physical destruction of the enemy and more on protection of civilians, reconstruction, and "military operations other than war." Others have argued that an excessive concern with minimizing bloodshed and avoiding civilian casualties has weakened the ability of the U.S. military to carry out its core task of "killing people and breaking things" in order to achieve a decisive military victory. These debates would not have been entirely unfamiliar in what Sherman called "the great problem of the Civil War. " The ideas and practices that he developed in an attempt to solve that problem touch on many issues that have remained pertinent to American wars. The strategic use of physical destruction to change the attitudes and behavior of civilians and noncombatants, the conduct of military occupations, the blurred distinctions between combatants and noncombatants in irregular warfare, collective punishment as an instrument of counterinsurgency, postwar stabilization, the political and psychological dimensions of modern warfare-all these components of the American wars of this new century were also present in the war that Sherman once fought.
To what extent were Sherman's campaigns a "modern" form of warfare or an anachronistic regression? Whom did he attack and why? Is it true, as Russell Weigley and so many others have argued, that Sherman's strategy of terror in the South paved the way for the bombing of Dresden and Hiroshima, the free-fire zones of Vietnam, or the My Lai massacre? If so, how? What exactly did that strategy consist of and to what extent have America's subsequent wars followed the template that Sherman created? His campaigns have already generated a voluminous literature, and I do not claim to have uncovered any new historical material about them. I am not a Civil War historian, and this is not a conventional military history, partly because Sherman's campaigns were not a conventional military campaign, and also because my primary concern is not with military operations, strategies, and battles but with the broader impact of war-and American war in particular-on civilians. For many years now, I have written about the U.S. military and American wars, most often from a critical perspective.
If this book might be categorized as an antimilitarist military history, it is also to some extent a companion or counterpoint to my earlier history of terrorism, The Infernal Machine. The U.S. Department of Defense defines terrorism as "the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear; intended to coerce or to intimidate governments or societies in the pursuit of goals that are generally political, religious, or ideological." There is much of this definition that could be applied to what Sherman tried to do in Georgia and the Carolinas. This does not mean that I wish to indict Sherman as a terrorist-a futile and essentially meaningless exercise. But Sherman embodies a very specific use of military force as an instrument of coercion and intimidation that has often been replayed by the U.S. military and also by other armies. Understanding what he did and what his armies did and didn't do can therefore tell us a great deal, not only about the Civil War and American war making, but also about the evolution of modern war into attacks of unprecedented violence against civilians. I would like to hope that the following study can contribute to widening this understanding, not only by those who fight wars, but also by those who would like to stop them from being fought.
to the Western theater. In March 1864, Grant was promoted to lieutenant general and Union general in chief. By that time, the tide of war appeared to be moving irresistibly in the North's favor. The South was now cut in half; Union armies had seized key enclaves on the Atlantic coast; and Union armies were advancing ever deeper into the Mississippi Valley and Tennessee. Yet despite these reversals, the Confederacy was far from defeated, and the inability of the two sides to achieve a decisive victory on the battlefield had begun to change the strategic direction of the war.
The Civil War was an internal conflict between two groups of Americans, and it was also a relatively new kind of war whose implications were only just becoming apparent in the nineteenth century. "It was a war between the States, or better still, a war between two nations," wrote the Georgia scientist and prominent proslavery theorist Joseph LeConte. "For each side it was really a foreign war … let it be distinctly understood, that there never was a war in which were more thoroughly enlisted the hearts of the whole peoplemen, women, and children-than were those of the South in this. To us it was literally a life and death struggle for national existence."

The Civil War also exposed Americans for the first time to the environmental devastation of war. Forests were stripped and cut down to make breastworks, trench fortifications, and chevaux-de-frise or set on fire in the course of battles. Armies burned crops and slaughtered livestock to deny food to their opponents or reduce besieged cities to starvation. Entire districts in the South were laid waste by foraging Union armies, who burned and stripped barns and fences and consumed grain and livestock, but also by Confederate soldiers, who frequently foraged with a voracious intensity that was
In July 1862, Lincoln sarcastically dismissed complaints from Union loyalists in Louisiana that Union troops were protecting slaves and imposing restrictions on local trade; he asked them if they expected him to wage war "with elder-stalk squirts, charged with rose water." That same month, Lincoln responded to Robert E. Lee's invasion of Maryland by drawing up a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which declared his intention to free all slaves in Confederate states that did not return to the Union by January the following year. The Emancipation Proclamation was intended to preempt the possibility of international recognition of the Confederacy and pave the way for the formation of black regiments. But it also confirmed the government's new willingness to wage "hard war" with an "iron hand" against the South. Writing to Grant in April 1863, Henry Halleck observed, "The character of the war has changed very much with the last year. There is now no possible hope of reconciliation with the rebels… . There can be no peace but that which is forced by the sword. We must conquer the rebels or be conquered by them."

On July 30, 1864, Confederate cavalry numbering 2,800 under the command of Brigadier General John McCausland raided the town of Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, in retaliation for a punitive antiguerrilla campaign conducted by the Union general David "Black Dave" Hunter in the Shenandoah Valley during the summer, which culminated in the destruction of the town of Lexington, Virginia. McCausland ordered Chambersburg's inhabitants to pay compensation, and when they proved unable to provide it his men burned some 550 buildings, creating what the Richmond Enquirer called "a blaze that will arrest the view of the Northern people, and illustrate the destruction of villages, homesteads, and towns in every Southern state." Such raids were sporadic, if only because the Confederacy lacked the capacity to carry them out on a regular basis. For the Union, on the other hand, physical destruction was not only intended to punish civilians for their real or alleged collusion in guerrilla attacks; it also became an instrument of pacification and subjugation. Such destruction was generally aimed at property rather than people, but it could nevertheless have devastating consequences for those on the receiving end. As Philip Sheridan, one of the toughest Union generals and an implacable proponent of destructive raiding, observed in his memoirs, "Death is popularly considered the maximum of punishment in war, but it is not; reduction to poverty brings prayers for peace more surely and more quickly than does the destruction of human life, as the selfishness of man has demonstrated in more than one great conflict."

Grant's promotion took place at a time when the war had to all intents and purposes shifted irresistibly in the Union's favor. Large swathes of Southern territory were under Union occupation; the Confederate Army and Navy had experienced huge losses; some 33 percent of its nominally available troops were absent without leave; and the civilian population had seen its living standards drastically decline under the impact of warinduced inflation, high food prices, and the increasingly tight blockade. Yet despite these reversals, the Confederacy remained undefeated. Its heartlands in the Deep South were largely untouched, its capital remained unconquered, and it retained powerful and wellentrenched armies in both theaters. It was against this background that Grant was authorized to devise a new strategic plan that would bring the war to a conclusion, together with the man who was soon to prove himself the most destructive of all the Union raiding generals.
In the famous photograph taken by the Civil War photographer Mathew Brady in May 1865 at the height of General William Tecumseh Sherman's fame, Sherman is wearing a high white collar and uniform, his arms crossed, his receding hair wild and unkempt on his domed forehead, his posture ramrod straight. He is looking slightly to his left with a fierce, implacable expression, the embodiment of "grim-visaged war," as one of Grant's staff officers described him in Atlanta in September 1864, whose severe demeanor is enhanced by the black armband commemorating Lincoln's assassination, the sharp aquiline nose, hard-set mouth and hooded eyes, and the pronounced crease on his right cheek, which looks like a dueling scar. Brady's iconic image does not convey the contradictions of Sherman's complex personality-the thoughtful, literate, and highly intelligent man who was prone to fits of depression and self-doubt, the democrat who disliked and distrusted democracy, the racist who freed slaves, the ruthless soldier who often professed his loathing for war and preferred to avoid battle, the man who loved the South yet set out to bludgeon it into submission. The photograph was taken when Sherman had barely returned from the campaigns that had transformed him into the eccentric genius general of the North and the nemesis of the South, and he exudes confidence and willpower and the sense of a man who is conscious of his place in his country's history. Before the war, there was little to suggest that such an outcome was likely; Sherman himself had come to believe that he was destined for obscurity and mediocrity, and even after the war began his career came close to unraveling before it had even begun. 
The general whom one of his officers called "the most American looking man I ever saw" was born on February 8, 1820, in the small town of Lancaster, Ohio, the son of a successful lawyer who gave him his unusual middle name in honor of the legendary Shawnee chieftain. At the age of nine, his father died of fever, leaving his widow with eleven children to support. To ease the burden on his mother, "Cump" Sherman was handed over to the care of the attorney Thomas Ewing, a family friend and Whig Party senator. Ewing secured his adopted son a place at the West Point military academy at the age of sixteen, where he received the standard military education of the period, with a heavily Europe-oriented curriculum that included courses on civil and military engineering, fortifications, siegecraft, artillery and infantry tactics, and a great deal of drill, in addition to more academic subjects such as mineralogy, geology, moral philosophy, and international and common law, which Sherman described to his younger brother John as essential requirements for "the scientific officer."
One of Sherman's professors at West Point was Dennis Hart Mahan, the father of the great admiral and naval strategist Alfred Thayer Mahan. He taught courses on military and civil engineering and the science of war at the academy from 1832 to 1871. Sherman does not say much in his memoirs about the impact of West Point on his future thinking and career, except to boast of the demerits he received as a result of the academy's insistence on "neatness in dress and uniform, with a strict conformity to the rules." Though he may not have paid much attention to his appearance, this most cerebral of American generals thrived academically, and he also imbibed a strong sense of the military as a special caste and the ultimate guarantor of the laws and Constitution of the republic that shaped his worldview both during and after the Civil War.
In 1840 Sherman left the academy as a second lieutenant and received his first posting, to Florida, where between 1835 and 1842 the U.S. Army was engaged in a vicious guerrilla war against the Seminoles known as the Second Seminole War, in which ten thousand regular troops and thirty thousand volunteers fought a frustrating campaign against one thousand Seminole warriors, for whom the swamps and hummocks of the Everglades provided a natural fortress and hiding place. In 1841 Colonel William J. Worth turned the war in the government's favor by sending small units into the Everglades outside the normal hunting season, in the winter, to burn and destroy Seminole camps, canoes, crops, and food supplies rather than hunt their elusive combatants. These operations contain the outlines of Sherman's future campaigns in the Civil War and also in the West. Though he made little contribution to the Seminole campaigns, he described them with some enthusiasm to Ellen Boyle Ewing, the daughter of Thomas Ewing and his soon-to-be fiancée, as "a kind of warfare which every young officer should be thoroughly acquainted with, as the Indian is most likely to be our chief enemy in times to come."

He was less enthusiastic about the military, which offered only limited prospects of promotion. Unlike Grant and many of his other West Point classmates, Sherman did not participate in the 1846-48 war with Mexico, and he was uncomfortably conscious afterward that "our country had passed through a foreign war, that my comrades had fought great battles, and yet I had not fired a single shot." In 1850 he married Ellen Ewing, and three years later he left the army after having obtained the rank of captain, largely as a result of pressure from his adopted family to find more remunerative employment. That same year, he moved to San Francisco to take up a position as manager of the local branch of a Saint Louis bank, where he was appointed major general of the California militia. This appointment drew him into a bitter dispute between the state government and a self-styled Vigilance Committee over the deteriorating law-and-order situation in the city. True to his West Point education, Sherman took the side of the government and was ignored and humiliated, an experience that reinforced his instinctive conservatism, in which an almost religious reverence for the law and the Constitution was coupled with a deep suspicion of "mob rule" and "anarchy," and the politicians and newspapers who he believed often promoted these tendencies.
Sherman's letters and memoirs contain a cross section of the turbulent and dynamic mid-nineteenth-century American society that he inhabited, from Indians, aristocratic Mexican women, and slave-owning planters to California gold miners, frontier scouts, and settlers, as well as the hardworking Yankee middle classes of the great Northern cities that he was never able to feel part of. In 1856, an economic slump in California led his employers to close down his bank in San Francisco. In July 1858, the Shermans moved to Leavenworth, Kansas, where he was admitted to the Kansas bar, but this career path also turned out to be a dead end when the new lawyer was unable to generate sufficient work to feed his growing family. These failures intensified Sherman's tendency to melancholy and self-pity, and his pessimism regarding his career prospects was not helped by the success of his younger brother John, who made a smooth transition from the law to the House of Representatives. In one of his many despondent moments, Sherman told his wife that he was "doomed to be a vagabond," and described himself as "a dead cock in the pit." In 1859, his luck changed when he secured a job as superintendent of a new military academy in Louisiana, and the following year he wrote to Ellen in a tone of resignation rather than satisfaction from the newly created Louisiana Seminary of Learning and Military Academy, "I must rest satisfied with the title of the 'Old Man,' the 'cross old schoolmaster.' "
The "cross old schoolmaster" was then forty years old and appeared to have reached the zenith of his less than dazzling achievements. Without the Civil War, Sherman might have spent the rest of his life churning out Southern cadets for the U.S. Army, but this did not mean that he relished the opportunity that the outbreak of war provided. On Christmas Eve, 1860, he was in his college rooms when he read that South Carolina had seceded. According to a Virginian friend and colleague, Sherman began crying and pacing the room and decried what he called an act of "folly, madness, a crime against civilization" that would force him to fight "against your people, whom I love best." Sherman insisted that the South could not prevail against "one of the most powerful, ingeniously mechanical and determined people on earth" but he nevertheless foresaw, unlike many of his contemporaries, that the war would be long and bloody.

Against his better judgment, he agreed to become brigadier general of a volunteer regiment in Kentucky, and in October he was unexpectedly promoted to commander of the Army of the Cumberland in Kentucky, when his predecessor resigned on health grounds. Sherman did not believe he was ready for high command, and the promotion nearly wrecked his career when he scandalized Lincoln's secretary of war Simon Cameron by declaring that at least two hundred thousand soldiers would eventually be needed to extend the war into the South. This prediction, as it turned out, was not inaccurate, but it was not what the North believed at the time. Sherman's case was not helped by his paranoid overestimation of the numbers of Confederate troops in Kentucky, which led him to believe that his own army was about to be overwhelmed. These views caught the attention of the Northern press, which was frequently as eager to destroy the reputations of Union generals as it was to boost them, and led to a series of stories questioning his sanity. Reports from Sherman's headquarters of the manic behavior of the insomniac commander of the Army of the Cumberland did nothing to dispel such reports and eventually prompted his wife to travel to Louisville to rescue him from what was effectively a nervous breakdown. In November 1861, Sherman was relieved of his command and taken home to recuperate before being transferred to a remote post in Missouri, where he might easily have remained had it not been for the efforts of his wife, his brother, his stepfather, and his father-in-law, who lobbied intensively in Washington for him to be given another chance.
In February 1862, his old West Point classmate Henry Halleck sent him to Paducah, Mississippi, to organize the supply depot that Ulysses Grant had established for his campaign against forts Henry and Donelson. Here Sherman first demonstrated the logistical skills that would later shape his campaigns in the Deep South. Located twelve miles apart at the parallel Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers respectively, in barely mapped terrain with few roads, these two forts were a vital component of the Confederate defense of Tennessee. Placed by Halleck in charge of the District of Cairo, Sherman demonstrated the punctilious attention to detail of a consummate quartermaster and restored much needed order and organization to the Western army's chaotic supply chain. It was largely due to his efforts that Grant was provided with a constant flow of boats bearing food, supplies, and reinforcements when he needed them, in order to carry out his complex operations that provided the Union with its first major victories of the war, and this contribution restored Sherman's own confidence. His redemption was confirmed at the Battle of Shiloh on April 6, though only just. Initially taken by surprise by the Southern assault, he proved himself to be a courageous and inspirational general during twelve hours of ferocious combat, in which he was lightly wounded twice and had three horses shot from under him.
Sherman was praised by both Halleck and Grant for his contribution to the successful Union counterattack the next day, and Shiloh cemented his friendship with Grant that was to play such a decisive role in the campaigns that followed. Even more than Bull Run, Shiloh exposed the former lawyer and bank manager to the horrors of the conflict. "The scenes on this field would have cured anybody of war," he told his wife. "Mangled bodies, dead, dying, in every conceivable shape, without heads, legs; and horses!"

Grant's tactics were a revelation to Sherman. Not only had he demonstrated that a large army could subsist on the country without supplies, but his skillful manipulation of the Confederate armies offered a brilliantly executed example of how to make tactical gains over an opposing army by avoiding battle rather than pursuing it. Sherman's corps also participated in the destruction of factories, storehouses, and railroad lines at Jackson, while Grant moved toward Vicksburg. Sherman learned these lessons well. In July that year, he returned to Jackson following the fall of Vicksburg and completed the destruction of the city with such thoroughness that Union soldiers dubbed it Chimneyville.
Unlike his superiors, Sherman never believed that the South could be brought back to the Union through a policy of conciliation. "The greatest difficulty in the problem now before the country is not to conquer but so conquer as to impress upon the real men of the South a respect for their conquerors," he wrote to his brother from Saint Louis in 1861. "When one nation is at war with another, all the people of the one are the enemies of the other; then the rules are plain and easy of understanding," he wrote to Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase from Memphis in August 1862. In a letter to Grant that same month, he promised to "make this war as severe as possible, and show no symptoms of tiring till the South begs for mercy; indeed, I know, and you know, that the end would be reached quicker by such a course than by any seeming yielding on our part."

His personal motives notwithstanding, Sherman came to believe from a purely military perspective that the South could not be subjugated unless the civilian population also paid a price for its support of the Confederate government and army. In his letter to Halleck in September 1863, he declared in unequivocal terms that the war should be waged not just against those who actively resisted the Union, but also against Southerners who "stand by, mere lookers-on in this domestic tragedy, they have no right to immunity, protection, or share in the final results." Despite such statements, Sherman still attempted for the most part to limit these efforts to public property rather than private homes, but his previous concern when his troops exceeded these boundaries was conspicuously absent by the summer of 1863. "Of necessity, in the war the commander on the spot is the judge, and may take your house, your field, your everything, and turn you all out, helpless to starve," he told a citizens committee from Warren County. "It may be wrong, but that don't alter the case."

Marching in two columns and supported by simultaneous diversionary operations in northern Mississippi and along the river, Sherman was able to prevent Lieutenant General Leonidas Polk's twenty-thousand-strong Army of Mississippi from massing against him. On February 14, his troops entered Meridian unopposed. Sherman spent the next five days displaying what Bruce Catton has called "a sinister zeal for destroying Southern property," wrecking the city with such thoroughness that he was able to report to Grant that "Meridian, with its depots, storehouses, arsenals, hospitals, offices, hotels, and cantonments no longer exists."

On March 20, 1864, Sherman and Grant met in the Burnet House hotel in Cincinnati to devise the coming spring campaign, at a time when the outcome of the war was by no means certain. Despite steady Union gains over the past year, Union casualties far outnumbered those of the Confederacy; its army was also plagued by desertion, and the Lincoln administration was entering an election year in which the president could not take the support of the public or even his own party for granted.
Both Grant and Sherman were acutely aware that a Democratic victory in the November election might lead to a negotiated peace and the definitive breakup of the Union, as they plotted a simultaneous campaign in both theaters that would bring the Confederacy to its knees. In the East, the Armies of the Potomac and the James would advance on Richmond and attempt to draw Lee's Army of Northern Virginia into a position where the Union armies would be able to destroy it. While Grant's armies set out to "get Lee," the Union Army and Navy would attack the Confederacy at multiple points throughout Georgia, Mississippi, Alabama, and the Carolina coast.
As commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi following Grant's promotion, Sherman was entrusted with preventing Joseph Johnston's Army of Tennessee, the second of the CSA's armies, from coming to Lee's assistance from Georgia. On April 4, Sherman was ordered "to pursue Johnston's army, to break it up and to get into the interior of the enemy's country as far as you can, inflicting all the damage you can against their war resources." Over the next month, Sherman prepared for the coming campaign with characteristic thoroughness. On April 6, he commandeered all available rolling stock and food supplies south of Nashville exclusively for military use. For the next four weeks, an average of 130 locomotives hurtled down the heavily guarded railroad between the Union supply depot at Nashville and its forward supply base at Chattanooga, while horses, pack animals, and herds of cattle were shunted toward the front.
On May 4, some 120,000 Union soldiers crossed the Rapidan River in Virginia, and the following day they clashed with Lee's forces in the dense woodland known as the Wilderness, in a hallucinatory two-day battle of stunning savagery. Over the next six weeks, the two armies were engaged in what Grant later called "as desperate fighting as the world has ever witnessed," a series of ferocious and bloody battles in which the Union armies lost 65,000 men and Lee 35,000.   While this terrible war of attrition was unfolding in Virginia, Sherman began a very different campaign in Georgia. On May 7, the combined armies of the Cumberland, the Tennessee, and the Ohio left Chattanooga, Tennessee, and followed the route of the Western & Atlantic Railroad, which was to be their principal supply conduit. Established in 1773 as a result of a royal charter from King George III, Georgia, the last of the fifteen British colonies, now had one million inhabitants. They had not yet experienced the war firsthand, but their state now became the scene of a dramatic war of maneuver, as a hundred thousand infantry, artillery, cavalry, and engineers advanced cautiously down the railroad toward Atlanta and forced the Army of Tennessee to conduct a series of tactical retreats to avoid being outflanked.
Today it takes just over an hour to drive from Chattanooga to Atlanta. In the summer of 1864, it took Sherman's army more than two months to fight its way to the Chattahoochee River. Sherman generally tried to avoid direct frontal assaults on the welldefended Confederates and attempted to turn Johnston's flanks, while his adversary was equally determined to conserve his forces by avoiding a decisive confrontation. The Union advance was marked by constant skirmishing and vicious small-scale engagements at New Hope Mill, Pickett's Mill, Dallas, and Kennesaw Mountain, where Sherman ordered a rare and costly failed attack on strongly fortified Confederate positions on June 27. Though Confederate cavalry and guerrillas harried Sherman's armies and attempted to cut their railroad supply link, this damage was quickly repaired-under the direction of Sherman's brilliant chief of engineers, Captain Orlando Poe-with an improvisational ability that astonished the rebels, in one instance rebuilding a 780-foot-long trestle bridge across the Chattahoochee River in four days. Throughout this advance, Union soldiers foraged relentlessly to compensate for delays in the flow of supplies, and they burned buildings and houses in retaliation for acts of sabotage and guerrilla attacks. "We have devoured the land and our animals eat up the wheat and corn field close," Sherman wrote to his wife. "All the people retire before us and desolation is behind. To realize what war is one should follow our tracks."

As a result, the Lincoln administration's hopes of reelection rested on Sherman's campaign. On July 17, Jefferson Davis lost patience with Johnston's cautious defensive strategy and replaced him with Lieutenant General John Bell Hood. A brave but reckless commander who had lost a leg and the use of an arm and took opiates to kill the pain, Hood immediately threw twenty thousand troops against Union forces at Peachtree Creek on July 20, losing 4,746 men in the first of three attempts to drive Sherman's encircling armies back. The next day, Union batteries opened fire on Atlanta for the first time. On August 1, Sherman ordered his artillery commanders to "fire from ten to fifteen from every gun you have in position into Atlanta that will reach any of its houses. Fire slowly and with deliberation between 4 P.M. and dark."
On August 9, an estimated five thousand exploding shells and cannon shots fell on the city, whose population may have been as large as ten thousand, including refugees who had fled the Union advance. To escape the bombardment, many of its inhabitants were obliged to dig "bombproofs" and "gopher holes" beneath their gardens or by extending their cellars, as Union commanders targeted prominent buildings and used heated shells as incendiaries. Though Sherman told one of his generals that most civilians had "got out" of the besieged city, civilians were inevitably killed in these bombardments. "This seems to me a very barbarous mode of carrying on war, throwing shells at women and children," reflected a local bookseller named Samuel Richards.

Only five days after taking control of Atlanta, Sherman informed Hood that he had decided to reserve the city exclusively for military use and that it was "to the interest of the United States that the citizens now residing in Atlanta should remove, those who prefer it to go south, and the rest north." This was not the first time civilians were forcibly evacuated during the Civil War. On August 25, 1863, Sherman's father-in-law, Brigadier General Thomas Ewing, ordered the depopulation of three counties in Missouri in retaliation for Quantrill's raid on Lawrence. Some twenty thousand people were driven from the county and their homes burned, an expulsion that was justified by General John Schofield, then commander of the Department of the Missouri, on the grounds that "all the inhabitants [were] practically the friends of the guerrillas." On July 7, during the advance on Atlanta, Sherman ordered General Kenner Garrard to arrest four hundred mostly female mill workers and their children from two factory towns near Roswell, outside Atlanta, whose factories produced a fabric used to make Confederate tents and uniforms. In Sherman's opinion, their workers were "as much governed by the rules of war as if in the ranks." 
21
The evacuation of Atlanta was justified on different grounds. From Sherman's perspective, the continued presence of civilians was both a security threat to his own troops and an additional drain on the food supplies available to his army. Hood reluctantly agreed to comply in an angry letter the following day, in which he accused Sherman of deliberately shelling civilians and condemned the evacuation order as an affront to "the name of God and humanity" and an "unprecedented measure" that "transcends, in studied and ingenious cruelty, all acts ever before brought to my attention in the dark history of war." This prompted an acrimonious exchange in which Sherman denied that his decision was unprecedented and accused the Confederacy of "hundreds" of similar actions. 
22
In a long rejoinder, Hood insisted that "there are a hundred thousand witnesses that you fired into the habitations of women and children for weeks, firing far above and miles beyond my line of defense" and accused Sherman of "subjugating free white men, women and children" in order to "place over us an inferior race, which we have raised from barbarism to its present position"-reference to the presence of black soldiers in the Union army. Sherman denied that there were "negro allies" in his army and maintained that "I was not bound by the laws of war to give notice of the shelling of Atlanta, a fortified town, with magazines, arsenals, foundries, and public stores; you were bound to take notice. See the books."
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of this exchange is that it even took place at all. Victorious generals have never been obliged to explain or justify their decisions to their opponents, and this was just as true in the nineteenth century. Hood's references to "the laws of God and man" and Sherman's reference to the "books" both evoked a corpus of customs or usages of war inherited from the European military tradition, which attempted to limit the impact of war on noncombatants. The work of eighteenth-century legal scholars such as the Swiss jurist Emmerich de Vattel and the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau received a new impetus in the second half of the nineteenth century as armies, governments, and jurists debated a wide spectrum of military activities that included the treatment of civilians by occupying armies, the appropriation and destruction of private and public property, the conditions under which cities could be bombarded, and the legitimacy of reprisals and other forms of collective punishment in response to guerrilla warfare. These debates were reflected in the foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross in 1863, as well as in the Civil War. On April 24, 1863, Lincoln promulgated General Orders No. 100: Instructions for the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field, which laid down a code of conduct for Union commanders in Southern territory. 
23
Sherman clearly regarded his decision to remove the population of Atlanta as justifiable according to this criterion, and this interpretation was supported in a letter from Halleck that same month: "Not only are you justified by the laws and usages of war in removing these people, but I think it was your duty to your own army to do so… . Let the disloyal families of the country, thus stripped, go to their husbands, fathers, and natural protectors, in the rebel ranks; we have tried three years of conciliation and kindness without any reciprocation; on the contrary, those thus treated have acted as spies and guerrillas in our rear and within our lines. Therefore the safety of our armies … requires that we apply to our inexorable foes the severe rules of war."

Now that war comes home to you, you feel very different. You deprecate its horrors, but did not feel them when you sent car-loads of soldiers and ammunition, and moulded shells and shot, to carry war into Kentucky and Tennessee, to desolate the homes and of hundreds and thousands of good people who only asked to live in peace in their old homes, and under the Government of their inheritance. But these comparisons are idle. I want peace, and believe it can only be reached through union and war, and I will ever conduct war with a view to perfect and early success.
That, as far as Sherman was concerned, was the crux of the matter. Not only had the Confederacy brought such treatment on itself, but Atlanta's role in war time production meant that its population was also a legitimate military target. Not only was war a form of cruelty that could not be "refined," but the escalation of its "horrors" was an instrument of "perfect and early success" and was therefore more merciful and humane in the long run. The Lieber Code expressed a very similar idea when it declared, "The more vigorously wars are pursued, the better it is for humanity. Sharp wars are brief." And Sherman's reply to Calhoun closed with a rhetorical flourish that held out the prospect of reconciliation in exchange for the South's obedience: "But, my dear sirs, when peace does come, you may call on me for any thing. Then I will share with you the last cracker, and watch with you to shield your homes and families against danger from every quarter. Now you must go, and take with you the old and feeble, feed and nurse them, and build for them, in more quiet places, proper habitations to shield them against the weather until the mad passions of men cool down, and allow the Union and peace once more to settle over your old homes at Atlanta." Despite his ruthlessness, Sherman still rejected the suggestion that his conduct of the war constituted what would later be called a "war crime" as a personal insult and an insult to his government. When Hood published extracts from this correspondence in a Macon newspaper, Sherman sent the complete exchange, together with his letter to Calhoun, for publication in Northern newspapers to make sure that his position was understood. In the North, the response was generally positive. "General Sherman says to the Mayor of Atlanta what every true heart in the land confirms and approves," observed Harper's Weekly. In the South, Sherman's words were as iniquitous as his actions and transformed him into a hate figure in whom the Macon Telegraph saw "all the attributes of man … merged in the enormities of the demon, as if Heaven intended in him to manifest depths of depravity yet untouched by a fallen race."
"Making Georgia Howl"
The South would soon have many more reasons to despise Atlanta's conqueror. By the end of September, the city had been emptied of its inhabitants, but Sherman was beginning to have second thoughts about maintaining Atlanta as a military base and retaining a railroad supply line that ultimately extended some 470 miles to Louisville, Kentucky, via Chattanooga and Nashville, much of which passed through hostile territory and was vulnerable to attacks by marauding Confederate cavalry raiders in addition to Hood's roving forty-thousand-strong army. To keep the railroad link open required the continued deployment of large numbers of troops that would undermine the offensive momentum that his armies had acquired, at a time when Grant's armies were already bogged down in Virginia.
Grant suggested in a telegram that Sherman might link with General Edward Canby, the Union commander at New Orleans, and carry out a joint attack on the city of Columbus. Instead Sherman proposed to march his army through central Georgia "hauling some stores, and depending on the country for the balance" with a view to attacking Macon, Augusta, or Savannah, depending on the Confederate response, because "either horn of the dilemma will be worth the battle." 
26
On September 29, Sherman dispatched a large force under command of the "Rock of Chickamauga," General George H. Thomas, to defend Tennessee against Hood. Two days later, he informed Grant of his intention to "destroy Atlanta and march across Georgia to Savannah or Charleston, breaking roads and doing irreparable damage." This plan became more defined as Hood attempted to lure his army out of Atlanta by cutting the railroad link to Chattanooga. These efforts were partly successful, and Sherman was obliged to venture out of the city to keep his supply line open. But he had no intention of chasing Hood's army indefinitely. On October 10, he suggested to Grant that he "strike out with our wagons for Milledgeville, Millen, and Savannah." This expedition was not designed to capture these cities, because "until we can repopulate Georgia, it is useless for us to occupy it; but the utter destruction of its roads, houses, and people, will cripple their military resources… . I can make this march, and make Georgia howl!"
In another telegram two days later, Sherman dismissed the idea of pursuing Hood or defending the railroad: "We cannot remain on the defensive. With twenty-five thousand infantry and the bold cavalry he has, Hood can constantly break my road. I would infinitely prefer to make a wreck of the road and of the country from Chattanooga to Atlanta, including the latter city; send back all my wounded and unserviceable men, and with my effective army move through Georgia, smashing things to the sea." Grant was not averse to a campaign of devastation in principle. That same month, Philip Sheridan was ordered to transform the Shenandoah Valley into a "barren waste" in an attempt to cut off the flow of food to Confederate guerrillas and Lee's army. On October 7, Sheridan reported the destruction of over two thousand barns and seventy mills, the seizure of four thousand head of livestock, and the killing or distribution of more than three thousand sheep to troops. He boasted that "the Valley, from Winchester up to Staunton, ninety-two miles, will have little in it for man or beast." 
27
These observations are an indication of the extent to which Sherman's strategic thinking had moved beyond the Napoleonic concept of the decisive battle. In his standard textbook, An Elementary Treatise on Advanced-Guard, Out-Post, and Detachment Service of Troops, Sherman's former tutor at West Point Dennis Hart Mahan argued that "carrying the war into the heart of the assailant's country, or that of his allies, is the surest plan of making him share its burdens and foiling his plans." 
28
The benefits of this course of action were by no means obvious to his superiors in Washington, who were accustomed to more conventional military objectives. Anticipating these objections, Sherman fired off two more telegrams to Grant on November 1, in which he insisted that it was "useless" to pursue Hood. "If I turn back, the whole effect of my campaign will be lost." The following day, Grant conceded that pursuing Hood would mean "giving up all we have gained in territory" and told his friend to "go on as you propose." On November 6, the triumphant Sherman promised "to act in such a manner against the material resources of the South as utterly to negate Davis's boasted threat and promises of protection. If we can march a well-appointed army right through his territory, it is a demonstration to the world, foreign and domestic, that we have a power which Davis cannot resist. This may not be war, but rather statesmanship." Sherman now accelerated his preparations, as trains shuttled back and forth between Atlanta and Chattanooga, carrying sick and wounded soldiers and surplus artillery and equipment, and bringing new supplies for the coming campaign. Amid the pandemonium and the purposeful movement of soldiers, wagons, and animals, civilians who had not yet left the city crowded onto the last trains with their household pets and what furniture they were able to carry or bribe the guards to let them take on board. On November 8, Sherman issued his Special Orders No. 120, which informed his troops that they had been organized "into an army for a special purpose, well known to the War Department and to General Grant … that … involves a departure from our present base, and a long and difficult march to a new one. All the chances of war have been considered and provided for, as far as human sagacity can." Sherman's troops were instructed to take with them only the minimum of supplies and provisions. Servants, noncombatants, and refugees were to be sent back to Tennessee. Each corps was to carry provisions for ten days and forage for three days in its supply wagons, while soldiers were expected to "forage liberally on the country" to make up the rest. While quartermasters and commissary officers continued to accumulate supplies and equipment, teams of soldiers destroyed everything in Atlanta and its surrounding towns that could be of use to the enemy. Using an improvised battering ram and a grappling hook invented by the indefatigable chief of engineers, soldiers knocked down foundries, factories, and railroad installations and tore up a hundred miles of track. On November 12, the telegraph link was cut, leaving his army, as Sherman later put it, "detached from all friends, dependent on its own resources and supplies."
Over the next few days, fires broke out in the business district of Atlanta and eventually destroyed some five thousand homes, creating a conflagration that was visible for miles around. Some fires were caused by pillaging soldiers; others were an accidental consequence of the ongoing destruction. On the morning of November 15, the first of Sherman's columns marched eastward out of the deserted city along the Decatur road. The following day, at seven in the morning, Sherman himself left the smoking ruins of Atlanta with the Fourteenth Corps along the Decatur road, accompanied by the strains of military bands.
Sherman and his soldiers left the city in a buoyant mood. He later wrote, "The day was extremely beautiful, clear sunlight, with bracing air, and an unusual feeling of exhilaration seemed to pervade all minds-a feeling of something to come, vague and undefined, still full of venture and intense interest." The British Army & Navy Gazette observed that Sherman "has done either one of the most brilliant or one of the most foolish things ever performed by a military leader," while the London Herald predicted that the coming campaign would determine whether Sherman was to become "the scoff of mankind, and the humiliation of the United States for all time" or whether his name would be "written on the tablet of fame." Georgia newspapers predicted that Sherman had committed a tactical error that would result in the destruction of his army at the hands of Confederate guerrillas. In a visit to Macon shortly before his departure, Jefferson Davis exhorted the population of Georgia to ensure that Sherman's armies would meet the same fate as Napoléon's Grand Army during its retreat from Moscow-causing Grant to ask sarcastically whether the Confederate president would be providing the snow. Over the next month, the hollowness of these aspirations became painfully apparent, as Sherman's armies showed the South what his "statesmanship" meant.
Throughout history, warring armies have burned and destroyed crops and property in order to reduce besieged cities to starvation, to punish rebellion and defiance, to deny food to their opponents, or to prevent invading armies from living off the land. In 1069-70, the Normans adopted a policy of "harrying the North" in response to a baronial rebellion in Yorkshire that was supported by a Danish invasion. The twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury describes how William the Conqueror "ordered both the towns and fields of the whole district to be laid waste; the fruits and grain to be destroyed by fire or by water" in a campaign of "fire, slaughter and devastation" that left "the ground, for more than sixty miles around, totally uncultivated and barren, remaining bare even to this present day." 1 "Ravaging" expeditions in which foraging was indistinguishable from plunder were a well-established tactic of medieval European warfare, one that was often radically at odds with the prevailing mythology of knightly chivalrous war. The late twelfth-or early thirteenth-century Chanson des Lorrains describes a typical spectacle of military depredation that would not have been unfamiliar to Sherman's armies:
The incendiaries set the villages on fire, and the foragers visit and sack them; the terrified inhabitants are burnt or led apart with their hands tied to be held for ransom. Everywhere alarm bells ring, fear spreads from side to side and becomes widespread. On all sides one sees helmets shining, pennons floating, and horsemen covering the plain. Here hands are laid on money; there cattle, donkeys and flocks are seized. The smoke spreads, the flames rise, and the peasants and shepherds flee in panic in all directions. 
2
Campaigns of devastation aimed at civilian life and property were also a feature of the more stately conventions of warfare in early modern Europe. In Ireland, Sir Arthur Chichester described operations in 1593 along Lough Neagh in which "We have killed, burnt and spoiled all along the lough within four miles of Dungannon… . We spare none of what quality or sex soever, and it has bred much terror in the people, who heard not a drum nor saw not a fire there for a long time."

The transformation of Sherman's march into a paradigm of military destruction has often been enhanced by evocative metaphors that have variously compared his army to a storm or a typhoon, an expression of divine wrath and retribution, or a "wild Halloween brawl," as Bruce Catton once described it. The novelist E.L. Doctorow described Sherman's army as "a great segmented body moving in contractions and dilations at a rate of twelve or fifteen miles a day, a creature of a hundred thousand feet. It is tubular in its being and tentacled to the roads and bridges over which it travels. It sends out as antennae its men on horses. It consumes everything in its path. It is an immense organism, this army, with a small brain." 
7
To reduce the loads still further, heavier wall tents were limited to officers only; enlisted men were reduced to the light fly sheets they carried with them, each of which formed one half of a pair to make a tent. Apart from their rubber blankets, soldiers carried three days' rations and forty rounds of ammunition in their pockets and knapsacks. A rigorous medical selection process in Atlanta ensured that only the healthiest and strongest soldiers were allowed on the march. To give himself maximum tactical flexibility, Sherman divided his army into two parallel wings, marching roughly twenty miles away from each other. The Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps of the Army of the Cumberland occupied the left, under the command of the New Yorker Major General Henry W. Slocum. On the right marched the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps of the Army of the Tennessee, commanded by the devoutly Christian Major General Oliver O. Howard. With Hood's army absent in Tennessee, Georgia was defended by an ad hoc conglomeration of Confederate forces that included four brigades of the ill-trained and inexperienced Georgia State Militia, various hastily scooped up and under-strength regiments dispersed throughout the state, in addition to fewer than 2,000 cavalry under the command of General Joseph "Fighting Joe" Wheeler, making a total of some 13,000 fighting men. These forces could not hold back an army of nearly 60,000 veteran soldiers, but Sherman was no less aware than Grant that any extended delay would quickly exhaust his army's supplies of food and provisions and leave it vulnerable to hit-and-run attacks. In a state crisscrossed with rivers, creeks, and swamps, determined resistance from even small concentrations of troops might bring his army to a halt. Sherman's organization and deployment of his army were carefully designed to avoid such bottlenecks. Both wings were preceded by ax-wielding "pioneers," whose task was to rebuild destroyed bridges, clear blocked roads, and cut down trees to "corduroy" the swamps and muddy roads with rows of timber to allow wagons to pass. Each corps included a contingent from Orlando Poe's corps of engineers, equipped with wagons carrying the canvas canoes and light planks that were used to replace destroyed bridges with pontoon bridges up to nine hundred feet long. These preparations transformed his army into two astonishingly mobile "flying columns" that were capable of marching at an average speed of ten to fifteen miles a day with very few stragglers.
From the early hours of the morning until often late in the evening, Sherman's soldiers marched almost continuously in fifty-minute stretches broken by ten-minute rests, with a forty-minute break for lunch at midday, in a line that sometimes stretched for twenty miles, including the cattle and supply trains. In May 1862, it took the overcautious Henry Halleck three weeks to march a hundred-thousand-strong army five miles to capture the city of Corinth. It took Sherman's army less than a month to reach the outskirts of Savannah on December 10. In that time, his army crossed fifteen creeks, streams, and rivers; constructed pontoon bridges at an average of 230 feet per crossing; and chopped down trees to corduroy more than a hundred miles of mud and swamp while fighting constant skirmishes with Confederate cavalry. This irresistible progress was a testament to Sherman's meticulous planning and organization and also to the skill and motivation of what was then one of the finest and most experienced armies in the world. With Judson "Kill Cavalry" Kilpatrick's horsemen acting as messengers, the two wings invariably arrived when and where they were supposed to, while stripping food from the countryside through a remorselessly effective foraging system. Under Sherman's chief quartermaster, General George L.C. Easton, foraging was carried out with such speed and efficiency that supply wagons barely paused during the march as new quantities of food and other goods were absorbed and distributed among them. Each morning, brigade commanders dispatched foraging parties of approximately fifty men, who were sent out before daylight with details of where the army would be camping at the end of the day. Fanning out five to six miles or more from the main body of the army, these organized teams, as well as more autonomous foragers known as bummers, returned in the early evening or late at night to the next camp, mounted on mules, cows, or horses or in requisitioned buggies and wagons loaded with corn, molasses, sweet potatoes, turkeys, ducks, chickens, and meat, all of which were handed over to the brigade commissary officers.
The success of this system was partly due to Sherman's prewar travels in the South. His exceptional memory for landscape and topographic detail meant that he knew exactly what to expect before leaving Atlanta, and he brought with him a copy of the 1860 census containing precise details of the population and economic resources of every county in the state. As he later boasted to his wife, "No military expedition was ever based on sounder or surer data."

As in the Meridian campaign, Sherman divided his army in order to confuse his enemies about his intentions. On leaving Atlanta, the left wing followed the Decatur road through Covington and Madison toward the state capital of Milledgeville-a line of march that seemed to suggest the city of Augusta as its ultimate objective. The right wing, meanwhile, headed farther south through Jonesboro and McDonough, leaving open the possibility of an attack on Columbus or Macon. From a conventional military perspective, any of these cities constituted a potential target. Augusta was the site of the largest gunpowder factory in the CSA; Columbus was the site of the Columbus Arsenal and Armory, the Confederate Quartermaster Depot, and the Naval Iron Works; while Macon contained a number of factories and workshops dedicated to military production.
Rather than commit his troops to a prolonged siege of fortified cities, Sherman chose to bypass them, forcing his opponents to disperse their forces and constantly guess his ultimate direction, using Kilpatrick's infantry as an instrument of deception. On approaching Macon, Kilpatrick's men carried out a feint attack to the very outskirts of the city, while the right wing wheeled north to converge with the left at the state capital of Milledgeville. From there the two armies diverged once again, and Kilpatrick was transferred to the left wing, where he carried out a similar feint toward Augusta, skirmishing with Joseph Wheeler's cavalry at Waynesboro before resuming the march toward Savannah.
By the time it became clear to the Confederacy that both wings were headed toward Savannah, it was too late to do anything about it. With the main Confederate army pinned down in Virginia, only John Bell Hood's forty-thousand-strong Army of Tennessee posed a significant threat to Sherman's forces, a threat that was removed when Hood decided to take his army out of Georgia and invade Tennessee. Successive defeats at Franklin on November 30 and Nashville on December 15-16 decimated Hood's army and eliminated any last possibility that Sherman might have to diverge from his route to defend the state.
As a consequence, Sherman was able to move through Georgia almost at will, using Kilpatrick's cavalry to shield his army from Wheeler's probing attacks. Apart from cavalry skirmishes and occasional sharpshooting attacks, his army faced no significant resistance. The only significant battle of the march took place near the small town of Griswoldville on November 22, when a 1,500-man brigade of the Fifteenth Corps under Brigadier General Charles C. Walcutt easily repulsed a pointless assault by 4,500 illtrained militia and Georgia state troopers, many of whom consisted of adolescent boys and old men, in which 51 rebels were killed and 471 wounded. On December 10, Sherman's armies reached the swampy outskirts of Savannah and found that the city's defenders had broken open the dikes and flooded the rice fields. Three days later, the Second Division of the Fifteenth Corps stormed the Confederate outpost of Fort McAllister, overlooking the Ogeechee River, thus enabling the Union Navy to resupply Sherman's armies and reopen the "cracker line"-as Union soldiers called their supply line, after the hardtack crackers that were an essential part of their rations.
The dikes were quickly repaired by Poe's unstoppable engineers, and as the waters receded Sherman's army prepared to besiege a city that was defended by ten thousand Confederate troops under the command of Lieutenant General William J. Hardee. Sherman warned Hardee to surrender and threatened to inflict the "the harshest measures" on the city's population if he was obliged to mount a siege. On the night of December 20, Hardee's forces quietly slipped out of the city across a makeshift causeway, and the following day the Union army entered Savannah. On Christmas Eve, its triumphant commander sent a telegram to Lincoln offering him the city and its cotton as a "Christmas present." Sherman's previous failures were forgotten as the North celebrated a campaign that appeared to confirm the imminent collapse of the Confederacy. Behind him, the March to the Sea had left a trail of misery and destruction that confirmed his reputation as the nemesis of the South and which, to many Southerners, did not seem like war at all.
In his memoirs Sherman later described the March to the Sea somewhat dismissively as a "mere change of base" that was intended to put his army in a position to assist Grant in Virginia. While this objective certainly figured in his calculations, this explanation does not accord with the motives in his letters and telegrams that preceded the march. Unlike Scott's march on Mexico City in 1847, Sherman's march was not simply intended to get from one place to another, but to eliminate Georgia's war resources and break its communication links to the rest of the South. These objectives were pursued with the same mechanical and workmanlike precision that characterized other aspects of the campaign.
Between Atlanta and Savannah, Sherman's soldiers tore up 317 miles of the Central Georgia Railroad, including the vital junction at Millen where the lines from Savannah, Augusta, Atlanta, and Macon converged, in addition to demolishing and burning railroad depots, warehouses, station buildings, and bridges. In what was already a well-established procedure, sections of track were hoisted up simultaneously by hundreds of soldiers, and the wooden ties burned to make a bonfire on which rails were softened and twisted around trees or bent into bow shapes-"Sherman's neckties"-so they couldn't be used again.
After severing the railway and telegraph connections within the state and between Georgia and the rest of the South, Sherman did not need to actually capture the cities that the Confederacy was so anxious to defend. The effectiveness of this strategy was demonstrated by the complete collapse of gunpowder production at the Augusta powder factory during the march. Factories, cotton storehouses and cotton gins, flour and salt mills, workshops, tanneries, and sawmills with any direct or potential military purpose were also destroyed. Sherman's soldiers also targeted Georgia's agricultural production, burning barns and storehouses containing food supplies that they didn't need for themselves, and shooting or bayoneting livestock that they couldn't take with them. Thousands of exhausted mules and horses were put down with the blow of an ax or a bullet so that they couldn't be used by the enemy, and bloodhounds used to pursue slaves were also shot, often at the request of the slaves themselves. This ongoing slaughter of animals added to the general desolation that accompanied Sherman's army. One Confederate officer described how "the whole region stunk with putrefying carcasses, and earth and air were filled with innumerable turkey buzzards battening upon their thickly strewn death feasts." Sherman's marching orders in Atlanta had specified that destruction should be limited to public property and subject to approval from commanding officers. In the early stages of the march, however, soldiers burned property as they saw fit; Georgians were able to measure the progress of the Union armies by the spreading fires.
"As far as the eye could reach, the lurid flames of burning buildings lit up the heavens. I could stand out on the veranda and for two or three miles watch them as they came on," remembered one Georgia woman.

From Savannah Sherman sent an audit of destruction to his superiors, which claimed that his armies had seized 6,871 mules and horses, 13,294 head of cattle, 10.4 million pounds of grain, and 10.7 million pounds of fodder and had inflicted $100 million in damages on the Georgian economy, only $80,000 of which he attributed to "simple waste."

In a letter to Halleck from Savannah, Sherman wrote that "this war differs from European wars in this particular: we are not only fighting hostile armies, but a hostile people, and must make old and young, rich and poor, feel the hard hand of war, as well as their organized armies. I know that this recent movement of mine through Georgia has had a wonderful effect in this respect. Thousands who had been deceived by their lying newspapers to believe that we were being whipped all the time now realize the truth, and have no appetite for a repetition of the same experience."

Even before capturing Savannah, Sherman had always intended to join Grant's armies in Virginia via the Carolinas. As the first state to secede from the Union, South Carolina and its planter aristocracy were particularly despised by Sherman and many of his soldiers. "With Savannah in our possession, at some future time if not now, we can punish South Carolina as she deserves," he told Grant on December 17. "I do sincerely believe that the whole United States, North and South, would rejoice to have this army turned loose on South Carolina, to devastate that State in the manner we have done in Georgia." 
23
With its swamps and waterlogged lowlands, nine major rivers and innumerable streams and creeks, South Carolina presented formidable obstacles to an invading army and the state was also better defended. A total of 33,450 Confederate infantry, cavalry, and militia were deployed in South and North Carolina, which included the Army of Tennessee, made up of the remnants of Hood's battered army and Hardee's garrison from Savannah, under the command of Sherman's reinstated adversary Joseph Johnston in addition to cavalry and militia.
Sherman undertook his preparations for what Grant called his "January project" with characteristic thoroughness. His chief quartermaster and commissary officers were ordered to the Union-controlled city of New Bern in North Carolina to oversee a buildup of supplies, and his engineers repaired the stretch of the Atlantic and North Carolina Railroad that was under Union control to ensure that provisions were waiting for his army when it arrived. As in Georgia, Sherman's men were instructed to carry only minimal supplies and live off the land, but this time his officers were deprived of their wall tents and obliged to use the same bivouacs as enlisted men in a campaign that promised to be more explicitly punitive than its predecessor. "The truth is, the whole army is burning with an insatiable desire to wreak vengeance on South Carolina," he wrote to Halleck on Christmas Eve. "I almost tremble at her fate, but feel she deserves all that seems in store for her." 
24
The two wings continued to make their way through the swamps and water channels at an astonishing pace, dragging wagons that sometimes sank in the mud and water and had to be unloaded and reloaded by up to seventy-five men. Once again, Sherman's pioneers and engineers played a vital role in making this rapid progress possible, hacking their way through swamps, laying corduroy roads, and erecting pontoon bridges, as the left wing feinted toward Augusta while the right moved east toward Charleston, which was already blockaded by the Union Navy. This rapid progress astounded Sherman's adversary Joe Johnston, who later wrote that "there had been no such army in existence since the days of Julius Caesar," but it was facilitated by poor judgment by General Beauregard, the overall commander of Confederate forces in the Carolinas. As Major George Nichols, one of Sherman's staff officers, observed, "Beauregard committed the gross error of attempting to defend cities of no strategic importance" instead of using the terrain to his advantage and concentrating his forces along the Salkehatchie River.

As in Georgia, Sherman's orders specified that only houses that had been abandoned were to be burned, but these orders were not always obeyed. "I never saw so much destruction of property before," wrote Charles Wills. "Orders are as strict as ever, but our men understand they are in South Carolina and are making good their old threats. Very few houses escape burning, as almost everybody has run away from before us, you may imagine there is not much left in our track. Where a family remains at home they save their house, but lose their stock, and eatables." 
28
Similar scenes were enacted all along the forty-mile-wide strip that the two wings of Sherman's army passed through. "Where our footsteps pass, fire, ashes, and desolation follow in their path," observed Nichols in his diary. "The sufferings which the people will have to undergo will be most intense. We have left on the wide strip of country we have passed over no provisions which will go any distance in supporting the people," wrote Major Thomas Osborn, Sherman's chief of artillery.

The targeting of cities was always an important component of the Union's hard-war policy, whether because of their significance as industrial centers and transportation hubs or as symbols of Confederate political power. For many Southerners, the most shocking and visible evidence of the war's destructive power was the transformation of towns and cities, which had previously been regarded as symbols of civilized progress and material prosperity, into the ruined "chimneyvilles" that dotted the South. With the advent of photography, Americans were presented with images of urban devastation that would later become so familiar to the twentieth century-hollowed-out roofless buildings, piles of rubble, and protruding chimneys at Charleston, Vicksburg, Richmond, Atlanta, and other cities. When Sherman's army entered Atlanta, the spectacle of destruction shocked even his own soldiers. "I had often heard of the terror of bombardment of a crowded city, but I never realized it before," wrote the Union surgeon J.C. Patton, who observed buildings "torn in every shape that can be imagined," trees cut down and fences destroyed, "in short every kind of mischief done by these iron missiles."

Before the war, Columbia was a prosperous city of some 8,000 residents, half of whom were slaves. With gas lighting and three railroads, it was a city that the celebrated Carolinian diarist Mary Chestnut described as "the place for good living, pleasant people, pleasant dinners, pleasant drives." By the time the city surrendered to Sherman's troops, its population had grown to 24,000, including many evacuees and young women sent from the countryside to what was considered to be a safer environment. Though it contained some factories that had been reconfigured for military purposes, Columbia was essentially an administrative center whose significance to Sherman's army was largely due to its political symbolism as the capital of the "cradle of secession."
The day before entering the city, Sherman told General Oliver Howard to "occupy Columbia, destroy the public buildings, railroad property, manufacturing and machine shops; but [we] will spare libraries, asylums, and private dwellings." He was nevertheless aware that many of his soldiers wanted to go further than this-a sentiment summed up in their reworking of the song "Hail, Columbia," with its refrain "Hail, Columbia, happy land! / If I don't burn you, I'll be damned." The city was already beginning to burn on the morning of February 17, when the local plantation owner General Wade Hampton III ordered his retreating cavalry to set fire to bales of cotton in the street. For the rest of the day, fires continued to spread as Union troops poured into the city and proceeded to burn buildings on their own account. Many soldiers were given alcohol by the local population in a misconceived attempt to pacify their conquerors, but these efforts had the opposite effect.
In the course of the night, much of the city was burned to the ground, as drunken soldiers and freed slaves rampaged through the streets in a wild spree of looting, burning, and vandalism, driving much of the population into the streets. "Streams of pale women, leading their terrified children, with here and there an infant in arms, went by, they knew not whither, amid the fierce flames," wrote Columbia resident Reverend Anthony Toomer Porter. "The streets were filled with soldiers mounted and on foot, in every stage of drunkenness… . Shouts of derision and blasphemy filled the air. Cries of 'There are the aristocrats!' 'Look at the chivalry!' were yelled into the ears of these defenseless women. Men seemed to have lost their manhood, and the mere beast was in the ascendant."

In Carolina as in Georgia, the population was mostly unmoved by appeals from Southern politicians, generals, and newspapermen to wage guerrilla warfare against Sherman's invading army. Nevertheless sixty-four bummers were found dead during the march toward Savannah, and others disappeared, presumably killed by cavalrymen or by local inhabitants. In South Carolina, Confederate cavalrymen executed foragers on sight, sometimes leaving them by the side of the road with their throats cut and a note declaring DEATH TO FORAGERS. In both states, Sherman's columns came under sporadic fire from bushwhackers and sharpshooters, and the absence of more concerted resistance was partly due to the measures that Sherman took to prevent it.
As military governor of Memphis, Sherman was a stern advocate of collective punishment in response to acts of sabotage or sharpshooter attacks on Union steamboats on the Mississippi. On September 23, 1862, a Union packet steamer came under fire from the vicinity of a small town, Randolph, that was under his jurisdiction. In response Sherman ordered Colonel Charles C. Walcutt, commander of the Forty-Sixth Ohio Infantry Regiment, to burn the town. Walcutt carried out these orders so well that Sherman was able to inform Grant afterward with his usual brusqueness in such matters, "The regiment has returned and Randolph is gone." Sherman's marching orders in Atlanta instructed his officers to inflict "a devastation more or less relentless" in response to acts of resistance or sabotage, and these orders were carried out on various occasions. In one incident, Sherman ordered the destruction of a farm at Buffalo Creek near Milledgeville in retaliation for the burning of a nearby bridge. When Henry Hitchcock suggested that it was unfair to punish someone who might not have been responsible, Sherman replied that individual responsibility was not the issue. "If they find that burning bridges only destroys their own citizens' houses, they'll stop it… . In war everything is right that prevents anything."

Sherman was particularly outraged by the Confederate tactic of burying shells or "torpedoes" as mines along the roads or along railroad tracks. In his memoirs, he describes how he came across "a handsome young officer, whose foot had been blown to pieces by a torpedo planted in the road," waiting for a surgeon to amputate his leg at the knee along the road to Savannah. "There had been no resistance at that point, nothing to give warning of danger, and the rebels had planted eight-inch shells in the road, with friction-matches to explode them by being trodden on," Sherman recalled. "This was not war, but murder, and it made me very angry." 
47
In the event, none of the prisoners was killed. Looking back on this episode, Sherman declared, "Prisoners should be protected, but mercy is not a legitimate attribute of war. Men go to war to kill or be killed if necessary and should expect no tenderness… . But it was, I think, a much better show of tenderness for me to have the enemy do this work than to subject my own soldiers to so frightful a risk." This indignation ignored the fact that he himself sometimes ordered his soldiers to pile branches on top of bent railroad ties to conceal shells that would blow up anyone trying to retrieve them. If Sherman was not always morally consistent, neither was he as implacable as he was sometimes depicted. In Sandersville, Georgia, he watched Confederate cavalry set fire to stacks of fodder just outside the town and use civilian buildings for cover during their retreat. Even though these actions breached the rules that he had imposed, he did not inflict "general devastation" on the town and told a preacher who pleaded on behalf of the female population and their families, "I don't make war on women and children." For the most part, Sherman's resort to collective punishment and reprisals in response to irregular warfare was focused, selective, and pragmatic, geared toward the achievement of his military objectives and the security of his troops.
This pragmatism was also evident in his use of physical destruction as an instrument of pacification and subjugation. On March 7, the advance units of the Twentieth Corps crossed the state line into North Carolina, and the bulk of Sherman's army followed the next day. Some of the worst environmental destruction of the campaign took place in North Carolina, as soldiers set fire to the pine forests and resin pits that formed the basis of South Carolina's turpentine and tar industry, causing huge fires that illuminated their progress, till one Union stretcher bearer described how Sherman's army was visible at night only "by glimpses under the smoke and muffled by the Niagara-like roar of the flames as they licked turpentine and pitch." Sherman's soldiers were generally more restrained in North Carolina, the last state to join the rebellion, than they had been in South Carolina, and Sherman made more effort to restrain them, especially as it became clearer that the war was coming to an end. On February 2, Union troops captured Wilmington, depriving the Confederacy of its last port. On March 11, Sherman's army reached Fayetteville, where it proceeded to destroy the Confederate arsenal, various foundries, and the offices and paper mills of the town's three newspapers. After pausing to reoutfit his troops and evacuate the wounded soldiers and slaves who had joined his army, Sherman took his army over the Cape Fear River on pontoon bridges and continued its inexorable advance.
Once again Sherman confused the Confederate defenders, sending four light divisions toward the state capital, Raleigh, in the northwest while the bulk of his army converged in two separate wings on Goldsboro, which was defended by the remnants of Joseph Johnston's Army of Tennessee and other Confederate units. On March 19, Johnston's forces sallied out of Goldsboro and attacked Slocum's left wing near the town of Bentonville. A three-day battle produced the bloodiest fighting since Sherman's army had left Atlanta, before Johnston's army was driven back at the cost of 2,600 casualties. Sherman called off a follow-up attack by General Joseph Mower's brigade that might have captured Johnston's entire army, but this error, if such it was, soon became irrelevant as Sherman's forces entered Goldsboro on March 23 without resistance, where it joined Schofield's Army of the Ohio to form a combined force of 90,000 men.
With Union armies tearing through its territory from multiple directions, the Confederacy was now close to collapse. On March 22, Major General James Harrison Wilson, the twenty-three-year-old chief of cavalry in Sherman's Military Division of the Mississippi, led 13,480 cavalrymen on a 525-mile raid into Georgia, capturing the cities of Columbus and Macon and destroying their factories, arsenals, railroads, and rolling stock.

For a conquered population in wartime, the first sight of an invading or occupying army in their streets and cities provides definitive proof of its own defeat and the overwhelming power of the victors. In August 1914, many Belgians heard the advancing German army long before they saw it, through the rhythmic pounding of hobnailed boots on the roads. The American journalist Richard Harding Davis described the arrival of the first German units in Brussels as "something uncanny, inhuman, a force of nature like a landslide, a tidal wave, or lava sweeping down a mountain."

Many Southerners regarded the "Yankee ruffians" and "Yankee Vandals" who marched through their previously inviolable heartlands as a foreign army. In 1861 the Raleigh Banner described Lincoln's armies as "the sewers of the cities-the degraded, beastly outscourings of all quarters of the world."

Most civilians encountered Sherman's army for less than twenty-four hours, but the meeting was often a harrowing ordeal, as a seemingly endless line of soldiers marched past and often into their homes, stripping them of the food and possessions that their predecessors had not taken. "Like demons they run in!" wrote Dolly Sumner Lunt Burge, a New England native and widow of a Southern husband, about Union soldiers at her plantation near Covington, Georgia. "My yards are full. To my smoke-house, my dairy, pantry, kitchen, and cellar, like famished wolves they come, breaking locks and whatever is in their way." By the time the last remnants of Sherman's army had left the next day, Lunt Burge claimed to have been left "poorer by thirty thousand dollars than I was yesterday morning. And a much stronger Rebel!"

Rich plantations were always more likely to suffer such depredations, but poverty did not guarantee immunity. Union soldiers were often shocked at the primitive living conditions of the Southern "white trash" they encountered. Nevertheless foragers stripped even the humblest farms and shacks and sometimes burned them, particularly in South Carolina. Nor was age always respected. Sherman had declared his intention to make "old and young" feel the weight of war, and elderly people were sometimes selected for special treatment because of their vulnerability, rather than in spite of it. Caroline Ravenel, a resident of Anderson, South Carolina, described how soldiers threatened to hang her grandmother if she did not reveal where her family had concealed its valuables, and went on to hang her sixty-year-old uncle from his bedstead, pulling him up and down various times before beating him with a shovel in an attempt to make him talk.

On February 22, 1865, soldiers sacked Otranto Plantation, part of modern Berkeley County, in South Carolina. The plantation was occupied by an entirely female household consisting of Mrs. Louise Porcher, her two daughters and two aunts, and their servants. One of Mrs. Porcher's daughters watched soldiers sack the house and outbuildings, driving off and killing livestock. "It was awful to hear the screams of cattle and hogs as they were chased and bayoneted, and the scatter and terror of the sheep was terrible to see," she later remembered. "Even my pet calf … was killed; and dear old Aaron, our house cat, was cruelly run through with a bayonet, right before my eyes." 
11
Such episodes cannot be attributed entirely to out-of-control soldiers acting on their own behalf. Sherman's strategy of intimidation was intended to break the morale of the Southern population, and to that end the horrors were often specifically directed against the white female population. A ghoulish caricature in Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper on May 17, 1862, entitled "The Rebel Lady's Boudoir" shows a wealthy Southern woman reading a letter from her soldier husband in a room decorated with the skulls and bones of Union soldiers. Union soldiers in the South often commented on the hostility they encountered from females. Sherman himself, despite his fondness for Southern women in his prewar military postings, was no exception. "I doubt if history affords a parallel to the deep and bitter enmity of the women of the South," he wrote to his wife from Vicksburg in June 1863. "No one who sees them and hears them but must feel the intensity of their hate." 
12
13
The Southern press also regarded the female population as a military asset and frequently exhorted the "women of the South" to use their influence to send more men to the front and stem the rate of desertions. Female support for the war was expressed through Ladies Aid societies and Soldiers' Relief or Ladies Clothing associations, which made socks and uniforms for soldiers or prepared food parcels for them. When the Union Army invaded and occupied the South, its soldiers were frequently shocked at the extent of female hostility, as women spat at and insulted occupying troops, refused to walk under the Union flag, or threw stones and even fired on the invaders. Retreating through the town of Winchester, Virginia, in June 1862, one Massachusetts officer reported that women "fired at us from windows and then hand grenades and bottles of fulminating powder and hot water and even chamber pots were used as missiles." In New Orleans in 1862, General Benjamin "Beast" Butler outraged Southerners when he issued General Orders No. 28, which declared that any woman who spat at or insulted his troops would be treated as "a woman of the town plying her avocation," i.e., as a prostitute.
Sherman's army often encountered such hostility during its marches. In Georgia, one divisional commander and his staff were insulted by women using "language which no well bred ladies use." At Milledgeville a woman threw a stone at passing soldiers from a second-story window. Other women openly berated soldiers as they passed. The twentysix-year-old Charlestonian Emma Holmes, who was working as a governess on a South Carolina plantation when Sherman's army arrived, harangued soldiers for the best part of an hour on the iniquities of making war on women and children, and proudly related afterward that one admiring officer had called her "the best rebel he had ever met." Union soldiers were often amused by such behavior and sometimes deliberately provoked rebel women to "hear them roar," as one soldier put it.
Others were angered by it and locked some of the more vocal "secesh" women in cupboards or cellars to shut them up. One woman who shouted at a group of foragers was dumped in a barrel of molasses. In South Carolina, General Smith D. Atkins told a female house owner, "We shall soon see the women of South Carolina as those of Georgia with tears in their eyes begging crusts from our men for their famishing children. O it was glorious to see such a sight … you women keep up this war. We are fighting you." 
14
Many women in Georgia and the Carolinas had already experienced the "hard hand of war" indirectly, long before Sherman's soldiers arrived on their doorsteps, and some had lost their earlier enthusiasm for it. In her diary, Mary Boykin Chestnut describes how her enthusiasm for the Confederate cause was tempered by her growing depression and despondency at the growing numbers of men who came back wounded or not at all and by her horror at the sight of wounded Confederate veterans in local hospitals.

Such sentiments have often provided a context for sexual violence. In a society where (white) female honor and purity were sacrosanct, the prospect of mass rape by Yankee "mudsills" was a persistent theme in the Southern press. In November 1864, the Macon Telegraph urged Southern men to "hasten to the front … to die for home, altars and female purity" and prevent Sherman's army from "subjecting our wives, daughters and sisters, to the brutal lusts of an infidel, coarse, and fiendish horde." 
18
Much of this was rumor and fabrication. Sherman later claimed that there were only two reported cases of rape, one of which took place at Winnsboro, South Carolina, on February 27, 1865, when a black woman was raped by two soldiers of the Thirty-Eighth Ohio Volunteers, who were court-martialed and sentenced to ten and four years' hard labor. In another incident in South Carolina, Sergeant Arthur McCarty of the Seventy-Eighth Ohio Regiment was court-martialed for the rape of a girl near Bennettsville and drummed out of the army. There were other cases that Sherman may or may not have been aware of. At Milledgeville, Mrs. Kate Latimer Nichols, the twenty-seven-year-old wife of a Confederate captain, was raped by two soldiers while lying sick in bed and later died in a mental institution. At Aiken in South Carolina, a detachment of Wheeler's cavalrymen were told by a weeping Baptist minister that a group of Union soldiers had just raped his daughter. Wheeler's men caught seven of the men responsible and cut their throats, leaving them with a sign that read THESE ARE THE SEVEN.
There were numerous testimonies of rape carried out by Union soldiers during the calamitous occupation of Columbia. Daniel Trezevant described how soldiers broke into the home of a Mrs. Thomas B. Clarkson Jr. and "forced her to the floor for the purpose of sensual enjoyment" before raping her maid instead.

Nor were relations between the army and the white female population always so acrimonious. In many cases, Sherman's officers responded positively to requests from women to guard their homes, and some soldiers spontaneously offered to protect their property from their own comrades. In South Carolina, one soldier nearly died when an elderly woman begged him to save furniture and a photograph of her husband from the house that the army had just burned. A Mrs. Alfred P. Aldrich described how a soldier threatened to burn down her house at Barnwell unless she told him where her silver was, only to be stopped by a Union officer who "repeatedly expressed his disapprobation of war, and his sorrow for what was going on around him" and ordered the soldier to "let the lady alone."

Sherman's soldiers often expressed their amazement and disgust at the "ugliness" of rural white women, and were appalled by their propensity for swearing and their unladylike habit of chewing tobacco. But many of Sherman's battle-hardened soldiers also admired the "pretty smart pieces" they encountered during the march, finding their elegance and femininity a pleasing contrast to the brutal campaigns they had endured, a reminder of the female world of wives, mothers, and sisters that they had left behind them. Some formed temporary and even permanent relationships with white women and married them after the war. Such events do not belong to the image of Sherman's march depicted in Gone with the Wind, when Scarlett O'Hara shoots a lascivious Union intruder on her stairwell. But for all their anger toward the "hostile people" and the women whom some soldiers blamed for the war, Sherman's army remained for the most part a controlled and disciplined army, whose treatment of women was in keeping with the moral conventions of nineteenthcentury society. Such an army might be willing to chop up pianos, raid smokehouses, and steal cows and chickens, but it generally stopped short of resorting to sexual violence either as a right of conquest or as a weapon of war.
Southern condemnations of Sherman's "Vandal army" were often reinforced by the many instances of vandalism and destruction of private libraries and scientific laboratories carried out by Sherman's soldiers. Descriptions of soldiers trampling on books at the Milledgeville statehouse or making bonfires of books on South Carolina plantations support a wider depiction of the Civil War as a confrontation between a refined, cultured, and lettered Southern civilization and the materialistic, utilitarian North. But there was always another side to this "civilization," which tended to be ignored in subsequent Southern condemnations of Sherman's march. On December 4, the pious Grace Elmore passed the prisoner-of-war compound of Camp Sorghum, near Columbia, on the way to a classical music recital and recorded her pleasure on witnessing "one fellow riding a rail and another bucked and gagged, hoped they were native born Yankees and not poor foreigners."

23
For tens of thousands of slaves, Sherman's army brought freedom, or at least the possibility of it, from this world of whippings, bloodhounds, lynchings, violence, and terror on which the Southern social order depended. Even before Sherman's army reached them, plantation owners were uncomfortably conscious that the "breath of Emancipation" had reached their slaves, and some owners removed "bad negroes" to more distant plantations to prevent them from trying to escape to the Union lines. Some slaves, particularly house servants, remained loyal to their masters and mistresses and suffered at the hands of Sherman's army, but many recognized the opportunity presented to them and seized it. At Madison, a slave owner pleaded with an elderly black couple not to leave the plantation with the Union Army on the grounds that he had always treated them kindly. The couple agreed that he had, but nevertheless explained, "We must go, freedom is as sweet to us as it is for you." 
24
25
In February, Sherman's army reached the sumptuous Manigault plantation of Middleton Place, near Charleston, where slaves broke open the vaults of the family graveyard and scattered the bones about the landscaped grounds, while soldiers burned the mansion and destroyed its library and gardens in what Gabriel Manigault called an act of "Gothic barbarity." Manigault's father, Charles, was appalled at what he regarded as the disloyalty of his slaves when Sherman's army reached two more Manigault plantations, New Hope and Silk Mill, near Charleston, and slaves seized family portraits and paintings from the plantation house and nailed them to the walls of their own quarters or left them in the rain, "to shew their hatred of their former master & all his family." 
26
Many slaves saw the arrival of the Union army as the fulfillment of the biblical Day of Jubilation, the Jubilee promised in Leviticus 25: 8-13, where God exhorts the Israelites every fiftieth year to "proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family." Sherman had mixed feelings about this reception. His own attitudes toward slavery were strongly imbued with white supremacism. "All the Congresses on earth can't make the negro anything else than what he is; he must be subject to the white man, or he must amalgamate or he must be destroyed," he told his wife on July 11, 1860. 
27
The attitudes of Sherman's soldiers toward the slaves were a microcosm of the Union itself. Some soldiers were passively or actively racist, like the German soldier who told a Southern woman near Atlanta, "Fight for the nigger! I'd see 'em in de bottom of a swamp before I'd fight for 'em." Two or three black soldiers were killed by Union soldiers in Savannah. At Robertsville, South Carolina, a white resident reported that Sherman's bummers were murdering black men driving wagons on the roads and seizing their loads.
According to Conyngham, many other freed slaves "died in the bayous and lagoons of Georgia" of hunger because "when food was getting scarce, we turned them adrift, to support ourselves or perish." 
28
Davis was a notorious racist, who once described the refugee columns as "useless creatures … encumbering the trains and devouring the subsistence along the line of march so needed for our soldiers." 
29
In effect, Sherman's army inadvertently became an instrument of the social revolution that Lincoln's proclamation had authorized. On January 16, 1865, Sherman co-wrote Special Field Order No. 15 in Savannah with Lincoln's secretary of war Edwin Stanton, which set aside four hundred thousand acres of coastal land in South Carolina and Florida for freed slaves to settle and cultivate as they pleased. This policy of "forty acres and a mule," as it came to be known, was undertaken largely as a temporary measure, in order to reduce the numbers of slaves accompanying Sherman's army, but the dispensation of white-owned land to freed blacks in the South was nevertheless an extraordinarily radical gesture in its context, which Michael Fellman has called "the single most revolutionary act in race relations during the Civil War." 
30
Not surprisingly, Sherman was highly regarded by Southern blacks. Presented by Stanton with stories circulating in Washington that he was racist and discriminatory, Sherman summoned a deputation of leading black dignitaries to testify on his behalf, all of whom spoke in his favor. In The Souls of Black Folk, W.E.B Du Bois looked back on the "Conqueror, the Conquered, and the Negro" as the three essential components of Sherman's "raid through Georgia" and concluded, "Some see all significance in the grim front of the destroyer, and some in the bitter sufferers of the Lost Cause. But to me neither soldier nor fugitive speaks with so deep a meaning as that dark human cloud that clung like remorse on the rear of those swift columns, swelling at times to half their size, almost engulfing and choking them."

In The Trojan Women, Euripides denounces the victorious "spear-carrying Greeks" as barbarians because of their vindictive treatment of women and children after the Trojan armies have been defeated. Both during and after the Civil War, Sherman was also denounced by Southerners as a coward and a barbarian who made war against "defenseless women and children." On the one hand, Sherman's campaign was seen as an expression of brutal and brutish Yankee warfare, which violated the chivalrous "Celtic" warrior code that supposedly defined the Southern military tradition. At the same time, the campaign was depicted as a retrograde anachronism, an accusation that was often accompanied by references to the "Vandal Sherman" and historical comparisons between his army and the Goths, the Thirty Years War, the French Army in the Palatinate, or the "savage" warfare of the American West.
When the Reverend William W. Lord pleaded with Sherman not to "burn and pillage" the town of Winnsboro in South Carolina on the grounds that it "sheltered only helpless women and children," Sherman testily replied, "Burn and pillage be damned! My soldiers may do as they please!"-to which the reverend responded that this was "an eleventhcentury answer to a nineteenth-century appeal." 
32
33
The idea that Sherman's campaigns represented a form of moral atavism reflected a widespread assumption that warfare between "civilized nations" had undergone a process of moral advancement in the nineteenth century, regarding the protection of civilians and noncombatants. Such preoccupations were not new. The "laws on truces and peace" drawn up by Pope Gregory IX in the thirteenth century included pilgrims, monks, peasants, and the "naturally weak"-women, children, widows, orphans, and their animals, goods, and lands-among those who merited such protection. Emmerich de Vattel's hugely influential The Law of Nations; or, the Principles of Natural Law (1758) states, "Women, children, feeble old men, and sick persons, come under the description of enemies, and so we have certain rights over them, inasmuch as they belong to the nation with whom we are at war, … but these are enemies that make no resistance; and consequently, we have no right to maltreat their persons or use any violence against them, much less to take away their lives." 
34
Much of what Sherman's army did in Georgia and the Carolinas fell within these parameters, or at least it was possible to argue that it did. Had the Union lost the war, Sherman might well have been put on trial for war crimes, and he might have cited Lieber in his defense. His lawyers could have argued that most of the destruction carried out by his army was not "wanton" but was directed at military resources, communications, and matériel of potential use to the enemy. They might have cited Article 17, which declared that "war is not carried on by arms alone" and that it could therefore be lawful in certain circumstances "to starve the hostile belligerent, armed or unarmed, so that it leads to the speedier subjection of the enemy." They could have argued that his army needed to take food from the population in order to survive and also to prevent it from being exported to Confederate armies, that many of the more extreme actions carried out by his soldiers were in contravention of Sherman's orders, and that the burning of Columbia was not his decision and that he tried to prevent it.
Even if this hypothetical court ruled that what Sherman's army did was legal, it is difficult to imagine that it would have ruled that it was moral or even that Sherman would have offered such a defense. He might have argued, as he often did, that the rules, laws, and moral codes that regulated civilian society in peacetime were not necessarily the same as those prevailing in war and that the actions of his army in Georgia and the Carolinas were not designed "to meet the humanities of the case." Sherman might also have reminded his accusers that Confederate bushwhackers fired on passenger trains and steamboats and killed or beat up Union loyalists and burned their homes. He might have mentioned Chambersburg or Lawrence. Sherman could also have quoted the Confederate "Gray Ghost," J. Singleton Mosby, who justified shelling Union trains even when they had women and children aboard on the grounds that he "did not understand that it hurts women and children to be killed any more than it hurts men." 
35
36
The Citizen Army Southerners often described Sherman's army as a rabble, a mob, whose behavior was sometimes attributed to the numbers of soldiers from the urban slums in its ranks. But the Army of the West included men from a variety of social backgrounds, from comfortable New England middle-class families and recently arrived German immigrants who barely spoke English to Midwestern farm boys and East Coast Irishmen. By the time they reached Atlanta, many of them had already fought and marched for more than a thousand miles, in some cases without boots or shoes, barefoot or with their feet wrapped in cloth and gunnysacks. They were tough, supremely fit, and imbued with a strong sense of their own invincibility and the infallibility of their commander, and also with an egalitarian spirit that owed much to the fact that more than 50 percent of captains and 90 percent of lieutenants had once served as enlisted men.
Observers commented on the motley appearance of Sherman's army. Their puttogether Confederate and Union uniforms, sometimes with mixed boots, top hats, and even women's bonnets, contrasted strikingly with the scrupulously well-turned-out Eastern armies. In Beaufort, South Carolina, one observer described Sherman's "western marauders … strange, rough-looking, unshaven, and badly dressed: they seem like a gang of coal-heavers" and "roaring out songs and jokes, making sharp comments on all the tidy civilians, and over-flowing with merriment and good-nature."

It is doubtful whether these cheering crowds cared very much whether the actions of Sherman's citizen army were in accordance with the usages of war or the morality of making war on civilians. To most of those present, victory negated the need for such questions, and to many it seemed that Sherman had saved the Union by defeating its enemies, not with a battle but with a march.
There is no doubt that Sherman's campaign was a formidable military achievement, in terms of its logistics, organization, leadership, and the determination and collective willpower that made it possible. In six months, an army of sixty thousand marched through some seven hundred miles of hostile territory, wading through or building pontoon bridges across innumerable streams, swamps, and flooded major rivers, corduroying muddy roads and tracks with a relentless efficiency that astounded its opponents. For much of that time, Sherman's army was entirely cut off from its line of supply and dependent for its survival on what it could take from the land and people along the route. Throughout these campaigns, its lines produced few stragglers and never lost their shape or coherence, despite marching in two separate wings for most of the time. The Confederates were powerless to stop its progress.
The strategic impact of these campaigns is more debatable. In a valedictory speech to the Army of the Tennessee on September 30, 1875, Sherman told his listeners, "The consequences of this march were felt all over the country. All acknowledged that when Savannah should be taken the road to Richmond was clear, and that the war was at an end… . Certain it is that this march was great in its conception and in its execution grand -that the blow was struck at the right moment and in the right direction."

Others have similarly hailed the symbolic and psychological impact of Sherman's campaigns. "The moral effect of this march … [through Georgia] was greater than would have been the most decided victory," declared the Confederate general Edward Porter Alexander.

Lee also commented on the absence of "the boldness and decision which formerly characterized" the defenders of Richmond-a development that he attributed to "the communication received from the men from their homes urging their return and abandonment of the field." 
8
It is also true that the presence of Sherman's army in North Carolina blocked any possibility of a southern escape route for Lee's army when Grant broke his line at Petersburg. The Confederacy conceivably might have dissolved its conventional forces and organized a campaign of guerrilla warfare in the spring of 1865, but this would have required a willingness to fight on, which was conspicuously absent. Sherman's contribution to this demoralization is also open to question. The fact that so few Georgians responded to the exhortations from Confederate generals and politicians to wage a Russian-style partisan war suggests that the appetite for resistance was already minimal.
Even before the army left Atlanta, the state governor, Joseph Brown, was in negotiations with Sherman about the possibility of withdrawing the state from the rebellion, and the ease with which Sherman's forces sliced through Georgia and captured Savannah certainly did not encourage resistance in the Carolinas.
Sherman's reference to the timing is significant. After nearly four years of brutal warfare, his campaign clearly had an impact very different from the one it might have had if such a strategy had been carried out earlier. Ultimately the extent to which his campaigns actually contributed to the military collapse of the Confederacy must remain something of an open question. However, the stature of Sherman's campaigns as an iconic episode in American military history is due not only to what they actually achieved, but also to what they were believed to have achieved-and even more to the persuasive idea they gave rise to, that in certain circumstances, civilian society could be legitimately targeted and punished in order to achieve both military and broader psychological and political effects. These campaigns cannot be understood or assessed only in terms of their contribution to the end of the war. For Sherman, destruction was always a calibrated and pragmatic measure that could be intensified or reduced in order to achieve strategic objectives that were not limited to the war itself, but were also concerned with what came afterward.
In 1903 Sherman was honored with an equestrian statue created by the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-Ninth Street in New York, which bears its subject's observation that THE LEGITIMATE OBJECT OF WAR IS A MORE PERFECT PEACE. Visiting the monument soon afterward, the novelist Henry James was unimpressed, considering it a "perversity" and "ambiguity" that failed to capture the "Sherman of the terrible march" and the "misery, the ruin, and vengeance of his track."

Sherman later claimed that this agreement was in keeping with Lincoln's own intentions, but its de facto guarantee of the right of slavery shocked many members of his administration, particularly Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, who assumed temporary control of the government following Lincoln's assassination. To Sherman's Republican critics, his agreement with Johnston constituted an illegitimate intervention into politics by a military commander, which reflected his own pro-Southern sentiments. Though Stanton and some Northern newspapers suggested that Sherman harbored dictatorial ambitions, the most likely explanation for his political largesse was his desire to end the war without provoking his defeated opponents into a guerrilla campaign, coupled with an overweening self-confidence that made him believe he was able to do anything he wanted. Whatever Sherman's motives, there is some irony in the fact that the man suspected of treason by Northerners would later be more despised by Southerners than any other Union general. Even his staunch friend Grant believed that Sherman had gone beyond his authority, and on April 24 he traveled to Raleigh and ordered him to reopen negotiations. Two days later, Sherman and Johnston met again at Bennett Place, and Johnston agreed to a strictly military surrender without the previous political guarantees. This agreement satisfied Sherman, who told his wife, "The mass of the people south will never trouble us again. They have suffered terrifically, and I now feel disposed to befriend them-of course not the leaders and lawyers, but the armies who have fought and manifested their sincerity though misled by risking their persons."

In 1866, the English baronet and future Conservative politician Sir John Kennaway (1837-1919) visited Georgia and South Carolina with a party of Oxbridge students as part of an educational tour to observe the effects of the Civil War. Traveling by train from Chattanooga to Atlanta, Kennaway observed "stations destroyed or gutted all along the line and charred ruins met the gaze wherever human habitations had been." 
14
Traveling in a windowless train through central Georgia, Kennaway concluded through conversations with fellow passengers and his own observations of the postwar devastation still visible along the route of the railroad that the state was a shadow of its prewar prosperity, whose "country is devastated, its stock destroyed, its currency worthless. Labor is scarce and crops scanty; and above all, a moral depression hangs over the soil, and seems for a time to forbid exertion." South Carolina presented a similar picture of desolation. On June 1, 1865, Mary Chestnut wrote of "three days of travel, over a road that had been laid bare by Sherman's torches. Nothing but smoking ruins was left in Sherman's track. That I saw with my own eyes. No living thing was left, no house for man or beast." Returning to her home in Charleston from Greenville at the end of 1865, the novelist Caroline Howard Gilman wrote of "Sherman's Desolation," in which "Scarcely a farm house, not an elegant and hospitable plantation residence on the way, all ruin, ruin; and in Columbia the last rays of twilight were on the ruins."

Georgians and Carolinians were also fed by Union soldiers, who sometimes distributed rations to the same communities they had so recently wrecked. In May 1865, Brigadier General E.F. Winslow estimated that 25,000 to 50,000 destitute people had been fed by his soldiers in and around Atlanta, some of whom walked forty miles to get food. Between January and April 1866, the newly created Freedmen's Bureau distributed food to destitute blacks and whites in Georgia and South Carolina. Although the population did not starve, there was nevertheless considerable distress and hardship in both states. One Savannah landowner claimed that it would be easier "to go into the wild wilderness and clear the forest than attempt the reclamation of my lands." In May 1865, the Episcopal Diocesan Records at Orangeburg reported that "most of the few who were well off among his parishioners are now poor; that widows and orphans, who had saved a little from the wreck of their property in the low country, are stripped of that little, and that defenseless females were living on the scraps left by those who had taken from them their supplies for domestic use." Writing in March 1866, the poet Henry Timrod (1828-67), who lost his source of income when the newspaper office of the South Carolinian was destroyed during Sherman's capture of Columbia, told a friend, "You ask me to tell you my story for the last year. I can embody it all in a few words: beggary, starvation, death, bitter grief, utter want of hope!"

In The Art of War, Antoine de Jomini warned that wars involving "the occupation or conquest of a country whose people are all in arms" rarely produce positive outcomes. Such occupations require an army to "make a display of a mass of troops proportional to the obstacles and resistance likely to be encountered, calm the popular passions in every possible way, exhaust them by time and patience, display courtesy, gentleness, and severity united, and particularly, deal justly." 
20
In the aftermath of the Civil War, much of the South was placed under military occupation, but the rapid demobilization of the Union Army soon reduced the overall military presence in the former Confederate states to only six thousand soldiers, which soon proved singularly inadequate in dealing with a turbulent and often openly seditious white population that was determined to reassert its dominance over the freed blacks. Responsibility for defending black lives and property and managing the incorporation of some 4 million former slaves into the new political and economic order fell primarily to the newly formed Freedmen's Bureau, under the direction of Sherman's former subordinate General Oliver Otis Howard. Inadequately staffed and funded and with little support from Lincoln's successor, President Andrew Johnson, Howard's organization struggled to cope with the complex challenges of enforcing black civil rights as reconstructed state governments sought to reimpose the prewar racist order in a new form.
No sooner had the war ended than many Southern states imposed stringent vagrancy laws and black codes in an attempt to force freed slaves to remain on the plantations. 
21
In the immediate postwar period, the federal government was either passive or complicit in this process. In September 1865, President Johnson rescinded Sherman's "forty acres and a mule" policy, and the abolitionist Howard was given the bitter task of informing its beneficiaries in South Carolina that their lands were to be returned to their former white owners. Johnson's reversal was a concession to an emerging counterrevolution in the South that increasingly resembled a covert insurgency. In a report to President Johnson from South Carolina that year, Major General Carl Schurz described a level of "aversion and resentment" toward the army and the North throughout the South that resulted from "the animosities inflamed by a four years' war, and its distressing incidents." Schurz also cited a report from one of his officers at Winnsboro, South Carolina, on July 19, which noted, "The spirit of the people, especially in those districts not subject to the salutary influence of General Sherman's army, is that of concealed and, in some instances, of open hostility… . A spirit of bitterness and persecution manifests itself toward the negroes. They are shot and abused outside the immediate protection of our forces by men who announce their determination to take the law into their own hands, in defiance of our authority." 
22
In Georgia, the Freedmen's Bureau reported 336 cases of murder or attempted murder of freedmen between January 1 and November 15, 1868. In October 1870, a mob of 2,500 armed whites drove 150 blacks from their homes in Laurens County, South Carolina, killing nine Republicans. Torchlight parades, the white cassocks of the Ku Klux Klan, drums and military displays, and exemplary public killings were all part of the pageantry of terror that white "Redeemers" imposed on the South. In South Carolina, Sherman's former adversary Wade Hampton commanded a Red Shirt militia with some thirty thousand armed members, many of whose units were led by former Confederate officers. In 1871 Ulysses Grant declared a number of districts in South Carolina to be in a "state of rebellion" and enacted the Third Enforcement Act, known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, which empowered the army to carry out mass arrests of Klan members.
The subsequent trials succeeded in curbing Klan activity temporarily in some parts of the state. In 1877, however, the last occupying troops left the South, a triumph for the racist order that would keep Southern blacks disenfranchised for nearly a century. In 1919, the British journalist and World War I veteran Stephen Graham followed the route of Sherman's march through Georgia, where he found former slaves living in conditions that were "poorer and barer than the average you would see in Russia." 
23
Sherman had little involvement with these developments. Though he did not favor a permanent army of occupation in the South and was personally opposed to giving voting rights to blacks, his attention was mostly focused elsewhere. In 1865 he was appointed commander of the newly created Military Division of the Missouri, with a much reduced force of six thousand soldiers tasked with protecting settlers from "hostile" Indians on the Western frontier and overseeing the completion of the transcontinental railroad network. Sherman had once described the Civil War as a "big Indian war," and his new command coincided with a period of renewed resistance to white settlement from the Indian tribes on the Great Plains and a new federal policy of forced assimilation.
The destroyer of Southern railroads took a keen personal interest in the Union Pacific Railroad, personally reconnoitering routes through the Rocky Mountains and assigning troops to protect its workers, many of whom included veterans from his campaigns in the Deep South. Sherman's attitudes toward Native Americans were infused with a strong streak of racial Darwinism. Though he respected their bravery and recognized that they had legitimate grievances regarding their treatment by the government and white society, he regarded them as primitives and an impediment to progress and civilization. "The more I see of these Indians the more convinced I am that they all have to be killed or maintained as a species of paupers," Sherman wrote to his brother in 1868. "Their attempts at civilization are simply ridiculous." 
24
25
As was often the case with Sherman, this strategy had a dual military and political purpose. With few troops at his disposal and faced with small bands of mounted warriors who specialized in rapid hit-and-run raids in a vast territory with limitless possibilities for escape, winter campaigning was a cost-effective alternative to allowing "fifty hostile Indians to checkmate three thousand soldiers." At the same time, the destruction of their food supplies would target the whole population and facilitate the government's assimilationist policy by driving Indians back into reservations. Sherman's indispensable lieutenant during these campaigns was the bulldoggish Philip Sheridan, who commanded the Department of the Platte.
In the winter of 1868, U.S. Cavalry units attacked the Southern Cheyenne, the Kiowa, the Arapaho, and the Comanche in northern Texas and Oklahoma, burning their camps and destroying or seizing their ponies and food supplies. One of their commanders was the Civil War hero Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer, who was ordered by Sherman to attack hostile tribes along the Washita River in order to "destroy their villages and ponies, to kill or hang all warriors, and bring back all women and children." On November 26, Custer led 720 men from the Seventh Cavalry in a dawn attack on the snowbound camp of fifty-eight lodges led by the friendly Cheyenne chieftain Black Kettle on the Washita River. In a battle that quickly turned into a rout, Custer's men killed over a hundred Indians, including Black Kettle and his wife. The majority of the dead were not armed warriors, but women and young children, most of whom, according to the writer and anthropologist George Bird Grinnell, a student of the Cheyenne, "were shot while hiding in the brush or trying to run away through it."

Throughout the winter of 1876-77, cavalry columns systematically pursued a policy of starvation against the Sioux and Cheyenne, burning their camps and seizing their supplies of dried buffalo meat, their ponies, and their buffalo robes, leaving their destitute inhabitants exposed in the mountains in below-zero temperatures. By May 1877, most of the Indians had come into the reservations. Despite sporadic resistance to white settlement over the coming years, the defeat of the Sioux effectively marked the end of America's long conquest of the Native American population.
Sherman regarded his contribution to the settlement of the West as one of his greatest achievements. "I have been travelling, in three months, in beautiful cars abundantly provided with every comfort, over an extent of more than ten thousand miles of country, every mile of which is free from the danger of the savage and is being occupied by industrious families," he wrote to his wife in 1883, during his last official trip to the West. "Every day I am reminded of little things done, or words spoken which have borne fruit. I honestly believe in this way I have done more good for our country and for the human race than I did in the Civil War."

On February 14, 1891, just after his seventy-first birthday, Sherman collapsed in his rocking chair while rereading Great Expectations and died shortly afterward. More than thirty thousand soldiers and veterans accompanied his coffin to the train in New York that took it to Saint Louis. There another twelve thousand veterans, soldiers, and local dignitaries accompanied his body on a seven-mile procession from the station to the Calvary Cemetery, where his son Tom read the funeral oration. In this way, America said farewell to the soldier who, in the words of the poet and Civil War veteran Richard Watson Gilder, "fought for freedom, not glory; made war that war might cease."

The memory of the Civil War looms large in the American wars of the twentieth century. Generations of officers absorbed tactics and strategies during "staff rides" to Civil War battlefields and studied Stonewall Jackson's Valley Campaign, Grant's turning movement at Vicksburg, and Lee's audacious division of his army during the Seven Days Battles. The great Civil War commanders provided moral, tactical, and strategic inspiration to a succession of generals from Pershing, Patton, and MacArthur to "Stormin' Norman" Schwarzkopf and Tommy Franks.
During the First Gulf War, General Schwarzkopf made Grant's memoirs his bedside reading and placed on his desk a Sherman quotation: "War is the remedy our enemies have chosen, and I say let's give them all they want." General Wesley Clark, the commander of NATO forces during the Kosovo War, has praised Sherman as "a man who used his skill and insight not only to blaze a trail of destruction across the American South but also to create a new form of maneuver, a 'strategy of the indirect,'" because of which "future generations of military leaders would ask themselves if there wasn't a way of avoiding the big battles, of breaking the enemy through indirect maneuver. And they looked back, always, to Sherman to find the answer."

These very different interpretations suggest that Sherman's influence on American warfare was not as one-dimensional as his critics have sometimes claimed. Some associated Sherman with the "terrible ruin" and cruelty of war and the extension of military destruction beyond the battlefield, but there were also those who regarded his campaigns in the Deep South as a tactical and strategic model for minimizing military destruction. Neither of these interpretations was obvious in the immediate aftermath of the Civil War. Apart from some recommendations regarding the formation and supply of armies on the march, Sherman himself did not include his most famous campaigns in a section on military lessons of the war in his memoirs, which was mostly concerned with suggestions for the reorganization of the U.S. Army and the professionalization of its officer class. In 1906 the Leavenworth Infantry and Cavalry School in Kansas, which was founded at Sherman's instigation, began the practice of visiting Civil War battlefields to provide officers with insights into the "face of battle." On these so-called staff rides or tactical rides, officers consulted handbooks on particular Civil War battles published by the newly established Army War College and replayed the struggle on game boards based on topographical maps of the battlegrounds like the Germans, whose Kriegsspiel (wargaming) would later become standard practice in the U.S. military.

More than any of America's wars, the Philippine War of 1898-1902 bore the direct imprint of Sherman's campaigns in terms of both strategy and personnel. The war was an inadvertent and mostly unexpected consequence of the Spanish-American War. On May 1, 1898, the U.S. Navy's Asiatic Squadron under Commodore George Dewey destroyed the Spanish fleet in Manila harbor and found itself in joint control of the Philippine capital with three or four thousand members of Emilio Aguinaldo's Army of Liberation, which had previously been a de facto ally of the United States. In December 1898, the United States bought the Philippines from Spain during the negotiations in Paris that ended the Spanish-American War, and President McKinley adopted a policy of "benevolent assimilation" toward the islands. As a consequence, the U.S. Army's Eighth Corps in the Philippines was ordered to suppress Aguinaldo's Army of Liberation and "win the confidence, respect, and affection of the inhabitants of the Philippines."
This mission turned out to be much more difficult than anticipated. Though Aguinaldo's poorly armed insurrectos were no match for the better-equipped U.S. troops in conventional battles, they were able to inflict significant casualties with ambushes, snipers, booby traps, and attacks on lone soldiers or stragglers in the tropical landscape of swamps, rice paddies, inaccessible mountains, and muddy roads that did not favor pursuit operations. In response the Americans frequently made no distinction between fighters, suspects, and sympathizers. Civilians and captured insurrectos were often subjected to various forms of torture, including the "water cure," in which suspects were pumped full of water and stomped or suspended headfirst into wells and buckets of water to extract information, after which they were often killed.

In the spring of 1899, General Loyd Wheaton, a Civil War hero who had served under Sherman, ordered his men to burn every village within a twelve-mile radius along the Pasig River in response to a guerrilla ambush. One of Wheaton's soldiers later described the scene: "A long black column of smoke sprang up … cascoes [flatboats] were dragged up to the fires and burned and the entire district so destroyed so that it would seem necessary not only for a bird but even a Filipino to carry his rations while crossing it."

In February 1901, a battalion of Seventh Infantry and five companies from the Forty-Eighth U.S. Volunteer Infantry conducted a scorched-earth campaign in the guerrilla stronghold of Abra Province in northern Luzon; villages, crops, and storehouses were systematically ruined and burned, till commanding officer Major William C. Bowen reported that "the entire province was as devoid of food products as was the valley of the Shenandoah after Sheridan's raid during the Civil War."

On September 28, 1901, a group of armed insurrectos under the command of General Vicente Lukbán carried out a surprise attack on the recently established base of Company C of the Ninth Infantry Regiment at the town of Balangiga, on the island of Samar, in which fifty-nine soldiers were killed and twenty-three wounded, many of them horribly mutilated. In response the American commander General Adna R. Chaffee appointed Brigadier General Jacob H. Smith as commander of the Sixth Separate Brigade, with orders to take control of the pacification of Samar and Leyte. Known as Hell Roaring Jake because of his stentorian voice, Smith told Major Littleton W.T. "Tony" Waller, the commander of three hundred marines sent to assist these operations in October: "I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn, the more you kill and burn the better it will please me."
When Waller asked for clarification of these orders, he was told to kill every male on the island above the age of ten. For the next three months, Smith's troops did their best to fulfill his instructions to turn Samar into a "howling wilderness," in a chaotic, brutal, and badly organized campaign that wreaked havoc on the island's 250,000 inhabitants. While U.S. Navy gunboats patrolled the coastline and rivers to prevent the guerrillas from being resupplied, columns of soldiers trekked through swamps and jungle, burning villages, hamlets, and farms and destroying or confiscating livestock and food supplies.
These operations soon reduced much of the population to starvation, till some of Smith's own commanders pleaded with him to allow food supplies to be brought from outside the island to prevent famine. Subsequent estimates of the death toll from these operations have ranged from 2,500 to 50,000, and they were widely criticized in the United States despite their effectiveness against Lukbán's guerrillas. Smith's radical orders were revealed when Major Waller was court-martialed for the executions of eleven prisoners during a disastrous thirty-five-mile march into the interior of Samar. Summoned as a witness, Smith affirmed that "treachery must be punished, that war must be prosecuted vigorously; that war was hell; that great General Sherman had said that 'war is hell,' and that the quicker the war was ended the less cruelty," but nevertheless denied that he had ordered Waller to carry out indiscriminate killings.

Bell justified these measures in very Sherman-like terms. In his third telegram, he declared, "Military necessity frequently precludes the possibility of making just discriminations, but it should be borne in mind that the greatest good to the greatest number can best be brought about by putting a prompt end to insurrection. A short and severe war creates in the aggregate less loss and suffering than benevolent war indefinitely prolonged." Like Sherman, Bell also saw his campaign as an instrument of long-term pacification. In a letter to his immediate superior, Major General Wheaton, on December 26, he stated: "A peace brought about by peace commissioners prior to the suffering by these people of the real hardships of war would almost certainly be followed by another insurrection within the next five years. These people need a thrashing to teach them some good common sense, and they should have it for the good of all concerned." As on Samar, these methods were brutally effective. On April 16, 1902, the revolutionary commander Miguel Malvar y Carpio surrendered, and 2,973 insurrectos soon followed his example. Exactly one month later, Bell issued his final circular, number 38, which declared an end to these special war measures in order to "re-establish a feeling of security and tranquility among the people as rapidly as possible." On June 23, martial law was suspended and Batangas was handed over to a civil government made up of conservative members of the local Filipino elite acting under the auspices of the U.S. Bureau of Insular Affairs. By this time, hundreds of villages in the province had been destroyed, large areas of farmland had been devastated, and some 75 to 90 percent of the cattle had been slaughtered. Many of the people were still in concentration camps, where malnourishment and cramped and unsanitary conditions bred cholera, measles, and other diseases that killed thousands. The U.S. Army itself estimated that the population of Batangas fell by more than 90,000 between 1896 and 1902, and others have suggested that as many as 100,000 Filipinos died from hunger, fighting, or disease in the province as a direct consequence of Bell's operations.

Many of the methods adopted in the Philippines also formed part of the more "scientific" pacification campaigns of the Vietnam War. In his memoirs, Colin Powell recalls his youthful participation in operations against Vietcong guerrillas in the A Shau Valley: "We burned down the thatched huts, starting the blaze with Ronson and Zippo lighters… . Why were we torching houses and destroying crops? Ho Chi Minh had said the people were like the sea in which his guerrillas swam… . We tried to solve the problem by making the whole sea uninhabitable. In the hard logic of war, what difference did it make if you shot your enemy or starved him to death?"

Ewell and Hunt were obsessed with increasing their kill statistics; one of their officers later recalled that "commanders were under constant pressure to produce body count as a measure of their own effectiveness." At the beginning of Speedy Express, Ewell's division had an average body count of eight enemy dead for each dead American soldier. Within a month of the operation, the ratio had risen to 21:1. In April the following year, it reached an extraordinary 134:1. By the end of the operation, the Ninth Infantry claimed to have killed 10,899 Vietcong, yet only 748 weapons were recovered. In their after-action report, Ewell and Hunt described these operations as a means of "un-brutalizing" the war through a combination of combat operations and psychological warfare directed at the "destruction of the enemy's will to fight and the winning of the confidence of the civilian populace." Raids on villages were followed by civic action teams who held raffles with chickens and ducks as prizes, handed out free T-shirts with the colors of the South Vietnamese government, provided medical care, distributed food, and entertained the populace with military bands and country music ("a big hit with the Vietnamese").

The rural pacification campaigns of the Philippines and Vietnam belong to a tradition of American counterinsurgency warfare that developed from Sherman's Southern campaigns and the Indian wars in that they made little distinction between armed fighters and civilians and their political, military, and psychological goals overlapped. But Sherman's strategies and philosophy of war also embody certain assumptions and practices that were intrinsic to America's conventional wars in the twentieth century. In an analysis of World War I in the early 1920s, Lieutenant Commander Holloway Halstead Frost of the U.S. Navy argued that "when great nations are at war with approximately equal military forces it will seldom be possible to win a purely military decision" and that future wars should follow the Civil War campaigns of Sherman and Sheridan and take the form of "direct attacks on the enemy economic forces." 
24
In The Strategy of Indirect Approach (1929), Liddell Hart argued that battles between heavily armed industrialized armies had become so costly as to make them militarily unviable and that future armies should seek to avoid such confrontations by targeting the adversary's rearguard command-and-communications structure. These proposals were not entirely new, and Liddell Hart offered numerous historical precedents dating back to the Greek-Persian Wars to show how the indirect approach had been put into practice. He suggested, "It is … more potent, as well as more economical, to disarm the enemy than to attempt his destruction by hard fighting… . A strategist should think in terms of paralyzing, not of killing." This advice had particular resonance in the aftermath of World War I. 
25
These components of Sherman's campaigns, Liddell Hart insisted, were particularly relevant at a time when the invention of the internal combustion engine and the caterpillar track and the development of airpower offered new instruments for eliminating the "deadly ground"-the space between an advancing and defending army-and targeting the enemy rear guard. Long before World War II, Liddell Hart argued that tanks and mechanized forces could be used for "deep strategic penetration," in much the same way that Sherman had used horses, wagons, and infantry columns. These ideas were echoed by Liddell Hart's British contemporary the military historian and journalist General J.F.C. Fuller. A tank commander during World War I, Fuller was not an admirer of Sherman, but his views on mechanized warfare and the "rebirth of mobility" were not that far removed from Liddell Hart's formulations. In a May 1918 memorandum, Fuller argued that the British army should switch from the destruction of German soldiers, or "body warfare," to "brain warfare" aimed at the destruction of Germany's command and supply structures, through "a sudden eruption of squadrons of fast-moving tanks, which unheralded would proceed to the various enemy headquarters, and either round them up or scatter them." 
26
Like many Union commanders, Sherman had great respect for the destructive raids carried out by the Confederate cavalryman Nathan Bedford Forrest, but he tended to use cavalry for screening, reconnaissance, and feints, leaving the work of destruction to fast-moving infantry units. In a 1928 memorandum, "A Mechanized Unit," Major General Adna R.
Chaffee Jr. (1884-1941), the son of the former military governor of the Philippines, called for the replacement of the U.S. horse cavalry by mechanized forces. A former cavalry officer himself, Chaffee proposed that these new units would emulate the "army-sized raids through Georgia, Alabama and the Carolinas" carried out by Sherman and the destructive 525-mile cavalry rampage carried out by James Harrison Wilson in the aftermath of Sherman's marches, penetrating deep into the enemy rear guard, targeting command, control, and logistical networks in a strategy that echoed Liddell Hart's "indirect" formulations. 
27
Faced with the looming prospect of a static World War I-style front line, General Omar Bradley launched his First Army in a combined aerial bombing and infantry offensive called Operation Cobra on July 25, piercing the German defensive lines and opening the way for what Russell Weigley called a "virtual road march" that appealed "to the passion for moving that is so much a part of the American character and heritage." This "passion for moving" was the cornerstone of Patton's concept of war, just as it had once been of Sherman's. On August 1, the Third Army advanced into Brittany with the objective of capturing Brest and other German-held Breton ports. In a speech to his staff officers, Patton outlined the kind of campaign he wanted with characteristic bluntness and disregard for military convention: "Flanks are something for the enemy to worry about, not us… . We are advancing constantly and are not interested in holding anything, except the enemy… . Our basic plan of operation is to advance and keep on advancing regardless of whether we have to go over, under, or through the enemy." 
28
29
Patton also followed Liddell Hart's concept of "selling the dummy" and placing his opponents "on the horns of a dilemma" regarding his line of attack and his ultimate destination, by allowing his divisional commanders to exploit "breaks" and gaps and vary the route of their advance in order to maintain their forward momentum. In the era of radio and telephone communications and aerial reconnaissance, Patton's motorized divisions could not "vanish" as Sherman's army had after leaving Atlanta, and they received a constant flow of intelligence information from aircraft, the Forces Françaises de l'Intérieur, and a thirty-man mobile reconnaissance team known as Patton's Household Cavalry, which moved ahead of them.
Nevertheless, the speed of the Third Army's advance often meant that radio contact with headquarters was temporarily broken, and Patton's commanders were expected to show the same capacity for improvisation that Sherman had once expected from his corps commanders and make decisions in accordance with Patton's general guidelines. To move as quickly as possible, Patton's troops were expected to travel lightly, and the Third Army's rapid progress was a prodigious feat of teamwork, administration, and logistical organization, in which supplies of food, ammunition, and gasoline were brought forward from Normandy in trucks and sometimes dropped from the air. One of Patton's commanders described the supply trucks following the advancing columns "like a band of stage-coaches making a run through Indian country. We got used to keeping the wheels going, disregarding the snipers, and hoping we wouldn't get lost or hit." Using these methods, Third Army advanced four hundred miles and fought on two fronts, five hundred miles apart, in the first three weeks of August, liberating 47,829 square miles of French territory and taking thousands of prisoners. Between August 1 and September 24, Patton's "flying columns," as Eisenhower called them, drove the Germans toward Brest before turning eastward toward the Loire Valley, bypassing Paris, and heading toward Reims, Verdun, Commercy, and the Moselle River with such speed that soldiers often rode on tanks, trailers, and jeeps as well as in trucks, in a campaign whose "brilliant rapidity" was subsequently praised by the Allied supreme commander as "perhaps the most spectacular ever seen in modern warfare."

Like the March to the Sea, the popularity of Patton's campaigns was due not just to their speed and seeming irresistibility, but also to their relatively low cost in American lives. In the Pacific campaign, General Douglas MacArthur adopted a variant of the indirect approach in even more challenging conditions during the Allied invasion of the Pacific. In France and Germany, Patton's divisions hurtled down roads that were visible on any tourist map. In the Pacific, Allied soldiers faced some 668,000 tenacious Japanese troops in swamps, mountains, and deep jungle that often lacked roads or even paths, conducting complex land, air, and naval operations with supply lines that reached across thousands of miles of land and sea and included coral reefs, atolls, and innumerable islands. When MacArthur was appointed supreme commander of the Southwest Pacific Area (SWPA) on April 18, 1942, following his defeat in the Philippines, the Allied strategic plan in the Pacific was to mount a two-pronged step-by-step offensive, with MacArthur's forces moving through Papua New Guinea and the southwest Pacific in conjunction with amphibious landings through the Marshall and Gilbert Islands in the central Pacific under the direction of Admiral Chester Nimitz (1885-1966), commander in chief of the Pacific Ocean Area.
These efforts required a complex and grueling combination of air, land, and amphibious operations whose ultimate goal was the conquest of Rabaul, the capital of New Britain and the bastion of Japanese military power in the Pacific. On August 7, the First Marine Division landed on the islands of Guadalcanal and Tulagi, beginning a bloody to-and-fro naval and land campaign that finally ended in an American victory in February the following year. Between November 22, 1942, and January 22, 1943, Australian and American troops destroyed the Japanese garrison at Buna-Gona, New Guinea, in a bloody confrontation that cost the lives 8,500 Allied soldiers. Faced with a potentially endless series of costly "storm landings" against well-entrenched Japanese positions, in August 1943 the Allied chiefs of staff abandoned the attempt to capture Rabaul and opted to neutralize it instead. In September MacArthur outlined his strategy in the Western Pacific islands: "Key points must of course be taken, but a wise choice of each will obviate the need for storming the mass of islands now in enemy possession. 'Island hopping' with extravagant losses and slow progress … is not my idea of how to end the war as soon and as quickly as possible."

Instead of attacking Wewak, MacArthur's air force bombed the three weakly defended Japanese air bases at Hollandia and Ataipe, which was roughly halfway between Humboldt Bay and Wewak. In this way, Adachi's Eighteenth Army was cut adrift as the Allied armies gained 750 miles without fighting a major battle. In July, Adachi attempted to reverse these gains with a counterattack from Wewak. Weakened by malaria and an exhausting 400-mile jungle trek, his troops suffered massive casualties. After the war, a senior Japanese intelligence officer praised MacArthur's strategy, which "with minimum losses, attacked and seized a relatively weak area, constructed airfields and then proceeded to cut the supply lines to [our] troops in that area… . Our strongpoints were gradually starved out." MacArthur's policy of "hitting 'em where they ain't" was partly a response to the strategic geography of the Pacific, and like Patton's campaign in Normandy it evoked a lost "romantic" form of warfare won by guile, intelligence, and dash rather than brute force. These campaigns did not preclude physical destruction. Patton's reliance on tactical air support and artillery bombardments reduced German-defended villages into rubblestrewn "Third Army memorials." MacArthur's territorial leaps were made possible by the extension of the "bomber line," the distance from which the air force could attack Japanese positions from airfields or aircraft carriers.
In the Pacific, amphibious assaults on fortified positions could not always be avoided and were often preceded by "softening-up" bombardments and followed by a savage struggle that wreaked havoc on soldiers and civilians alike. Between April and June 1945, nearly half of Okinawa's three hundred thousand inhabitants died during the three-month battle for the island. In February 1945, MacArthur ordered an assault on Manila; in it 70 percent of the city was destroyed and a hundred thousand Filipinos were killed. Most of the civilian dead were massacred by the vengeful Japanese, but the destruction of the city was also due to the American use of tanks and artillery in street fighting characterized by what the Thirty-Seventh Infantry's After-Action Report described as "literal destruction of a building in advance of the area of friendly troops."

Once again, Sherman's campaigns have often been cited in connection with these developments. "Once proportionality and discrimination were subverted by Sherman, it is arguable that they made the severities of modern American war making at least conceptually possible, from the saturation bombing of World War II, to Hiroshima and Nagasaki, to the Christmas bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong in 1972," argues James Reston Jr. in his indictment/investigation of Sherman's campaigns.

In Walt Disney's 1943 celebration of his ideas and theories, Victory Through Air Power, Mitchell described airpower as the "dominant feature of military operations. Airpower can fly directly to the vital centers of an opposing state and neutralize them. It can destroy the cities and wreck the aqueducts. It can knock out the lines of communications. It can destroy the food supply. It can make the people helpless to resist." In the same film, Mitchell's disciple Major Alexander de Seversky predicted that airpower would soon "transform the entire surface of our planet into a battlefield. The distinctions between soldiers and civilians will be erased." Mitchell's vision of airpower was initially out of step with U.S. military thinking in the interwar years. Though the Tactical Air Corps accepted in principle the notion that airpower could be used to target the morale, the will to win, of the civilian population, air force debates tended to focus on precision bombing of economic and military targets rather than wholesale terrorizing of civilians. 
40
As de Seversky noted, "The kind of large-scale demolition which would be looked upon as horrifying vandalism when undertaken by soldiers on the ground can be passed off as a technical preparation or 'softening' when carried out by aerial bombing," and such destruction inevitably produces a broader psychological and physical impact on the surviving population. For John Steinbeck, aerial bombing was a new form of frontier warfare, in which "the American boy simply changes the nature of his game. Instead of raiding Sioux or Apache, instead of buffalo or antelope, he lays his sights on Zero or Heinkel, on Stuka or Messerschmitt."

In all, some 305,000 German civilians were killed and 780,000 wounded in raids that destroyed or partially destroyed fifty cities and made 7.5 million German civilians homeless. Civilian casualties were often obscured by euphemistic bureaucratic language in which the success of such operations was measured by lists of factories or bridges destroyed or numbers of workers who had been "dehoused." The impact on German morale was more difficult to measure. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey that followed the Allied invasion of Germany found that the population "showed surprising resistance to the terror and hardships of repeated air attack, to the destruction of their homes and belongings, and to the conditions under which they were reduced to live… . The power of a police state over its people cannot be underestimated." 
44
Both the legitimacy and the effectiveness of bombing German cities have continued to be debated by historians. Regardless of whether or not it "worked" on its own terms, the strategy of bombing German civilians in order to crush their will to fight or support their government did not meet with universal favor, even within the U.S. military. Patton considered the bombing of German cities to be "barbaric, useless and sadistic." In a memorandum to General Carl A. Spaatz, commander of U.S. Strategic Air Forces in Europe, a staff officer declared it "contrary to [American] ideals to wage war on civilians." 
45
As in Germany, operations analysts talked of "man-hours lost" and "dehoused" workers in ostensibly targeting Japan's factories and wartime cottage industries, but the broader intentions behind LeMay's campaigns were summed up approvingly by an editor of the Atlanta Constitution, despite the city's history of wartime destruction, who observed that it was "shocking to think of the thousands who must be burned to death" in such attacks but nevertheless concluded, "If it is necessary, however, that the cities of Japan are, one by one, burned to black ashes, that we can, and will, do." Such approval was fueled by racist depictions of the Japanese as a bestial and subhuman enemy and also by the belief that the bombing of Japanese cities would "save lives"-meaning the lives of American soldiers. At least 806,000 Japanese civilians were killed or wounded in nine monthsmore than all the Japanese soldiers killed during the whole war-in a campaign that one of MacArthur's key aides described in a confidential memorandum as "one of the most ruthless and barbaric killings of civilians or non-combatants in history."

On August 6, 1945, the United States ushered in a new era of military destruction when the Enola Gay dropped an atomic bomb on Hiroshima, killing and wounding 150,000 people; three days later, another nuclear attack, on Nagasaki, killed or injured 80,000. There is no space here to consider the historical debate regarding whether the atomic bomb was really necessary to make Japan surrender or the degree to which its use was determined by wider geopolitical objectives regarding the Soviet Union. 
51
By the end of World War II, America's bomber fleets had become a confirmation of American military technological supremacy, and airpower was firmly embedded in the nation's conventional and unconventional war strategies. Airpower played a major role in the massive destruction inflicted on both North and South Korea during the Korean War (1950-53). UN (almost entirely American) air forces flew 1,040 sorties and dropped 698,000 tons of bombs and rockets on North and South Korea filled with white phosphorus, thermite, napalm, nerve gas, defoliant chemicals, or clusters of bomblets filled with metal balls and fiberglass fléchettes to maximize injuries to people. In September 1950, the British journalist Reginald Thompson described the impact of American firepower on Seoul and its surrounding villages as "a new technique of machine warfare" in which "the slightest resistance brought down a deluge of destruction, blotting out the area. Dive bombers, tanks and artillery blasted strong points, large or small, in town and hamlet, while the troops waited at the roadside as spectators until the way was cleared for them. Few people can have suffered so terrible a liberation."

In April 1952, the FEAF outlined a new policy of "maximum selected destruction" directed toward "targets of military significance so situated that their destruction will have a deleterious effect upon the morale of the civilian population engaged in the logistic support of enemy forces." 
55
Unlike World War II or Korea, the bombing of North Vietnam was not intended to inflict massive destruction and loss of life. Though some military officers urged the Johnson administration to conduct an all-out bombing campaign in the North, civilian leaders were anxious that such a campaign might lead to war with China and the Soviet Union. In 1964 the U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, Henry Cabot Lodge, rejected a bombing campaign that would "lay the whole country to waste" on the grounds that "there will be nobody left in North Vietnam on whom to put pressure… . What we are interested in here is not destroying Ho Chi Minh … but getting him to change his behavior." 
56
In two years, American pilots flew 148,000 sorties and bombed an array of targets that included towns, cities, factories, bridges, churches, schools, pagodas, a convent, and private homes. U.S. pilots often complained about the restrictions placed on their operations that were designed to avoid large-scale civilian casualties and the negative political consequences that came with them, but if these raids did not result in the massive urban devastation of the Korean War, they nevertheless inflicted widespread physical destruction on a largely agricultural society. In December 1966, Harrison Salisbury, the deputy editor of the New York Times, visited the town of Nam Định, forty miles southwest of Hanoi, which had been repeatedly bombed for more than a year, leaving "block after block of utter desolation." Salisbury insisted that Nam Định had no military significance, but the distinctions among military, economic, and political targets were irrelevant in a bombing campaign intended to break the will of the North Vietnamese government by terrorizing its people.
In December 1966 the scientific advisory group JASON concluded that this stop-start bombing campaign had had no measurable impact on North Vietnamese support for the rebels in the South or on the "determination of Hanoi and its people" to continue the war, and that this failure represented a more general failure "to appreciate the fact … that a direct, frontal attack on a society tends to strengthen the social fabric of the nation, to increase popular support of the existing government, to improve the determination of the leadership and its people to fight back." 
57
58
The extent to which these raids contributed to this outcome is debatable, because the North did not alter its negotiating position and was able to keep its army in the South; the chief North Vietnamese negotiator, Hà Văn Lâu, even called the bombing campaign an "aerial equivalent to Dien Bien Phu." The Linebacker raids nevertheless demonstrated once again the willingness of American leaders to use airpower as a bludgeon of political coercion and intimidation and to extend the "hard hand of war" to civilians in ways that made the burned plantations and Chimneyvilles of the Civil War appear almost quaintly reserved by comparison.
The century between the end of the Civil War and the escalation of the Vietnam War in 1965 was marked by a striking paradox. On the one hand, more international laws, treaties, and conventions regulating the conduct of warfare were drawn up and signed by more countries than during any other period in human history. The Hague Conventions on Land War of 1899 and 1907, the International Law Association's 1938 Amsterdam Draft, which declared that "the civilian population shall not form the object of war," and the Fourth Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War were all part of a new international attempt to humanize or "refine" war, as Sherman disparagingly put it, which mandated armies to avoid unnecessary suffering and the deliberate targeting of civilians or other "protected persons." Yet these developments coincided with-and to some extent were a product of-a period of unprecedented global violence in which these rules and regulations were systematically violated or disregarded. At the beginning of the twentieth century, civilian deaths constituted between 10 and 15 percent of wartime deaths. By the end of the century, some 75 percent of wartime dead were civilians and noncombatants. In 1948 the Southern historian John Bennett Walters Jr. published an article, "General Sherman and Total War," based on his PhD thesis, in the Journal of Southern History and subsequently expanded it into the book Merchant of Terror: General Sherman and Total War (1973). In it Walters accused Sherman of having initiated his army into "the savage art of destruction and the disregard for human rights which the rules of war had sought to mitigate," thereby establishing a "record for systematic torture, pillage, and vandalism unequalled in American history."

Total war means war waged without moral restraint. The term can also refer to the maximization and reorganization of the economic, social, and industrial resources of a society to achieve military objectives. For the historian David Bell, some of these tendencies were already evident in the French Revolutionary Wars, especially the war of extermination waged by the revolutionary armies against royalist rebels in the Vendée region between 1793 and 1796, which he described as "a kind of warfare whose scale had little or no precedent, whether in the mobilization of population and resources, the ambitious and ill-defined war aims, the demonization of enemy populations." 
3
The term total war was coined by Giulio Douhet in his exposition of airpower in 1921 to describe war waged against the civilian population and resources of the opposing state as well as its uniformed armies. In 1924, the German infantry and General Staff officer Joachim von Stülpnagel outlined a theory of Volkskrieg (people's war), predicting that the coming wars would be waged without clearly defined theaters of operations or any distinctions between the front and the rear guard. In these wars, von Stülpnagel predicted, armies would no longer be bound by moral constraints in their treatment of civilians. "We can show no consideration for the population if the outcome of the war depends on it. In the war of the future, death behind the front has to be viewed like death at the front."

Nevertheless, there are some peripheral historical connections between his campaigns in the South and some of the wars that followed. In 1865 Sherman's aide-de-camp Major George Ward Nichols claimed, "History … will search in vain for a parallel to the scathing and destructive effects of the Invasion of the Carolinas. The immediate disasters to the Rebel cause, the cities captured, arsenals and munitions of war destroyed, the communications severed, will be appreciated by the military mind in Europe, as well as by our own army and people."

One of the justifications for the Spanish-American War in 1898 was American outrage at the "reconcentration" policy enforced in Cuba by the Spanish general Valeriano Weyler y Nicolau (1838-1930). While serving in Cuba and Santo Domingo during the American Civil War, Weyler was sent to Washington as a military attaché, and he was a great admirer of Sherman, whom he met. Weyler was particularly impressed by his tactics in Georgia and the Carolinas. In February 1896, he was appointed captain-general of Spanish forces in Cuba, with the task of suppressing a powerful anti-Spanish rebellion in the countryside. In response Weyler introduced a series of draconian measures. Guerrilla prisoners were summarily shot, and villages and houses of known or suspected sympathizers were burned and their food supplies confiscated or destroyed.
Sent by President McKinley to investigate conditions in Cuba in 1897, former congressman William J. Calhoun described a journey from Havana to Matanzas by train: "The countryside outside of the military posts was practically depopulated. Every house had been burned, banana trees cut down, cane fields swept by fire, and everything in the shape of food destroyed… . I did not see a house, man, woman or child, a horse, mule, or cow, nor even a dog… . The country was wrapped in the stillness of death and the silence of desolation." 
7
In 1897, however, Weyler introduced a new policy of forcibly evacuating civilians from the countryside and "reconcentrating" them in fortified stockades in order to break the links between the people and the guerrillas. Between 155,000 and 170,000 civilians died of hunger and disease in these camps, according to the more recent scholarly estimates. In the American press, these policies earned Weyler a nickname, the Butcher, and made his name a byword for Spanish cruelty in Cuba. Weyler consistently rejected allegations that his methods were uniquely barbaric, and he and his government excused them by saying that they were no different from those used by the American government during the Civil War. When the American consul in Cuba, Fitzhugh Lee, nephew of Robert E. Lee, asked Weyler about civilian suffering in the concentration camps, he received the very Sherman-like reply that "everything is fair in war."

Wolseley also cited the methods used by the Union Army for destroying Southern railroads in his bestselling textbook, The Soldier's Pocket-Book for Field Service (1869), which contained detailed instructions on how to destroy and reconstruct railroad lines, modeled on the techniques developed by Union engineers during "the American war." Borrowing methods almost exactly from Sherman's chief of engineers, Orlando Poe, and the head of the War Department's railroad bureau, Herman Haupt, Wolseley recommended that track should be uprooted by squads of soldiers using U-shaped metal tools, after which the sleepers were to be burned in order to soften the rails until they could be "bent into the shape of a U, or round a tree or telegraph pole."
In a section on protection of railways, Wolseley recommended that saboteurs should be dissuaded by proclamations warning that anyone caught damaging railways or telegraph lines would be "hanged without mercy," just as Union generals had done in Missouri and parts of the South. Where these warnings failed to achieve their objectives, he suggested, "It may be possible to make the inhabitants living along it responsible for its preservation, and it may sometimes be necessary to make severe examples by burning the houses near the spot where any injury was done to it." Wolseley himself made some "severe examples" during the Third Anglo-Ashanti War in the Akan interior of the Gold Coast in modern-day Ghana of 1873-74, when he followed the British victory at the Battle of Amoaful on January 31, 1974, by marching on the Ashanti capital, Kumasi. After ordering his troops to carry reduced rations in order to increase their mobility, Wolseley entered the abandoned Ashanti capital four days later and summoned the Ashanti king to negotiate a peace agreement. When the king refused to appear, Wolseley's troops blew up the royal palace, then burned the city and all the villages they passed through during their retreat because, he later wrote, "In my heart I believed that the absolute destruction of Koomassee, with its great palace, the wonder of West Africa, would be a much more striking and effective end to the war than any peace treaty."

Food denial was only one objective of these operations. Unable to locate and capture de Wet's elusive guerrillas, Kitchener and Roberts adopted a strategy of indirect psychological pressure that was primarily directed against women, children, and the elderly-the easiest targets. These objectives were made explicit by General Thomas Kelly-Kenny, who told one detachment to "burn all farmhouses-explain reason (for so doing) as they have harboured enemy and not reported to British authorities as required. The question of how to treat women and children and what amount of food and transport will arise, as to the first part they have forfeited all right to consideration and must now suffer for their persistently ignoring warnings against harbouring and assisting our enemy." Not surprisingly, this "strategic" destruction frequently became merely a license for looting. Letters from British soldiers are filled with descriptions that recall Sherman's campaigns in the South in the violent intrusions into female domestic space and the vindictive destruction of pianos, furniture, and other property of no military but great sentimental value.

Civilian deaths during the British "burn and capture" campaign were often due to poor sanitary conditions and mismanagement rather than the result of deliberate policy, but they were often accepted by the British military establishment as a tragic but inevitable necessity in order to bring the war to an end. Many officers shared the outlook expressed in a December 1901 letter to The Times of London, whose author justified programs of slaughter by neglect in prison camps with a quotation from none other than Philip Sheridan: "The proper strategy consists in inflicting as telling blows as possible on the enemy's army, and then in causing the inhabitants so much suffering that they must long for peace, and force the government to demand it. The people must be left with nothing but their eyes to weep with over the war."

The behavior of the Prussian army in France pales beside the Vernichtungsbefehl (extermination order) issued by General Lothar von Trotha in response to the Herero and Nama Rebellions in German South West Africa, in which men, women, and children were driven out into the desert and denied food and water or imprisoned in forced-labor camps -a policy that reduced the Herero population from 80,000 to 15,000 and the Nama by half by 1911. In 1905 the German army waged an even more destructive campaign to suppress the Maji Maji Rebellion in German East Africa (later Tanganyika), when three columns under the command of the German governor Count Adolf von Gotzen burned villages and crops throughout the southern part of the country in a deliberate famine strategy that, according to the historian Thomas Pakenham, resulted in 250,000 to 300,000 deaths. 
19
The manual Kriegsbrauch im Landkriege (Usages of War on Land), issued by the German General Staff to its soldiers during World War I, expressed a philosophy very similar to the Lieber Code, asserting, "Certain severities are indispensable in war, nay more, the only true humanity very often lies in a ruthless application of them."

As early as 1863, the Cambridge University political economist Henry Fawcett in his Manual of Political Economy criticized the "feeling of false humanity" that had "attempted to make the rights of private property respected in war."

25
In a memorandum to the British Cabinet in October 1917, Winston Churchill, munitions minister and former high lord of the Admiralty, rejected the idea of a bombing campaign against Germany in retaliation for the Gotha raids on London, arguing, "It is improbable that any terrorization of the civil population which could be achieved by air attack could compel the Government of a great nation to surrender."

The barbarism of twentieth-century warfare and the blurring of the boundaries between armies and civilians were not limited to wars between states. By the mid-twentieth century, irregular and guerrilla conflicts had become a ubiquitous feature of modern warfare, from the resistance to German and Japanese occupations during World War II to the wars of decolonization that followed. On May 13, 1941, the Wehrmacht adopted a special dispensation for the forthcoming invasion of the Soviet Union known as the Kriegsgerichtsbarkeitserlass (War Jurisdiction Decree), which authorized its officers to carry out collective reprisals against civilians in response to any acts of partisan resistance. During the Nazi advance on Moscow, German infantry units burned villages, executed hostages, and destroyed property, crops, and livestock in "mopping up" operations behind the lines, and the reliance on destruction, devastation, and massacre became ever more pronounced as resistance continued to grow and the German advance was halted.
In the Ukraine, Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau, commander of the Sixth Army, adopted a policy of burning houses, confiscating food, and shooting or hanging hostages in operations against partisans, whom he regarded as "murderous animals." On December 16, 1942, the German supreme commander of the armed forces, Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, authorized German troops throughout Europe "to take any measures without restriction and even against women and children if these are necessary for success" in a struggle against "bandit warfare" and "communist-trained fighters," which Keitel insisted "has nothing to do with a soldier's chivalry nor with the decisions of the Geneva Conventions." 
28

30
Nazi counterinsurgency tactics also influenced the Japanese Imperial Army in its response to Communist and Nationalist guerrillas in China and Southeast Asia. Between 1933 and 1937, the Japanese Kwantung Army successfully eliminated anti-Japanese resistance in Japan's puppet state Manchukuo, using a range of methods that included the forcible relocation of some 5.5 million Chinese civilians into ten thousand "collective hamlets" on the same model used in Cuba, the Philippines, the Boer War-and later in Vietnam. As in these wars, towns and villages that lay outside these camps were destroyed to deny food to the guerrillas, and these campaigns had a devastating impact on the civilian population as well.
In May 1940 General Okamura Yasuji, commander of the North China Area Army, implemented a policy ordered by his superiors known as Sankō Sakusen, the Three Alls Strategy (kill all, burn all, loot all), also known as Jinmetsu Sakusen, the Burn to Ash Strategy, against Communist guerrillas in northern China. According to historian Chalmers Johnson, the method was "to surround a given area, to kill everyone in it, and to destroy everything possible so that the area would be uninhabitable in the future." 
31
32
German and Japanese commanders justified violence and terror on the grounds of military necessity, and these arguments were sometimes accepted by their victorious enemies. In October 1944, General Lothar von Rendulic, the German commander in Finland and Norway, ordered his troops to burn Finnish villages during a scorched-earth retreat from Lapland. At the Nuremberg trials, Rendulic was found not guilty of unlawfully destroying civilian property on the grounds that "urgent military necessity warranted the decision made." He received a twenty-year sentence for other offenses; it was commuted to ten, and he was freed after three years. This successful defense became known as the Rendulic rule, and its general acceptance was such that it was still referred to in the U.S. Army's rules of engagement in the 2003 invasion of Iraq. 
33
Guerrillas, terrorists, and other "non-state agents" have often adopted their own smallscale forms of total war that make no distinction between combatants and noncombatants or even deliberately target civilians. All these developments contributed to the lowered threshold of twentieth-century war and moved the notion of combat far beyond the battlefield.
To suggest, as John Bennett Walters and others have done, that Sherman was somehow responsible for these streams of twentieth-century barbarism fails to account for the relative restraint of his campaigns in comparison with their successors and ignores equally barbaric acts of military violence that preceded the Civil War and could be cited as precedents for his campaigns. Classical historians' gleeful descriptions of Roman soldiers slaughtering "barbarian" women, children, and old people in the aftermath of battle; the massacres carried out by crusaders in the Holy Land; the razing of cities by the armies of Ghengis Khan; the destruction of the Aztec capital Tenochtitlán by Cortés's invading army -all these premodern episodes belong to a grim tradition of military violence against civilians that long precedes the modern concept of "total" warfare. Sherman's decision to wage war on Southern civilians certainly belongs to this tradition, but the limited and calibrated destruction that his army visited on the South was also a departure from it, reflecting the modern drift toward rule-based warfare exemplified by the Lieber Code. The allegation made by Walters, J.F.C. Fuller, and others that his methods caused a "moral regression" in warfare tend to exaggerate both the destruction that he inflicted and the extent to which "civilized" warfare was really civilized in practice. Such accusations also tend to ignore the extent to which Sherman's strategies, tactics, and philosophy of war were the products of a broader understanding of how wars could be fought and won that was shared by many of his contemporaries and then became more consensual and widespread as the wars of the twentieth century revealed the impossibility and irrelevance of Napoleonic notions of "the decisive battle" as the crucial ingredient of warfare.
Something similar can be said of Sherman's alleged influence on the more conventional military strategies and tactics that also fall under the rubric of total war. If Basil Liddell Hart is to be believed, Sherman's campaigns had a decisive impact on twentieth-century warfare through adoption of his "indirect approach" by many armies and generals, including not only Patton's Third Army, but also the German pioneer of tank warfare Heinz Guderian and the "desert fox" Erwin Rommel, both of whom were cited by Liddell Hart as his "disciples." Liddell Hart's inclusion of the British Eighth Army's North African desert campaigns and the Israeli army during the Six-Day War as practitioners of his indirect method appears to extend Sherman's influence even further.
In a discussion of the German blitzkrieg campaigns of World War II in his memoirs, Liddell Hart claimed, "The development of the theory owed much to the study I made, in reflection on the entrenched deadlock of 1914-18, of ways and means by which an earlier case of deadlock had been overcome in the American Civil War, particularly by Sherman in the western theatre."

In a report to the army high command on February 8, 1919, von Seeckt argued, "The whole future of warfare appears to me to lie in the employment of mobile armies, relatively small but of high quality and rendered distinctly more effective by the addition of aircraft, and in simultaneous mobilization of the whole defense force, be it to feed the attack or for home defense."

It was against this background that the American way of war acquired its distinctive features by the end of the Vietnam War. In conventional warfare, the U.S. military relied heavily on its technological supremacy, particularly its fleets of bombers and fighters, to destroy its enemies' armed forces and achieve rapid military decision. Though not averse to Grant-style campaigns of attrition, sieges, and assaults, the U.S. military and the American public favored slashing cavalry-style offensives, using mobility, speed, and maneuver to make deep territorial gains and target command-and-control structures and lines of communication. As the armed enforcer of the world's premier industrial power and the essential guardian of the global capitalist economy, the U.S. military has always demonstrated a special aptitude for logistics that was already evident in the Civil War and was subsequently honed into a unique ability to organize and transport large numbers of men and materials across the most extended and attenuated international supply lines. When Woodrow Wilson declared war on Germany on April 16, 1917, the German military predicted that the war would be over before America was able to enter it. Instead the U.S. Army was able to mobilize 4,800,000 men in less than a year. By the time American troops first went into action at the Saint-Mihiel salient on September 12, 1918, the military had refitted French ports to receive its cargo ships, shipped 7.5 million tons of supplies to France, and built more than a thousand miles of railroad track in French territory. During World War II, these logistical skills overcame the extraordinary challenges of the Pacific and supplied Patton's army for most of its headlong charge through France, and they have remained essential to the projection of American military power ever since. America's desire to obliterate its enemies at a distance with its technological superiority has been shaped by a public aversion to prolonged wars and a determination to preserve the lives of its soldiers. As a result, foreign civilians have sometimes been merely an expendable consequence of the reliance on overwhelming firepower and limitless ordnance that British journalist Reginald Thompson observed in Korea, but at other times deliberate targets. "The Yank style of fighting was to wait for the artillery and let the big guns blast the enemy positions as barren of all life as possible. It saved many American lives but it took longer," recalled Lieutenant General Robert L. Eichelberger, commander of the U.S. Eighth Army in the Pacific in 1944 and 1945.

Sherman did not regard either the Confederacy or slavery as evil and would certainly have accepted the latter were it not for the disobedience of the former. Patton was shocked at the sight of the survivors of the concentration camps liberated by his troops, but his government did not enter the war to save Jews. MacArthur "liberated" a South Korea created as an American anticommunist bulwark so as to hand it back to the Syngman Rhee dictatorship that was no less brutal and oppressive than its North Korean enemy. U.S. support for the South Vietnamese strongman Ngô Đình Di m, the shah of Iran, and (initially) Saddam Hussein was based on very similar calculations. This does not mean that the liberating impulse in American war making is entirely fictitious. But even the most fervently "moral" of America's wars invariably involve more sordid economic and geopolitical objectives that are rarely made clear to the public or ordinary soldiers. Looking back on his thirty-three years of military service, the decorated former Marine Corps general Smedley D. Butler described himself as "a high class muscle man for Big Business, for Wall Street and the bankers. In short, I was a racketeer, a gangster for capitalism."

In April 1914, President Woodrow Wilson dispatched a naval force with six thousand marines to the Gulf of Mexico to bring pressure to bear on the Mexican strongman General Victoriano Huerta. When Huerta refused an order from the U.S. Navy to apologize for the temporary detention of U.S. Marines who had gone ashore at Vera Cruz by firing a twenty-one-gun salute in honor of the U.S. flag, Wilson ordered marines to occupy the port facilities and seize the Customs House, which was one of the Mexican government's main sources of income. Though Rear Admiral Frank F. Fletcher refused to carry out a "wholesale bombardment" of the city to avoid civilian casualties, this incursion turned into a full-fledged battle between the marines and Mexican soldiers and cadets from the Vera Cruz Naval Academy, supported by armed civilians. The conflict spread from the port into the city.
"Opposed by an enemy they could not see, in the streets of a strange city where every house was an ambush and every church tower had a fighting top," in the words of war correspondent Richard Harding Davis, marines and navy "bluejackets" engaged in what was then the most intense urban combat in U.S. history, fighting house to house and sometimes floor by floor, killing several hundred Mexicans-both armed and unarmedand losing 130 Americans.

In Mexico Funston adopted a very different policy and conducted a remarkably progressive-if puritanical-seven-month occupation that began to reform the city's finances and local government, reopened its schools and recruited new teachers, built new roads and banned gambling, marijuana, cocaine, and cockfighting, and vaccinated much of the population against smallpox before it was abruptly brought to an end. This littleknown episode embodied the same combination of "coercion and attraction" employed during the Philippine-American War that has become as much a part of the American way of war as blowing things up and killing people. In Military Government (1920), Colonel Harry A. Smith argued against "a military occupation marked by harshness, injustice, or oppression" because it would generate "lasting resentment against the occupying power in the hearts of the people of the occupied territory"; he described the ideal form of military government as one based on "just, considerate, and mild treatment of the governed by the occupying army" that would "convert enemies into friends."

In October 1919, the U.S. high commissioner for Haiti Colonel John S. Russell condemned the fact that "troops in the field have declared and carried on what is commonly known as an 'open season' where care is not taken to determine whether the natives are bandits or 'good citizens' and where houses have been ruthlessly burned merely because they were unoccupied and native property otherwise destroyed." 
54
All these episodes provided the U.S. military with the common sense and expertise in the conduct of occupations that would later be so conspicuously absent in its disastrous management of the Iraq War. By the end of the Vietnam War, however, there was little indication that the U.S. military would draw upon this legacy in the future, as the army began a process of readjustment, reorganization, and retrenchment, beginning with the abolition of the draft in 1973 and the establishment of the All Volunteer Force (AVF) that Sherman had regarded as the military ideal. As a result of the huge rearmament programs of the Reagan era, the military began to reacquire some of the prestige it had lost in Vietnam and got a new generation of weapons and technologies intended to produce a smaller, leaner army for conventional and unconventional war. Apart from the "covert" wars and "rollback" campaigns of supplying anti-Soviet guerrillas such as the mujahideen, conventional military strategy in the Reagan years was still largely geared toward waging a deep-strike counteroffensive against a putative Soviet invasion of Western Europe on the Patton model. In war-gaming scenarios and training exercises, the military endlessly rehearsed a mechanized war of maneuver based on close air support, which would drive the Soviets out of Europe by penetrating deep behind their advancing formations. But in the last decade of the century, the age of superpower confrontation came to an abrupt and unexpected end, and the U.S. military entered a new period in its history, in which the old assumptions of "total" and "limited" war were no longer valid. The change called into question the very purpose of the military's vast destructive powers.
The New American Way of War At the end of the Cold War, the United States became the world's only military superpower, with a global reach unprecedented in world history. In addition to more than seven hundred military bases and installations in twenty-nine countries throughout the world, its fleet of warships, submarines, and aircraft carriers patrolling the world's oceans had long since transformed Alfred Thayer Mahan's sea-power ambitions into a permanent reality. Since the end of the Vietnam War, it had bolstered its arsenal of intercontinental ballistic missiles, bomber fleets, fighter planes, and attack helicopters with a new generation of high-tech weapons that included radar-invisible stealth fighters, AC-130 gunships, laser-guided missiles, and laser-guided smart bombs. Following the abolition of the draft, a smaller and more streamlined professional army had taken full advantage of the technological revolution and laid the foundations for a digitalized battlefield command system that no other military in the world could match.
All these developments gave the military a unique ability to fight any enemy anywhere in the world, while making the United States impregnable. Yet hardly had the euphoria of the West's "victory" begun to wear off than a pessimistic school of thought within the American political and military establishment predicted that the United States faced a new era of "persistent conflict" from an unpredictable array of natural and artificial enemies that include terrorists, rogue states, drug cartels and other mafias, and dictators armed with weapons of mass destruction, and that the maintenance of America's global military presence was essential for national security and also for the stability of the international system.
In the same period, the military, its analysts and strategists, and key institutions, such as the Army War College and the Joint Readiness Training Center, increasingly stressed the importance of "military operations other than war" and "full dimensional operations," in which the military was expected to prepare for a range of activities, from peacekeeping, "stability operations," humanitarian assistance, emergency disaster relief, and "conflict termination."
According to the concept of "three-block war" elaborated by U.S. Marine General Charles Krulak in the late 1990s, soldiers might be obliged to engage in combat, humanitarian, and stability operations simultaneously within the contiguous space of three city blocks. The idea that war could have humanitarian and altruistic objectives was often reinforced by the notion that new high-tech weaponry and more accurate targeting systems and sensors would make it possible to restrict "collateral damage"-civilian casualties and property destruction-to an acceptable minimum.
In 1996 the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Vision 2010 claimed that precision targeting had made it possible to "achieve the necessary destruction or suppression of enemy forces with fewer systems" and deploy the "necessary concentration of combat power at the decisive time and place-with less need to mass forces physically than in the past." New capabilities would also "relieve our Service men and women of the need to be physically present at the decisive points in battle or in other operations, or to be exposed to conditions of great danger and hardship." 
1
These expectations shaped a range of armed conflicts in which America became involved in the aftermath of the Cold War, including three major wars, an on/off air war with Iraq, naval skirmishes with Iran, peacekeeping missions and occupations in the Balkans and Somalia, and the occupation of Haiti. In December 1989, these new doctrines were tested for the first time when the United States invaded Panama in order to topple and arrest the CIA protégé and narco-dictator General Manuel Noriega. Ostensibly intended to safeguard American lives and "defend democracy" in response to Noriega's brutal crackdown on political opposition, the invasion was actually also motivated by the imminent implementation of the 1977 Carter-Torrijos Panama Canal Treaty, which was due to restore full sovereignty over the Canal Zone to Panama by the end of the century.
For the military, the invasion was an opportunity to dispel "Vietnam syndrome"-the humiliation of the world's foremost industrial power being beaten by a Third World agricultural society despite its overwhelming firepower and the moral collapse of the U.S. Army and the loss of domestic prestige that accompanied that defeat. Panama also provided an opportunity to demonstrate America's new technological weaponry and its tactical and operational prowess. In October 1989, General Carl Stiner, the commander of the U.S. Army's Southern Command, presented to the Bush administration an invasion plan that called for simultaneous attacks against twenty-seven targets from land, air, and sea to rapidly destroy Noriega's command-and-control structure. This plan became the basis for Operation Just Cause, which began at 12:30 a.m. on December 20, when a combined task force of 27,000 infantry, sailors, paratroopers, and special forces attacked some 14,000 Panama Defense Forces (PDF) personnel, police, national guard, and paramilitaries. Subjected to simultaneous naval, ground, and aerial attacks involving paratroopers, special forces, and regular infantry in addition to a stunning display of firepower from Apache and Cobra attack helicopters, Sheridan light assault vehicles, AC-130 gunships, and the new F-117 Nighthawk stealth fighters, Noriega's forces were rapidly overwhelmed and effectively defeated by the time the sun came up.
Stiner's strategic plan combined well-established American principles of speed, mobility, and overwhelming force with seamlessly integrated joint operations and the new technological weaponry at the U.S. Army's disposal, but it was also subject to stricter rules of engagement than any previous American wars. Indiscriminate artillery and aerial bombardments and attacks on military targets close to "critical public facilities" were prohibited, and soldiers were obliged to show maximum restraint when firing at the enemy, even to the point of shooting at defended buildings rather than directly at their defenders in order to make them surrender.
These rules appear to have been mostly observed. When a stealth fighter attacked the main PDF barracks, it dropped a bomb fifty yards away in order to stun its defenders rather than destroy the building. Psychological operations teams equipped with loudspeakers played an important role in reducing the level of destruction by exhorting PDF forces to surrender or by simply calling telephones in defended buildings to persuade their defenders to give up-the "Ma Bell approach." Twenty-four radio programs and leaflet distributions disseminated the same message of the futility of resistance. The military's concern with keeping civilian casualties and physical damage to a minimum was partly influenced by the close proximity of some forty thousand Americans in the Panama Canal Zone and also by the desire to leave as much of the country's infrastructure intact as possible. These efforts also reflected the Pentagon's new emphasis on media presentation as an important factor in shaping military outcomes and preventing a repetition of the "living-room war" in Vietnam, where militarists have often cited the impact of television coverage of civilian deaths on international and domestic public opinion as a decisive factor in the U.S. defeat. Media coverage of the Panama invasion was therefore carefully managed in the U.S. Army's first use of the media pool system, and its specially selected correspondents saw little or nothing of the combat until it was over.
These efforts would not have surprised Sherman, who was famously hostile to the Union press and frequently banned Northern reporters from accompanying his armies. On one occasion, Sherman court-martialed the reporter Thomas Knox, who wrote a critical article on his failed offensive at Chickasaw Bayou, for making "sundry and false allegations and accusations" against the army "to the great detriment of the interest of the National Government and comfort of our enemies." 2 These charges were rejected at the court-martial, but Knox was banned from associating with Sherman's army. Pentagon efforts to control media coverage of the Panama War were more subtle but no less effective. Reporters found themselves forced to watch CNN reports or official briefings in windowless rooms.
As a result, few journalists saw the controversial series of events that followed the U.S. attack on the PDF military headquarters in the heart of El Chorrillo, one of Panama City's working-class districts, in the first hour of the invasion. Most of El Chorrillo's fifteen thousand residents were asleep when the attack took place, and they woke to find that their neighborhood had become a battle zone, as helicopters blasted the comandancia building and U.S. soldiers and Noriega loyalists fought running gun battles in the surrounding streets. Fires quickly spread throughout El Chorrillo, forcing most of its people to flee their homes. Pentagon spokesmen accused Noriega's paramilitaries of setting the fires, but residents insisted that they were spread by tracer bullets and artillery and some alleged that U.S. soldiers had intentionally burned down individual houses with incendiaries.
The Spanish journalist Maruja Torres watched what she later recalled as a bombardment-"a genuine, authentic, super-technical and modern bombardment by the most powerful army in the world, of one of the poorest neighborhoods in the capital" from her room at a Marriott Hotel.

Though the United States officially fought as part of a coalition, the war was always an American-dominated and American-dependent enterprise. Of the 956,600 troops deployed in Saudi Arabia and other countries at the war's peak, some 697,000 were American, and the U.S. military took care of the logistics and supplied most of the planes, missiles, and other weaponry for the ground and air campaigns. These forces faced some 545,000 Iraqi troops in forty-two or forty-three divisions, including elite Republican Guard units, equipped with some 4,200 tanks and 3,000 heavy artillery pieces, in Kuwait and along the southern Iraqi border. Expectations of potential heavy casualties shaped a coalition campaign strategy that was very different from Operation Just Cause.
The coalition commander, General H. Norman Schwarzkopf, planned to use airpower to cut Iraq's lines of communication with Kuwait. Having cut off the Iraqi army, the coalition would proceed to "kill it," as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell put it, with a ground offensive that drew heavily on Liddell Hart's indirect strategy. 
7
On January 16, 1991, Allied planes initiated Operation Desert Storm with multiple air strikes in Iraq and Kuwait. Over the next forty-two days, coalition planes dropped 88,000 tons of bombs in the most sustained and relentless bombing campaign in military history. More than two hundred Tomahawk cruise missiles fired from ships and carriers in the Persian Gulf added to the devastating technological assault. On February 24, the Eighteenth Airborne Corps, supported by the French Sixth Airborne Division and the 101st U.S. Airborne Division, entered Iraq from Saudi Arabia, having successfully reached their starting positions without detection.
By the end of the day, the Eighteenth Corps had advanced 170 miles toward the Euphrates River and the main highway connecting Iraq to Kuwait, completely circumventing Iraqi defensive positions farther south, before swinging back into Kuwait, where the 150,000-strong Seventh Corps had also made a decisive breakthrough. Battered by more than a month of air strikes, the much-vaunted Iraqi army quickly crumbled, and the "mother of all battles" never materialized, as hundreds of thousands of Iraqi soldiers surrendered in Kuwait and Iraq, while others attempted a chaotic retreat. On the night of February 26-27, more than a thousand vehicles, many of them carrying loot from Kuwait, were bombed and strafed by Allied planes along the Mutla Ridge on the road to Basra in what one U.S. pilot described as a "turkey shoot." Macabre photographs of wrecked vehicles and burned corpses along this "Highway of Death" became iconic images of the disparity between the contending forces. On February 28, Iraq agreed to a cease-fire, which was formalized on March 3. In all, coalition forces suffered fewer than two hundred casualties. Estimates of Iraqi military casualties initially ranged from 100,000 to 200,000 in the immediate aftermath of the war, but subsequent research put the number from the low thousands to 20,000-22,000 combat deaths cited in a 1993 survey by the U.S Air Force.

In the course of the war, coalition planes attacked more than three hundred targets in Iraq and Kuwait, many on multiple occasions. This campaign was intended to weaken and "degrade" Saddam Hussein's military machine and destroy his arsenal of chemical and biological weapons, but many of the bombs were dropped on "dual use" targets and inevitably killed civilians. Coalition spokesmen insisted that laser-and satellite-guided missiles and smart bombs made these raids less destructive to ordinary people than their predecessors. "For the first time we had a capability to focus on military targets and avoid civilian areas, "Schwarzkopf later declared, "so there was a degree of discrimination within the execution of the plan that made it much more palatable than it would have been … like the firebombing of Tokyo or something like that, that was just an indiscriminate destruction of the entire city." 
9
The rhetoric of "surgical" targeting also obscured the new forms of destruction resulting from a bombing campaign that targeted the "joints" of a modern industrial society, as opposed to indiscriminate carpet or area bombing. In addition to Baath Party headquarters and military bases, the United States blew up telephone and radio transmission towers and lines, food processing, storage, and distribution facilities, animal vaccination facilities, power stations, water treatment plants, irrigation water pumping stations, railroads, bus depots, oil wells and pumps, pipelines, refineries, and storage tanks to paralyze Iraq "strategically, operationally, and tactically," as U.S. Air Force secretary Donald Rice described it.
In these attacks, as a Department of Defense interim report prepared for Congress noted after the war, "It was impossible … to destroy the electrical power supply for Iraqi command and control facilities or chemical weapons factories, yet leave untouched that portion of the electricity supplied to the general populace." Yet the scope of the bombing campaign clearly went beyond "unavoidable hardships" and combined psychological, economic, and military objectives in a very Shermanlike attempt to target the enemy's will to resist-a goal made explicit by one air force officer who told a reporter, "Big picture, we wanted to let people know, 'Get rid of this guy and we'll be more than happy to assist in rebuilding. We're not going to tolerate Saddam Hussein or his regime. Fix that, and we'll fix your electricity.' "

Within a few months, most essential services in Iraq had been restored, much of its electricity grid was functioning again, and rationing was abolished. But the casualties of the bombing campaign were not limited to immediate wartime destruction. A 1993 study carried out by Beth Daponte and funded by Greenpeace claimed that 111,000 civilians, including 70,000 children and adolescents under the age of fifteen, had died from "warinduced adverse health effects" due to the disruption of food production and damage to water-treatment and sanitation facilities and the electricity grid.

16
The unraveling of Iraqi society was not due only to the bombs and missiles. In his authoritative study of the impact of war on civilians, the Oxford humanitarian ethics scholar Hugo Slim has written, "The two main ways of using food and starvation as weapons of war are through policies of blockade or scorched earth-the former often being a more subtle and more easily disguised form of the latter." 
17
Ostensibly intended to "contain" Saddam Hussein's regime and neutralize Iraq's ability to reconstitute its chemical and biological weapons programs, sanctions also had a wider purpose. In March 1991, the New York Times reported that "the United States has argued against any premature relaxation in the belief that by making life uncomfortable for the Iraqi people it will eventually encourage them to remove President Saddam Hussein from power." The U.S. deputy national security adviser Robert Gates also proclaimed, "Saddam is discredited and cannot be redeemed. Iraqis will pay the price while he remains in power. All possible sanctions will be maintained until he is gone." 
18
19
In a 1999 article in the journal Foreign Policy, John Mueller and Karl Mueller compared the impact of the sanctions to the atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and argued that "a so far futile effort to remove Saddam from power and a somewhat more successful effort to constrain him militarily" may have constituted "a necessary cause of the deaths of more people in Iraq than have been slain by all so-called weapons of mass destruction throughout history." 
20
21
Cockburn described the political advantages of "conduct-based targeting," which enables the United States government to wage a form of "modern economic warfare" that "bends the global financial system to its ends and can blight entire societies, operates well below the radar, frequently justified as a benign alternative to military action." In terms of their impact on the targeted society and their broader coercive intentions, sanctions can also constitute a "Sherman's march" without armies or soldiers. And in the case of Iraq, their full impact would not become clear until U.S. troops entered Iraq a second time, thirteen years after Schwarzkopf's troops hurtled through the Iraqi desert.
Even more than Panama, the Gulf War was a watershed in American warfare; it confirmed and demonstrated to the world the technological and organizational supremacy of the U.S. military. In a 1993 article in the military journal Parameters, Major Wayne K. Maynard compared the war to nineteenth-century colonial wars that "pitted small numbers of disciplined, well-trained Western troops with rifles against hordes of tribal warriors armed with only shields and spears."

Other analysts made similar arguments. Some air force strategists saw the Gulf War as a paradigm of "effects-based operations" (EBOs), in which conventional military power and nonmilitary capabilities have broad "effects" on the enemy, without inflicting mass casualties, through simultaneous attacks on multiple targets that isolate and neutralize enemy armed forces without actually destroying them. The Department of Defense articulated a vision of "network-centric warfare" (NCW), in which a fully digitized U.S. Army would be able to "see" all dimensions of the battle space and achieve "unequivocal military decision with minimum cost to both sides." Technological omnipotence has not always been seen as a justification for restraint, however. In a report to the United States National Defense University in 1996, the naval officers Harlan K. Ullman and James P. Wade elaborated a strategic doctrine called shock and awe. They proposed that space-based observation systems, sensors, computers, and robotics now made it possible to inflict "instant, nearly incomprehensible levels of massive destruction" on people and their resources so as to nullify "the will, understanding, and perception of an adversary" through "the non-nuclear equivalent of the impact that the atomic weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki had on the Japanese." 
27
The willingness to "frighten, scare, intimidate and disarm" was an essential component of Sherman's low-tech campaign of destruction, and it is possible to trace other continuities in the visions of perfect technological warfare that percolated through the U.S. military in the last decade of the century. In a 1989 article in the Marine Corps Gazette, the conservative military pundit William S. Lind argued that the U.S. military had entered a new era of "fourth-generation warfare" (4GW) that differed radically from a firstgeneration war like the Civil War. On the fourth-generation battlefield of the future, Lind argued, "the distinction between war and peace will be blurred to the vanishing point… . The distinction between 'civilian' and 'military' may disappear," and attacks on traditional military targets, such as airfields, communications facilities, power plants, and infrastructure would "become rarities because of their vulnerability," while psychological operations would become "the dominant operational and strategic weapon in the form of media/information intervention," to the point that "television news may become a more powerful operational weapon than armored divisions." 
28
29
From the military's perspective, the need for such management was underlined by the collapse of the U.S. military mission in Somalia when the deaths of eighteen U.S. soldiers and more than five hundred Somalis in the botched arrest in Mogadishu that Somalis now call Ranger Day led to a domestic outcry that forced the Clinton administration to withdraw. Restricted, false, or demoralizing information may be a weapon of modern war, but it's available to all, and weaker opponents can use it to compensate for lack of military strength, as the Pentagon discovered during America's last war of the century.
In its objectives and in the way it was fought, NATO's seventy-eight-day aerial campaign to force Serbia to withdraw from Kosovo in 1999 exemplified the new paradigm of "humanitarian war" and the emerging doctrine of responsibility to protect (R2P). Whereas Operation Desert Storm had been dictated by clear geostrategic considerations regarding the threat posed by Saddam Hussein to the world's key oil reserves, the NATO intervention in Kosovo was presented as an attempt to prevent "genocide"-the brutal repression of the Kosovar Albanians by the remnant of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) in its counterinsurgency operations against the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
On March 18, 1999, members of the NATO Contact Group presented the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY) with an ultimatum at the Château de Rambouillet in France, which called on Slobodan Milošević's regime to withdraw Serbian security forces from Kosovo and replace them with a NATO peacekeeping force. Milošević refused to accept, and each side blamed the other for the collapse of negotiations. On March 24, the ultimatum expired, and NATO warplanes began bombing targets in Kosovo, Serbia, and Montenegro as part of Operation Allied Force. As in the Gulf War, the U.S. military played the leading role in a nineteen-member coalition commanded General Wesley Clark, the supreme allied commander Europe (SACEUR). Unlike the war against Iraq, however, many members of the coalition had strong reservations about the use of force in Kosovo, and political considerations resulted in a very different campaign. Initially the coalition believed that Serbia would come to terms quickly through a limited and tightly regulated bombing campaign against "enabling" military targets, such as air-defense systems, army barracks, and antiaircraft installations, just as the Bosnian Serbs had done during NATO's Operation Deliberate Force in the autumn of 1995.
The ambivalence of some members of the coalition obliged a reluctant Clark to adopt a gradualist bombing strategy that harked back to the Vietnam War, a strategy that the U.S. military continued to regard as one of the reasons for losing the war. In order to keep collateral damage to a minimum, all bombing targets had to be approved by teams of lawyers, and particularly sensitive targets had to be personally approved by President Bill Clinton, Prime Minister Tony Blair, and President Jacques Chirac in order to reduce the possibility of "unintended consequences." These constraints resulted in a bombing campaign of remarkable precision. On April 3, the Serbian dissident journalist Jasmina Tešanović watched NATO planes bomb the Ministry of the Interior and other targets within twenty yards of the largest maternity hospital in the Balkans without damaging it, and she marveled at the skill of the NATO pilots "responsible for hitting military targets without harming a single new-born baby." 
30
The worst incident took place on May 16, when a cluster-bomb attack on an airfield in the city of Niš killed sixteen people and wounded sixty more. As in the Gulf War, these incidents were mostly due to operational and intelligence errors, but such mistakes became more likely as the list of targets widened. Despite the Bosnian Serbs' murderous ethniccleansing operations under Milošević a few years earlier, NATO was unprepared for Serbia's defiance and caught completely off balance by its ruthless expulsion of more than 90 percent of the Kosovar population into neighboring countries, which provoked an even worse humanitarian crisis than the one the bombing was intended to address.
By week three of the war, the absence of tangible gains prompted even the establishment journal The Economist to question the U.S. Defense Department's "post-Gulf-war prestige" and "the doctrines of high-tech dominance that the Gulf war encouraged people to believe." Faced with continued Serbian resilience and unwilling to mount a ground offensive, NATO intensified its effort with a bombing campaign based on the "four Ds"-"demonstrate, deter, damage, degrade." At the beginning of the war, the NATO "Master Target File" identified 169 targets. By its end, 976 targets had been hit, including oil refineries, petroleum depots, road and rail bridges, factories, the electricity grid, and "crony" targets-businesses and resources closely related to the regime. In theory, bombing was intended to prevent the Serbian security forces from carrying out military operations in Kosovo and force its government to submit to the terms imposed at Rambouillet. However, because many NATO members were reluctant or unwilling to undertake a ground invasion, airpower increasingly became a weapon of intimidation directed against civilians.
Though air strikes did not target civilians directly and NATO pilots went to considerable lengths to avoid civilian casualties, the coercion of the Serbian government was increasingly dependent on the use of force to make ordinary Serbs feel the impact of the war. In her wartime diaries, Jasmina Tešanović vividly describes the terror of her children, friends, and neighbors during the NATO bombings of Belgrade as they faced blackouts, water and food shortages, and the constant threat of death experienced by all civilians in such circumstances. Within four weeks, fifty-nine bridges, nine major airports, and 80 percent of Serbia's oil production facilities had been destroyed, in addition to 70 percent of its electricity grid.
On April 21, NATO attacked a new "military" target, using three cruise missiles to destroy the Belgrade headquarters of Radio Television of Serbia (RTS), run by Milošević's wife, Mirjana Marković, killing sixteen journalists and technicians. The attack on Serbia's television network reflected the coalition's frustration at the Milošević regime's careful control of the foreign media inside Yugoslavia and the media's role in mobilizing Serbian and international opinion. In a subsequent examination of NATO's failure to achieve "information dominance" in the war, U.S. Air Force Major Wayne A. Larsen argued that the Serbian television and radio network prolonged domestic resistance through its patriotic appeals to Serbian nationalism and its exploitation of "collateral damage incidents" for propaganda purposes. 
31
32
The extent to which Serbia's acquiescence was due to the fear of a ground invasion and pressure from its ally Russia are questions that have never been resolved. But NATO had achieved its objectives with no combat casualties on its own side and the loss of only two U.S. soldiers in a helicopter accident. Serbian military casualties have been estimated at between 5,000 and 10,000, while some 500 civilians were killed and 6,000 wounded. In Kosovo, 4,300 bodies of Kosovar civilians were exhumed by 2001, most of whom had been killed during the expulsions that followed the outbreak of war. In its after-action report, NATO hailed this outcome as a triumphant vindication of "the most precise and lowest-collateral-damage air campaign in history." 
33
34
A former critic of the Rolling Thunder bombing campaign, Clark argued that the road to "compellence" in war lay through the use of "decisive force" rather than "failed gradualism." He described Operation Allied Force as a form of "coercive diplomacy" that violated all the "principles of war" imbibed in American military academies. It was characterized by "extraordinary concern for military losses, on all sides. Even accidental damage to civilian property was carefully considered." These claims have not been universally accepted. In 2000 a Newsweek investigation accused the Pentagon of deliberately exaggerating the number of Serbian military targets during the war and discounting the impact of bombing on the civilian population. In Newsweek's estimation, "Air power was effective in the Kosovo war not against military targets but against civilian ones. Military planners do not like to talk frankly about terror-bombing civilians ('strategic targeting' is the preferred euphemism), but what got Milošević's attention was turning out the lights in downtown Belgrade." 
35
"In such dangerous things as war, the errors which proceed from a spirit of benevolence are the worst," observed the Prussian strategist Carl von Clausewitz. 1 For Clausewitz, war is "an act of violence pushed to its utmost bounds, as one side dictates the law to the other," thereby creating a "reciprocal action" in which attempt at moderation or restraint by one side can only be counterproductive, since "he who uses force unsparingly, without reference to the bloodshed involved, must obtain a superiority if his adversary uses less vigour in its application." From the Civil War onward, most American wars have been fought in accordance with these precepts. As George S. Patton once put it, "There is only one tactical principle which is never subject to change. It is to use the means at hand to inflict the maximum amount of wound, death, and destruction on the enemy in the minimum amount of time." America's dazzling high-tech wars of the last decade of the twentieth century seemed to herald another possibility, in which wars could be fought and won with minimal levels of "wound, death, and destruction" for civilians and soldiers alike. These expectations were partly a consequence of America's technological, tactical, and organizational superiority against enemies who could not even begin to retaliate in kind-an imbalance that naturally reduced the "reciprocal dynamic" Clausewitz described. In a 2000 treatise on urban warfare written for the U.S. Army's Command and General Staff College at Fort Leavenworth, the military historian Anthony Spiller predicted, "The era of the iron force is over. The nation that will lead the military world this next century already produces and employs its coercive power differently from any army in history. Finesse is replacing weight as the basis of American military power." 
2
The catalyst for this transformation took place on September 11, 2001, when nineteen hijackers enacted a spectacle of destruction and mass killing that had not been seen on American soil since the Civil War. The attacks on New York and Washington were frequently compared to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, and were immediately declared by the Bush administration to be acts of war, even though they were carried out by an amorphous nonstate terrorist organization that offered no commensurate military target. On September 20, 2001, George W. Bush promised the American people that the United States would respond to these attacks with a global "war on terror" that "begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated."
In this war, Bush warned, "Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success." The most obvious object for a military response consisted of the "al Qaeda bases" in Afghanistan, but Bush also issued a wider warning that "every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists."
Even at this stage, the CIA had already identified a "worldwide attack matrix" of targets for covert and overt military operations in more than eighty countries. In his January 2002 State of the Union address, Bush identified Iran, North Korea, and Iraq as members of an "axis of evil" whose development of weapons of mass destruction posed an ongoing security threat to the United States. Other countries were listed by the administration and its supporters as "outposts of tyranny" that also constituted potential enemies of the United States. From the outset, therefore, the "global war on terror" (GWOT) became a recipe for a rolling series of wars, military interventions, and covert operations directed not only against al-Qaeda, but against an array of "terrorist" organizations considered by the United States to be in some kind of alliance with Osama bin Laden's network and also against the states that were deemed to be their supporters. This framework transformed the world into a global battle space for the limitless projection of U.S. military power. Bush administration officials and intelligence officers repeatedly warned that such a war would not be subject to moral or legal restraints, and these claims were reflected in the introduction of new measures and procedures that included torture, or "enhanced interrogations," Special Forces assassination teams, trials of terrorist suspects by military courts, indefinite detention of "enemy combatants," and kidnapping, or "rendition," of suspects across international boundaries to secret prisons in countries with weak or nonexistent legal protections.
As in previous American wars, the determination to "take the gloves off" was justified on the basis that the United States faced an existential threat to its "way of life" comparable to Nazism or Communism from an enemy that did not fight by the same "rules." The persistent references by the Bush administration to the "evil" of al-Qaeda and the "axis of evil" that was somehow connected to it echoed the crusading zeal that was also intrinsic to American warfare. During the 2004 presidential election campaign, Vice President Dick Cheney mocked Democratic nominee John Kerry's proposal to wage a "more sensitive" war on terror, saying, "President Lincoln and General Grant did not wage sensitive warfare-nor did President Roosevelt, nor Generals Eisenhower and MacArthur." A "sensitive war," Cheney argued, would not "destroy the evil men who killed 3,000 Americans and who seek the chemical, nuclear, and biological weapons to kill hundreds of thousands more."

"No one starts a war-or rather, no one in his senses ought to do so," declared Clausewitz, "without first being clear in his mind what he intends to achieve by that war and how he intended to conduct it." This principle was entirely absent from the GWOT from its inception. In 2005 the U.S. Army's National Military Strategic Plan analyzed the first four years of the GWOT and offered strategic guidance for its future conduct. On the one hand, its authors defined al-Qaeda as a "movement" and identified its primary "center of gravity" as its "extremist ideology," which "motivates anger and resentment and justifies, in the extremists' eyes, the use of violence to achieve strategic goals and objectives." 
4
These recommendations suggested a calibrated and careful use of military force coupled with a global ideological attempt to win over al-Qaeda's potential constituency, but these guidelines were not always observed in the chaotic, incoherent swathe of global violence that ensued. Two full-scale wars and occupations, proxy wars like the Ethiopian invasion and occupation of Somalia, "targeted assassinations" by drones (unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs), and the global deployment of Special Forces death squads have generated "negative effects" that undermined the ideological justifications of the Bush administration's antiterror crusade. In Somalia, the United States gave diplomatic and military support in 2006 to Ethiopia's toppling of the Islamic Courts Union (ICU), a broad coalition of Islamist groups that opposed the corrupt and warlord-dominated Transitional Federal Government (TFG).
Regarded by the Bush administration as an affiliate of al-Qaeda, the ICU was followed by the far more radical al-Shabaab movement, which fought the Ethiopian army and the TFG in one of the bloodiest periods in Somalia's recent history. In 2007 some two hundred thousand people were driven from Somalia as a result of the fighting between the Ethiopian army/TFG forces and al-Shabaab. Though al-Shabaab's harsh version of Islam is now well known, its Islamist nationalist insurgency was fueled by the brutality of the Ethiopian security forces, which burned villages and shot, raped, and tortured Somali civilians with impunity.

On March 19, 2003, the U.S.-led coalition planes and missiles struck at targets throughout Iraq in the opening salvo of a war that, according to George W. Bush, was intended "to disarm Iraq, to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger." The following day, the U.S. Third Infantry Division and First Marine Expeditionary Force crossed the Kuwait border and raced into the Iraqi hinterland in a rapid two-pronged advance, while their British allies concentrated on Basra and the south. In seventy-two hours, U.S. forces covered 240 miles in a classic example of "indirect," fast-moving, deep territorial penetration in the tradition of Sherman's and Patton's armies.
In general, cities and urban areas were bypassed where possible; support troops were left to pin down their defenders and mop up, while most of the army drove north toward Baghdad. Despite occasionally stiff resistance and sporadic ambushes from the Iraqi army and the paramilitary Saddam Fedayeen, American firepower crushed the poorly armed and often badly led defenders. Despite a sandstorm on March 26, which restricted visibility, the first U.S. units reached the outskirts of Baghdad on April 4, three hundred miles from their starting point, and began conducting armored "thunder raids" into the heart of the city.
On April 10, Baghdad fell to coalition forces, and the Iraqi leadership went into hiding. The quick victory was a triumph for Bush and a vindication of his secretary of defense Donald Rumsfeld's doctrine of a nimble, high-tech army that was able to achieve rapid results through a combination of airpower and minimal ground forces. Whereas the Union had once taken four years to conquer 6 million Southerners with more than a million soldiers, in Iraq fewer than 160,000 troops had conquered a country of 30 million in what Bush described as "one of the swiftest and most humane military campaigns in history." Despite the frequent media references to the shock and awe that preceded the war, the bombing of Iraq owed more to Kosovo than to the first Gulf War. According to the U.S. Army's official history of the invasion, its planners were "haunted" by "images of Berlin, Hue, and Grozny" and determined to avoid "wanton physical destruction, rampant human misery, and post-fighting devastation" whose "human, political, and financial cost … would be unacceptable in a campaign of liberation." 
7
The unwillingness of the occupying forces to provide the necessary security and protection mandated by international law was an alarming indication of the lack of planning for postinvasion chaos, a lack that was even more mystifying given the U.S. Army's extensive experience with postcombat occupations. It is difficult to imagine that Sherman, with his very pragmatic attitude toward postwar stabilization and reconstruction in the South, would have approved of the catastrophic decision by the Coalition Provisional Authority to dissolve the Iraqi army, police, and bureaucracy overnight, and the disastrous consequences of this decision soon became even more glaringly apparent.
On May 1, George Bush announced from the deck of the carrier USS Abraham Lincoln that all major combat operations in Iraq were over. As the summer wore on, however, coalition troops found themselves subjected to daily attacks from an ad hoc array of demobilized soldiers and domestic and foreign organizations, using car bombs, suicide bombers, snipers, and the ubiquitous improvised explosive devices (IEDs), whose nineteenth-century precursors had so infuriated Sherman and his officers in Georgia. Some of the methods adopted to deal with this situation, such as the "porno interrogations" at Abu Ghraib and other detention centers, were historical novelties based on a catastrophically wrong-headed and often profoundly racist American understanding of Arab cultural norms, but others would have been entirely familiar to U.S. soldiers in the Philippines and Vietnam. First Lieutenant Paul Rieckhoff, a platoon leader in the First Brigade, Third Infantry Division, described the reaction of a Baghdad family to a noknock raid on their home in search of weapons and insurgents. "They screamed and yelled in Arabic. We screamed and yelled in English-sweat pouring, babies wailing, muzzles swinging and hearts pounding. We huddled them into the far corner so we could cuff them, control them, and search the house. The women cried uncontrollably, the men were angry and proud-always glaring… . We occupied their home, invaded their personal space… . We stormed into their house like the Gestapo."

In a press conference in March 2005, Jean Ziegler, the UN special rapporteur on the right to food, accused the coalition of "using hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population" in what he called a "flagrant violation of international humanitarian law." In some cases, most of the people were forced to leave, while military-age men were ordered to remain in quarantined towns or neighborhoods designated as weapons-free zones that could be fired upon with impunity by U.S. troops. As in the Vietnam War, houses used by rebels were blown up, and crops and orchards were also destroyed as a punishment for "allowing" insurgents to use their property to fire on U.S. troops.
Despite strict rules of engagement designed to prevent indiscriminate retaliation, U.S. troops frequently responded to attacks by firing into densely packed neighborhoods. On March 31, 2004, insurgents at the resistance stronghold of Fallujah ambushed and mutilated four private military contractors. The killings provoked a wave of revulsion in the United States, and politicians and media commentators urged the military to "raze" a "sick" and "diseased" city and subject Fallujah to a Carthaginian punishment. 
9
Following George Bush's reelection in November, the administration resolved to bring Fallujah, which it regarded as a symbol of the insurgency, back under control of the Iraqi Interim Government. To prepare, U.S. troops surrounded Fallujah and ordered civilians to leave. Some 350,000 people obeyed these orders, leaving an estimated 30,000-50,000 noncombatants and 4,500 insurgents in the city. On November 8, U.S. forces subjected Fallujah to a massive aerial and ground bombardment, followed by a ground assault by U.S. Marines, with British and Iraqi forces in support, in which insurgent fighters were shot or blown up in houses, mosques, and on the street, and burned to death with white phosphorus in "shake and bake" bombings.
As in the first siege, there were reports of civilians shot in their homes, in the streets, and in hospitals, in some cases while waving white flags. After three weeks, the military announced that the city had been brought under control. By this time, much of it had been reduced to what a Reuters correspondent called a "sea of rubble and death." In a visit to Fallujah in December, the New York Times reporter Erik Eckholm found "a desolate world of skeletal buildings, tank-blasted homes, weeping power lines, and several palm trees." 
10
11
The "pacification" of Fallujah had no impact on the insurgency, but other cities were subjected to similar operations. In 2004 the epidemiologist Les Roberts watched "the shredding of entire blocks" by U.S. gunships in Sadr City in Baghdad, the base of support for Shiite leader Muqtadā al-Ṣadr's Mahdi Army. During the siege of Ramadi in June 2006, some 70 percent of the population fled the cordoned-off city before U.S. forces carried out air strikes and a ground assault in which eight blocks of the city were systematically demolished and U.S. snipers on rooftops fired down at pedestrians. "They bombed the power stations, water treatment facilities, and water pipes," a local sheikh told the Inter Press Service reporter Brian Conley. "This house is destroyed, that house is destroyed. You will see poverty everywhere. The things that the simplest human in the world must have, you won't have it here." 
12
Insurgent car bombs and suicide bombings wreaked havoc among Iraqi civilians and security forces alike, and civilian "soft targets" were attacked with merciless ferocity. American occupation officials frequently emphasized the military's restraint and humanity in comparison with their "terrorist" opponents, but numerous testimonies from American soldiers, Iraqi civilians, and foreign journalists tell a story that recalls the Philippines and Vietnam, of an army permeated with contempt for Iraqi "hajis" and "camel jockeys" and terrified soldiers brutalized by a shockingly violent and unpredictable guerrilla war. In August 2006, a military court investigating the killing of three Iraqi prisoners at Samarra by soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division's Third Brigade heard testimony from a member of the unit who described "a culture of racism and unrestrained violence" encouraged by its commanding officer, Colonel Michael Steele, who reportedly gave knives to his troops as rewards for their kills in an attempt to foster a competitive body count of insurgents.
In 2008, Iraq Veterans Against the War conducted Winter Soldier hearings in Washington that recalled the 1971 Winter Soldier hearings held in Detroit by Vietnam Veterans Against the War. More than two hundred veterans described a war that bore little relation to its altruistic intentions. Two soldiers from the First Cavalry Regiment told the audience of a "weapons-free" assault on the Abu Ghraib neighborhood in April 2004 in which their unit bulldozed dozens of buildings, crushed vehicles, and left the streets "littered" with seven or eight hundred corpses of humans and animals. Various soldiers claimed that they were encouraged by their officers to take shovels or "drop weapons" with them on patrol that would be left on the bodies of civilians they shot to make it look as if they'd been attacking.

In January 2005, an article in Newsweek claimed that Pentagon officials were preparing a new policy in Iraq called the Salvador Option, modeled on the "so-called death squads" that had hunted down and killed "rebel leaders and sympathizers" in El Salvador during the 1980s. The article quoted one official who justified such actions by saying, "The Sunni population is paying no price for the support it is giving to the terrorists… . From their point of view, it is cost-free. We have to change that equation." 
18
As in El Salvador, American involvement in these operations is murky, but some paramilitary units, such as the Special Police Commandos, received training from U.S. military advisers, including Colonel James Steele, the former head of the U.S. military mission in El Salvador. The campaign of what can be described only as state terror carried out by the Shiite "pop-up" militias coincided with the escalation of raids carried out by Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) hunter-killer teams and the British Special Air Service between 2006 and 2008, in which thousands of "terrorists" were captured or killed. Though lawyers were supposedly present during the target selection process, it has never been explained who these targets were or what determined the decision to capture or kill them. Whether these operations merely coincided with the sectarian violence directed by the Ministry of the Interior or were designed to complement it, the state-directed campaign of terror ended the last prospect of a national resistance to the occupation unified across sectarian lines, and it drove the Sunni population to regard the U.S. Army as the lesser of two evils, at least temporarily, to the point where its leaders were increasingly willing to turn to their former enemy for protection.
A 1994 counterinsurgency manual, Foreign Internal Defense Forces: Techniques for Special Forces, which was used by U.S. forces in Iraq, emphasized the importance of "national programs to win insurgents over to the government side with offers of amnesty and rewards" in addition to the "persuasive power" that "pressure from the security forces" was able to provide. 
19
To the advocates of COIN, as this approach to counterinsurgency became known, the army had dangerously isolated itself from ordinary Iraqis by sealing itself up in fortified compounds and conducting large-scale operations with armored columns. Borrowing from a strategy developed by the French army in Algeria known as clear-hold-build, the "COINistas" advocated a return to small-unit operations in which U.S. soldiers would drive insurgents from a particular locality and "live amongst the people" in smaller forward operating bases in order to protect and gain the trust of the local population and bring them under the control of the Iraqi government.
COIN was given official status in the U.S. Army/Marine Corps Field Manual 3-24 (FM 3-24), which was presented to military officers and selected journalists with great fanfare in February 2005. Hundreds of delegates listened to Petraeus and the manual's authors expound the principles of population protection, nation building, cultural sensitivity, and "measured" force. These ideas were not entirely revelatory, and some commanders in Iraq already practiced them of their own volition. Nevertheless, some delegates were puzzled about how to fulfill FM 3-24's requirements to "apply force without killing or crippling the enemy" and about maxims like "The best weapons for counterinsurgency do not fire bullets" and "Mounting an operation that kills 5 insurgents is futile if collateral damage leads to the recruitment of 50 more." The former marine and military writer Francis West questioned the relevance of such methods in Iraq and exclaimed, "An insurgency-it's war! The weapons we have, the reason people want us there, is we kill people!"

In 2009, the incoming Obama administration announced plans for a troop surge in Afghanistan in an attempt to defeat the long-running insurgency that followed the toppling of the Taliban government in 2001-2. In June 2009, General Stanley McChrystal, the head of the Joint Special Operations Command in Iraq, was appointed head of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and U.S. Forces Afghanistan (USFOR-A) in preparation for the Afghan surge. The former director of JSOC hunter-killer teams in Iraq seemed an unlikely practitioner of nonkinetic warfare. Nevertheless, McChrystal issued a tactical directive to American and ISAF military units shortly after his arrival, urging his commanders to adopt the COIN approach and "avoid the trap of winning tactical victories -but suffering strategic defeats-by causing civilian casualties or excessive damage and thus alienating the people."

To officers like Tunnell, killing was the essential task of the infantry. In an article in Joint Forces Quarterly in 2009, Colonel Gian Gentile, a serving officer in Iraq and one of Petraeus's most articulate critics, also claimed that the army's "operational capability to conduct high-intensity fighting operations other than counterinsurgency has atrophied over the past 6 years" and called for a new balance between counterinsurgency and "operations at the higher end of the conflict spectrum." 
26
27
Similar incidents took place in other areas. In 2009 Matthew Hoh, a senior U.S. diplomat in Kabul and former marine, resigned in protest at what he called a "Special Operations form of attrition warfare" that had increased popular support for the Taliban. In April 2010, McChrystal admitted to his own officers, "We've shot an amazing number of people and killed a number and, to my knowledge, none has proven to have been a real threat to the force." Since his arrival, the number of IED attacks had soared from 250 per month to more than 900. In July that year, McChrystal was replaced by Petraeus, who continued to combine nonkinetic and population-centric counterinsurgency with an intensification of air strikes and special-forces raids. In August 2011, Petraeus left Afghanistan and the army to become director of the CIA. At his retirement ceremony, Admiral Michael Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, described him as one of the "great battle captains of American history," alongside Grant, Marshall, and Eisenhower, and claimed that "Afghanistan is now a more secure and hopeful place than a year ago" as a result of his efforts. These claims did not go unchallenged. In a book-length critique of COIN, Gian Gentile accused Petraeus and his colleagues of misapplying an already flawed and overrated strategy in Afghanistan and promoting a seductive but delusional form of sanitized warfare designed to conceal the unavoidable reality of "death, destruction, and human suffering." 
28

Such criticisms tended to ignore the fact that the "immutable principles" that Gates outlined were not necessarily appropriate to wars that U.S. armies were now fighting. With its scaled-down professional army and a public with a limited appetite for foreign military adventures, the minimization of American casualties was even more of a priority than usual for U.S. military planners, and reducing the extent-or at least the visibilityof wartime destruction was an essential strategic component of "information operations." These considerations have influenced the deployment of unmanned combat aerial vehicles (UCAVs) as an essential weapon of twenty-first-century American warfare. Initially used for surveillance during the Afghan War in 2001-2, these drones were subsequently fitted with missiles and have been used to kill hundreds of alleged terrorists and militants in various countries, including Iraq, Afghanistan, Somalia, Yemen, and Pakistan.
For the first time in military history, "pilots" thousands of miles away from the battle zone could observe, select, and kill specific persons in their cars, their homes, or public places, in town or countryside, in undeclared wars. From the perspective of the U.S. military and intelligence services, drones were the ideal weapon for media-managed warfare against a stateless enemy. They could simply kill people instead of trying to capture and arrest them, thereby eliminating the negative domestic political repercussions of taking casualties and the legal complications of due process and detention of "enemy combatants."
Reaper and Predator drones are often presented to the public as the ideal instrument of "humane" and "surgical" warfare, minimizing physical destruction and making it possible to selectively eliminate "high-value" targets rather than civilians. In 2012 President Obama stated that "drones have not caused a huge number of civilian casualties" but are a "targeted, focused effort at people who are on a list of active terrorists trying to go in and harm Americans" and were used only when there was a "near certainty" that civilian casualties could be avoided.

It's symptomatic of the strategic incoherence at the heart of this "long war" that the United States has tried to fight terrorism by terrorizing other societies thousands of miles away on the basis of nebulous assumptions about their cultural behavior, such as carrying guns or gathering in groups, while anthropologists gather information on rural Afghans in an attempt to win their hearts and minds. In effect, technology appears to have defied Sherman's dictum and proved that it is possible to make war "easy and safe"-for one side at least. In doing so, it has paved the way for a world in which fully autonomous drones may soon hover permanently over the world's "lawless" spaces and select their own targets on the basis of computerized data without any human input.
The U.S. military's embrace of drone warfare doesn't mean it has relinquished the search for destructive supremacy that has always been intrinsic to America's military objectives. In 2000, the Department of Defense published a remarkable document, Joint Vision 2020, which outlined its new grand strategy for future warfare. Elaborating on a strategic concept first mooted in a 1998 U.S. Space Command document, Vision for 2020, the DoD looked forward to the creation of "a force that is dominant in the full spectrum of military operations-persuasive in peace, decisive in war, preeminent in any form of conflict" that would make it possible for U.S. forces, "operating unilaterally or in combination with multinational and interagency partners, to defeat any adversary and control any situation across the full range of military operations" on land and sea, in the air, and in space. 
36
37
For the past decade the military has been developing a "prompt global strike" system to make it possible for submarine-based missiles to "strike virtually anywhere on the face of the Earth within 60 minutes." In the same period, the military's cutting-edge Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and a host of universities and military research institutes have continued to seek new technologies to extend the RMA into the indefinite future. Future developments include autonomous self-sustaining robo-soldiers, laser-guided bullets, cyborg "insects" that can spy or kill, and a semimythical weapon known as the rod of God or finger of God, which could destroy any target with a spacebased laser. 
38
Whereas Sherman once feared that the United States might become "like Mexico" as a result of the Civil War, the projection of U.S. military power in the early twenty-first century is often presented as an essential bulwark against global chaos and implosion of the international order. In The Pentagon's New Map (2004), the military geostrategist Thomas P.M. Barnett compared the U.S. military to a "SWAT team within any metropolitan police force" that would "enter and exit crime scenes according to circumstances" against an array of rogue states, terrorists, and drug lords that belonged to what he called the "non-integrating gap." Barnett lauded the U.S. military's unique ability to kill and destroy "bad actors while leaving behind societies otherwise unimpaired; it will surgically remove unwanted tissue, not riddle the body politic with smoking holes." These "surgical" interventions, Barnett argued, would facilitate postconflict integration of targeted countries into the international economic order and enable the United States to direct military force against "bad guys, using weapons with a real moral dimension, such as smart bombs and new nonlethal forms of warfare that target enemy systems without harming people."

It is 150 years since Sherman marched his army out of Atlanta and set out to "make Georgia howl." At that time, the destructive consequences of war between industrialized states and societies were still a historical novelty whose strategic implications were only just becoming visible to nineteenth-century armies. Today, at the beginning of the twentyfirst century, such confrontations have become something of a rarity. Sir Rupert Smith, the former British commander of UN forces in Bosnia and Wesley Clark's deputy in Kosovo, has argued that "war as battle in a field between men and machinery, war as a massive deciding event in a dispute in international affairs, such war no longer exists." For Smith, Sherman's "strategic decision to destroy the material base of the South … signalled the future direction of industrial warfare, both in the targeting of the enemy's industrial and economic infrastructure, and in the development of an industrial base at home."

Nevertheless, the notion of a general moral transformation in the conduct of war is exaggerated and likely premature. Many nineteenth-century governments and armies believed that the conduct of war had reached a new level of moral advancement, only to dispense with such assumptions in order to win the new wars they found themselves fighting. Today, many of the Union practices that so appalled Southerners during the Civil War are prohibited by a corpus of international humanitarian law and the accumulated laws of war that have developed since the Hague Conventions. Article 54 of Additional Protocol I of the 1977 Geneva Convention states:
It is prohibited to attack, destroy, remove, or render useless objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population, such as foodstuffs, agricultural areas for the production of foodstuffs, crops, livestock, drinking water installations and supplies, and irrigation works, for the specific purpose of denying them for their sustenance value to the civilian population or to the adverse Party, whatever the motive, whether in order to starve out civilians, to cause them to move away, or for any other motive.
These prohibitions are still subject to exceptions and reinterpretations based on specific and contingent notions of military necessity, just as they were in Sherman's time, and the ability to enforce them or punish those who break them still depends largely on who wins. Today many of the strategies and tactics that Sherman and his fellow commanders once applied remain intrinsic to war-forced removal of civilians, reprisals against noncombatants, starvation, devastation of infrastructure and industries, bombardment of towns and cities. The bloody denouement of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009, in which some forty thousand Tamil civilians were killed during the Sri Lankan army's bombardment of the "safe zone" adjoining the Indian Ocean; the destruction of some 2,800 Darfuri villages by Sudanese government forces and Arab Janjaweed militias; the scorched-earth campaigns waged by various warlords, armies, and rebel groups in the civil wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the siege and bombardment of Sarajevo by the Bosnian Serb army; the destruction of Grozny by Russian forces in the Second Chechen War; the bombardment of civilian areas by the Syrian army in the ongoing civil war-all these episodes demonstrate the continued prevalence of what Hugo Slim calls "anticivilian thinking and practices" in modern war.
In some cases, civilians may become indirect victims of military operations directed against armed opponents, but the proliferation of "wars among the people" means that civilians are likely to be deliberate objects of terror and intimidation. In 2006 Israel responded to a cross-border raid by Hezbollah fighters from Lebanon with a ground offensive in south Lebanon and aerial attacks throughout the whole country that were specifically intended to turn the Lebanese civilian population against Hezbollah. Airports, bridges, electrical facilities, ports, supermarkets, water-treatment plants, gas stations, and residential areas were targeted in seven thousand air strikes that reduced many neighborhoods to rubble, including the Hezbollah stronghold Dahiya in Beirut. The strategy of bombing civilians in response to armed attacks has a long-established tradition in Israeli military thinking, based on the belief that popular anger at the resulting destruction will be turned against Israel's enemies rather than Israel itself. These aspirations have never been realized, either in Lebanon or anywhere else, but Israel has never abandoned them. In 2008 Major General Gadi Eizenkot outlined a strategy known as the Dahiya doctrine. He promised, "What happened in the Dahiya Quarter of Beirut in 2006, will happen in every village from which shots are fired on Israel. We will use disproportionate force against it and we will cause immense damage and destruction. From our point of view these are not civilian villages but military bases."

The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan, the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine, the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf, and the fleets which ensure the blockade of Iraq… . Also the American army is part of the American people… . The American people are the ones who employ both their men and their women in the American Forces which attack us.

Today the United States remains a global military colossus with a defense budget in 2013 of $716 billion, more than the next ten countries combined. Though proponents of American exceptionalism still regard America's armed forces as an essential instrument for the world's salvation, the country's appetite for military intervention since World War II has left a trail of death, destruction, and chaos and produced very few positive results, either for the countries it set out to save or for the United States itself. Since the Bush administration launched its open-ended "war on terror" in 2001, American military power has been checked or neutralized by far less powerful opponents and has produced outcomes that are unlikely to produce the triumphal victory parades that once greeted Grant's and Sherman's armies. This disjunction between stated aims and actual outcome raises questions about the legitimacy of these wars, the strategies that have been adopted to win them, and whether they were ever winnable in the first place. In theory, the U.S. military's primary mission remains the defense of the nation, just as it was in Sherman's time, but the wars of the twenty-first century have been "defensive" only by an extremely elastic and tortuous definition of defense, which in the case of Iraq was based entirely on false and essentially fabricated premises. Stripped of its "preemptive" and "preventive" rationalizations, Iraq was a war of choice and another product of a culture of militarism that has become deeply rooted in the American elite since World War II, one that sees enemies and threats everywhere and uses these perceptions to justify the endless projection of U.S. military power in pursuit of geopolitical advantage and ultimately unrealizable fantasies of absolute military supremacy.
Enraged by the humiliation of 9/11, the United States has embarked on a succession of ill-conceived wars in the new century that have contributed little to its national interest but have enriched the weapons manufacturers, defense contractors, private military companies, and logistics and military-services companies that have profited from them. At a time when the U.S. economy has yet to emerge from its worst financial crisis since the 1930s, when its infrastructure and cities are crumbling, when the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq have drained the U.S. treasury of trillions of dollars, Dwight Eisenhower's warning of the dangers to the American republic of a preponderant military-industrial complex appears particularly prescient.
Like the Civil War, the war on terror was seen by some of its more fervent supporters as a moral crusade that would regenerate a supposedly decadent and materialistic American society with a new sense of purpose and "moral clarity." Since then these expectations have been eclipsed by Abu Ghraib, Haditha, the Stryker Brigade "kill teams," and the killing spree of Sergeant Robert Bates. "Clarity" has been conspicuously absent from a sordid trail of violence that has produced thousands of dead and wounded noncombatants and record numbers of military and veteran suicides. In 2013, a war-weary Congress and American public forced the Obama administration to back away from another potential Middle Eastern war, in Syria. This reticence may be the beginning of a new preference for diplomacy rather than war, or it may be just a fad. The retired colonel and Vietnam veteran Andrew Bacevich has written that Americans are "seduced" by war. Today that attraction may be wearing off. Bacevich has warned that America must wean itself from its "addiction" to militarism and its "outsize martial pretensions" or face ruin.
