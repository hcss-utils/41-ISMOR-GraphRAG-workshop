As the previous chapters have discussed, Western scholars state that China and Russia are major spoilers that could cause serious disruption in the prevailing international security environment due to their conflicts of interest with the United States, which is the creator and beneficiary of the current international order and which therefore stands to check China's rise and Russia's resurgence.
This thesis has aimed to add value to the literature about defense strategy implementation by China and Russia by providing a sideby-side view of the effect of these states' records of implementing their respective defense strategies.
While there is no standard measurement of how effectively a defense strategy is being implemented, Young's method offers a way to assess whether a defense strategy has sufficient funds to achieve its stated objectives.
Based on this method, this research finds that China has been effectively implementing its defense strategy, while Russia has not.
