Even as the Russians were finishing the capture of the last Ukrainian garrisons on Crimea, they seemed to answer the question about their next objective when small groups of pro-Russian "separatists" began demonstrating near and threatening to seize government buildings in cities across Ukraine's south and east, beginning a series of actions that would result in bitter conventional warfare and cost thousands of lives.
Given the same aggressor and victim it is valuable to examine the differences in conditions that resulted in completely opposite outcomes between the mostly bloodless annexation of Crimea and the very bloody war in eastern Ukraine.
