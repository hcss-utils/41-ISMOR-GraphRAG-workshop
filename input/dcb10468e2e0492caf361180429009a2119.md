Recent reporting reveals that Russia's INFOWAR agency has manipulated individual soldiers' social media profiles.
Attackers pose as a trusted source to a soldier (presumably as a fellow soldier or family member).
There is limited information available about what the "trusted source" communicates to the affected soldier.
However, the potential is extremely damaging and broad sweeping.
Unconfirmed reports demonstrate that INFOWAR agents encourage soldiers to defect or allege nonexistent family issues to distract the soldier from warfighting.
