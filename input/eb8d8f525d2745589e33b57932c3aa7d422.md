One may object, however, that the likelihood of such positive-sum multilateral involvement in Afghanistan coming so seamlessly to fruition is remote at best.

They most likely will.
Iran may continue to arm the Taliban.
India and Pakistan may prove irreconcilable in pursuing what, objectively, appears to be common interests.
An increased Russian military presence in the states surrounding Afghanistan, even for an allegedly "anti-drug security belt," may arouse American, Central Asian, and perhaps even Chinese suspicions of Moscow's alternative motives.
Additionally, and despite Western support for Islamabad during the July 2010 floods, increasing NATO-ISAF pressure on Pakistan may encourage that government to perceive itself as "constrained to consider response options."
