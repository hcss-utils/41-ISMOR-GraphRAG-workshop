The Russian Operational Concept: Factors that Influence a Slowly Emerging "Novelty," by LTC Sergiu Cirimpei, MDA, 49 pages.
The Russian Federation has changed its operational concept. Russian Armed Forces fight differently today from how they did after the collapse of the Soviet Union. This monograph answers the question: what factors influenced the changes in the Russian operational concept after the collapse of the Soviet Union? The monograph argues that the following factors influenced the change: Russia's assertive foreign policy, the perceived threat from the West, asymmetries with Western armies and their capabilities, untenable casualties, the generational change within Russian society and its armed forces, and the lessons that Russians learned from conflicts. Although most of these factors appear to be "commonsense knowledge" for Western countries, some of them represent, nevertheless, a "renewed thinking" for Russia.
The monograph first provides evidence that the current Russian operational concept is different from the operational concept inherited from the Soviet Union, and that there are seven major differences between the two "ways of war." Subsequently, the monograph analyzes two case studies -the Chechen wars and the 2008 Russo-Georgian war -in order to identify what changes occurred during and after these wars. The monograph claims that the factors identified above did change the Russian operational concept, but this change was an adaptation rather than a paradigm shift. It was a "novelty" within the old paradigm, a continuity rather than a contingency.
The monograph then analyzes what these factors mean to other countries. The monograph asserts that these factors represent strengths and vulnerabilities, which if properly exploited, may help counter the operational concept that they themselves created. Differences between the Russian operational concept used during the Chechen wars and the Russian operational concept during the 2008 war in Georgia ......
The Russian military's operational concept has significantly changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Following the independence of the Russian Federation, the Russian military inherited the Soviet operational concept. Today, nevertheless, there is evidence that the Russian "way of war" is different. There is sufficient literature describing how the Russian operational concept changed. However, fewer publications address the factors that influenced those changes.
The primary question this monograph answers is: what factors influenced the change in the Russian military's operational concept after the collapse of the Soviet Union? The monograph argues that aggressive Russian foreign policy, a perceived threat to Russia's national security, asymmetries with Western military capability and quality, generational change in Russian society, untenable casualties, and the lessons Russians learn from wars influenced the Russian military's change of operational concept.
The change from the Soviet operational paradigm did not occur immediately after the collapse of the Soviet Union. The initial hypothesis was that Russian Armed Forces underwent a paradigm shift of their operational concept after the 2008 Russo-Georgian war. However, as the monograph shows, it was not a revolution, but rather a slow adaptation to the prevailing paradigma slowly emerging "novelty."

According to US Army doctrine publication (ADP) 1-01, Doctrine Primer, an operational concept is "a fundamental statement that frames how Army forces, operating as part of a joint force, conduct operations." 2 For the purpose of this monograph, the Russian operational concept is a fundamental way that frames how Russian Armed Forces conduct operations.
Understanding the operational concept of a specific country is important because it is the core of doctrine and provides ideas about the potential future security policy. 3 R. G. Collingwood suggested that in order to understand the writings of a philosopher, we must first understand what question the philosopher is trying to answer.

The monograph contains seven chapters. The first chapter gives background information about the thesis. Following the introduction, Chapter 2 analyzes the operational concepts that the Russian Federation inherited from the Soviet Union and Russia's current operational concept. The purpose is to identify if there are differences between the two concepts, as well as what the main differences are. The next two chapters are the two case studies -the Chechen wars and the Russo-Georgia war. The purpose of these case studies is to reveal the path of the operational concept change, the change tempo, the specific changes that occurred, and the context in which those changes emerged. Chapter 5 identifies the specific factors that influence Russia's operational concept change. This chapter also analyzes potential implications of the new operational concept for NATO and countries that are within Russia's "near abroad."
The monograph has four tables designed to explain the main differences between Russian operational concepts at different times. Table

The following section describes and compares the operational concept the Russian military inherited from the Soviet Union with the current Russian operational concept. As the monograph demonstrates, there are important differences between the two concepts.
Russian Operational Concept -Adaptation or Paradigm Shift?
Before analyzing the evolution of the Russian operational concept, it is important to identify whether or not the operational concept changed and if it did, how significant the changes were. This chapter focuses first on describing the Soviet-Russian operational concept when the Soviet Union collapsed. The chapter then describes the current Russian operational concept.
Subsequently, the chapter analyzes what the biggest differences and similarities between the concepts are, and whether there was a paradigm shift or an adjustment to the prevailing paradigm.
Emergent Russian Operational Concept after the Collapse of the Soviet Union
After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia became an independent country. A few months after independence, the Russian Armed Forces continued using a doctrine that had great similarities with the draft 1990 Soviet Military Doctrine. Security policy of the Russian Federation was also based mostly on Soviet heritage.

Moreover, all the officers of the Russian Federation Armed Forces came from the ranks of the Soviet Armed Forces. They had Soviet education and thus, even when they modified some documents, those changes were initially insignificant. For instance, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Russian Federation modified the 1990 draft Soviet Doctrine. Russians added the 
5
Another reason why the changes were insignificant was the lack of perceived external threats. A review of the Russian professional military journals from 1992 reveals that the politicians and high-ranking military officials appeared to have transitioned to a neo-liberal institutional worldview (although not for a long time). In an article published in 1992, General V. P. Luzianin, mentioned that there was a new, multipolar world order and that the Western countries were no longer enemies to Russia; Western countries were partners. 
8
Overall, at the strategic level, the Russian Federation relied on nuclear deterrence, despite its "no-first-use" statements, until 1999. 9 If deterrence failed, the Russian operational approach would have transitioned to the deep battle concept. The essence of the offensive battle in depth was the simultaneous and massed use of combat resources throughout the entire depth of enemy defenses, with the goal of encircling or annihilating the enemy.

Other evidence of a conventional, large-scale focus was the priority order in which the 1992 Russian Federation's doctrine described various types of conflict. The first was global nuclear war, followed by the large-scale conventional war, and then local wars and local armed conflicts.
The Russian Federation changed the order in its 2000 doctrine and put local armed conflicts first. 
13
One could argue that Russian doctrine was more defensive if compared to the Soviet doctrine. However, a defensive posture was the result of unfinished Soviet effort. During the last decade of the Soviet Union, Soviet theorists tried to rebalance the offensive posture of the Soviet army with a more defensive one. Accordingly, the defensive posture of operations became more obvious and gathered momentum.

While there is a relative consensus about the operational concept that Russia inherited from the Soviet Union, there are very different opinions about the current Russian operational concept. Some experts call it "hybrid warfare," others call it "reflexive control," yet others name it "asymmetric" or "non-linear warfare." Whichever the description, this new Russian operational concept has distinct, although variable, characteristics.
The identification of "hybrid warfare" is probably one of the most common in the West. It derived primarily from the Russian operation in Crimea in 2014. From a Western standpoint, the key word in describing hybrid war is "multimodality," a fusion of regular and irregular warfare. 
15
Instead, Russians describe their way of war as asymmetric and non-linear with the purpose of confronting a stronger opponent. For instance, Colonel P. A. Dulnev and Colonel (retired) E. A.
Bzyugin, in their 2005 article, described the "asymmetrical" aspect of warfare as representing the way countries with weaker technologies, less advanced weapons and methods of fighting conduct warfare against stronger countries. 
16
17
General Gerasimov, Russia's Chief of General Staff, in his famous article in 2013, also explained the idea of using asymmetrical ways to achieve national aims. According to Gerasimov, "the role of non-military means of achieving political and strategic goals may have exceeded the power of force of weapons in their effectiveness." 
18
According to Kasapoglu, Russian non-linear warfare is "an attempt to catch up conceptually to the realities of modern war with which the United States has been grappling for over a decade in Iraq, Afghanistan, and elsewhere." 
19
20
21
Russian non-linear warfare does not intend to catch up, but instead seize the initiative from its adversaries. This means that Russians may have developed the non-linear approach as a reaction to Western overmatch, but the intent behind it is not reactionary-it is offensive.
In order to increase the non-linear approach's effectiveness, Russia must address significant challenges. First, in contrast with Soviet doctrine, an asymmetric approach can achieve only limited aims. Second, there should be a strong Russian deterrent against a potential conventional reaction by the "stronger state" to the non-linear Russian approach. For the Russian Federation, as it was for the Soviet Union in the past, this deterrent comprises both conventional forces and, more notably, nuclear weapons. Third, the targeted state should be in relatively close proximity to the Russian Federation and should have a population vulnerable to Russia's propaganda. Lastly, there are certain conditions that Russia must set in the targeted country to make the non-linear approach feasible. The Russian Federation's Armed Forces have a great responsibility in the last two tasks of influencing the local population and setting necessary conditions for the success of the operation.
The setting of favorable conditions strongly relates to the concept of "reflexive control" which Russians have studied since the 1960s. "Reflexive control refers to the systematic methods of shaping the adversary's perceptions, and thereby decisions and latently forcing him to act voluntarily in a way that would be favorable to Russia's strategic interests." 
22
23
24
Therefore, the current Russian operational concept is a "reflexive control"-driven, nonlinear form of warfare, in which unified action partners tailor non-linear operational approaches for specific missions to deceive and offset enemy superiority. The concept focuses on achieving limited aims at a minimal cost. In Clausewitz's terms, Russian warfare today focuses primarily on wars for limited objectives with limited means. Figure

From the collapse of the Soviet Union there were consistent standpoints in Russian doctrine. The main similarities were the fear of being surrounded by enemies and the protection of Russians abroad. 
25
However, the fundamental approach that underlines Russian operations has significantly changed. In other words, the operational concept is different. Table

As the following case studies show, changing the Russian operational concept was a long and emergent process. This change aligns more with adaptations rather than with a paradigm shift. 
There were many "anomalies" and not a real Kuhnean "crisis." Although the Russian military had previously participated in regional wars in the Republic of Moldova, Georgia, and other countries, the first time the Russian military faced an anomaly was during the Chechen wars.
Case Study 1: The Chechen Wars
This chapter represents a case study of the Russia-Chechen wars. The purpose of this study is to identify which of the seven major differences in the Russian operational concept (described in
Chapter 2) occurred during or immediately after the Chechen wars. As the case study reveals, the operational concept that Russian forces used in the First Chechen War was almost identical to the concept inherited from the Soviet Union. However, Russia has adapted their operational concept in several ways during and after the Chechen wars. Overall, three of the seven major differences occurred during and immediately after the First and Second Chechen wars.
The history of Chechnya suggests a secular enmity between Chechens and Russians. The Russian Empire incorporated Chechnya in 1860. However, Russians succeeded in conquering Chechnya only after a fierce resistance that lasted approximately thirty years.
26
27
On October 27, 1991, Chechens elected their president, Djohar Dudayev. Several days later, Chechnya declared its independence. 
28
29
Russian President Boris Yeltsin did not focus on solving the Chechen problem immediately because his preferences were to maintain control of other, apparently more urgent problems within the ex-Soviet region. 
30
After settling other issues in the ex-Soviet area in favor of its own national interests, Russia focused on Chechnya. Russia opposed allowing Chechens to become independent. By potentially granting independence to Chechnya, Russia would have had to assume high risks. The first was a geostrategic risk. An independent Chechnya would have probably aligned itself with Turkey, threatening Russia's southern frontiers. 
31

33
In August 1994, after a meeting of the Russian National Security Council, the Presidential Commission on Security, and the cabinet under Chernomyrdin, Russia decided to intervene indirectly by supporting the "Provisional Council," the Chechen opposition to Dudayev, as proxies. 
34
35
After failure of the "proxy" operation in November 1994, Russian leadership could not design a clear strategy for a direct intervention. This was partly because of divisions in the Russian central government.

do not appear to be mere shirking. As subsequent operations would show, Vorobyev was correct in his refusal.
Following numerous internal negotiations, Yeltsin issued on November 30, 1994 presidential decree No. 2137c (secret), authorizing the invasion of Chechnya. 
38
40
Consequently, Russia decided to conduct a limited war for limited objectives.
On December 11, 1994, Russian forces commenced offensive operations against Chechnya.

The Russian offensive was poorly coordinated and conducted. Not only did Russian commanders lack operational art (partly for objective reasons), but the shortfall of equipment and training further exacerbated the problem. As Antulio J. Echevarria puts it, "Operational art is nothing without operational capability."

During this time, Chechen insurgents conducted guerilla warfare in the mountains, waging essentially a war of attrition. This forced Russians to focus on counter guerilla operations, in other words on the "second grammar." However, this relative focus on counter guerilla operations was insignificant and for the most part unsuccessful for the demoralized Russians because they did not possess the combat power and skills to address Chechen guerilla attacks.

Robert D. Putnam, "Diplomacy and Domestic Politics: The Logic of Two-Level Games," International Organization 42, no. 3 (1988): 434-437, accessed November 23, 2016, http://www.jstor.org/stable/2706785. difference was in its practical application due to the limited size of the operational environment and that the operational environment was in Russia and not abroad.
Another aspect was the lack of ideology. During that period, Soviet ideology was in the process of being replaced by developing Russian nationalism, but the process was relatively slow.
For example, BG V. I. Reaboshapko argued that Russia should be proud of itself and should not feel humiliated. 
53
54
Another aspect of the operational concept worth mentioning is the lack of unity of effort throughout the First Chechen war. As Anatol Lieven describes, there was "sheer disorganization and internal divisions at all levels." 55 This is not surprising in light of the relatively weak leadership, unclear aims, and ineffective civil-military discourses. As one of the Russian battalion chiefs of staffs, Major Iurii Chirev, describes, "commanders at higher echelons and leaders at all levels were confused, while their soldiers were totally disoriented." 
56
From the seven main differences between the Soviet inherited operational concept and the current Russian Operational Concept identified in Table 
1
The Second Chechen War Chechens de facto won the First Chechen war and in 1997 elected Aslan Maskhadov as their president. Although Maskhadov's preferences were to have Chechnya under his control and continue negotiations for independence with Russia, he faced a very complex problem set and did not have the necessary power to address it. Maskhadov had to rule an unrecognized and devastated "country," with almost no internal coalitions and consensus, penetrated by extremist elements, with very limited resources, and with Russia not providing any substantial assistance. Therefore, Maskhadov's relative control decreased as the extremist and Islamic elements increased their influence in Chechnya.

59
President Yeltsin had substantial difficulties not only with the deteriorating situation in Chechnya, but also with his internal coalition and his popularity.

Russian politicians changed their narrative concerning Chechnya from reestablishing constitutional control to defeating terrorism. The emphasis on "terrorism" provided legitimacy for the upcoming operation. As a result, in contrast with the first war in Chechnya, there was more popular and political support for the second war. At the same time, the Russian media fueled nationalistic sentiments, even xenophobia and racism.

Just as politicians prepared themselves better for the upcoming operation, so did the armed forces, but only to a certain degree. In contrast to the First Chechen Campaign, the Russians, according to Copp, "had a plan to destroy illegal Chechen armed formations and their bases in Chechnya." 68 Russia intended to dislocate the Chechens from Dagestan and then destroy the rebels in Chechnya. Prior to the Second Chechen war, there were indicators that Russia had transitioned from a "first grammar" focused operational approach to a more of a "second grammar." An instance of that was the decision to operate in Dagestan first rather than directly in Chechnya. This appeared to be in concert with some of the counterinsurgency/counterrevolutionary theorists, like John McCuen, in that the government should "prevent establishment of revolutionary bases in underpopulated areas" and in areas bordering the zone under rebel control. 69 However, Russia's subsequent actions would contradict this apparent "second grammar" focus. The atrocities that Russian forces committed in Chechnya, coupled with the extensive reliance on firepower, were clearly in contradiction with counterinsurgency theories of "winning hearts and minds." Nevertheless, after defeating the rebels in Dagestan, Russian forces were postured for what would be called the Second Chechen war.
Putin declared that the military objective was to "re-conquer Chechnya." This represented a policy shift in light of Russia's promises in 1996 not to decide the Chechen status until December 2001. 
70
71
68
There are indicators, although weak, that Russians tried to achieve unity of effort during the Second Chechen war. For instance, throughout the campaign, gas and electricity were cut off. This was not done in the first campaign. 
73
74
75
After the seizure of Grozny, the situation was not under full Russian control yet. A number of rebels were still active, mostly in mountainous areas. The solution that Russian leaders envisioned was Chechenization. The process of Chechenization resembled a subsequent phase of the war. It started on October 5, 2003 when the Russian government installed Akhmad Kadyrov as the president of Chechnya. 
76
72
73
74
75
76
Opposition fighters killed Akhmad Kadyrov in 2004, but the Chechenization did not stop, as his son, Ramzan Kadyrov, took charge of Chechnya with the same efficiency and positive results for the Russians as his father. 
78
The type of warfare that the Russians fought initially did not differ from the Soviet "Combined Arms Air-Land Battle." It just was on a much smaller scale, yet perhaps more brutal.
However, the type of warfare did shift towards non-linear warfare when Chechenization started.
Moreover, the attempts for unified actions and interoperability represent limited adjustments in the primary operational approaches. As far as means, there was no significant change. Large armored and conscript-based infantry formations, supported by massive artillery fires and aviation remained the primary means. An emerging change was the ideology. While during the First Chechen war, Soviet ideology was already obsolete and there was no other ideology to replace it; during the Second Chechen war, Russian cultural relativism started to emerge. 79 However, this new ideology was still weak and could not influence the operational concept.

There is solid ground to infer that solving the Chechnya problem freed Russia from its major domestic problem, and thus provided flexibility for a more assertive foreign policy.
This chapter represents the second case study, the 2008 Russo-Georgian war. Similar to the previous chapter, the purpose is to identify which of the seven major differences in the Russian operational concept (analyzed in chapter 2) occurred during or immediately after the war in Georgia and in what context. Unlike the campaigns in Chechnya, the 2008 war was a short, high tempo war with better strategic and operational planning from the Russian side. It also involved a better-suited operational approach. This supported Russia achieving its strategic aims in Georgia. At the same time, Russia made its decisions based on the perceived threat of NATO expansion, which Russia considered to be to the detriment of its national interest.

3. Destroy Georgian Armed Forces so that Georgia would not be able to threaten South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
In order to achieve these objectives the Russians employed a strategy that was essentially a combined political-military campaign.

The fact that Russia did not use vertical envelopments despite the large number of airborne units involved indicates that Russia lacked coordination.

The Russian military had addressed them ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union. For example, General-Colonel Bukreev mentioned most of this issues in his 1996 article "On Increasing the Efficiency of Staff Operations."

Had the Georgians assumed that Russia would invade into Georgia, they could have fought a more "second grammar" type war. Given their tactical advantage, Georgians could have prolonged the war and finished the war on different terms. Even prior to the 2008 Russian invasion, Georgian officers proposed an unconventional war approach against a potential Russian invasion of Georgia, believing that it may be the only feasible operational approach to counter Russia. 
125

Although the number of casualties during the operation could not make Russians rethink their operational concept in Grozny, they nevertheless made them rethink some tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Russia was traditionally less averse to casualties compared to other nations and, therefore, casualties should not have influenced the operational concept as much. Nevertheless, in the case of Chechnya, the relationship between the belligerents was asymmetric because Chechens fought a total war for survival while Russia fought a limited war for limited aims. This asymmetry, in theory, brings constraints in terms of military resources for the side fighting a limited war. 128
Casualties were among those constraints. Moreover, the relatively uncontrolled media displayed images from the Grozny onslaught, which led Russia to lose the information war. 
129
The second factor that influenced the way Russians were fighting was lessons learned.
Russia, like most armies, had a culture of analyzing lessons after each conflict.

131
Consequently, the main causes that influenced adaptation of the Russian operational concept during the Chechen wars were the untenable casualties and the lessons learned during and after each war.
In contrast to the relatively small adaptations in the Russian operational concept during the Chechen wars, the 2008 Russo-Georgian war had a greater impact on the operational concept.
However, what is distinct about these changes is that almost all of them occurred after the Russo-Georgian war and not prior or during the war. Although the lessons learned from Afghanistan and both Chechen wars were not yet fully implemented, lessons from the 2008 war significantly influenced immediate reform. 
132
133
134
According to Klepper, Russian forces "appeared highly reminiscent of the Red army…and were technically and tactically inferior to their Georgian counterparts." 
135
The next factor that influenced the Russian operational approach was the asymmetries in conventional capabilities between Russia and Western countries. The 2008 war indicated that Russia would be at a disadvantage in a conventional war with a Western army. The question that probably arose in the minds of Russian strategists after this war was how could Russia conventionally confront a Western military of a much bigger size and equally or better trained than Georgia? In a potential confrontation with NATO, Russia would not have such a numerical advantage to overcome capabilities asymmetries. Nuclear weapons served well as a deterrent.
However, for accomplishing foreign policy aims by using the military instrument of national power, nuclear weapons were not an option. Having these asymmetries in conventional capabilities forced Russians to consider ways to overcome their disadvantages.
The Russians were thinking about asymmetries with the West since the mid-nineties, but they were thinking in a linear way in terms of numbers. For example, Lieutenant General V. G.
Reznichenko, in his 1996 article "About Russian Military Doctrine," emphasizes NATO's overmatch in numbers, and not capabilities. 
136
In contrast to the prevailing thinking of the mid-nineties, Russian officers viewed asymmetry in a different way after the Russo-Georgia war. For instance, the candidate of "military scientist" degree, Colonel I. V. Krinitskii, provides in his article "Asymmetric Means and Ways of Warfare" a modified concept of asymmetry. 
137
138
139
140
The factors that influenced the operational concept change were not limited to military and political aspects only. They closely related to Russian society and culture as well. There are indicators that suggest a generational change in Russian society and, consequently, a generational change in the armed forces too. These causes emerged before and during the Second Chechen war, but they influenced the operational concept much later-before and during the invasion of Georgia.
Partly because of effective information operations and control of the media, partly because of the period elapsed from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian society and the Russian Armed Forces started to embrace cultural relativism, becoming more nationalistic and more proud of themselves. This helped recruit soldiers and, most importantly, it provided the popular passion for war. Moreover, a much more effective civilian-military discourse emerged after the 2008 war. A good comparison of that is the resignation of General Vorobyev in 1994 versus the influence that General Gerasimov has had since 2012.
These changes influenced society and the armed forces alike. For example, several readings emphasized the importance of raising patriotism. One of those articles, "Cadet Education in Fostering the Moral-Physiologic Training of Troops," explains the need for patriotic and moral education and provides potential ways to do that.

There is no doubt that if there will ever be an existential threat to the Russian Federation from outside, the factors that this monograph argues for will have a different (for the most part lesser) impact. For instance, it is highly likely that casualties will not have as big of an impact during an absolute war as during a limited war. However, Russia is currently less likely to engage in absolute wars, nor does it perceive other countries as intending to engage in absolute wars with Russia. In its 2014 military doctrine, Russia states that the probability of someone launching a fullfledged war against Russia is low.

Implications for the Countries within Russia's "Near Abroad"
The factors that this monograph identified provide insights about Russian armed forces' vulnerabilities and potential ways to exploit those vulnerabilities. First and most important, Russia is still slow in changing its paradigms and even in adapting to new realities of warfare. A single crisis is less likely to trigger significant changes in the way Russia fights. This means that staying "one step ahead" of Russian decision-makers will provide an important advantage to the aggressed state. Proactivity versus reactivity in relation to Russia is imperative.
Second, in a limited war scenario, Russia is sensitive to its own casualties. Successful information operations could show the Russian population the real cost that Russia is paying while conducting military operations. This could weaken the popular support for such campaigns. Even if Russia were resilient to its own casualties from a popular support standpoint, it would not be as resilient from a financial standpoint. Currently Russian Armed Forces employ professional soldiers to execute operations. Replacing well-trained soldiers is expensive and requires time.
Third, Russia uses "reflexive control" to make the opponent fight on their terms, as the Georgia case study demonstrated. Instead, while exploiting Russian inflexibility and other vulnerabilities, it is important to fight on terms that are less favorable to Russia (i.e., night operations). Although advantages in hardware are good, for small countries it may be difficult to keep up with the quantity required to fight Russia. In this case, determination, mobility, flexibility, unity of effort, and mission command would be necessary for countries opposing Russia. In other words, NATO and the countries threatened by Russia should develop and maintain asymmetries in relation to Russian military capabilities.
Lastly, some countries may not have the capabilities to confront Russia conventionally. In such cases, making the aggressed country "indigestible," as Georgian officers had proposed prior to the 2008 invasion, by fighting an unconventional war against Russia, may be the only feasible solution, but nevertheless a solution.
The purpose of this monograph was to identify what caused changes in the Russian operational concept. The initial hypothesis of this monograph was that Russia underwent a paradigm shift in its way of fighting and that the shift occurred after the Russo-Georgian war in 2008. Rather than the paradigm shift, research showed that there were a series of adaptations in the Russian way of fighting. This means that the Russian military, although it adapts slowly, does not need a crisis to evolve. Subsequently, the analysis of the ex-Soviet operational concept and the current Russian operational concept demonstrated that there are seven major differences between how Russians fight today and how they fought at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union.
Further, the case studies of both Chechen wars and the 2008 Russo-Georgian war identified that an aggressive Russian foreign policy, the perceived threat to Russia's national security, the asymmetries with Western military technology and quality, a generational change in Russian society, untenable casualties, and the lessons Russians learn from wars influence the Russian military's change of operational concept.
Although Russia has always adapted to new realities, what makes this change more significant this time is the change in their thinking process. The Russian military, as Donovan mentions, "is observing other militaries and trying to blend its operational thought and capability into an emerging Russian way of waging war that is effective in achieving tasks proportionate with its geostrategic aims."

Changes in the Russian operational concept occurred over a period of more than twenty years. Change involved adaptation and not a sudden paradigm shift, continuity rather than contingency, an evolution rather than a revolution. Russia's changing tempo has been historically slow and it remains relatively slow. The factors that made Russia change its operational concept represent vulnerabilities that, if properly exploited, may help counter the operational concept that they themselves created.

Subsequently, Georgia identified two main objectives: the first was to quickly destroy South Ossetia separatist forces and seize their "capital" Tskhinvali. The second objective was to block the Roki Tunnel, in order to prevent Russian volunteers from reinforcing the separatists.

According to Thomas S. Kuhn, "novelty" is a change that emerges with difficulty. Moreover, "novelty" emerges against the background provided by an already existing paradigm. Thomas S. Kuhn, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions (Chicago, IL: University of Chicago Press, 1996), 65.

In contrast to the wars in Chechnya, the 2008 invasion of Georgia is an instance of Russia using its military instrument of national power outside Russian borders, in a blunt violation of a foreign country's sovereignty. The roots of the conflict go back to 1991, when Georgia, one of the fifteen Soviet Republics, aligned itself with the West.
