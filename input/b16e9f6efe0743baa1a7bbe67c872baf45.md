Beyond its own neighborhood, the security policy goal of stability involves thwarting perceived U.S. attempts at regime change globally, and particularly vis-Ã -vis Russia, supporting like-minded sitting (mostly, but not exclusively, authoritarian) governments and deterring the United States from taking steps to undermine Russia's domestic stability.
A second consensus security policy goal is retaining and increasing Russia's influence in its "near abroad"; that is, to be the political, economic, and security center of gravity in the region that consists of the 11 other non-Baltic former Soviet republics (the Baltic states, having joined North Atlantic Treaty Organization [NATO] and the European Union [EU], seem to be viewed in the same, more "foreign" category as the east and central European countries).
