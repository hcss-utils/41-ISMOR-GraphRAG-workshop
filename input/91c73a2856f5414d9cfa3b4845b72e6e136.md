Russian military actions taken in Chechnya, Georgia, and especially Ukraine are more limited in nature due to the political repercussions these conflicts could cause.
It should also be noted that these actions were taken against former Soviet states in which two had political aims to join NATO.
These types of conflicts are likely to occur in the future if NATO continues to expand into Russia's "near abroad".
The political factors of Russia attacking a former Soviet state is very different than if it became a US/NATO war with Russia.
Russia would not be as restrictive, and the tactics would be much more like the Zelenopillya example using much more artillery and massed fires.
In Zelenopillya, Ukrainian vehicles were an easy target, parked in a motor pool-like fashion.
Russia attacked these using high-explosive fuzes, the most basic and most jam-proof fuze, to attack the target.
Russia is aware of Western countermeasures and, where appropriate, will continue to use artillery techniques which will not be defeated by modern technology.
