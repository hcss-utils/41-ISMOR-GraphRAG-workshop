Against India, China would have the ability to cover Indian cities many times over with nuclear MRBM warheads, allowing it to position a part of its force opposite India, and a part opposite targets in Northeast Asia and probably Russia (since some Russian targets would be within MRBM range).
China could barely cover India's airfields with its entire fleet of nuclear MRBMs in 1999, but the enhanced, MIRVed payloads of 2010 would allow China to threaten well both Indian cities and military targets like airfields.
Chinese nonnuclear ballistic missiles would provide less coverage of Indian targets, though potentially enough to provide some powerful coercive potential below the nuclear threshold.
A key issue is thus how India might react to Chinese ballistic missile attacks with CW, recognizing the Chinese potential to escalate to nuclear attacks against India with devastating consequences.
