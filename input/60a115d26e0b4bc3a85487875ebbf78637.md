The four major strategic shocks-the so-called Bronze Soldier Monument Coup d'Ã©tat in Estonia in April 2007, the five-day Russo-Georgian War in 2008, Russia's "hybrid war" campaign against Ukraine in early 2014, and Russia's full-scale unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022-are just a few examples that have once again confirmed the Russian Federation's aggressive foreign policy strategy and determination to employ multifaceted means including full scale unprovoked military invasion to achieve its goals.
Furthermore, the perverse and antisocial means by which the Russian Federation achieves its foreign policy objectives have significantly impacted Estonia's National Security Strategy and increased the population's desire to participate.
Notably, Russia's aggression against Ukraine since 2014 has resulted in a genuinely tectonic shift, as most Estonians now view national defense as their top priority.
