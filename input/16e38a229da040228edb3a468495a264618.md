There was no "separatist" movement in east Ukraine and the fighting there was not a civil conflict or an internal dispute.
The war in eastern Ukraine was entirely a product of the Kremlin's design, as were the armaments and Russian troops who made up the bulk of the pro-Russian forces.
This was an invasion of Ukraine by Russia as was the Crimean operation by Vladimir Putin's own admission after months of public claims to the contrary.
The West must "counter, not abet, Russia's hybrid war by speaking clearly, consistently, and publicly about Russia's war against Ukraine."
