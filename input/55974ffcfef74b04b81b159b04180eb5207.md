Despite the obvious asymmetric threat invited by our overwhelming reliance upon space-based assets, China's ASAT test fundamentally contradicts its adamant opposition to American withdrawal from the ABM Treaty and the subsequent deployment of a ballistic missile defense shield.
Both China and Russia have sought to limit American space capabilities by proposing an international ban on weapons in space in order to deter a new "space race" and prevent American hegemony in space.
Surely disingenuous, China's Foreign Ministry replied to U.S. and Japanese concerns about its ASAT test by stating: "Since other countries care about this question and are opposed to weaponization of space and an arms race in space, then let us join hands to realize this goal."
However, an "arms control regime" prohibiting the "militarization" of space would present a nearly insurmountable verification challenge and would only serve to handicap the United States and others who would adhere to their treaty obligations.
At least two potential adversaries, Russia and China, are known to have demonstrated ASAT capability.
General Maples, Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified before the Senate Intelligence Committee in January 2007 that "while Russia and China continue to be the primary states of concern regarding military space and counter-space programs … several countries continue to develop capabilities that have the potential to threaten U.S. space assets and some have already deployed systems with inherent anti-satellite capabilities … [including] kinetic or directed energy weapons capabilities."
