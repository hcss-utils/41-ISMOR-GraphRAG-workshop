Russian media outlets could flood Western media using information warfare and counter narrative with propaganda that Russia is merely providing humanitarian aid.
The Black Sea Fleet's naval vessels could be carrying aid that doubles as military sustainment; however, the Russian President will continue to issue statements that Russia is currently not involved with any ground-based forces.
During these Russian deception tactics, the Ukrainian military will attempt to mobilize and begin its counteroffensive into the southern Odessa, Mykolaiv, and Kherson regions to end civil unrest.
