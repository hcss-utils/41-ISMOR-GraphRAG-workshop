.23  There is an argument that U.S. forward presence could provoke U.S. adversaries and actually increase the chances of conflict, short of war.
Statistical analyses of historical cases, for example, show that increased forward presence generally decreases interstate conflict but increases the chances of militarized disputes. (

That said, if Russia's actions in Ukraine or China's actions in the South China Sea are driven by motivations other than a negative reaction to U.S. forward presence, the greater chances of deterrence might be worth the added risk of provocation.
