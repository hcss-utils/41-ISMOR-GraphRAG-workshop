Western European Way of War Relevant Question #1: Posture toward War Historically, practitioners of the Western European way of war pursued a proactive-offensive posture to wars, which is one of the most significant differences with the Korean way of war.
Most of all, they used to adapt proactive strategy toward wars in history.
For example, Britain deployed their military forces into the Western European continent and fought against Napoleon's troops during Napoleonic Wars even though they had not been invaded directly.4 5F 1 Additionally, Britain proactively involved itself in the wars of the continent once World War I and the World War II began.4 6F 2 As another example, Germany preemptively initiated the Austro-Prussian War in 1866 and the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 in order to achieve and extend their unification.4 7F 3 Also, starting the World War I, they adopted a invaded France as a way of response to the increased crisis in the region.4
