After the Russians occupied Afghanistan in 1979, Pakistan provided sanctuary for the mujahideen and the conduit for U.S. nances and equipment.
When the Russians withdrew in 1989, the United States lost interest in Afghanistan, and the mujahideen deteriorated into warlords squabbling over spoils.
Pakistan, having developed nuclear weapons to o set India, threw its support behind the nascent Taliban in order to create a client state on its western border.
