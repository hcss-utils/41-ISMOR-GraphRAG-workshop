The renewal of great power competition with Russia, which was underscored by Russia's seizure and announced annexation of Ukraine in March 2014 (which the United States does not recognize) 40 and Russia's subsequent actions in eastern Ukraine, has led to a renewed focus in U.S. defense planning on strengthening U.S. and NATO military capabilities for countering potential Russian aggression in Europe.
41 Some observers have expressed particular concern about the ability of the United States and its NATO allies to defend the Baltic members of NATO in the event of a fast-paced Russian military move into one or more of those countries.
