The 2018 National Defense Authorization Act acknowledges the Russian threat posed to the United States and Western democracies.
As it states, "Russia's ongoing malign influence activities-misinformation, disinformation, propaganda, cyber-attacks, election interference, active measures, and hybrid warfare operations-pose not only a threat to the security interests of the United States and those of our allies and partners in Europe but also to the integrity of Western democracies and the institutions and alliances they support."
60 Increasing the resilience of the United States against Russia's nonlinear warfare and its attacks on democratic institutions requires a whole-of-government approach that mobilizes all resources across the spectrum of US national power.
