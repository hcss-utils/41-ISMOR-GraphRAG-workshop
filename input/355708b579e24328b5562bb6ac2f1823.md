This study is an examination of building partner capacity (BPC) in the current and future context of U.S. global strategic competition with great power rivals-namely:
China. Each U.S. security partnership is a unique and complex adaptive system, meaning it displays certain characteristics at the local level that lead to system-wide emergent properties over time. Reductionist methods of analysis cannot explain such systems because their components interact in dynamical and non-linear ways that display aggregate behavior. Therefore, policy and strategy formulation should begin with a systems-minded approach in order to understand the specific dynamics and relationships of a particular partnership ecosystem. The reason for selecting a single security partnership system is to demonstrate the utility of employing a systems methodology to identify both the unique attributes of the system as well as its potential commonalities with other systems. It is then possible to extrapolate relevant conclusions and implications that may apply to the greater context of partnerships in global strategic competition writ large. The reason for selecting Taiwan as the systems "case study" is principally because the "cross-strait" security dilemma is one of the most pertinent and challenging issues facing the United States and its allies today. The "question" of Taiwan's existence is one of the greatest geopolitical phenomena in history and also one of the most dangerous flashpoints for armed conflict in the world today. There is a sense in which-if it is possible to understand the problem accurately and create an effective deterrence strategy for such a complex situation as Taiwan-it is possible to do so with other partnerships and problem-sets that do not possess some of the singular characteristics as Taiwan does. No other state is as politically sensitive for military engagement and security assistance than Taiwan. Moreover, selecting Taiwan is germane because of its central importance in the grand strategy and foreign policy of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP).2 F 3 The United States and Taiwan can exploit this susceptibilityas this study proposes-to successfully compete with and counter the CCP's long-term, grand strategic goals. The reason for selecting the PRC is its relevance and timeliness as the United States' "most significant competitor" and "pacing threat," as U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin declared during his Senate confirmation hearing in January 2021.3 F 4
This introduction provides the reader with context and direction in order to apprehend the overall trajectory of the study. Although each chapter builds upon the introduction and preceding chapters, each is also semi-autonomous from the whole and provides a singular lens from which the reader may view the strategic problem.
In the immediate aftermath of the chaotic withdrawal of U.S. forces from Afghanistan and rapid takeover of Kabul by the Taliban in mid-August 2021, many around the world began to call into question the credibility of American security commitments and partnerships. Opportunistic foreign adversaries and major news media outlets echoed the same sentiment: that allies and partners could no longer trust the United States after witnessing its frenzied departure from Afghanistan. A New York Times columnist forewarned that "every ally-Taiwan, Ukraine, the Baltic states, Israel, Japan-will draw the lesson that it is on its own."4 F 5 A day later, before the fateful ISIS-K suicide bomber attack and before evacuations from Hamid Karzai International Airport had yet concluded, a chorus of Chinese state-run media agencies seized on the opportunity to herald the "death knell for the decline of U.S. hegemony." State news agency Xinhua added that "the fall of Kabul marks the collapse of the international image and credibility of the US."5 F 6
Meanwhile, the CCP nationalist mouthpiece, the Global Times, set its sights on Taiwan and wasted no time in drawing comparisons between the withdrawal from Afghanistan and the "omen of Taiwan's future fate," exclaiming that, "once a cross-Straits war breaks out while the mainland seizes the island with forces, the U.S. would have to have a much greater determination than it had for Afghanistan, Syria, and Vietnam if it wants to interfere."6 F 7 The comparison continued: "from what happened in Afghanistan, [Taiwan authorities] should perceive that once a war breaks out in the Taiwan Straits, the island's defense will collapse in hours and the U.S. military won't come to help."7 F 8 The purpose of CCP propaganda like this is to undermine the credibility of the U.S. security commitment and partnership with Taiwan and to influence the cost-benefit analysis of Taiwan's continued reliance on the United States.
In contrast, some argue that the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan is unlikely to have any significant negative consequences on existing or future American security commitments.8 F 9 As one commentator summarized, "the specter of crises, conflicts, and strategic realignments is guaranteed to grab attention, but an emphasis on rare events almost certainly inflates the potential consequences of credibility damage."9 F 10 In fact, by ending the so-called "drain" of what many came to call the "forever war" in Afghanistan, the United States can arguably shift greater resources and attention to more pressing national security threats, such as an ascendant China. This shift has the potential to increase the credibility of existing American security commitments, rather than decrease it.1 0 F 11 Freed from the strategic distraction of Afghanistan, Washington can finally make the strategic adjustment to complete its long-proclaimed "pivot to Asia." The United States is better positioned now to aid Taiwan with its defense posture and to pursue new security commitments such as the nascent AUKUS trilateral security pact with Australia and the United Kingdom. On a larger scale, the termination of the war in Afghanistan represents a final transition for American grand strategy from two decades focused on a global war on terror (GWOT) to a renewed era of great power competition (GPC). But it is not entirely clear yet how the Department of Defense (DOD) and Joint Force-to include Special
Operations Forces (SOF)-should now understand existing partnership strategies and the role of BPC in the context of GPC.1 1 F 12
The question of whether the withdrawal from Afghanistan was a net positive or negative gain for the credibility of American security commitments is not the focus of this study. But the events surrounding the withdrawal serve as a timely and illustrative microcosm of the greater strategic problem which the United States faces in global strategic competition with China, namely: the capability, commitment, and communication of deterrence. These three "Cs" are the pillars of deterrence theory-with capability and commitment often encompassed together as credibility. With regard to capability, Beijing has historically had no impetus to doubt the capability of U.S. power projection and deterrence in the region, but China's drastic growth and rise to power-as well as recent events such as the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan-have increasingly emboldened it to contest U.S. capability. One conspicuous example is China's recent program to expand its strategic nuclear arsenal to include the construction of at least 250 new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos and two successful test launches of a nuclear-capable hypersonic glide delivery vehicle.1 2 F 13 Beijing cites the "abandonment" of Afghanistan as evidence that the United States' military power is waning and that the United States would lose a war against China.
Secondly, the pillar of commitment or resolve has always been central to the deterrent value of the United States' relationship with Taiwan. Repeatedly since 1949when the ROC government under Chiang Kai-shek fled to Taiwan-Beijing has attempted to discredit the U.S. commitment to Taiwan and sow seeds of doubt in the minds of Taiwanese citizens. Predictably, the controversial element of commitment continues to rear its ugly head today, and not without cause. It is unclear and purposefully ambiguous whether or not the United States would come to Taiwan's defense if China attacked, and it is far from certain whether the general American public would endorse such a costly war with China. But there is political pressure on both sides of the aisle in Washington to shore up American resolve-particularly after Afghanistan and particularly with the thriving democracy of Taiwan-which makes it difficult to formulate clearheaded and dispassionate assessments of the security environment. For example, if one of the primary reasons for the withdrawal from Afghanistan was to stop further U.S. casualties, how could 13 Shannon Bugos and Julia Masterson, "New Chinese Missile Silo Fields Discovered," Arms Control Association, last modified September 2021, https://www.armscontrol.org/act/2021-09/news/new-chinesemissile-silo-fields-discovered; Demetri

Lastly, U.S. communication and deterrence signaling are also under siege. Even though Beijing's targeted messaging is what one commentator deemed, "cheap psychological warfare," it is nonetheless effective in complicating and obfuscating Washington's ability to present a coherent foreign policy-both to domestic and foreign audiences.1 3 F 14 China is exceptionally adept in pointing out the United States' inconsistencies and where it has disregarded the very norms and laws which it uses to discredit China.
Typically, when a state's reputation and credibility are cast in doubt, leaders turn to a "standard playbook"-making public statements to refute false accusations and to reassure existing partners and allies.1 4 F 15 When questioned about the Chinese commentaries comparing Taiwan with Afghanistan, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki reiterated the United States' commitment to its "enduring" partnership with Taiwan: "Our message is very clear. We stand by, as is outlined in the Taiwan relations agreement

with Japan, same with South Korea, same with Taiwan."1 6 F 17 It is now routine for U.S. officials to describe the United States' commitment to Taiwan as "rock solid," following the impromptu remarks of a State Department spokesman in April 2020.1 7 F 18 The United States has remained fairly consistent in its choice of wording on Taiwan since 1979, when it officially adopted the "One China" policy and switched diplomatic recognition of China from Taipei to Beijing. But there is a growing body from the public, media, and government which argues it is high-time to communicate a clear commitment to the defense of Taiwan-a message which they believe will have a greater deterrent effect against China.
The strategic problem which the Joint Force and SOF now face in the wake of Afghanistan and the emergence of global strategic competition with China is how to increase its capability, commitment, and communication in order to deter China from its strategic objectives and place the United States in a position of relative advantage. Taiwan is rapidly becoming "ground-zero" for this competition.
The realm of U.S. security sector assistance (SSA) is a vast and complex system of joint, interagency, and multinational actors interacting at all levels from the policy to the tactical levels. Within this system, building partner capacity (BPC) is a broad concept that means many different things to different people within the U.S. security sector establishment. The term originated in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and has since become a "catchall" phrase to encompass a large cross-section of various security cooperation, security assistance, and security force assistance missions, programs, 17 "Full Transcript of ABC News' George Stephanopoulos' Interview with President Joe Biden," ABC News, last modified August 19, 2021, https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/full-transcript-abc-news-georgestephanopoulos-interview-president/story?id=79535643.

In concert with security assistance programs led by the Department of State (DOS), security cooperation is one of the U.S. government's greatest foreign policy and statecraft tools because it can shape and assure alliances, generate interoperability, assist weak or fragile states, and deter state and non-state adversaries. Within this construct, the Joint Force and SOF conduct security cooperation and other related activities such as security force assistance (SFA) to train, educate, advise, and equip foreign security forces (FSF).1 9 F 20 In so doing, BPC can be one of the most important ways-if not the most important way-for the United States to compete with adversaries, deter aggression, and set conditions for the transition to armed conflict if needed. But the DOD lacks a systems-based approach to BPC that will enable the Joint and SOF enterprise-from policy-maker to practitioner-to develop and implement BPC strategies that effectively compete with and deter great power adversaries.
There is general consensus that BPC can play a significant role in deterrence, specifically extended deterrence-the concept of deterring adversarial aggression toward a third party such as a partner or ally.2 0 F 21 But there are countless stakeholders and corresponding concepts, policies, and strategies that make BPC a haphazard rather than unified enterprise when it comes to extended deterrence. There is also a wide range of explanatory deterrence theories through which one may interpret and apply BPC. There is no universal consensus on which theory to adopt. Furthermore, it may be relatively straightforward how BPC may achieve extended deterrence through conventional deterrence practices, but it is less understood how it may play a role in unconventional 19 See Figure

deterrence-the concept of dissuading an adversary from aggression via threats of unconventional warfare (UW) such as guerilla resistance, sabotage, and terrorism.2 1 F 22 This irregular form of BPC may be precisely the approach needed to offset the hybrid and "gray zone" activities of great power rivals such as China and Russia. Just as they have adapted their strategies to compete with the United States while remaining below the threshold of armed conflict, so the Joint Force and SOF must also adapt their BPC strategies to be able to maneuver within this "gray zone" and deter escalation toward conflict.
Since the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001, security cooperation and especially SFA have largely focused on BPC in order to counter global terrorism. However, under the 2017 National Security Strategy (NSS), the 2018 National Defense Strategy (NDS), and the National Military Strategy (NMS), the DOD has now shifted focus to GPC and the potential for large scale combat operations (LSCO) against peer or near-peer threats such as China or Russia. President Biden reinforced these themes shortly after his inauguration in the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance (INSSG)-emphasizing collective action and the reinvigoration and modernization of alliances and partnerships: "we will strengthen and stand behind our allies, work with like-minded partners, and pool our collective strength to advance shared interests and deter common threats."2 2 F 23 There have been some positive steps to refocus security cooperation and SFA for GPC and LSCO, such as the Irregular Warfare Annex to the 2018 NDS and the U.S. Army's creation of five permanent Security Force Assistance Brigades (SFAB). But overall, the security cooperation enterprise is lagging behind when it arguably should be leading the way. GPC is predominantly occurring on the frontiers between PNs and revisionist adversaries such as China and Russia, who are exploiting this space to their advantage-often using proxies and hybrid tactics to avoid attribution. BPC policy, strategy, and doctrine must adapt and align with the current GPC construct, which expands the view of the operating environment from an obsolete peace/war binary model to an alternate "competition continuum" of cooperation, competition below armed conflict, and armed conflict. The Joint Force and SOF need a BPC model that is flexible enough to compete in this operational environment and effectively deter not only the outbreak of conventional conflict, but also the escalation of "gray zone" irregular and unconventional threats below the threshold of armed conflict.
What is the optimal deterrence strategy for the Joint Force and SOF-in the context of global strategic competition with China-to deter an invasion and annexation of Taiwan,
and in what ways does the Joint Force and SOF need to adapt and innovate in order to develop and implement this strategy effectively? Supporting research questions include the following. How does China perceive and react to U.S. global strategic competition and deterrence efforts? What is the optimal role for BPC in deterrence and competition?
The central hypothesis of this study is that a strategy of unconventional deterrence-focused on BPC activities and programs to build Taiwan's resilience, resistance, and asymmetric defense capacities-will increase the probability of deterring a Chinese invasion by decreasing China's probability of achieving a fait accompli and rapidly securing the Taiwanese populace. The independent variable is BPC for resilience and resistance and the dependent variable is unconventional deterrence.
This hypothesis resides at the strategic level of warfare, but it extends to the level of policy and grand strategy as well. For example, it requires no change to current U.S.
policy regarding Taiwan from a policy of "strategic ambiguity" to "strategic clarity," as many argue today. In fact, a continued policy of "strategic ambiguity" would facilitate and enhance an unconventional approach whereas a policy of "strategic clarity" would preclude it by committing the United States to an overt and conventional military strategy for defending Taiwan. Furthermore, an unconventional deterrence strategy which deters China from achieving a fait accompli indefinitely would simultaneously be a "gray zone" form of strategic sabotage of the CCP's grand strategy, which ties the reunification of Taiwan to its "national rejuvenation." As it approaches the end of its 100 year plan with no sure way to reunify Taiwan, the CCP will face increasing challenges to maintain its legitimacy and regime stability.
There is one supporting hypothesis which corresponds at the strategic and operational levels of implementation. Superimposing and "baking-in" strategic communication and deception at every layer of BPC and deterrence activities will confuse, disrupt, and delay Chinese decision-making by introducing doubt, misinformation, and multiple possible interpretations into their information collection and processing systems.
This requires the synchronization of multiple information related capabilities (IRC) including diplomatic, cyber, media, and military means such as psychological operations, civil affairs, and military deception. Strategic communication is essential for a strategy of unconventional deterrence in order to signal to the aggressor the PN's level of resolve and resilience as well as its resistance and asymmetric defense capabilities. A partner's perceived capability and commitment will fail to influence an aggressor's cost-benefit calculation without the incorporation of the third pillar of deterrence: communication.
The purpose of this study is threefold. First, this study aims to develop an updated mental framework for BPC in the context of global strategic competition, with Taiwan as a case study. This mental model will serve as a conceptual foundation from which planners and practitioners can conceive of and conduct security assistance, security cooperation, and SFA activities. To accomplish this goal, this study begins with a comprehensive treatment of the cross-strait strategic environment and a system dynamics analysis. Second, this study aims to demonstrate how a strategy of unconventional deterrence in Taiwan is the most feasible and effective strategy for the United States and Taiwan in order to deter a Chinese attack and invasion of the island. A corollary goal is to demonstrate how strategic communication can amplify its effects. Third, the expanded purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the greater strategic role that unconventional deterrence and strategic communication can play with other partners and allies. Finally, the thesis end state is to provide recommendations at the strategic, operational, tactical, and institutional levels, as well as recommendations for future research.
This study neither proposes nor proves a universal theory for BPC, deterrence, or GPC. In fact, it demonstrates how no single theory or approach can make sense of a complex and systemic issue like Taiwan nor develop perfect solutions for it. Instead, this study presents a variety of analytical methods and perspectives to serve as a tool and guide for U.S. military planners and practitioners at the policy, strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Although this study is most relevant for the United States and its regional partners within the Indo-Pacific Command (INDOPACOM) Area of Responsibility (AOR), the methodology, conclusions, and implications of the study can inform policy and strategy formulation for other GPC problem sets, partnerships, and AORs.
The target audience of this study is primarily the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC): policy-makers at the national and military departmental level as well as strategic planners and commanders at the geographic (GCC) and functional (FCC) combatant command (CCMD) level-including the respective service component commands (SCC) and theater special operations commands (TSOC). The primary goal is to inform Globally Integrated Campaigning (GIC) within the Joint Strategic Planning System (JSPS) and provide recommendations for joint capability development, joint force development, and the Joint Strategic Campaign Plan (JSCP). But the study is also relevant and informative for practitioners and advisors who plan or carry-out security cooperation and SFA activities with partners at the operational and tactical levels. Lastly, the study has bearing for analysts and scholars in the foreign policy and security community as well, who can utilize the methodologies and tools in this study for further research or to pursue new research questions. At a minimum, if this thesis provides the reader with a greater awareness and appreciation of the complexity of the problem or prompts further discussion or research, it will have accomplished its core objectives.
This study employs a multilayered approach drawing from various theoretical frameworks, qualitative and quantitative analysis, case studies and analogies, wargames, and practical experience. This study primarily employs a systems-thinking approach, which focuses on one particular sub-system rather than the whole. It also draws on a wide range of explanatory disciplines to make specific points-from ancient Greek history to modern psychology and communication theory. Although this study primarily analyzes the system at the strategic level of warfare and statecraft, it also considers elements at the operational and tactical levels, with some considerations at the higher levels of policy and grand strategy as well. The three universally accepted levels of warfare are strategy, operations, and tactics, although some have postulated different or additional levels. For example, the famous Prussian military theorist Carl von Clausewitz saw believed the three levels were policy, strategy, and tactics, whereas the acclaimed military strategist Edward N. Luttwak postulated five levels of war: grand strategy, theater strategy, operations, tactics, and technology-arguing that that changes in tactics can negate innovative technologies and vice versa with each of the levels.2 3 F 24 This study does not seek to propose a novel framework.
Instead, it employs an amalgamated framework consisting of six interrelated levels 
(grand strategic, policy, strategic, operational, tactical, and institutional)
Grand Strategicthe level of aligning national interests and resources with a long-term vision of a nation and its theory about how it can best achieve that vision. Grand strategy lies above policy and bureaucracy but influences both domestic and foreign policy. It may be explicit or implicit or it may be a deliberate plan or simply an organizing principle.
• Policythe level of codifying and communicating domestic and foreign national interests in order to guide national or multinational strategic planning. Policies provide legal, moral, and fiscal authorities and constraints in order to direct national or multinational resources to achieve grand strategic objectives.
• Strategicthe level of determining national or multinational security objectives, then developing national or multinational guidance, resources, and capabilities to achieve policy objectives through operations and campaigns.2 5 F 26 The strategic level is often sub-divided into theater strategic levels for each of the GCC and FCC combatant commands (CCMD).
• Operationalthe level of planning, conducting, and sustaining campaigns and major operations to achieve strategic objectives by assigning missions, tasks, and resources to tactical units and forces.2 6 F 27
• Tacticalthe level of planning and executing missions, engagements, and activities to achieve operational or campaign level objectives.2 7 F 28 It involves tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as well as technical aspects and the employment of technologies.
• Institutionalthe level of identifying capability gaps and developing material and non-material solutions for implementation in the other, parallel levels of warfare. This study also references the results and findings from two Taiwan-focused wargames conducted at NPS in 2021. First, the department of Defense Analysis (DA) collaborated with 1st Special Forces Group (1SFG) to design and run a series of wargames in order to inform the planning and execution of 1SFG's participation in exercise FORAGER 21. The wargames also served to propose the requisite capabilities, force posture, and organizational mission command structure that Joint SOF should employ during the phase of persistent competition transition to conflict against a peer adversary in INDOPACOM. The wargame scenario centered around a riverine border dispute between China and Thailand along the Mekong River followed by a 7.7 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan.
Secondly, the department of National Security Affairs (NSA) conducted a geostrategic wargame in conjunction with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Political Science department and the Harvard Kennedy School of Government. The intent was to use a non-military crisis to explore international implications of Taiwan's unique status facing Chinese coercive pressure-with teams representing military and diplomatic representatives from Taiwan, China, Japan, and the United States. Similar to the 1SFG wargame, the NPS-MIT scenario began with a 7.9 earthquake leading to a "Fukushima-like" nuclear meltdown of one of Taiwan's ageing nuclear powerplants.
The underlying methodology of this study is design thinking, itself an offshoot of systems thinking. Design thinking is a cognitive approach for devising innovative and "strategic empathy" or the ability to think like one's opponent.3 1 F 32 Design thinking then models or prototypes potential solutions through a process of envisioning more desirable end states-encompassed in the system dynamics modeling of this study. The process is iterative i.e., it arrives at a desired solution by repeating rounds of analysis with the objective of bringing the desired solution closer to discovery with each iteration. The inherent value of the iterative modeling or ideation is that it not only helps to develop a solution but also helps the user re-imagine and redefine the original problem by challenging previously held assumptions and biases and updating paradigmatic mental models-a process called double-loop learning. In the process, the user discovers novel implications or areas for further analysis and innovation-as captured in the conclusion of this study.
The structure of this study consists of three parts. The first part is a qualitative analysis of the problem-set beginning with a literature review in Chapter II and an analysis of the cross-strait strategic environment in Chapter III. The second part utilizes Art Lykke's "strategy stool" paradigm to outline the various "ends, ways, and means" of an unconventional deterrence strategy for Taiwan with the "ends" in Chapter IV, the "ways" in Chapters V, and the "means" in Chapter VI. The third part in Chapter VII consists of the conclusion and recommendations.
Chapter II presents the findings from a preliminary literature review of the study's primary topics and themes. The purpose of the literature review is twofold. First, the review outlines the necessary context, background, and basic definitions of terms and concepts to provide an introductory understanding of the logic and approach used for the remainder of the study. Secondly, the review identifies current gaps and inconsistencies in the existing literature which this study strives to redress and resolve. The focus of the literature review is on partnerships, building partner capacity, and their respective roles in deterrence.
However, the review does not explicitly cover the topics of Taiwan, system dynamics, unconventional deterrence, or strategic communication because the subsequent chapters will cover each of those subjects in detail.
Chapter III examines the "question" of Taiwan and the complex, triangular relationship between Taiwan, China, and the United States. This qualitative analysis utilizes a myriad of analytical lenses to shed light on the problem-set including a contemporary, historical, policy, strategic, and future lens. The chapter draws on international relations (IR) theory, applied history, and also introduces important conceptual constructs that will appear throughout the study such as the Thucydides Trap, the "One China" principle, and the policy of "strategic ambiguity." The purpose of this comprehensive analysis is to provide a detailed understanding of the cross-strait strategic environment. It will demonstrate not only the immense complexity of the problem-set but also the extraordinary divergence of public and expert opinions, explanatory theories, and policy decisions that further complicate the issue.
Chapter IV presents the policy & strategic "ends" for an unconventional deterrence strategy for Taiwan, First, the chapter utilizes Ivan Arreguín-Toft's "strategic interaction theory" to frame the purpose and rationale for an indirect, unconventional strategy rather than a direct, conventional one. Then it reviews relevant deterrence theory and how China interprets and reacts to deterrence. It examines both the Chinese strategic psyche and the grand strategic processing of the CCP to identify how an unconventional deterrence strategy would influence CCP decision-making.
Chapter V outlines the primary strategic & operational "ways" to operationalize the strategy. It presents the model of advisory support to Taiwan by the U.S. Army's Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG), then discusses the concepts of resilience and resistance, comprehensive defense, and asymmetric defense-as presented in the Swedish Defence University's Resistance Operating Concept (ROC) and NATO Special Operations Headquarters' (NSHQ) Comprehensive Defence Handbook (CDH). The chapter concludes by examining the value of superimposing strategic communication and strategic deception on BPC and deterrence activities throughout the operational approach.
Chapter VI outlines the tactical & institutional "means" with which to implement the "ways" to achieve "ends." It outlines the multiple organizations and capabilities from SOF, the Joint Force, and relevant institutional and multinational organizations that are best suited to implement the strategy.
Chapter VII presents the strategic risks and implications of the strategy, ranging from Taiwan to broader circumstances of global strategic competition. The chapter then offers a series of policy, strategic, operational, and institutional recommendations and concludes with suggested areas for future research.
Appendix A examines the systemic nature of BPC in Taiwan. The appendix includes a causal loop diagram (CLD) of the specific BPC interactions and feedbacks between the United States, Taiwan, and China in order to facilitate the visualization of the complex interactions and feedback loops between various elements in the system, thus reevaluating previously held notions of cause and effect. Appendix B presents the findings and outcomes of the Asymmetric Warfare Group's (AWG) Asymmetric Warfare Symposium (AWS) conducted with the Taiwan Army (TA) from 2015-2020.
There are several limitations and assumptions within this study that may negatively eschew the results. Some are deliberately self-imposed within the bounds of the research while some are extrinsically imposed.
The most significant limitation of this study is one which is endemic to nearly all deterrence studies: how to determine when deterrence is successful and how to measure it.
Successful deterrence is inherently elusive to detect because-by definition-it entails looking for something that did not occur. In a complex interconnected system like the security dilemma of Taiwan-where the variables interact in dynamical and non-linear ways leading to system-wide emergent properties over time-it is difficult to prove definitively that change in the independent variable (BPC) was the cause of change in the dependent variable (deterrence).
In his landmark publication The Logic of Warfighting Experimentation, Chief of Analysis for the Joint Experimentation Directorate Dr. Rick Kass put forward a methodology for defense concept and technology experimentation consisting of four requirements for valid experiments (see Figure 
1
A second limitation is the fact that the independent variable of the model is correlated and codependent with other variables within the system. This phenomenon is known as multicollinearity-when more than two explanatory variables are related linearly.3 5 F 36 Multicollinearity is a hindrance to the internal validity of a study because the independent variable is not truly independent. In this study, the codependent variables to building Taiwan's capacity for resistance and resilience are the Taiwanese government, military, and populace. BPC programs and activities are bilateral agreements, meaning
Taiwan must first agree with and approve any U.S. proposal or initiative for BPC. Even if it were possible to design a BPC strategy which would absolutely guarantee deterrence of China in Taiwan, unless the Taiwanese government authorizes it, the military implements it, and the populace accepts it, the strategy will die on the vine. For this reason, this study operates under the assumption of bilateral concurrence and consensus between the United
States and Taiwan, negating the collinearity between them. However, multicollinearity still significantly influences the external validity of the study, as any implementation of the proposed strategy would inevitably change in a non-linear manner as the Taiwanese choose to adopt or adapt the strategy according to their distinct mental model of the problem.
There are several other noteworthy assumptions which may or may not correspond to reality outside the model. This study assumes that the United States, China, and Taiwan do not make any significant changes in their current policies and strategies during the time horizon considered. For example, Taiwan does not declare independence and the United States does not rescind its "One China" policy and move from a position of "strategic ambiguity" to "strategic clarity" regarding its security commitment to Taiwan. In fact, this study makes the case at various points that the United States should maintain its current policy and that the proposed strategy of unconventional deterrence would be more effectual under such politically ambiguous conditions. Furthermore, this study assumes that the operational security environment-regionally and globally-does not undergo any significant change. For example, the United States does not decide to garrison troops in Taiwan in an overt attempt to deter an invasion or create a "tripwire force" which would commit the United States to war if it were attacked. Likewise, a major conflict or crisis does not erupt elsewhere in the world which would divert the attention and resources of the United States or China in such a way that the proposed strategy becomes no longer feasible or applicable. In other words, the outcome does not become one of de facto deterrence simply because both parties no longer actively pursue their previous policy objectives concerning Taiwan-rendering the proposed strategy temporarily extraneous.
This study focuses on various deterrence options to dissuade adversaries from taking aggressive actions, but it does not adequately explore potential compellence strategies that provide offramps for escalation or inducements to persuade aggressors to take alternative actions that are favorable to the deterrer. Deterrence strategies inherently have a "negative aim" which seek to deny the aggressor his objectives. They do not typically have "positive aims" which seek to achieve political or military objectives.
On War that it is easier for defenders to attain "negative aims" and that "positive aims" are not even necessary for defenders to be successful.3 6 F 37 But if a defender such as Taiwan were to achieve its "negative aim" of denying China its "positive aim" of reunification while China still retains that aim and the ability to prosecute toward it in the future, then Taiwan and the United States will have only temporarily achieved their objectives. Without any corresponding compellence options to provide inducements for China to ultimately relinquish its "positive aim" or exchange it for alternative aims, Taiwan and the United States will only succeed in deferring conflict, not deterring it. Compellence must shore-up and support deterrence for either to be successful.
This study, however, does not fully explore potential "positive aims" of compellence. This study also does not explore the topics of strategic nuclear deterrence or cyber deterrence.
Lastly, this study focuses predominantly on the military instrument of national power with corollary emphasis on the diplomatic and information domains. However, it does not examine in detail the economic, financial, intelligence, or law-enforcement aspects of DIMEFIL. It is beyond the scope of this study to analyze, for example, the role of economic sanctions or foreign espionage in deterring aggression. Because of the emphasis on BPC "means" and "ways," this study narrows the study primarily to the military domain. The other domains remain areas for future research.
The intent of this literature review is to demonstrate how previous research has touched on the topics and questions of this study and to identify any relevant gaps or inconsistencies in the research which this study may help to address. This review is not meant to be exhaustive but instead to be a launching-point for further research. This preliminary literature review reveals that while there is a great amount of literature on the topics of BPC and deterrence respectively, there is surprisingly little on how they relate to one another, or how BPC activities may play a deterrent role against adversarial aggression.
At first this is counterintuitive, but closer examination reveals there is abundant scholarship on the role of alliance-making and partnering, but little on the specific role of BPC programs and activities to accomplish these methods of deterrence. Additionally, while there exists a wide range of explanatory deterrence theories, this review examines only the scholarship focused on how BPC manifests in deterrence theory. In particular this review focuses on the role of BPC in extended and unconventional deterrence concepts, which deter aggression in a third-party state through threats of UW, guerilla resistance, and sabotage and terrorism. survivability of our allies and partners."3 9 F 40 In the 2018 NDS, the second of three lines of effort is, "Strengthen Alliances and Attract New Partners," in which "mutually beneficial alliances and partnerships are crucial to our strategy, providing a durable, asymmetric strategic advantage that no competitor or rival can match."4 0 F 41 This asymmetric advantage underpins the strategic utility of security cooperation and BPC activities, serving to maintain "favorable balances of power that deter aggression" and "expand our options."4 1 F 42 With reference to partner nations in the Indo-Pacific specifically, the NDS stated, "A free and open Indo-Pacific region provides prosperity and security for all. We will strengthen our alliances and partnerships in the Indo-Pacific to a networked security architecture capable of deterring aggression, maintaining stability, and ensuring free access to common domains."4 2 F 43
America's Greatest Strategic Asset President Biden's 2021 INSSG also elevates the importance of allies and partnersa theme that the administration is anticipated to echo and reinforce in the forthcoming NSS.
In a statement undoubtedly intended to signal a break from the policies of the previous administration, President Biden's vision is for America to return to the world stage:
"America is back. Diplomacy is back. Alliances are back."4 3 F 44 To accomplish this strategic vision, the interim strategic guidance acknowledges that, "we can do none of this work alone. For that reason, we will reinvigorate and modernize our alliances and partnerships around the world." America's partners and allies are a "unique American advantage" and "America's greatest strategic asset."4 4 F 45 The Biden administration and DOD quickly began 45

Secretary Austin first introduced his new vision for deterrence in May at the INDOPACOM headquarters in Hawaii during his first major speech after taking office. He described the need for "the right mix of technology, operational concepts and capabilitiesall woven together in a networked way that is so credible, flexible and formidable that it will give any adversary pause. We need to create advantages for us and dilemmas for The DOD has yet to fully detail this understanding of deterrence, but several key components can be synthesized from the statements thus far.
Secretary Austin described integrated deterrence in his Singapore speech as first, "using every military and non-military tool in our toolbox in lockstep with our allies and partners. Secondly, Integrated deterrence is about using existing capabilities, and building new ones, and deploying them all in new and networked ways-all tailored to a region's security landscape, and growing in partnership with our friends."4 8 F 49 From this representation, integrated deterrence can first be understood as a whole-of-government approach-involving not just the use of military means-in coordination with allies and partners. Secondly, integrated deterrence involves greater innovation and investment that is "interwoven." Austin explained how "innovation requires the resources to develop new ideas and scale them appropriately."4 9 F 50 Third, integrated deterrence will employ these capabilities in new and networked ways, tailored to specific regions, and in multi-domains:
"It means investing in cutting-edge capabilities for the future, in all domains of potential conflict."5 0 F 51 But this innovation and investment will not be unilateral. It will extend to allies and partners to increase their capacity for deterrence and resilience:
Together we're aiming to coordinate better, to network tighter and to innovate faster. And we're working to ensure that our allies and partners have the capabilities, the capacities and the information that they need. With our friends, we are stepping up our deterrence, resilience and teamwork, including in the cyber and space domains.5 1 F 52 Integrated deterrence is also not limited to high-end conflict, but to extended deterrence of "gray zone" activities as well, working with partners to deter coercion and aggression across the spectrum of conflict-including in the so-called "grey zone" where the rights and livelihoods of the people in Southeast Asia are coming under stress. That's why we're working to strengthen local capacity and to bolster maritimedomain awareness, so that nations can better protect their sovereignty.5 will likely expound on these questions and clarify to some degree the components of integrated deterrence, but until then it is crucial to understand what the role of BPC is in deterrence now and how it is currently understood in order to design and implement integrated BPC deterrence strategies effectively.
Nearly every study on deterrence that broaches the subject of BPC presents the two themes as contrasting alternatives between rival states, i.e., rival states can either deter one another or cooperate with each other in order to prevent aggression. Joint Publication (JP)
3-0 Joint Operations places deterrence along the same spectrum as military engagement and security cooperation, which "develop local and regional situational awareness, build networks and relationships with partners, shape the OE [operational environment], keep day-to-day tensions between nations or groups below the threshold of armed conflict, and maintain U.S. global influence."5 3 F 54 But there is little to no scholarship on how BPC nests or aligns under deterrence theory as opposed to beside or co-equal with deterrence as an alternative. Furthermore, there is virtually no scholarship on the role of BPC in unconventional deterrence, apart from its deterrent value in special operations UW-themed exercises with partners.5 4 F 55 The Deterrence Operations JOC further outlines BPC's contributions to denying benefits, imposing costs, and encouraging adversary restraint, which correspond with the three fundamental approaches of modern deterrence theory: "deterrence by denial," "deterrence by punishment," and "deterrence through assurances or inducements."5 6 F 57 In 2014, the Atlantic Council published a report on the future of U.S. extended deterrence in Asia to 2025 which adapted the "military means" of the Deterrence Operations JOC into the "21st
Century Deterrence Toolkit," adding new direct means such as cyber and space and retaining security cooperation as an enabling means.5 7 F 58  relationships that promote specific United States security interests."6 1 F 62 While these purposes make no explicit mention of deterrence, promoting U.S. security interests and developing partner capability for self-defense often entail deterrence of an adversary.
Unfortunately, most of the literature leaves the reader to make this mental connection himself.
Further complicating the issue is the close association of security cooperation with security assistance and security sector assistance. Security assistance is widely understood as the greater governmental effort under DOS headship, whereas security cooperation is specific and exclusive to the DOD. But in fact, many of the DOD's security cooperation activities and programs are actually in support of security assistance programs under DOS supervision, either through Title 10 or Title 22 authorities and funding. Thus, it is possible to refer to a specific activity or program as security cooperation when it is in reality DODadministered security assistance. Another way to understand security cooperation is simply as security assistance under the auspices of Title 10 or the delegated authorities of the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).6 2 F 63 For this reason, it is impossible to isolate security cooperation for discussion and analysis without understanding how it also supports and nests under security assistance.
With regard to security sector assistance (SSA), the only official description comes from Presidential Policy Directive 23 
(PPD 23)
Generally speaking, security assistance and security cooperation are the two sides that comprise the whole of SSA. Thus, it is more common to utilize one label or the other and reserve SSA for only the broadest possible terms. Officials also sometimes refer to SSA as security sector reform, but this term can carry negative connotations with foreign partners as they may not feel their security sectors are in need of reform.
Lastly, BPC can become muddled because it consists of multiple sub-sections of programs and activities, both official and unofficial, each with its own list of programs and funding sources. For example, there are three broad categories for "Train and Equip" programs, officially known as "Building Partner Capacity," each corresponding to DOSadministered Title 22, DOD-administered Title 22, or DOD Title 10 BPC programs.
However, the DOD tends to view BPC in much broader terms: "While Congress and the State Department tend to think of BPC as a relatively narrow foreign assistance tool, the DOD is de facto conceptualizing BPC as a strategy to address a broad range of challenges."6 4 F 65 There are other, less ambiguous categories such as operational support, defense institution building (DIB), international armaments cooperation (IAC), humanitarian assistance, education, exercises, contacts or military-to-military engagements, and exchanges.6 5 F 66 But it is not immediately clear how to make sense of all these activities or how best to orchestrate them toward effective deterrence. As a RAND report noted, BPC is more a "term of art" than a specific program or activity.6 6 F 67
Lastly, there is one noteworthy element of BPC that is typically under-valued when it comes to great power competition and deterrence strategies: SFA. SFA is not a security cooperation program or activity, but rather a method or approach to accomplishing many components of security cooperation. SFA is the set of activities that develop the "capacity and capability of foreign security forces and their supporting institutions."6 7 F 68 SFA activities often cut across the seams of security cooperation (Title 10) and security assistance (Title 
In summary, the existing literature primarily treats BPC as an "enabling" or forcemultiplying means of deterrence rather than having a prominent, "direct" role. BPC can entail any number or cross-section of security assistance, security cooperation, or SFA activities and programs and it is often difficult to distinguish one from the other. A 2015 in deterrence may be because it is a counterintuitive conception. BPC is primarily about improving partnerships and building relationships, not denying benefits or imposing costs.
Additionally, there is likely no literature because of the sensitive, diplomatic, and legal ramifications of this kind of strategy. BPC is most effective when it is transparent, mutual, and unclassified, not directed toward raising a guerrilla force or inciting insurgency or sabotage. This study will seek to inform this gap and provide an optimal model for the Joint Force and SOF to implement security cooperation and SFA in order to achieve unconventional deterrence in competition with adversarial great powers.
The cross-strait geopolitical and strategic environment is a living, dynamic system like all others. It constantly adapts and evolves as new events unfold. As Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen noted in a recent article for Foreign Policy, there are "new tensions and systemic contradictions."7 0 F 71 Moreover, there is an extraordinary divergence of expert and public opinions, explanatory theories, and policy decisions that complicate the trajectory of its evolution, but there are also multiple themes and trends which continue to influence it in somewhat predictable ways. While it is beyond the scope of this study to identify every potential variable within the triangular security ecosystem of Taiwan, China, and the United States, this chapter provides the most essential and relevant contextual information in order for the reader to understand the system dynamics and deterrence strategies presented in the remainder of the study. In an attempt to provide a detailed and comprehensive understanding of this evolving environment and its potential trajectory, this chapter examines the "question" of Taiwan from five intersecting lenses: contemporary, historical, policy, strategic, and future prospects.
Before looking at the historical background for how the cross-strait situation arrived at its current state, it is important to first frame and describe the current state as of December 2021 and identify some of the pressing implications moving into 2022 and beyond. The year 2021 will unquestionably be remembered as the year when tensions between China and Taiwan increased to their highest level in decades. Whether these tensions will continue to escalate or will deescalate in the coming years is yet to be seen.
The situation is continually in flux. Two weeks later, the incoming INDOPACOM commander Adm. John Aquilino appeared before the same committee and Sen. Cotton questioned him if he agreed with Adm. Davidson's assessment. Adm. Aquilino replied, "there are many numbers out there… there are spans from today to 2045. My opinion is this problem is much closer to us than most think," adding that Taiwan is Beijing's "number one priority."8 1 F 82 He echoed LTG (Ret.) McMaster and Adm. Davidson's concerns regarding the signs and indicators of a possible cross-strait conflict: "we have seen aggressive actions earlier than we anticipated, whether it be on the Indian border or whether it be in Hong Kong or whether it be against the Uyghurs. We have seen things that I do not think we expected, and that is why I continue to talk about a sense of urgency. We ought to be prepared today."8 2 F 83 From these three separate testimonies in the span of just one month, we gain a picture of the growing concern within the U.S. government (USG) and DOD regarding the prospect of a Chinese military action against Taiwan in the near future-a conflict which could embroil the United States and other regional actors such as Japan or the Philippines in a large-scale war with China. After seven decades of relative stability and coexistence between China and Taiwan, the risk of war has never been starker. Moreover, because of Taiwan's unique geopolitical status, there is no readily identifiable mechanism in the international space to mitigate the risk. Taiwan is not a member within multinational organizations specifically designed to deconflict or liaise between nations regarding international norms and standards, such as the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) or World Health Organization (WHO). Taiwan is not even recognized by the organization specifically created to prevent another world war: the 84 "The Most Dangerous Place on Earth," The Economist, May 1, 2021, 7, https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/05/01/the-most-dangerous-place-on-earth. 85 Jiachen Shi, "Will US-China Tensions Trigger the Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis?," Modern Diplomacy, last modified July 29, 2021, https://moderndiplomacy.eu/2021/07/29/will-us-china-tensionstrigger-the-fourth-taiwan-strait-crisis/.
86 For example, the Economist highlights how Taiwan is home to the semiconductor industry's leading chipmaker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), which produces 84% of the world's most advanced microchips on the island. If an invasion were to interrupt or destroy TSMC production in Taiwan, it would bring the global electronics industry to a halt, "at incalculable cost. The firm's technology and know-how are perhaps a decade ahead of its rivals." 87 The Economist, "The Most Dangerous Place on Earth," 7.
United Nations (UN).8 7 F 88 Taiwan has not held a seat at the UN since 1971, when member states voted it out to accommodate for the entry of the PRC. Perhaps the United States and other nations have recently acknowledged this glaring deficiency. In October 2021, Washington and Taipei discussed how Taiwan may "meaningfully" participate in the UN, with Secretary of State Anthony Blinken proclaiming in a press release that it is "not a political issue, but a pragmatic issue." Predictably, this suggestion drew the ire of Beijing; a spokesperson for the PRC's Taiwan Affairs Office reminded the world that Taiwan "has no right to join the United Nations."8 8 F 89 Secretary Blinken appealed to the value of including Taiwan as a "stakeholder" to help address global challenges-such as COVID-19-but he made no allusion to the reality that Taiwan could be the spark of another world war, one which could draw a large swathe of UN member states into conflict against one of the UN's permanent security council members: the PRC.8 9 F 90 If such a conflict were to ignite, how would the UN continue to function in any meaningful way?
Strait of Emergency?
In recent months, tensions across the Strait have escalated significantly. signaling to the people and authorities of Taiwan.9 1 F 92 Beijing typically coincides these incursions with meaningful dates, such as the anniversary of the PRC or Taiwan's National Day, or just prior to Taiwan elections, as it did prior to national elections in 1996 leading to the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. China also conducts these flights to signal opposition when U.S. officials meet with Taiwan counterparts either in Taipei or Washington. But there has been a noticeable uptick in missile tests and overflights since early 2020, at least since the reelection of Taiwan's incumbent president, Tsai Ing-wen. Aggressive signaling from Beijing increased even more after President Trump sent a high-level delegation to Taiwan in September 2020, including Undersecretary of State Keith Krach-the highestlevel State visit since 1979.9 2 F 93 Since that trip, China has flown into Taiwan's zone approximately twenty days out of every month, a percentage much higher than in the past.9 3 F 94 But the overflights in October eclipsed all previous signals from Beijing (667 incursions thus far in 2021 as opposed to 380 in all of 2020) leading some to suggest the situation is on the verge of becoming a Fourth Taiwan Strait Crisis (after the First in 
1954
-55, Second in 1958
, and Third in 1996)
Today's Chinese leaders will have decreasing ability to stand idly by, and they are acquiring logistical and strike capabilities that increasingly will give them options."9 8 F 99
There is also a convergence between China's growing military capability and its growing assertiveness and pressure to show a strong hand on the issue of Taiwan. "Whereas Chinese leaders used to view a military campaign to take the island as a fantasy, now they consider it a real possibility."9 9 F 100 Sooner or later, China's military superiority may tempt it to change the status quo. In July 2021, during a speech in Tiananmen Square on the 100th anniversary of the CCP, Xi Jinping rearticulated all of these themes and delivered a pointed warning: "we will never allow any foreign force to bully, oppress, or subjugate us. Anyone who would attempt to do so will find their heads bashed bloody against a great wall of steel forged by over 1.4 billion Chinese people. [emphasis added]"1 0 0 F 101 From Taipei's lens, the situation grows progressively starker. Immediately following China's incursions into its ADIZ in October 2021, Taiwan's Minister of Defense Chiu Kuo-cheng warned that China will have the capability to invade Taiwan by 2025 and that the situation "is really the most dangerous I have seen in my more than 40 years in the military."1 0 1 F 102 Perhaps the "Kuo-cheng Window" will prove to be a more prescient time horizon than the slightly longer "Davidson Window." Regardless, the United States, Taiwan, and international partners must quickly surmount the steep learning curve of Taiwan's peculiar predicament in order to develop and implement effective deterrence strategies in time.
The "question" of Taiwan is one of the most challenging geopolitical phenomena in modern history. Taiwan as one of their top policy objectives. But for more than 70 years, China and Taiwan have avoided war. Both governments "agree" that the mainland and island are inalienable parts of one sovereign state-an agreement known as the "1992 Consensus"-but they disagree on which of them is the legitimate ruling authority of that sovereign state. This is known as the "One-China policy." Since its inception, China has employed "wolf warrior diplomacy" to compel other nations to adopt the "One-China policy" and officially recognize either Beijing or Taipei as the sovereign authority, but not both. In 1979, during negotiations to incorporate Hong Kong into the mainland, Chinese Leader Deng Xiaoping introduced the "one country, two systems" principle to allow Hong Kong to retain its economic, legal, and administrative systems while stipulating that Beijing exercise all diplomatic and military authority. China also extended the principle as an olive branch to Macau and Taiwan as a model for "peaceful coexistence."1 0 2 F 103 P P Hong Kong and Macau officially adopted the principle in 1997 and 1999, respectively, and became Special Administrative Regions (SAR) of China. But Taiwan has consistently refused the proposal, irrespective of the political party in office or special provisions extended by Beijing such as the preservation of Taiwan's military. In light of recent escalation and legal vitiation in Hong Kong, the "one country, two systems" principle has increasingly become a siren's song for Taiwan just as it becomes increasingly null and void for Hong Kong.
It is important to note that at the heart of cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan is a civil war that has never officially concluded. In October 2021, during an address in Beijing on the anniversary of the revolution to overthrow the last imperial dynasty in 1911, President Xi Jinping spoke of the "glorious tradition" of opposing separatism and vowed to achieve "peaceful reunification" of Taiwan. Xi asserted that "Taiwan independence separatism is the biggest obstacle to achieving the reunification of the motherland, and the most serious hidden danger to national rejuvenation," adding that "no one should underestimate the Chinese people's staunch determination, firm will, and strong ability to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The historical task of the complete reunification of the motherland must be fulfilled, and will definitely be fulfilled."1 0 8 F 109 Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen responded the following day during a ceremony marking Taiwan's National Day and in the wake of China's record number of incursions into Taiwan's airspace: "There should be absolutely no illusions that the Taiwanese people will bow to pressure."1 0 9 F 110
To uphold its core interests with regard to Taiwan, Beijing maintains many levers of influence to constrain Taiwan's international space-typically employed in the "gray zone" below the threshold of armed conflict. China is increasingly employing a strategy of "combination warfare"-itself an asymmetric approach first conceived by Sun Tzu to "mix and match" combinations of warfare such as Colonels Qiao Ling and Wang Xiansui's "unrestricted warfare" or the "three warfares" (psychological, public opinion, and legal warfare or "lawfare") set forth by the PLA in 2003 as "political work regulations" to undermine opposition without firing a shot.1 1 0 F 111 P P The central strategy against Taiwan is to combine "ten thousand methods combined as One" from military, non-military, and abovemilitary forms of war to "overwhelm others by assaulting them in as many domains or spheres of activity as possible."1 • Cyber: Beijing uses Taiwan as a test-bed for intrusive and offensive cyber technologies, including those it later uses against other targets, such as the United States. China also steals electronic and corporate information.
• Espionage: Former Taiwanese officials now travel to China for business regularly and in great numbers. China persuades, and in some cases coerces, some former officials to collect sensitive information from those still active in Taiwan's government.
• Economic: In hopes of persuading Taiwan of the benefits of "peaceful reunification" with the mainland, Beijing has pursued an agenda to increase economic, social, and cultural ties with Taiwan.1 1 6 F 117 P P Taiwan now has extensive economic connections with the mainland, so much so that China has become Taiwan's largest trading partner.1 1 7 F 118 P P Taiwanese leaders have expressed concerns that Beijing will leverage these linkages to further coerce Taiwan into trading its sovereignty for economic stability.
Beijing also offers economic inducements to other countries in exchange for adherence to the "One China" policy.
Legal: Beijing exploits legal inconsistencies and loopholes to wage legal warfare or "lawfare" in order to further isolate and surround Taiwan in the international space. Beijing skillfully exploits the laws and policies of other nations in order to tie their hands against taking any action in support of Taiwan. Beijing regularly appeals to the "Three Communiques" which it signed jointly with the United States in order to condemn Washington's interference with its "domestic" issues with Taiwan and discredit Washington's trustworthiness on the international stage. In addition to these strategies of "combination warfare," "unrestricted warfare," and "three warfares" below the threshold of armed conflict, China's economic rise has financed a dramatic military modernization program. As a result, Taiwan has lost its long-held military advantage and power parity with the PLA in a potential conflict. However, in 1979 the United States ceased to formally recognize Taiwan or maintain official diplomatic relations with Taipei. Washington removed its embassy and withdrew all military forces from the island. President Carter terminated the mutual defense treaty with Taiwan, but in an effort to reassure pro-Taiwan constituencies and preserve relations with Taiwan, Congress signed into law the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. It carried some of the content from the Sino-American Defense Treaty but used the terminology "governing authorities of Taiwan" instead of "Republic of China." In place of an embassy, the TRA authorized the establishment of a nonprofit organization in Taipei under the auspices of the U.S. government to manage its interests: the American Institute of Taiwan (AIT). The TRA governs the interactions between the United States and Taiwan, allowing the United States to maintain commercial, cultural, and other non-diplomatic forms of exchange with Taiwan. But most importantly, the TRA does not explicitly articulate whether or not the United States would come to the defense of Taiwan. This has translated into a U.S. policy of deliberate "strategic ambiguity" regarding a potential conflict between China and Taiwan. Washington has made no pledge to defend Taiwan, but the TRA allows for security assistance and cooperation with Taiwan by declaring the United States, "will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense capacity" as determined by the President and the Congress.1 international audiences that it maintains a "modern" military and to demonstrate national resolve to its own populace.P P Instead, some argue Taiwan would benefit from a more decentralized, "porcupine" strategy whereby it makes the prospect of an invasion very costly to the PLA by hardening its defenses "to make itself indigestible," as LTG (Ret.)
McMaster recommended to the Senate Armed Services Committee in March 2021.1 2 7 F 128 By purchasing a higher volume of less expensive systems, such as anti-tank guided missiles (ATGMs) and man-portable air-defense systems (MANPADS)-similar to those provided by the United States in the 1980s to the Mujahadeen guerillas in Afghanistan during the Soviet-Afghan War-the advantage would be threefold. First, it would produce a more potent deterrent against invasion. Second, should deterrence fail, it would be more difficult for the PLA to destroy a large number of small, portable systems widely dispersed throughout the dense urban terrain of Taiwan's cities than it would be a smaller number of larger, high-profile items such as tanks or fighter jets.. Third, it might allow Taiwan to resist an invasion longer, perhaps buying time and space for its allies and the larger international community to intervene.1 2 8 F 129 P P In this way, a "porcupine" strategy could morph into a "poison pill" or "poison frog" strategy, whereby Taiwanese resistance prohibits China from consolidating any gains from the annexation of the island.1 2 9 F 130 Taiwan has shown some shift in this direction. In its last arms purchase from the United States, worth $2.25 billion, $250 million was allocated for MANPADS (the remaining $2 billion was for Abrams tanks.)1 Furthermore, Taiwan's parliament recently approved a $17 billion defense budget for 2022-the largest to date. It is a 5% increase from the previous year and accounts for 2.3% of Taiwan's GDP. The budget will reportedly pay for new air defense missiles for the Taiwan Navy's six Kang Ding-class frigates, four MQ-9B armed drones, $1.4 billion will also go towards new fighter jets, likely F-16s.1 3 2 F 133 Taiwan's parliament also approved an additional $9 billion special budget over the next five years. The majority of the funds will reportedly pay for indigenous long-range and anti-ship missiles, as well as the construction of Taiwanese manufactured warships, to include new "carrier killer" missile corvettes, landing ships, and diesel-electric submarines.1 3 3 F 134 But the PLAN fleet has over 170 frigates, cruisers, corvettes, and destroyers against Taiwan's 28, which are much older than the PLAN's.1 3 4 F 135 Up-arming six "carrier killers" will likely only make them a larger target for the PLA.
Many political science experts and international relations (IR) theorists have drawn 
One of the most relevant case studies from Thucydides's ancient account is the famous "Melian Dialogue," which recounts the failed negotiations between Athens and the small island-nation of Melos-an ally with Sparta. In the account, Athenian envoys attempt to reason with the Melian magistrates that it is in their best interest to cede the island without conflict and renounce their colony alliance with Sparta. The Melians imprudently refuse and consequently suffer annihilation at the hands of the Athenians. This brief account from millennia ago bears striking similarities with modern day cross-strait relations between China and Taiwan and highlights the potential role of Taiwan in the Thucydides Trap theory. While many have come to view international relations between China and the United States through this binary lens, concluding that the two great powers "are currently on a collision course for war," few have analyzed the role of Taiwan in this political context, akin to the role of Melos during the Peloponnesian conflict.1 3 9 F 140 P P Of all the potential flashpoints that could ignite conflict between China and the United States, none is more salient today than Taiwan. The vision of a "free and open Indo-Pacific," as well as U.S. assurances to vital allies in the region, all hinge on the "question" of Taiwan. A reexamination of the Thucydides Trap through the lens of the "Melian Dialogue" reveals how differences in IR theory between the United States, China, and Taiwan have critical foreign policy implications for the future of cross-strait relations. Having this awareness and a correct interpretation of these differences and implications is absolutely imperative if the United States and Taiwan are to avoid making the same mistakes as the Melians. An applied history methodology unveils alternative solutions other than war as well as effective policy options for U.S. extended deterrence in Taiwan across the spectrum of instruments of national power (DIMEFIL).
As a primer for analysis, the "Melian Dialogue" functions as a straightforward analogy for trilateral relations between Taiwan, China, and the United States. Melos represents Taiwan, Athens represents China, and Sparta represents the United States (or the post-WWII, U.S.-led liberal international order). The conspicuous similarities between Melos and Taiwan are manifold. Both are island-states which face superior military aggressors: Athens and China. Both align with competitive great powers whose hegemony is now challenged: Sparta and the United States. Both are geographically isolated from their base of support and face difficult calculations regarding the resolve and credibility of military intervention from their allies: Sparta and the United States. And both are regarded by their aggressor states (Athens and China) as politically and militarily strategic in order to shore up domestic support and send coercive signals to surrounding nations. But there is one noteworthy difference between the two island-states: Melos is a colony of Sparta whereas Taiwan is merely a partner of the United States. This may seem like a minor detractor in the analogy if it were not for the peculiar nature of Taiwan-what some analysts have described as a "geopolitical absurdity" or paradox.1 4 0 F 141 Ironically, Taiwan's most significant defense partner and preferred trading partner-the United States-does not even diplomatically recognize Taiwan as a sovereign state, nor is it a treaty defense ally with Taiwan. Conversely, China does not merely claim Taiwan as a foreign colony; it claims territorial sovereignty over Taiwan. In the eyes of China, Taiwan is an internal domestic issue-a dissident province separated from the mainland awaiting the right moment for reunification. Athens did not view Melos in this manner. On the contrary, the analogy would be more resemblant if Melos were a rebellious colony of the rising Athens, rather than Sparta. However, this divergence does not invalidate the overall analogy and in fact presents multiple unique opportunities for the United States and Taiwan to exploit that were not available to ancient Sparta and Melos.
The crux of the Melian analogy hinges on the comparison of IR theories. IR pundits herald the "Melian Dialogue" as a classical case study in realist versus idealist political theory, and more specifically coercion theory. Realist theory emphasizes national interests and security above ideology and international cooperation, with politics as the anarchic arena of competition and conflict among actors seeking power. Idealist theory emphasizes philosophical and ethical shared values and cooperation between states, with politics as a collective effort among actors seeking mutual advantage. The Melians' lack of realism and stubborn adherence to idealist notions that Sparta would come to their defense ultimately led to their downfall and decimation. The Melian magistrates maintained faith in the international system presided by just and honorable alliances rather than the pragmatic pursuits of power. They asserted to the Athenians, "we trust that the gods may grant us fortune as good as yours, since we are just men fighting against unjust, and that what we want in power will be made up by the alliance of the Lacedaemonians [Spartans], who are bound if only for very shame, to come to the aid of their kindred."1 4 1 F 142 The Athenians' argument, in contrast, is the classic exemplar of realism and Realpolitik: "since you know as well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must. [emphasis added]"1 4 2 F 143 In the analogy with Taiwan, the pivotal question is which IR theory and deterrence strategy do the United States, China, and Taiwan adhere to? The answer holds significant policy implications for the future of cross-strait relations. If Taiwan observes an idealist interpretation of international relations in the face of a Chinese invasion, while the United States does not, then the chances of U.S. intervention are ambiguous at best and nonexistent at worst.
There is ample evidence and literature to suggest that the United States is returning to a realist view of cross-strait relations after years of idealist-leaning policies-in particular, constructivism: an extension of idealism which sees politics and cooperation as socially constructed dynamics which will lead to a "collective identity that ameliorates a security dilemma."1 4 3 F 144 P P Following the "Three Communiques" with China from 1979-1982, the United States believed that the opening of China to the world and coupling of its economy with the United States would eventually lead to a free and democratic China. It also believed it could play the "China Card" to balance against the Soviet Union and pressure it on a number of issues. But as China grew more and more powerful while repudiating the western, neoliberal order which had accepted it, it became increasingly clear in Washington that the constructivist approach had failed. Now, China is espousing its "socialism with Chinese characteristics" as an alternative system for the rest of the world to emulate, also known as the "Beijing Consensus" or "China Model." But today, in the wake of COVID-19, political blundering, and widespread misinformation and fake news regarding the epidemic in China, the United States is beginning to abandon all pretexts of an idealist or constructivist resolution and is hoping it is not too late to stem the tide of China's rise while avoiding the Thucydides Trap. Many in Washington are now calling to 
143 Thucydides,

Conversely, it appears on the surface that China-unlike Athens-has persistently pursued an idealist policy with regard to Taiwan. It determinedly wages diplomatic and economic warfare against Taiwan to prevent it from being recognized by other nations or included by international organizations. By this standard China is seeking international consensus and compliance regarding the sovereignty of Taiwan, setting conditions for legal and unopposed reunification of the island by 2049-the 100th year anniversary of the founding of the PRC. However, underlying this guise of idealism on the international stage, China maintains a realist approach within its own borders and with its direct dealings with Taiwan. China is stoking the flames of domestic nationalism and ultimately is prepared to use force to occupy and annex Taiwan in spite of any international objection. In fact, a closer examination of China's foreign policy reveals a consistent undertone of realism stretching back to 1949. Chinese "foreign" policy towards Taiwan is unapologetically Realpolitik and tremendously patient. Yet China simultaneously seeks increasing involvement in the international, rules-based system of standards and behavior-albeit it believes the current system is orchestrated by the United States and was constructed during an era when China did not have a seat at the table.
In his book Haunted by Chaos, author Sulmaan Khan expounds on the consistent realism of China since its founding. His stated purpose for writing the book is to better understand China's grand strategy and "explore the calculus behind Chinese decisionmaking, to attempt to see the world the way China's leaders do."1 4 4 F 145 Beginning with Mao, he demonstrates how China has remained remarkably consistent in its domestic and foreign policy, even through modern times. The operating principle of Mao's strategy has remained largely unchanged and is pragmatically simple: to maintain a diplomatic balance of power, to grow its economy and modernize its military, and to never compromise on its core interests-of which Taiwan is central. Since the establishment of the PRC in 1949, its existence has been one of constant caution and insecurity. Its greatest perceived risk was and still is its claim to sovereignty and political recognition by others. To protect itself, Mao's goal was to reduce threats to national security by maintaining as many relationships as possible. Mao "sought to be closer to other players in the balance of power than they were to one another."1 4 5 F 146 Relations with smaller powers were as important as larger powers, and often partnerships with ideological sister-states such as the Soviet Union, North
Vietnam, and North Korea were for mutual convenience rather than ideological reasons.1 4 6 F 147
For Mao, socialist ideology was perennially flexible. Instead, he held an ideology of "pragmatic coexistence" and was not averse to depart from communist orthodoxy when needed, while not compromising away sovereignty.1 4 7 F 148 "The key organizing principle of Mao's diplomacy was simple: he would deal with whomever he could to get the state he wanted."1 4 8 F 149 P P He also sought buffer states from imperialist encroachment. The prospect of American presence and influence in South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan has not significantly changed. China remains staunchly realist but is not closed to the idea of diplomatic cooperation when possible, even with its greatest rivals. But China will not and has not compromised on its core interests. The problem is that its core interests often shift and expand. As China grows stronger, its insecurity and ambition expand as well.
Unlike the United States and China, which closely approximate the realism of Sparta and Athens respectively, Taiwan does not ascribe to idealism as Melos did. With a nuclear-powered, existential threat merely 100 miles from its coastline-realism has nearly always dominated Taiwan's view of international politics. Even when Taiwan has shown idealist leanings in the past and aspired to greater cooperation and inclusion within the 146 Khan, 38.

of constructivism in Taiwan at times. For a period of time following the "1992
Consensus"-when both sides of the strait essentially agreed that the other side existedit appeared that both China and Taiwan were pursuing a constructivist agenda of policy, therefore, is a delicate balancing game between "strategic ambiguity" and "clarity."
1.
In the realm of U.S. official and unofficial policy, the "question" of Taiwan quickly turns into a "policy football."1 5 0 F 151 Many argue that it is time for the United States to fully emerge from a long period of "strategic atrophy" as repudiated in the NDS and replace its policy of "strategic ambiguity" with Taiwan with "strategic clarity" to increase formal relations with Taiwan and intensify anti-invasion rhetoric. In April 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken responded in an interview that the United States has "a serious commitment to Taiwan being able to defend itself…and in that context, it would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change that status quo by force."1 6 3 F 164 In the wake of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, National Security Advisor Dan Sullivan stated that U.S. commitments to allies and partners were "sacrosanct and always have been. We believe our commitment to Taiwan and to Israel remains as strong as it's ever been."1 6 4 F 165 P P Secretary Blinken reinforced Sullivan's point in September during a testimony before the House of Representatives, referring to Taiwan as a "country" for the second time in his official tenure.1 6 5 F 166 P P Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also suggested a commitment to defend America's interests with Taiwan, claiming "we will not flinch."1 6 6 F 167 Asked if this commitment would be backed by "the full force of the American military," Bush replied, "Whatever it took to help Taiwan defend herself."1 6 8 F 169 This was the most overt statement of support for Taiwan by a standing U.S. President up to that point, but Sen.
Biden was quick to point out the gaffe, stressing in his op-ed critique, "Words matter, in diplomacy and in law." Aware of the tenuous circumstances and language of the crossstrait policy, Sen. Biden quipped against the Bush administration, "we now appear to have a policy of ambiguous strategic ambiguity."1 6 9 F 170 Moreover, as a Senator in 1979, Sen. Biden voted in favor of the TRA. In other words, it is difficult to imagine someone more capable than President Biden today to correctly understand the United States' position toward Taiwan and formulate an appropriate response that aligns with that position. The similarities between President Bush and Biden's interview remarks are remarkable. Both made nearly identical misleading statements regarding the U.S. position toward Taiwan to which both administrations had to immediately backpedal. But President Biden appears to understand the gravitas of his statements and actions. In November 2021, he invited Taiwan to participate in the virtual Summit on Democracy in December-the only participant not formally recognized as a country by nearly any of the other participants.1 7 0 F 171 Again, there is a difference between declaratory policy and actual policy. Renewed emphasis on partnerships and alliances has reinvigorated the discussion of a multinational approach to deterrence-what the Biden administration and DOD has termed "integrated deterrence." It appears that both have taken active steps to convey commitment to this vision, despite outspoken criticism from both domestic and foreign audiences. In a very short span of time between August and October 2021, Washington has carried out a series of highly public and decisive strategic decisions which-when viewed collectively-signal a much clearer rebalance or "pivot" to Asia and the Pacific than previous actions. First, in August, Washington withdrew all forces from Afghanistan-ostensibly to shift greater attention and resources to global strategic competition with great power adversaries like China. Then, in September, Washington announced the surprise formation of a new trilateral defense partnership with Australia and the United Kingdom, known as AUKUS.1 7 1 F 172 Explicitly, the partnership's purpose is to advance Australia's undersea projection capability by sharing critical nuclear technology and helping to develop attack class nuclear-powered submarines for Australia.1 7 2 F 173 P P Implicitly, however, the purpose is to hedge the balance of power in the Pacific against Chinese expansionism. The trilateral agreement is even more significant because it demonstrates Washington's willingness to forge new security relationships at the expense of damaging others. The AUKUS deal undermined and replaced an existing deal between Australia and France worth €56 billion for non-nuclear-powered submarines. The United States and Australia did not notify France of their intentions until hours before the public announcement of the deal, which France condemned as a "stab in the back" and responded by removing its ambassadors from Washington and Canberra.1 7 3 F 174 Lastly, the following month, two carrier strike groups (CSG) from the United States, one from the United Kingdom, and fifteen ships from Japan, New Zealand, Canada, and the Netherlands conducted naval exercises in the Philippine Sea, followed by exercises in the SCS with Australia. The U.S., Japanese, and some Australian ships then sailed to the Bay of Bengal to conduct QUAD naval exercises together with India, while the UK, Australia, and New Zealand remained in the SCS to conduct exercises with Singapore and Malaysia.1 7 4 F 175 Furthermore, prior to the exercises, a frigate from the HMS Queen Elizabeth CSG sailed through the Taiwan Strait enroute to Vietnam-the first time the UK had done so since 2008. One commentator noted the enormity of the carrier-based operations involving nine nations and compared it with the Taiwan Strait crisis in 1996, which involved only two carriers instead of three.1 7 5 F 176
Pro-Independence?
Many experts believe the actions and statements described in the previous section do not go far enough. Many believe the only compellent force powerful enough to coerce
China is to recognize Taiwan as an independent nation. But the greatest obstacle to this strategy is that the DPP-led government itself does not seek independence (officially).
Despite various pro-independence movements and a record high 83% of the populace identifying themselves as Taiwanese rather than Chinese or both in February 2020, the DPP-led government does not want to risk escalation with China over the topic of independence.1 7 6 F 177 P P The goal is rather to deter mainland unification efforts and maintain its current thirteen diplomatic allies (Nicaragua was the most recent nation in December 2021 to change diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing). But some analysts inside and outside of Taiwan suggest that Taiwan would be better off if it lost all its allies. It would leave Taiwan with a more natural and intrinsic impetus to declare autonomy as the "Republic of Taiwan" rather than the more flagrant decision of independence, which connotes a breaking away from mainland hegemony. This would allow nations to recognize both Taiwan and China simultaneously as two separate sovereign states. As long as even one country continues to recognize Taipei as the legitimate seat of China's government, a vote for independence will always be seen as defiance. But by losing the few allies that it has, Taiwan could-ironically-gain far more. There are, however, major risks inherent in this course of action, not least of which is that China would have no better occasion to attack the island, even though Taiwan independence poses no physical threat to China. Any rhetoric of the nationalist KMT party taking back the mainland or waging a low-intensity campaign against the coastline is long gone.
An invasion notwithstanding, opponents argue that the loss of Taiwan's allies would hamper its ability to take part in international activities. The Centre for Foreign Policy Studies at the National Chengchi University in Taiwan made this prescient observation in 2018: "For instance, if the World Health Assembly held an international conference to solicit ideas for dealing with a global virus, Taiwan could be shut out and deprived of first-hand information because no other countries supported its desire to take part."1 7 7 F 178 P P But this is exactly the scenario which Taiwan endured in 2020 during its fight against the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite its 14 diplomatic allies at the time as well as the United States and others lobbying for Taiwan's inclusion in the World Health Organization (WHO) and its assembly meetings (the WHA), they ultimately failed.1 7 8 F 179 P P If diplomatic ties are no guarantee of inclusion in international affairs, then what difference would it make if Taiwan had no diplomatic allies? This realization is undoubtedly changing the decision calculus for pro-autonomy leanings in the government and populace of Taiwan.
One of the strongest and most recent arguments for Taiwan independence is the ongoing circumstances or repression in Hong Kong. Anti-government protests in the former British colony erupted in June 2019 against legislation that would allow extradition of criminals to mainland China, violating the "two systems" agreement between China, Hong Kong, and the United Kingdom in 1997. China withdrew the extradition bill in September, but protests continued and escalated until China passed a controversial and legally ambiguous security law in June 2020 that gave China broad powers to criminalize any act of secession, subversion, terrorism, or collusion with foreign entities.1 7 9 F 180 P P By all accounts the security law has effectually terminated the special administrative status and "two systems" governance of Hong Kong. Never has there been a stronger case for Taiwan to denounce the "One-China policy" or for the international community to expose it as a deception and infringement of domestic sovereignty. This also provides the United States with a circuitous opportunity for extended deterrence and compellence of China in Taiwan.
If the United States were to deter Chinese intervention in Hong Kong while simultaneously broadcasting the inconsistencies and fraudulence of PRC "domestic" policy, it could concurrently bolster anti-unification and pro-independence rhetoric in Taiwan, thus deterring Chinese military action against Taiwan.
A positive step in this direction is the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act (HKHRDA) and related Hong Kong Be Water Act of 2019. But the United States could go further and attempt to compel China in Hong Kong by threatening increased collaboration with Taiwan or even pro-independence. By holding China's primary "core" interests of state sovereignty and territorial integrity at risk, the United States may be able to coerce China to play by its own rules (the special administrative status of Hong Kong) and adhere to international standards of human rights etc. In other words, extended compellence through Hong Kong could potentially result in augmented extended deterrence in Taiwan. This adaptation of extended coercion theory could be a powerful means to compete with China and escape the Thucydides trap.
In his book Haunted by Chaos, Sulmaan Khan demonstrates how there has been a surprising continuity between Mao's domestic and foreign policies and those of China today. But he then exposes the extent to which modern-day China has deviated from the policies of Mao's successors: Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, and Hu Jintao. The overarching grand strategy during this period may have remained the same: to keep China secure through modernization and developing the economy to underwrite that security. But modern China under Xi Jinping has strayed from the adaptive flexibility of this period's "pragmatic coexistence" and has run counter to the very policies that led to rapprochement with the United States and international recognition of sovereignty.
The case of Hong Kong is informative. Sulmaan Khan believed Deng Xiaoping would likely have reacted differently to the Hong Kong protests than Xi Jinping. For Deng, repression would have been antithetical to the relative benefits of allowing Hong Kong to remain capitalist and upholding the "one country, two systems" policy until 2047 (when the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1997 expires after 50 years). Actions like these undercut the credibility and political philosophy of Deng's "two systems" policy: that it could not only apply locally, but also serve as a global model for peaceful transition between contested territories such as Israel and Palestine or North and South Korea.1 8 0 F 181 Instead, the actions in Hong Kong undermine the intent of espousing "socialism with Chinese characteristics" and weakens the "Beijing Consensus." The evidence seems to suggest that China itself may be renouncing its own "two systems" approach and idea of "peaceful coexistence." It is doubling down in Hong Kong while resigning all options for Taiwan save a military solution. The fact that China is not responding to international cries for China to uphold the special administrative status of Hong Kong shows the world that it does not really believe in its own policy and solidifies its untrustworthiness and revisionism in the minds of other nations while only further disillusioning Taiwan and elevating the United States as the pragmatic advocate for peace and diplomacy.
There are generally three broad courses of action proposed by U.S. policy analysts and government officials to address the "question" of Taiwan: (1) an explicit policy commitment of "strategic clarity" to Taiwan (as Richard Haas and David Sacks argue),1 8 1 F 182
(2) an explicit statement that the defense of Taiwan is the sole responsibility of Taiwan (as Charles L. Glaser argues),1 8 2 F 183 and (3) a sustainment of the current policy of "strategic ambiguity" (as Bonnie Glaser and Michael Mazur contend).1 8 3 F 184 There is a wide range of differing opinions within the contours of these three policy options, but there are also diverging views which assert that these are not the only available courses of action.
Former AIT director and adjunct lecturer in Chinese studies at Johns Hopkins University, David Keegan, proposes a policy of "strategic stability."1 8 4 F 185 The policy would focus less on the level of clarity regarding the "question" of Taiwan and more on the strengthening of "dual deterrence" wherein the United States deters China from forcefully annexing Taiwan while simultaneously deterring Taiwan from declaring "independence" as a sovereign nation. This would be a better recipe for de-escalation than any of the other options. This also echoes what former ASD for International Security Affairs (ASD(ISA))
Franklin Kramer and former Prime Minister of Australia Kevin Rudd have described as "managed strategic competition" with China.1 8 5 F 186
Alternatively, former AIT chairman and managing director, Therese Shaheen, proposes a policy of "strategic coherence" based on "transparency about what is at stake" and the reality of Taiwan's existence.1 8 6 F 187 Such a policy would speak truth to Taiwan's geographic, de facto sovereignty apart from the PRC and validate the coherence of U.S.
relations with Taiwan over the past 71 years. This is a similar approach to LTG (Ret.)
McMaster's conception of "transparent competition" as described in the declassified 2018
Indo-Pacific Strategic Framework (IPSF), which seeks to achieve a balance between confrontation and accommodation with China. 
The United States has geostrategic, economic, political, and normative reasons for safeguarding Taiwan and preventing Chinese hegemony in the "first island chain," which runs from Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and Japan through the ECS and Taiwan, the Philippines and Borneo, and the contested "nine-dash line" region within the SCS (see Figure 
2
In April 2021, Taiwan's foreign minister said that Taiwan views itself as a "sea fortress" against Chinese expansion into the pacific-committed to ensuring freedom of navigations in its surrounding waters.1 9 1 F 192 Removed from the policy perspective regarding U.S. security commitments to Taiwan, there are multiple reasons why Taiwan is geopolitically and strategically significant. Answers to the "question" of whether the United States or a multinational coalition should come to Taiwan's defense range from dismissive views that a loss of Taiwan sovereignty would be inconsequential to alarmist views that it would mark the death knell for democracy and the advent of an irreversible new world order of global authoritarianism-if not the catalyst of a nuclear World War III.
In an October 2021 interview on Fox News, Sen. Dan Sullivan (R-AK) likened Taiwan to West Berlin at the height of the Cold War, asserting that "Taiwan is not some peripheral sideshow in great power competition. To me, it is the frontline of tyranny versus freedom. 192 Reuters, "Taiwan Is 'Sea Fortress' against China, Minister Tells U.S. Audience," Reuters, last modified September 15, 2021, https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-is-sea-fortress-againstchina-minister-tells-us-audience-2021-09-15/. been "prime real estate" in East Asia. The substantially mountainous island lies at the center of the archipelagic first island chain. If China were to control Taiwan, it would be a "uniformly negative" military effect for the United States and its allies.1 9 3 F 194 P P China would be able to reorient the island's defense posture outward and could convert the island into a forward operating base. It would extend China's missile and aircraft range another 150 nautical miles, which would place U.S. forces stationed in the region at greater risk and would likely compel INDOPACOM to reassess its force posture in South Korea, Japan, and Guam etc. It would also eliminate the PLAN's current freedom of maneuver disadvantages due to the canalization effects of Taiwan's geography. Taiwan sits on the edge of a continental shelf and would allow China to deploy passive and active underwater sensors from its eastern shore and greatly increase its ocean surveillance and over-thehorizon (OTH) radar capabilities. This would potentially threaten key sea lines of communication (SLOC) for the United States and allies. China would also be able to transition to a power-projection force instead of a near-abroad force. Conversely, it would create even greater stand-off for China and make it more difficult for the United States or allies to reverse or roll-back China's gains and hold the mainland at risk, similar to the position in which the United States found itself vis-à-vis Japan at the start of the Pacific War in 1941. In the event of war with China, the United States and allies would almost certainly have to seize a heavily defended Taiwan before launching an attack against the mainland, akin to taking Okinawa or Iwo Jima before attacking mainland Japan. It was precisely for this reason that GEN Douglas MacArthur issued a memorandum of warning to Washington in 1950, which remains as accurate today as it was then: I have been concerned as to the future status of Formosa and I have been convinced that the strategic interests of the United States will be in serious jeopardy if Formosa is allowed to be dominated by a power hostile to the United States.
As a result of its geographic location and base potential, utilization of Formosa by a military power hostile to the United States may either counterbalance or overshadow the strategic importance of the central and southern flank of the United States front line position. Formosa in the hands of the Communists can be compared to an unsinkable aircraft carrier and submarine tender ideally located to accomplish Soviet offensive strategy and at the same time checkmate counteroffensive operations by United States Forces based on Okinawa and the Philippines. [emphasis added]1 9 4 F 195 Most importantly, by controlling Taiwan, China would be freed from its 71-year strategic concentration on building the necessary operational requirements to seize the island, such as amphibious and air assault capabilities or a blue-water navy and massive transport fleet to be able to ferry troops across the strait. These capabilities would not disappear or become obsolete, but China would be able to redirect them to new mission sets. Similarly, China would not discontinue its "counter-intervention" or "anti-access/area denial" (A2/AD) strategy; rather it could focus it further afield and begin transitioning operations from the first island chain to the second island chain (see Figure 
2
Economically, China has much to gain by controlling Taiwan and the seas surrounding it. With an extensive mountain range running north-south on the eastern side of the island, the densely populated western side is naturally protected from the devastating typhoons that frequent the region. This also protects sea lanes and free passage through the Taiwan Strait which-if controlled or denied by China-could significantly affect imports and exports to South Korea and Japan. Furthermore, control of the Taiwan Strait would place China in a more advantageous position to seize further disputed islands in the ECS and SCS, creating a consolidated EEZ and ADIZ extending further into the West Pacific. give China greater economic leverage in the region and world, as well as alleviate the socalled "Malacca Dilemma" or vulnerability of sea-lanes from the Indian Ocean to East Asia through the Malacca Strait. From a budgetary perspective, the PLA currently dedicates a significant portion of its budget to developing and maintaining its capability to invade and seize Taiwan. If China were to reunify Taiwan, those funds could shift to other strategic priorities, such as expanding its A2/AD range to the second island chain and beyond.
Diplomatically, control of Taiwan will have an uncertain effect for China. For decades, China's diplomatic rhetoric and coercive efforts have centered around ensuring other nations adhere to the "One-China policy." But if China were to annex Taiwan, the "One-China policy" would become moot and extraneous for many nations in their dealings with China. Absent this issue, it is uncertain whether China would be able to retain the level of diplomatic pressure it previously enjoyed. Freed from the leverage which China held regarding the "One-China policy," nations may become emboldened to resist Chinese coercion directly. But it may equally induce nations to increase their relations with China or "bandwagon" with China rather than "balance" against it. With the "question" of Taiwan definitively answered and the greatest threat to peace and stability in the region removed from the table, China may or may not be able to exert greater pressure on the world stage.
In the information and cyber domain, all of the resources and time invested into coercing Taiwan could be directed further afield. Furthermore, the loss of a robust democracy like Taiwan would be a feather in the cap for China. Whether Taiwan falls to China because the United States fails to intervene or because it loses in battle, either outcome will fuel and validate China's narrative of the inevitability of its rejuvenation and America's decline. The loss of a democratic Taiwan would have a detrimental effect on American credibility and perceived resolve, as well as the legitimacy of a democratic, values-based international order. More than the material gain that Taiwan would provide China, reunification would strike a symbolic and ideological victory at the heart of U.S.-PRC competition and would advance China's "Beijing Consensus" and grand strategy.
Following the stunning U.S. victory over Iraq in 1991 and then China's sobering confrontation in 1996 with not one but two U.S. carrier strike groups in the Taiwan Strait, Beijing resolved to never again be in a "position of military weakness" vis-à-vis the United 
China's seizure of Taiwan would undeniably be a significant strategic payoff.
Taiwan is a tantalizing temptation for China that would add value to it politically, militarily, psychologically, and economically. But seizure of Taiwan could just as easily transform it into an international pariah overnight. For that reason, the manner in which China acquires Taiwan is absolutely critical.
There is general consensus among Taiwan security pundits that Beijing has three broad courses of action available to it: invasion, blockade, and seizure of off-shore islands.
First is the obvious and worrisome option of a full-scale cross-strait invasion by sea and China. The attack would equate in significance to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and Allied forces throughout the Pacific in 1941. Such an act of aggression could potentially involve a broader alliance architecture, such as the inclusion of NATO. Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty restricts NATO members from invoking Article 5 unless an attack occurs against a member's territory in Europe, North America, or the Atlantic. But it is highly unlikely that a coalition of NATO countries would not support the United States in some fashion, if not with outright military support. In contrast, the benefit of the second choice for China is that Beijing would avoid the "tripwire" effect of military alliances described above and would be more capable of maintaining the diplomatic "high ground."
China consistently asserts that the resolution of Taiwan's separation from the mainland is purely a "domestic" concern. By carefully sidestepping any military confrontation with surrounding powers, Beijing could justifiably condemn any foreign military attempts to intervene as acts of aggression against China's "domestic" sovereignty. This "no first strike" policy could feasibly entangle foreign domestic and international decision-makers in lengthy and legally problematic debates, wherein Beijing could deploy the full force of its diplomatic, economic, and cyber "united front" to ensure inaction long enough to achieve a fait accompli in Taiwan. The risks of this choice, however, is that the United States, Japan, and other regional powers could decide to launch a counteroffensive despite the legal and normative ramifications and destroy China's chances of taking Taiwan whole.
In the long-term, Taiwan would likely receive full international recognition and support while China would likely never again have the opportunity to reunify Taiwan. The blow to China's legitimacy, economy, and political stability could be catastrophic.
The second, alternative course of action for Beijing other than invasion is to form a naval or air blockade around the island in hopes of starving Taiwan of precious trade and resources until it submits to Beijing's demands. The blockade could be in full or in part;
China could prevent all foreign imports yet continue to provide essential goods and services from the mainland, making Taiwan dependent on China for survival. But the costs and benefits of this course of action are nearly identical to the first, with the added difficulty that a complete blockade of an island the size of Taiwan would be extremely time-and resource-intensive. It is a less attractive option for Beijing because it leaves too much open in the hands of Taiwan and international actors such as the United States or Japan. To encircle the island, China would need to occupy and control maritime zones contested by Japan in the ECS and would disrupt trading sea lanes to Japan through the strait. The chances of success would diminish over time as the level and volume of international opposition would grow proportionally. The most likely international response to a blockade of Taiwan would be a counter-blockade of China.2 0 5 F 206 Even though China would control the majority of the waters in the surrounding SCS and ECS, it would not be overly difficult for the United States and nations along the contested "nine-dash line" to make the "Malacca Dilemma" a reality for China by blockading its SLOCs from the Strait of Malacca or for Japan to counter-blockade from the ECS. China would have to eventually abandon the blockade of Taiwan or turn its forces outward to penetrate and disaggregate the coalition counter-blockade.
The third course of action is a much more plausible one. Beijing could seize one of Taiwan's offshore islands, such as Kinmen island-which lies only five miles of China's coast-in order to hold it as ransom for political concessions from Taiwan or to draw Taiwan across the strait into a fight of attrition which it cannot win. China could also seize Taiwan's Dongsha Atoll (Pratas Islands) at the northern edge of the SCS or Taiping Island in the Spratly Islands in order to transform either into an artificial island and military installation.2 0 6 F 207 This is often considered the most likely course of action if Beijing's goal is to signal resolve domestically and internationally but not instigate a full-blown war. But China has had the capability of taking Taiwan's off-shore islands for decades and has refrained from doing so. The problem with this course of action is it would all but guarantee that China would never have the opportunity to take Taiwan proper in the future. The alarm and backlash against such a hostile act would likely be the tipping point for large-scale international support for Taiwan and more conclusive measures to ensure Taiwan is heavily

defended. It could even precipitate Taiwanese independence. If China were to decide to seize an offshore island, it would need to do so in a way that does not preclude the option of taking Taiwan itself in the future. Once again, it matters very much the manner in which China acquires an offshore island.
The Taiwanese military, in contrast, has identified five scenarios that could lead to invasion from the mainland: (1) if an internal upheaval occurs on the island, (2) if Taiwan's armed forces become comparatively weak; (3) if any foreign power interferes in Taiwan's internal affairs, (4) if Taipei refuses to talk to Beijing about unification for a protracted period; and/or (5) the island acquires nuclear weapons.2 0 7 F 208 Other variations abound. In November 2021, Reuters published an interactive "wargame" report to visually depict six potential scenarios for conflict between China and Taiwan-each preceded by extensive "gray zone" operations: (1) Blockade of the Matsu Islands, (2) Invasion of Kinmen Island, (3) Customs Quarantine, (4) Full Blockade, (5) Air and Missile Campaign, and (6) All-out Invasion (See Figure 
4
The three broad courses of action and other conflict scenarios like those depicted by Reuters provide a useful conceptual framework to assess Beijing's actions, but they are not predictive. The question that analysts largely ignore in these scenarios and which cannot be answered at present is: if Beijing succeeds in any of its courses of action and "wins," can it "win the peace?" This is a challenge for Beijing that is as difficult as-if not more difficult than-the challenge of seizing the island and preventing foreign intervention.  protracted protests that would erupt in Hong Kong less than two years later, but he astutely recognized the far-reaching impact that such an event would have on the Taiwanese people.
Referring to the Taiwanese president as "she," he may have predicted the re-election of the pro-independence-leaning DPP incumbent President Tsai Ing-wen in January 2020. The following month, Taiwan revealed a record high 83% of the populace identifying themselves as Taiwanese (rather than Chinese or both).2 Allison's analysis of potential scenarios leading to war has never been more relevant or timely today. His vision of the events linking these events to war with China is harrowing, yet no longer inconceivable.
Is the underlying structural stress of China's "rise" versus the United States' "rule" such that the outbreak of war is inevitable, as Thucydides's prescribed? The Harvard 211 Graham Allison, Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides 
's Trap?,
Additionally, the fact that Xi has invested so much toward the goal of reunification indicates, as Khan stated, that he cares so deeply about the issue that he no longer understands it.2 2 3 F 224 This is a dangerous temperament for a Chinese paramount leader to have, particularly when China's military capacity to successfully invade Taiwan is so close at hand. The predicament is that China is now more powerful than at any time in its history, but its insecurity has not commensurately diminished. In many ways its insecurity has increased, creating a volatile and unpredictable situation for Taiwan and the region.
Today there may be opportunities to take advantage of China's pragmatic operating principle. Competition does not need to be at the expense of ostracization, which would trigger China's greatest insecurity of threats to its sovereignty. Or perhaps the goal of competition should be to prevent and deny China from dealing with "whomever it wants in order to get the state it wants." Nevertheless, great power competition must be able to temper China's growing ambition and expanding core interests without stepping on its central nerve. As David Keegan asserts, "The challenge is how to avoid a crisis over Taiwan and enable strategic stability so that the U.S. and China have time to make the fundamental policy accommodations necessary for a more stable world order."2 
While speaking of China as America's "pacing threat" in June 2021, USD(P) Colin Kahl declared the importance of "getting China right," adding that with any strategy, "resources must be matched to strategy, strategy matched to policy and policy matched to the will of the American people."2 2 6 F 227 Following this wisdom, chapters IV through VI outline the various military "ends, ways, and means" for an asymmetric defense and unconventional deterrence strategy for Taiwan in order to achieve national policy objectives in great power competition with China.
The outline follows the "strategy stool" framework conceived by acclaimed Army War College professor and retired Army colonel, Art Lykke. Lykke frames military strategy as a stool which balances national security on three legs: objectives, concepts, and resources.2 2 7 F 228 Objectives represent "ends," resources represent the "means," and concepts represent the "ways" by which the "means" are linked to "ends." The greater the imbalance between the three legs, the greater degree of risk to national security. "Strategy fails when the chosen means prove insufficient to the ends. This can happen because the wrong means are chosen or because the ends are too ambitious or slippery."2 2 8 F 229 Currently, the U.S.
strategy stool for Taiwan is imbalanced and is growing more imbalanced-increasing the degree of risk (see Figure 
5
Strategies formulated with existing capabilities under existing policies are "operational" strategies. They are typically short-term strategies conducive to five-year plans. Longerterm strategies based on estimates of the future environment and which may require changes to existing policies or capabilities are "force development" strategies.2 3 0 F 231 The unconventional deterrence strategy outlined in this study contains elements of both these levels of Lykke's conception of strategy. Some of the "ends, ways, and means" apply to an immediate "operational" strategy while others apply more to a "force development" strategy. In this case, the "operational" objectives are roughly equivalent to Taiwan's asymmetric defense objectives while the "force development" objectives are the U.S. BPC objective is to develop and support this collective military objective, but also to foster Taiwanese defense transformation and innovation.
The Within this construct, the strategic goal for a Taiwanese defensive posture is to create as many dilemmas for Beijing and as many options for Taipei and its allies as possible. The challenges that Beijing would face during a large-scale amphibious assault across the strait against a conventional Taiwanese defense are enormous. But Beijing is rapidly closing the capability gap in order to achieve this feat and it may not even be dissuaded by the potential costs of such an assault. Therefore, the strategic goal is to create a "defense-in-depth" on the island and in the surrounding waters consisting of integrated and dispersed conventional and unconventional capabilities. The objective of a conventional operational approach is to attrit PLA amphibious forces as they cross the strait and prevent them from gaining a decisive foothold on the island. The objective of an unconventional operational approach is to build resilient and redundant systems in order to absorb the costs of the assault and to have a robust resistance capability in order to prevent PLA forces from achieving full control of the island. In other words, the goal of a conventional approach is to prevent PLA forces from landing on the island whereas the goal of an unconventional operational approach is to compel the PLA to commit as many forces as possible until the ensuing counterinsurgency campaign is no longer politically tenable. As Andrew Mack stated, "In order to win, [the insurgents] must be able to impose a steady accumulation of 'costs' on their opponent… Strategically, the insurgents' aim must be to provoke the external power into escalating its forces on the ground."2 3 5 F 236
The combination of conventional and unconventional defense and deterrence approaches, regular and irregular forces, civil-military fusion, and resilience and resistance concepts is known as "total defense" or "comprehensive defense." Comprehensive defense measures are an effective deterrent because they force the aggressor to have to prepare and develop capabilities for not only a conventional attack but also for an ensuing, protracted resistance campaign-i.e., invasion and counterinsurgency. Tami Biddle explains the logic of this dynamic in her article, Coercion Theory: An army's presence on the ground is at once its greatest strength and its greatest weakness… A determined weaker enemy may be willing to enter an escalatory contest, upping the ante by turning to irregular methods and relying on time (and a high pain threshold) to hold out against a stronger force. Or it may turn to irregular methods once a conventional war has been fought, in order to shift the terms of surrender or alter the postwar political situation.2 3 6 F 237
The Comprehensive Defence Handbook (CDH) published by NATO Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ) refers to the unconventional resistance component of comprehensive defense as "asymmetric defense." The strategic "end" of an asymmetric defense strategy for Taiwan is to deny China from achieving political and populace control by building Taiwan's capacities for resilience and resistance. There are multiple benefits of this strategy for the United States.
First, the more resilience Taiwan has in peacetime-i.e., the ability to absorb costs or recover from those effects rapidly-the less salient the argument that Washington should signal a clear commitment to Taiwan's defense. In other words, Taiwanese resilience enables "strategic ambiguity" to persist-providing Washington with flexible response options and unofficial channels for de-escalation and dual deterrence. But a lack of resilience pressures Washington to adopt greater "strategic clarity"-constraining it to a narrow menu of options and binary, zero-sum solutions. Similarly, the more resistance capacity Taiwan has-i.e., the ability to protract a conflict and prevent full political annexation-the less credibility (capability & commitment) that Washington will have to carefully manage. In other words, Taiwan's resistance capacity reduces both the power projection capabilities (e.g., strategic lift, forward basing, naval presence etc.) and the level of resolve needed by Washington to commit those capabilities and the lives of U.S. service members in response to a potential crisis. If Taiwan lacks resilience and the capacity to resist an occupation then it will likely capitulate quickly and American resolve would need to be clear and unified in order to intervene in time-if at all. But if Taiwan possesses robust resilience and resistance capacities then a Chinese occupation will be more likely to drag on indefinitely, which would provide Washington and the international community with sufficient time and space to mount a counteroffensive and isolate China diplomatically, economically, and psychologically. In this scenario, even if Taiwan were to ultimately exhaust its resilience and resistance capacities and succumb to PRC control, it would still have denied China from achieving its grand strategic objective in the manner of its choosing. In the end, if all else fails, China may regain its territorial sovereignty, but the enormously consequential costs will likely destroy its chances for achieving "national rejuvenation" and becoming a "strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and modern socialist country" by 2049. This would place the United States in position of considerable advantage in global strategic competition with China.
The alternative is for Washington to increase its security commitments and "strategic clarity" with Taiwan and begin to commit more and more resources and assets to defend Taiwan. But there is no reason for Washington to believe it will be at an advantage in a situation of mutual imposition of costs with China. In a brinksmanship style of competition, the side that typically wins is the side with greater asymmetry of interest or resolve, as opposed to asymmetry of power. Direct, conventional approaches to deterrence are less likely to succeed in these cases than indirect, unconventional approaches.
While speaking of global strategic competition with China in June 2021, USD(P)
Colin Kahl stated: "My own view is that we win this competition by emphasizing our strengths… which is an unrivaled network of partners and allies around the world."2 Chinese focus more on resolve.2 4 0 F 241 Given this distinction, it is even more important for policymakers and practitioners alike to understand the concept of asymmetry and its role in strategy formulation.
The distinction of asymmetry is relevant to this study because the "question" of Taiwan into a "porcupine" or "poison pill" for China, they will be more likely to succeed in mitigating the relative power asymmetries by protracting the time horizon long-enough for a U.S.-led coalition to balance the asymmetry of resolve as well.
It is important to understand that all conflict-in effect-is asymmetric; there always exists some measure of disparity or overmatch between belligerents because no two belligerents are equally powerful. As Conrad Crane proclaimed and LTG (Ret.) H.R.
McMaster was known to frequently quote, "there are two approaches to waging war, asymmetric and stupid."2 4 2 F 243 All belligerents engage in asymmetric conflict in some fashion in order to circumvent the other's strengths, gain a position of advantage, and exploit the other's weaknesses. In 1994, political scientist T.V. Paul described asymmetric conflict as, "conflict involving two states with unequal overall military and economic power resources."2 4 3 F 244 But this definition fails to account for the positive versus negative forms of asymmetry as well as the difference between power asymmetry and interest asymmetry.
Most often, people tend to view asymmetric warfare in its negative form-as a threat which 
In his seminal 1975 article, "Why Big Nations Lose Small Wars: The Politics of Asymmetric Conflict," Andrew Mack was one of the first to use the concept of asymmetry to describe certain conflicts like the Vietnam War-which at the time was fresh in the minds of the American public and which had confounded military experts as to how the inferior North Vietnamese and Viet Cong were able to overcome the superior U.S. military.
Mack postulated that small powers succeed against larger powers not through military capability, but by attriting the political capability or will of the larger power. This dynamic is a function of what he calls the "asymmetric relationship" and "asymmetric structure" between the two powers.2 4 8 F 249
"Asymmetric relationship" refers to how each belligerent views the other, the level of perceived threat which each poses to the other, and the relative stakes at hand. For example, Washington views potential conflict over Taiwan as essentially a limited war because-although China has the capability to physically threaten U.S. interests or attack U.S. territory-it would still be regional in nature with no desire for all-out warfare with China. Beijing, however, views potential conflict over Taiwan as a total-albeit, "domestic"-war with the potential unlimited aim of reunification. Taiwan also views conflict as total because war would threaten its continued existence. As the current CENTCOM commander GEN McKenzie observed, "a rich man's small-scale contingency may be a poor man's major theater war."2 4 9 F 250 For Mack, these relationships are a consequence of power asymmetry versus interest asymmetry.
The United States and China also exist within an "asymmetric structure," which refers to their respective ability to bear a protracted war of attrition against each other (politically, psychologically, etc.). As the U.S. Air War College professor of strategy Dr. Arreguín-Toft's framework is useful for Taiwan as well. If Taiwan (as the weakactor) continues to pursue a direct, conventional defense strategy against China's stronger direct approach, it will likely fail. But if it defends using an indirect approach-all other things being equal-it will likely prevail. According to Dr. Record, "Indirect defense via irregular warfare is in most cases the only sensible strategy for the weaker side, because a direct defense is an invitation to swift defeat."2 5 4 F 255 Therefore, according to the theory of strategic interaction, the United States and Taiwan should both adopt a combined, indirect, and asymmetric strategic approach to counter China's direct strategy to invade and forcefully annex Taiwan. For Arreguín-Toft, the "key causal mechanism of the strategic interaction thesis is time."2 5 5 F 256 In other words, the actor with greater resilience can outlast the relative power of the aggressor. An indirect strategy of unconventional deterrence which threatens protracted resistance against China is the most likely strategy to succeed.
In this way, as Arreguín-Toft asserts, the "weak actor's strategy can make a strong actor's power irrelevant. 
Deterrence is fundamentally a strategy to "shape another's perception of costs and benefits to dissuade threatening behavior."2 5 7 F 258 Acclaimed political scientist and deterrence scholar Glenn Snyder calls this the aggressor's "risk calculus," which consists of four basic considerations: (1) assessment of one's objectives and the expected benefits of action; 
(2)
The purpose of compellence is most often to change a status quo by pressuring and persuading the target actor to take an action which it would not normally take and which is favorable to the compeller. The purpose of deterrence, however, is most often to maintain a status quo between actors by affecting the target actor's cost-benefit calculus and dissuading it from taking a belligerent action to change the status quo. For example, while
Beijing seeks to compel Taiwan and change the status quo-whether forcibly or via "gray zone," encroachment tactics-Washington seeks to maintain the status quo by deterring Beijing from taking steps in that direction unilaterally. Washington also seeks to deter
Taipei from unilaterally changing the status quo in the opposite direction-by declaring de facto independence. This is the concept of "dual deterrence." There is also an element of "triple deterrence;" Washington seeks to deter third party states from unbalancing the status quo by either bandwagoning with Beijing or encouraging Taipei to declare independence.
Furthermore, there is a distinction between direct and extended deterrence. Direct or basic deterrence is any action taken by a deterrer to discourage and prevent belligerent action against the deterrer directly. Extended deterrence is the concept of deterring belligerent actions against a third-party, such as an ally or protégé. This is undoubtedly the case with Taiwan, and arguably the main reason for the passage of the TRA in 1979.
Extended compellence logically follows as any attempts by a compeller to pressure or persuade a target to take action in favor of a third-party. However, there are more nuanced From this understanding of coercion theory, Washington's main policy objective to deter or counter Beijing should be to prevent it from achieving its foremost policy objective: the reunification of Taiwan. This assessment results from a basic center of gravity (COG) analysis of the CCP. The CCP's COG is the grand "Chinese Dream" and the critical vulnerabilities to its legitimacy include the repression of Hong Kong, the persecution of Muslim Uyghurs, and the uncertainty of Taiwan. Countering Beijing would include various and synchronized forms of direct and extended coercion efforts across each of the levers of national power (DIMEFIL). In many ways Washington is already pursuing this course of action but has yet to coalesce its actions into a coherent foreign policy for both its allies and partners to comprehend and support-as well as for the American public.
The latter audience is the nucleus of the dilemma.
Effective deterrence relies on the threat credibility of the deterrer, which itself relies on the retaliatory capability of the deterrer to intervene against the aggressor and inflict sufficient costs that outweigh the benefits of aggression. This includes more than just military capabilities. But credibility also relies on the perceived resolve of the deterrer.
"Making the hostile actor believe that the deterring actor has the political will to deny benefits and impose costs, even if it comes at a price to oneself, is an important element to impact its cost-benefit calculus."2 5 9 F 260 The most significant finding from the system dynamics analysis summarized in Appendix A is that the actual capability of the United actions by means of "decisive influence over their decision-making." Decisive influence is defined as "credibly threatening to deny benefits and/or impose costs, while encouraging restraint by convincing the actor that restraint will result in an acceptable outcome."2 6 7 F 268 P P In other words, decisive influence is achieved via denial and/or punishment in conjunction with compellence toward an acceptable outcome. Deterrence operations and strategies must be narrow enough to address specific adversaries but also broad enough to address widely varying risk-taking propensities. Different adversaries have different interests, values, and decision-making processes and vary in their tolerances of risks for different threats. Risk-averse adversaries will view uncertainty and ambiguity as threatening because it complicates clear and rational decision-making. More risk-tolerant adversaries will view uncertainty and ambiguity as potential opportunities to be exploited. Political scientist T. V. Paul calls this "complex deterrence" to describe the ambiguous and indeterminate deterrence relationships between various types of actors, such as great powers, nonstate actors, and third party weak states etc.2 6 8 F 269 For this reason, deterrence operations need to be flexible enough to address the variations in strategic interaction and both risk-averse and risk-tolerant adversaries.
Deterrence strategies also need to be flexible enough to adapt to changing environments and situations. JP 5-0 labels these as flexible deterrent options (FDO):
"preplanned deterrence-oriented actions to signal to and influence an adversary's actions."2 6 9 F 270 FDOs facilitate a commander's decision-making process by "laying out a wide range of interrelated response paths that are carefully tailored to avoid the classic response of 'too much, too soon, or too little, too late.'"2 7 0 F 271 P P Joint commands develop FDOs within each of the instruments of national power (DIME) to deter adversarial actions before or during a crisis.

There are two foundational forms of deterrence: "deterrence by punishment" and "deterrence by denial." There are also two related forms: "deterrence by entanglement"
and "deterrence by assurance" or inducement."2 7 2 F 273 The fundamental difference between the two primary forms is their directional focus vis-à-vis the aggressor. The first form focuses on reactive measures to punish aggression while the second focuses on proactive measures to deny aggression. The first focuses on raising the costs in the aggressor's "cost-benefit" analysis while the second focuses on reducing the benefits.
"Deterrence by punishment" refers to dissuading aggression by threatening the imposition of costs that are higher than the anticipated benefits. "Deterrence by entanglement" is similar to deterrence by punishment in that the end result of each is the same: costs that are higher than the anticipated benefits. With "deterrence by punishment," the deterrer imposes the costs, whereas with "deterrence by entanglement" the costs are self-imposed. Many experts argue that "deterrence by entanglement" is the dominant form between China and the United States due to their economic and financial involvements. For example, Graham Allison invokes the concept of mutual assured economic destruction (MAED) as a powerful deterrent against the Thucydides Trap.2 7 5 F 276 "Deterrence by denial," in contrast, refers to dissuading aggression by signaling to the aggressor that the deterrer can easily absorb an attack with minimal costs and recover quickly.2 7 6 F 277 This denial capacity makes it infeasible or unlikely that the aggressor will attain its objectives, neutralizing its confidence in its theory of victory.2 7 7 F 278 Denial strategies focus principally on effecting the fourth factor of Snyder's "risk calculus:" the probability of gaining the objectives.2 7 8 F 279 "Deterrence by assurance" or inducement is related to "deterrence by denial" in that the end result is the same: the aggressor does not achieve his goals. With "deterrence by denial" the goals are negated, whereas with "deterrence by assurance" or inducement the goals are foreclosed or substituted by offering alternate ones. Notwithstanding, some form of reassurance is desirable for any successful deterrence strategy.2 7 9 F 280
There are fundamentally two ways to think about "deterrence by denial." First, the general tendency is to think of denial as preventing or blocking an aggressor's action. This conception, however, can easily be confused with "deterrence by punishment." Positioning denial capabilities to prevent an aggressor's action is essentially a threat to impose costs should the aggressor take that action. But this conception of deterrence is in reality a form of defense; "deterrence and defense are analytically distinct but thoroughly interrelated in practice."2 8 0 F 281 An example which elucidates these distinctions is the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis of 1996, when Washington sent two carrier strike groups to dissuade Beijing from aggressive action against Taiwan. This was simultaneously a threat of punishment to impose costs if Beijing escalated tensions and a denial strategy to prevent Beijing from achieving its political and military objectives. However, it was also a rapid countermaneuver to intervene in the strait and defend Taiwan.
The other way to think of "deterrence by denial" is denying the benefit and viability of an aggressor's objective. This can be achieved by making it difficult for the aggressor to attain its objectives, by making it harder to retain its objectives, or by making it difficult to accrue any benefit from the attainment of its objectives. The first and second approaches employ a "porcupine" stratagem, while the third employs a "poison pill" stratagem. Both punishment and denial rely considerably on the three pillars of deterrence: capability, commitment, and communication. But the nature of each pillar differs. With punishment, the deterrer communicates its retaliatory capabilities and commitment to use them in order to impose costs should the aggressor attack. But with denial, the deterrer communicates its resilience capabilities and commitment to absorb costs. The subtle difference is critical.
With punishment, if the aggressor perceives the threat as credible and costly, it will likely not change its objectives. It will simply reassess its response options and develop countervailing capabilities to mitigate the costs. But with denial, if the aggressor perceives the deterrer's resilience as high and the probability of success as low, it may reassess its response options and develop countervailing capabilities, but it will also be forced to reassess its objectives. This is the fundamental value proposition of an extended deterrence by denial versus punishment approach for Taiwan. Due to China's resolute objective of reunifying the island, it is unlikely that any amount of punishment threats will alter its costbenefit analysis. Instead, extended deterrence strategies must incorporate denial approaches that focus on making the perceived benefits unfeasible and unviable.
Many continue to advocate a strategy of "deterrence by punishment" for Taiwan based off its success in the past. In their research note, "The Power and Limits of Compellence," Robert Art and Kelly Greenhill illustrate two successful instances of extended compellence, both originating in the Taiwan Strait between China and the United States 
(1954-55 and 1958)
The greatest problem with current strategic thinking and design for the Taiwan security dilemma is that actors within the system have failed to reassess the mental model for Taiwan to see if the current strategy of deterrence is the most appropriate. This is a classic example of "bounded rationality," whereby actors within a system act rationally and for the best interests of the system's objectives, but operate within limited bounds of information, a flawed mental model, or simply too small a subset of the system to fully know how their actions affect the system overall. Their actions can impede or contradict the actions of others operating from a different perspective or location within the system. An example of this dynamic is the recent Pacific Deterrence Initiative (PDI), a $6 billion fund authorized by Congress in the FY2021 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to "send a strong signal to the Chinese Communist Party that America is deeply committed to defending our interests in the Indo-Pacific."2 8 2 F 283 The PDI will primarily invest in more modern, dispersed, and resilient capabilities and force postures throughout the Pacific, such as upgrading Guam's missile defense systems. But the PDI is fraught with problems, not least of which is a lack of emphasis on security cooperation-leaving a mere $500 million to "strengthening alliances and partnerships." This has led some analysts to call the PDI a "band-aid" solution and the "Platform" Deterrence Initiative.2 8 3 F 284 The initiative is a good example of strategic programming versus strategic planning, wherein planners assemble a strategy from previously existing ones rather than designing one anew.
The DOD modeled the PDI after the European Defense Initiative (EDI) which it introduced to deter Russian aggression in Europe shortly after the annexation of Crimea in 2014. With the PDI, the DOD is "doubling down" on punishment and "third offset" measures to deter Beijing.2 8 4 F 285 But many experts are calling for the Pentagon and Congress to amend the PDI so as to reflect a denial approach instead and focus on partners rather than platforms. A 2020 article from The Diplomat astutely postulated the benefits of such an approach:
Getting the PDI right means understanding which model is more strategically stable and palatable to U.S. allies without spooking them into thinking that the PDI is too overtly antagonistic. Deterrence by punishment would be fundamentally destabilizing and create more problems than it would solve.
Utilizing the resources provided by the PDI to formalize a deterrence by denial doctrine would be the far more stabilizing and diplomatically realistic option. Many U.S. allies and partners already follow a denial doctrine themselves, giving U.S. planners a solid basis to argue for building upon already existing capabilities.
While allies and partners play a major role in a PDI informed by denial, they are largely bystanders in a PDI informed by punishment.2 8 5 F 286
The authors go on to argue that a PDI informed by denial would also promote less expensive and more independent partner capabilities; help to overcome the "tyranny of distance" and challenges for U.S. power projection into the region; facilitate the services' new force design plans and concepts such as the Marine Corps' expeditionary advanced basing operations (EABO); and avoid the dyadic narrative of ideological competition between Washington and Beijing which tends to cloud any discussion of the topic.
One of the plausible reasons why current strategic thinking favors an extended "deterrence by punishment" strategy for Taiwan may be because of the growing call for a policy of greater "strategic clarity" in order to increase formal relations with Taiwan and intensify anti-invasion rhetoric. The belief is that threats of punishment must be clear in order to be credible. Therefore, without clarity for deterrent signaling, Beijing will not perceive any U.S. deterrence activities as credible. "Strategic ambiguity" supposedly inhibits this deterrent signaling. But with an extended "deterrence by denial" strategy, "strategic ambiguity" would actually enhance deterrent signaling because the goal of a denial strategy is to increase the ambiguity and uncertainty for an aggressor that it will be able to achieve its objectives. What Washington and Taipei need is not to provide Beijing with greater clarity regarding the potential conditions and costs of war but to induce greater ambiguity and uncertainty into Beijing's decision cycle. Alternatively, some suggest that Taiwan should develop the capabilities needed to strike strategic sites on the mainland and hold Chinese population centers at risk as a punishment strategy. But such a strategy would be counterproductive for Taiwan, as it would likely only serve to increase China's asymmetry of resolve vis-à-vis the international community. It would reduce Taipei and Washington's collective ability to message Taiwan's victimhood and to thereby garner international backing for Taiwan and political ire for China.
Conventional deterrence of China has worked in the past primarily because of U.S. conventional military superiority, as well as its relative credibility and resolve. However, conventional deterrence efforts may have no coercive psychological effect if China comes to perceive in the future that it has conventional superiority-at least to achieve local and limited goals. China is nearly there. Conditions have changed, and conventional deterrence alone is no longer enough. Contrary to the initial inclinations when considering different extended deterrence strategies, the appropriate solution for the United States and Taiwan is not to select one form of deterrence to the exclusion of the others. While this study primarily focuses on a "deterrence by denial" strategy for Taiwan, it does not seek to invalidate all other strategies.
There is no "one size fits all" for deterrence. The requirements for effective deterrence vary given the need to address the unique perceptions, goals, interests, strengths, strategies, and vulnerabilities of different potential adversaries. The deterrence strategy effective against one potential adversary may not deter another.2 8 6 F 287
The optimal solution is to diversify and integrate multiple forms of deterrence in tandem with and in mutual support of each other. A comprehensive defense strategy for Taiwan which combines conventional and unconventional, direct and indirect, and symmetric and asymmetric approaches should also combine a comprehensive deterrence strategy of both punishment and denial approaches at each phase of the operational campaign. For example, prior to armed conflict, the aim should be to deter the initiation of high-end conflict by threatening to impose significant costs (punishment) while simultaneously mitigating lowend hybrid activities by denying their negative effect (denial). During conflict, the aim should be to deter escalation of the invasion and to protract a fait accompli indefinitely through organized resistance-a combination of both punishment and denial plans. This diversified and differentiated combination of deterrence activities can be viewed as a form of "tailored deterrence" and is likely at the heart of the Pentagon's new concept of "integrated deterrence" with partners and allies. Tailored and integrated extended deterrence is particularly effective for small states like Taiwan. With an asymmetric defense strategy which combines both punishment and denial approaches, It is important to note that unconventional deterrence is not a UW or special operations approach, nor is it conducted only by SOF or unconventional forces. Rather it is "unconventional" because it goes against the conventional logic of deterrence. In the case of Taiwan, this logical argument goes something like this:
This argument may be valid but it is unsound, meaning one or more of its premises is not entirely true. The argument fails a common fallacy test known as "denying the antecedent" wherein the conclusion () does not logically follow when the first proposition (X) is denied. Unconventional deterrence recognizes that an invasion (X) is not causally sufficient to bring about reunification (Y). It may make it more likely, but what is necessary is that China controls Taiwan politically. This can occur through peaceful concession from the Taiwanese to unify with China, coercive measures which compel them to unify, or a Taiwanese surrender after a period of armed conflict. It is not the means of reunification that matter but the end result: political control. China could accomplish this by utterly destroying Taiwan like Athens did to Melos or it could accomplish it without any force whatsoever.
An apt example of this played out during the NPS-MIT geostrategic wargame in October 2021. In the wake of a 7.9 magnitude earthquake and meltdown of a nuclear power plant reactor, PLA forces landed "humanitarian relief" forces at a small airport in Taiwan.
Over the course of several moves, the PLA slowly increased its footprint, incorporated
Taiwanese "liaisons" to deconflict air traffic, and renamed the airport the "PRC friendship airport" in a gesture of peaceful intentions. This wargame scenario plainly demonstrates how a PLA invasion of Taiwan is not the only situation in which Chinese forces could arrive and gain a foothold on the island. But Taiwan can still deny China from controlling its populace no matter how Chinese forces arrive on the island.
It is very difficult for Taiwan-and increasingly less likely in the face of China's rapid military growth and modernization-to prevent PLA forces from putting "boots on the ground." It may not even be possible either for Taiwan to prevent the PLA from defeating its military forces. But that does not logically entail that China will "win" reunification until it has first secured the entire populace and stamped out all violent and non-violent resistance. Taiwan's goal need not be to keep PLA troops off the island or defeat the PLA in decisive battle. Taiwan should certainly strive to deter and deny China from landing and defeating its forces, but it should not be its only goal. Instead, Taiwan should strive to resist a Chinese occupation and deny it freedom of maneuver and freedom of operation. In this way, unconventional deterrence is not about blocking an invasion from happening, but making it so that if an invasion occurs, the populace keeps it from having its desired effect. As a thriving democracy facing an authoritarian occupier, Taiwan has a unique potential to resist foreign subjugation. understanding to develop an unconventional deterrence strategy for Taiwan.
An unconventional deterrence strategy is particularly well suited for "weak" states like Taiwan that are unable to defend themselves without outside support or intervention.
As the acclaimed political scientist and IR scholar John J. 
Mearsheimer (1983)
[conventional] deterrence does not really apply."3 0 2 F 303 Taiwan aptly fits this depiction of a weak power vis-à-vis China, but can it still be considered weak when the United States provides "defense articles and defense services" to Taiwan or if it were evident that the United States would intervene military to defend Taiwan? An unconventional deterrence strategy would not be ideal for Taiwan if this were the case.
Generally speaking, a weak state that concentrates its defense according to the expectations of an external military assistance, normally needs to defend some important strategic points of their national territory, in order to facilitate the intervention of its allies. In turn, that is inherently inconsistent with unconventional capabilities, which are not the best means for holding territory.3 0 3 F 304
But it is precisely because the United States' commitment to defend Taiwan is uncertain that Taiwan should "concentrate its defenses according to the expectations" of no external military assistance, and therefore should adopt an unconventional deterrence strategy which does not focus on holding territory. An unconventional deterrence strategy would also be optimal for the United States because it would align with the current policy of "strategic ambiguity." In fact, the strategy would thrive under such conditions and would alleviate any political pressure to change the policy.
Although an unconventional deterrence strategy involves unconventional means and methods, it is not an unconventional strategy per se. While SOF are uniquely skilled to plan and implement an unconventional deterrence strategy, it requires interservice, interagency, and civil-military cooperation. Likewise, neither conventional nor unconventional alone is sufficient. As Arreguín-Toft exclaims, "conventional deterrence works best when both sides define power in similar ways," while unconventional deterrence works when "the benefits of a positive outcome [for the aggressor] are low to nil, and the costs are likely to be high-perhaps a Vietnam-like quagmire."3 0 4 F 305 Once again, the strategic goal is to create as many dilemmas as possible for China to have to account for and to have to develop countervailing capabilities for. By combining an unconventional deterrence plan with a conventional one, Taiwan would create a "deterrence-in-depth" or "elastic denial-in-depth" as 
Michael Hunzeker et. al
Leading American economist and game theorist Thomas Schelling described deterrence and coercion as a bargaining process between actors. What is their theory of victory? Second, it is important to identify China's strategy for Taiwan and how it aligns with its global strategic goals and policy objectives. Lastly, it is it is important to understand China's grand strategy and how Taiwan is the critical linchpin within it.
There are multiple ways to understand the Chinese strategic psyche, but there are four principal components that are relevant to this study: 
(1)
The first component of the Chinese strategic psyche is the utilization of "history as a mirror to guide the present."3 1 0 F 311 This does not just include modern history but also "civilizational history going back millennia."3 The official AUKUS partnership and unofficial QUAD relationship reiterate the commitment to a "free and open Indo-Pacific" that is "undaunted by coercion." The danger is that Beijing may feel that it is running out of options except a military one.
Due in part to their far-reaching temporal view of history and the future, the Chinese strategic psyche displays tremendous strategic patience. "Given China's view that progress advances in decades and centuries rather than days and months, it has historically shown a capacity to set problems aside for long periods"3 1 9 F 320 The time horizon for strategy formulation is likewise often in decades or even generations, rather than years. Henry Kissinger remarked that the Chinese think in terms of "multi-year maneuvers" and stress The Chinese concept of shih and the "patient accumulation of relative advantage" is at the center of China's "combination warfare" and "unrestricted warfare" approaches to reunify Taiwan without firing a shot. China has developed a long-term strategic time horizon to accomplish its objectives and has developed many levers of influence to combine "10,000 methods" as one from all the DIMEFIL instruments of national power.3 2 3 F 324 China typically employs these approaches in the "gray zone" below the threshold of armed conflict, but it has never forfeited the possibility of forceful means to reunify Taiwan.
Due to the Chinese concept of shih and "multi-year maneuvers," the Chinese naturally see the value of positive asymmetry and the indirect approach as conceived by Arreguín-Toft. Sun Tzu surmised the indirect approach in The Art of War:
Those adept in warfare can conquer the enemy without fighting battles, capture cities without laying siege to them, and annex states without prolonged warfare. They can preserve their own forces whole and intact while struggling for the mastery of the entire Empire. They can win a victory without wearying their men. All this is due to strategy.3 2 4 F 325
The concept of the indirect approach is central to the Chinese game Go, where players take turns placing white versus black stones on the intersections of a 19x19 grid of lines. The goal is not to attrit or remove pieces from the board, like Chess, but to surround more territory than the opponent. Many experts compare and contrast Go and Chess as different conceptual approaches to warfare from Eastern and Western traditions (see Figure

• Stage impressive displays of military capability including demonstrations and maneuvers (like China's record overflight of 149 aircraft in October 2020). • Exploit procedural uncertainties of intelligence operations.
• Target "sympathetic" groups and political factions.
• When dealing with democratic systems, divide and conquer.
• Act suddenly and swiftly when the opportunity presents itself. Present the world with faits accomplis. • Espouse only "reasonable" objectives.
• Always play the role of the aggrieved party (Hitler masked his longterm policy of expansion with the short-term attempts to redress the "wrongs" of Versailles, similar to China's "century of humiliation").3 3 7 F 338
Like Nazi Germany prior to WWII, China is playing a game of deception and deterrence to prevent intervention in its final approach to power. "Deception is a strategy designed to improve one's prospects in competition."3 3 8 F 339 Deception and stratagem, therefore, are the means by which China conducts sophisticated statecraft. Leading Cold War expert on statecraft, R. W. Van de Veld, defined statecraft as, "the process through which a nation attempts to minimize its weaknesses and limitations, and to maximize its strengths and capabilities in a current international situation to achieve its international goals of foreign policy."3 3 9 F 340 In this sense, Chinese statecraft through deception and stratagem are in many ways the embodiment of China's strategic psyche. Through strategic patience spanning decades and generations, China employs indirect approaches to develop shih in order to achieve its strategic and foreign policy goals and achieve strategic deception and surprise of its opponents. 
To develop and implement an effective counterstrategy to China's strategy for First is the identification of the "strategic opponent"which is presently the United States. Second is the "primary strategic direction" oriented to the geographic center of gravity (COG)-which is presently Taiwan and the surrounding first island chain. The third and most important guideline is the "basis of preparations for military struggle"-which is presently "counter-intervention" and amphibious assault capabilities within that geographic COG. The fourth is the "basic guiding thought" for the use of military power or formulation of operational approaches-which is presently the menu of options such as hybrid or "gray zone" encroachment, naval blockade, missile or cyber barrage, and all-out invasion etc.
The "question" of Taiwan is the proverbial "elephant in the room" for Chinese grand strategy. Beijing has employed every lever of national power to coerce and compel it has always been inflexible about Taiwan. Why? Because Taiwan-more than any other "core interest" of China-is a "trigger point" which awakens "fierce emotional reaction" in Beijing. Democracy in December. Additionally, because Taiwan's continued existence is the result of consistent U.S. intervention in the region, a free and independent Taiwan represents China's perceptions of U.S. containment, encroachment, and interference in its "domestic" and regional affairs. For China, the United States is omnipresent in its foreign and domestic affairs.3 4 3 F 344 All these factors coalesce to form a heated opinion of the Taiwan "question" that is intimately tied to China's sense of humiliation and self-sovereignty-and thus, China's grand strategic aims. As China's defense minister cited during the 1996 Taiwan 343 Khan, Haunted by Chaos, 188. 344 Andrew J. Nathan and Andrew Scobell, "How China Sees America: The Sum of Beijing's Fears," Foreign Affairs, October 2012, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2012-08-16/how-china-seesamerica.
Strait Crisis, "As long as Taiwan is not liberated, the Chinese people's historical humiliation is not washed away, as long as the Motherland is not reunited, our people's armed forces responsibility is not fulfilled."3 4 4 F 345 For Beijing, there is tremendous pressure to demonstrate resolve regarding Taiwan-not only to foreign target audiences and the Taiwanese populace, but more importantly to its own populace in order to preserve its perceived legitimacy. For example, in 2012 the Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun declared,
The Chinese government has unshakable resolve and will to uphold China's territorial sovereignty. We have the confidence and the ability to uphold the country's sovereignty and territorial integrity. No amount of foreign threats or pressure will shake, in the slightest, the resolve of the Chinese government and people.3 4 5 F 346
In 2013 Xi Jinping said, "No foreign country should expect us to make a deal on our core interests and hope we will swallow the bitter pill that will damage our sovereignty, security and development interests."3 4 6 F 347 And in 2017, Xi proclaimed, "We absolutely will not permit any person, any organization, any political party-at any time, in any form-to separate any piece of Chinese territory from China."3 4 7 F 348 This level of conviction and rhetoric explains the animus of several statements and actions coming from Beijing in recent months. Following the record 149 PLAAF fighter and bomber incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ in October 2020, Xi vowed to achieve "peaceful unification" and that the "historic mission of achieving the complete unification of our country must be realized, and can be realized… peaceful means is most in line with the overall interests of Chinese People, including Taiwan compatriots." However, he also warned that "those who forget their heritage, betray their country, and seek to break up 345 Garver, China's Quest, 629-30.

Nevertheless, these statements and actions indicate a concerning level of unease and impatience within the party. A noteworthy Washington Post op-ed by 
David Von
China is known as the sage of nations, strategically patient, thinking in terms of centuries while the West flits about like a toddler in a toy store. Current events are forcing a reappraisal, however, as China careens wildly-and very dangerously-from one bad decision to the next. This nation that supposedly thinks in centuries is now issuing sweeping fiats on a seemingly weekly basis. Xi is causing the world to recalculate the risks of doing business with such an unpredictable nation. 
Many people conceive of China's grand strategy as a detailed master plan spanning a century or longer, but "rather than a long-term strategy, the Chinese leadership are acutely aware of the here and now…China's leaders recognize that the road is littered with opportunities and challenges along the way, and it devises its policies accordingly and openly in speeches and other important policy documents."3 5 9 F 360 China's grand strategic thinking derives from three primary sources, one domestic and aspirational, one external and threat-oriented, and one internal and stability-oriented. Together, these inform China's domestic and foreign policies as well as changes in its military strategy.
( national insecurity."3 6 0 F 361 From this lens, any challenge to Chinese sovereignty is at once an affront to Chinese national pride and to its insecurity. Upholding sovereign claims is used to justify increasingly assertive and optimistic rhetoric and behavior.
In the last decade, Chinese officials have increasingly referred to the advent of a "period of historic opportunity." This language fully emerged in 2017, when Xi Jinping announced a new phase in Chinese grand strategy by declaring the world was in the midst of "great changes unseen in a century." The significance was not lost on his audience. Xi had recast a well-known phrase from general Li Hongzhang in 1872 pronouncing China's humiliation at the hand of Western powers: the world was experiencing "great changes unseen in 3,000 years."3 6 1 F 362 The simple yet profound juxtaposition of these two statements is the foundation for understanding Chinese grand strategy. Li foresaw the end of an era; Xi foresaw the beginning of a new era. Li proclaimed China's humiliation; Xi proclaimed China's rejuvenation. For Li, there was tragedy, but for Xi there is only opportunity. This is the assessment of the current National Security Council (NSC) China director and founding director of the Brookings China Strategy Initiative, Rush Doshi, in his 2021 book
The Long Game: China's Grand Strategy to Replace American Order. While the phrase originated years before Xi's announcement, it was Xi who tied it to the birth of a new era for China and the world, making it a cornerstone to his foreign policy in countless speeches.
In the same speech in 2017, Xi proclaimed China's future: "nourished by a nation's culture of more than 5,000 years, and backed by the invincible force of more than 1.3 billion people, we have an infinitely vast stage of our era, a historical heritage of unmatched depth, and incomparable resolve that enable us to forge ahead. [emphasis added]."3 6 2 F 363 Moreover, in November 2021, the CCP designated Xi as a "historic figure" on par with Mao Zedong and Deng Ziaoping-one who has "promoted historic achievements and historic changes."3 6 3 F 364 The choice of descriptors is no coincidence.
(2)
Grand Strategic Adjustments vis-à-vis the United States
The second basis for Chinese grand strategy is a close assessment of its greatest "strategic opponent:" the United States. Doshi argues that "China's assessment of American power has long been critical to its grand strategy. this twenty-year period China began to take greater initiative worldwide as its economy grew and its greatest rival found itself strategically occupied in the Middle East. It was during this time that Chinese leaders began to speak of China's "peaceful rise" or "peaceful development."3 6 7 F 368 The resulting Chinese grand strategy was to build regional order.
The third adjustment began after Xi's announcement in 2017 of "great changes unseen in a century." Jiang Zemin's "period of strategic opportunity" transitioned into Xi's "period of historic opportunity." The focus changed from "doing some things" under Deng to "striving for achievements" under Xi.  These "infractions" paint a picture of the CCP as deeply insecure and virtually obsessed with domestic and party stability. CCP leaders fear chaos more than anything, which can breed irrationality at times. Furthermore, when domestic events disturb party stability and question its legitimacy, the CCP tends to incite nationalist sentiment and turn it externally as an outlet. "The pattern seems fairly clear: when the regime worries about major challenges to its legitimacy, it tries to redirect blame to (mostly foreign) 'hostile forces.'"3 7 6 F 377 373 Samson Ellis, "EU Parliament Tests China's Warnings With First Visit to Taiwan," Bloomberg, last modified November 3, 2021, https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/eu-parliamenttests-china-s-warnings-with-first-visit-to-taiwan; "Baltic Lawmakers Meet Taiwan's Tsai, Stepping up Cooperation," Associated Press, last modified November 29, 2021, https://apnews.com/article/europechina-estonia-taiwan-latvia-de0c6b41ad5a50e9d4089ad9bb2c144d. 374 Lexi Lonas, "China Criticizes NBC for Not Showing Taiwan, South China Sea in Olympic Map," The Hill, July 24, 2021, https://thehill.com/homenews/media/564673-china-criticizes-nbc-for-not-showingtaiwan-south-china-sea-in-countrys-map. 375 Stu Woo, "China Makes Sure Everyone Writes Taiwan's Name Just So-Even a Colorado High School," Wall Street Journal, September 10, 2021, https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-makes-sureeveryone-writes-taiwans-name-just-soeven-a-colorado-high-school-11631304386. 376 Benjamin Haas, "China Bans Winnie the Pooh Film After Comparisons to President Xi," The Guardian, last modified August 7, 2018, https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/aug/07/china-banswinnie-the-pooh-film-to-stop-comparisons-to-president-xi. 377 Johnston, "Is Chinese Nationalism Rising? Evidence from Beijing," 37.
The three principal sources of Chinese grand strategy-historic opportunity, assessment of the enemy, and regime security-are the primary feedback loops for Chinese strategic and foreign policy thinking (see the causal loop diagram (CLD) in Figure 
9
There are multiple factors which form balancing loops with each of the three sources and can affect each of them either positively or negatively. Only one potential factor is depicted in the CLD for each source. For example, if "Taiwan Resilience/Resistance" (depicted in green) increases, it will reduce each of the three grand strategic sources, which will have a cascading negative reinforcing effect within the grand strategy feedback loops. As they reduce, they will reduce Taiwan's need for resilience and resistance capacity, so the feedback loops are balancing (B). A balancing loop represents goal seeking behavior.
When the system is dominated by one or more of the balancing loops, China will seek to correct the imbalance.
The utility of using a CLD to depict Chinese grand strategy is its flexibility to 
In its most basic form, there are three different conceptual approaches to competition with a strategic rival: (1) compete to win, ( 
2
A nation's grand strategy does not exist in a vacuum. There is always an element of strategic interaction, "which requires predicting, evading, blocking, and otherwise adjusting to the countermoves of principal adversaries."3 7 8 F 379 "Every strategy has an ideal counterstrategy," according to Arreguin-Toft, and his theory of strategic interaction provides a theoretical approach to the concept of grand strategy sabotage. If strong and weak powers employ same-approach strategies against each other, the outcome should favor the stronger power. But if the strategies are mismatched-i.e., direct versus indirect-the outcome will favor the weaker power.
If the contest of U.S. and CCP grand strategies is framed in terms of direct versus indirect, then the CCP is the weak-actor employing an indirect approach, and the United States is the strong-actor currently employing a direct approach. If the United States persists with a direct counterstrategy, however, the CCP will likely prevail. States should prevail. Authoritarian single-party states like China tend to have more articulated and identifiable grand strategies, therefore they are easier to target and sabotage.
Democratic governments like the United States tend to struggle in crafting and articulating a unified grand strategy, therefore the focus on counterstrategy. However, democratic nations have a formidable propensity to unify against a common threat and coalesce a unified grand strategy when the threat is clear and the situation is dire. A counterstrategy of sabotage could transition into a larger, unified strategy if this becomes the national situation, or it could prevent this situation from coming to fruition.
If one were to conduct a center of gravity (COG) analysis of the CCP's grand strategy, Taiwan would be its most critical vulnerability. A COG is any "source of power that provides moral or physical strength, freedom of action, or will to act." development, but also the underpinnings of its strategic psyche, like strategic patience and deception. Among the CVs that could disrupt the innerworkings of this framework are the protests in Hong Kong, economic sanctions, but most importantly, the "question" of Taiwan. By coupling Taiwan so closely with its grand strategic plan, it is the CCP's greatest vulnerability to continued legitimacy. During multiple interviews with Taiwanese officials for their 2018 report A Question of Time: Enhancing Taiwan's Conventional Deterrence Posture,

Many like to highlight and laud Beijing's long-term, steady strategic advancement and contrast it with Washington's oscillating and divided political system, but as Beijing approaches its self-appointed deadlines in the near future, it will be forced to speed-up its plan. If it does not, it will have to find some way to move the goalpost to a new milestone (a new 100 year plan?). The protracted unconventional deterrence strategy would force China to choose between rigid adherence to its 100 year plan, concession to forging a new plan, or diplomatic negotiations for a peaceful settlement. In this scenario, deterrence for long enough could lead to compellence at that point. All that is needed is to outlast China's own appointed timeline. The main question is whether the CCP would change its grand
The "ways" to operationalize an unconventional deterrence strategy are theoretically endless. Given enough resources and a long enough time horizon to plan, any option could be feasible. However, given the constraints of the operational environment (including policy restraints) and the compressed time horizon-i.e., the six-year "Davidson
Window"-this chapter focuses on existing frameworks and constructs that are low resource-intensive and available for immediate implementation. Each proposed "way" meets the SMART criteria (specificity, measurability, achievability, relevance and resultsoriented, and time-bound).3 8 2 F 383 This chapter presents the primary strategic and corresponding operational "ways" which represent the initial contours of a "campaign plan" or "series of operations aimed at achieving strategic and operational objectives within a given time and space."3 8 3 F 384
The overarching "way" for the United States and Taiwan to execute an unconventional deterrence strategy is to engage in proactive and enduring irregular warfare (IW). The basis for this proposition comes from the Irregular Warfare Annex of the 2018 NDS, wherein the DOD describes the purpose of IW:
To expand the competitive space, shape the environment, and prepare for escalation to conflict, if required. To control the tempo of adversarial competition… manage escalation dynamics and dictate the character, scope, intensity, and terms of this competition to our adversaries. We will apply IW to shape our adversaries' behavior to our advantage, increase the cost of hostile action against the United States and its allies, and pursue innovative ways to disrupt, counter, and preempt coercion and subversion. This definition more accurately describes the concepts of operational advisory support to Taiwan, the building of resilience and resistance, and the interweaving of strategic communication and deception described in this chapter.
The "asymmetric operations working group" was an initiative led by the U.S.
Army's Asymmetric Warfare Group (AWG) in partnership with the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab (JHU/APL). The periodic AOWGs were strategic-level joint, interagency, intergovernmental, and multinational (JIIM) forums with public/private collaboration in which participants shared asymmetric operations perspectives to better understand and mitigate U.S. and allies' vulnerabilities. The Taiwan AOWG serves as a good model for future advisory support for comprehensive or asymmetric defense.
In 2006, the Department of the Army (DA) created AWG as a special mission unit (SMU) under the G-3/5/7 in order to mitigate current and emerging asymmetric threats worldwide. The SMU comprised of approximately 350 specially-selected and trained senior officers and noncommissioned officers (NCO) as well as DA civilians and contracted consultants-typically retired service-members with specialized expertise.
AWG's charter mission was to 
(1)
The life cycle of the study-entitled Cross-Strait Asymmetric Warfare-began with a research intensive primer in July 2015, "Phase One: Understanding the Threat." The AOWG conducted site visits and designed a small tabletop exercise (TTX), called the threat assessment exercise (ThreatEx). The ThreatEx led to "Phase Two: Assessing the Threat," designed to understand and enable a response continuum. Again, leveraging expertise from across the JIIM, the AOWG produced the "Phase Two: Assessing the Threat" publication in order to facilitate a final exercise called the competitive influence exercise (CIEx). The publications and the CIEx facilitated dialogue for how U.S. and Taiwan units could cooperate beyond the realm of tactical-level exercises such as joint combined exchange trainings (JCET).
The aim is to engender in the TA a gray zone-like, unconventional warfare (UW) approach to operations. Although the TA still must plan for the fullscale invasion scenario, what actions might it take in the shaping phase to make an invasion less likely? In other words, how might Taiwan "win" without fighting?3 9 0 F 391
Following the success of the AOWG, AWG continued its persistent advisory    understanding of Chinese hybrid warfare tactics, and helped shape conditions to prevent Chinese force projection by denying confidence in operational success. Appendix B of this study lists the final AWS outcomes in six categories: overview, training, mission command, weapon systems, asymmetric defense, and ideas for adapting the force.
The AWS was not the first occasion to identify these types of conclusions, but it was one of the first official and comprehensive assessments of the problem set. Similar collaborative efforts and organizations like AWG and the AOWG could further help Taiwan-as well as other U.S. partner nations-to institutionalize needed defense transformation and innovation. While the AWS concluded in 2018, its legacy lived-on as USARPAC and the TA broadly integrated the outcomes into official "Lu Wei" objectives, with "Asymmetric Measures and Force Preservation" becoming Line of Effort (LOE) One.3 9 5 F 396 Indeed, the term "asymmetric" has now become a cornerstone for Taiwanese strategic thought, with its formal incorporation into its 2017 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) and culmination in President Tsai Ing-wen's reelection inaugural address on May 20, 2020: "While we work to bolster our defense capabilities, future combat capacity development will also emphasize mobility, countermeasures, and non-traditional asymmetrical capabilities."3 9 6 F 397 Unfortunately, there are recent indicators that Taiwan may be reversing this trend towards asymmetric defense reform. In Taiwan's recent 2021 QDR and its National Defense Review, the term "asymmetric" now seems to be a mere buzzword that encompasses more and more symmetric capabilities and concepts. Assistant professor at George Mason University's Schar School of Policy and Government Michael Hunzeker postulates that Taiwan is gradually abandoning an asymmetric strategy while still seeking to appease U.S. petitions for Taiwan to further adopt such an approach: "rather than acquiesce to these painful and costly demands, the [MND] has instead coopted and repurposed asymmetry's lexicon so as to rationalize their decidedly symmetric plans.3 9 7 F 398 Foreign Policy journalist Tanner Greer contends that while Taiwan's strategy may not seem viable or feasible, it does make political sense as Taiwan's leaders must signal a credible defense to its populace. 
The central idea of the ROC is the integral relationship of resilience as the foundation for successful resistance. Resilience and resistance form a positive reinforcing feedback loop for unconventional deterrence. As resilience increases, the capacity to organize for resistance increases. As the capacity for resistance increases, the will and resiliency to withstand increases. The ROC's definitions for each are:
Resilience: the will and ability to withstand external pressure and influences and/or recover from the effects of those pressures or influences.
Resistance: a nation's organized, whole-of-society effort, encompassing the full range of activities from nonviolent to violent, led by a legally established government (potentially exiled/displaced or shadow) to reestablish independence and autonomy within its sovereign territory that has been wholly or partially occupied by a foreign power.4 0 1 F 402 P The purpose of the ROC is to provide a planning guide for nations to "increase national resilience against incursion by planning for, establishing, and developing organized national resistance capabilities."4 0 2 F 403 Figure

Resistance Operating Concept,

For nations like Taiwan that face an aggressive or revisionist adversary with expansive intent, it is imperative to develop the prerequisite legal frameworks, policies, and systems prior to their necessity if crisis erupts. It must also involve not only the military, but also government and civil organizations at the national and local levels.
Government agencies, private and commercial entities, voluntary organizations, and individual citizens must be included and committed to the national effort and must see the resistance capability as "a legitimate form of warfare, grounded in law, which is acceptable and suitable."4 0 5 F 406 This combines the concepts of "military defense" and "civil defense."
Military defense entails the ability of professional regular or irregular armed forces to defend the nation against attack or regain national sovereignty. Civil defense entails the ability to protect the civilian population and public services, to mitigate the effects to these during conflict, and to support the functions of the armed forces during conflict.4 0 6 F 407
Together, the concept of civil-military defense fusion comprises the concept of "total defense" or "comprehensive defense." Total defense is a concept which grew out of WWII and Cold War efforts to elevate the role of the population in deterrence and national defense in addition to and in concert with traditional military defense measures. One of the early adopters and best examples of total defense, Estonia, defined total defense in 2012 as "the permanent, readiness of states' civilian structures, local governments, the [defense forces],
and the mental, physical, economic, and other potential of the whole nation to resolve crisis and coordinated and united action to prevent and deter a threat of an attack for nations'

In the ROC, resilience is the foundation for resistance. In many contexts of defense and deterrence, the concept of resilience often signifies resilience against cyber or nuclear threats-the ability of key infrastructure and systems to survive and recover quickly. But the ROC speaks more to the human and cognitive dimension of resilience, to include social and psychological resilience.4 0 8 F 409 This involves a concerted, whole-of-society effort to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities and threats well in advance.
For example, one of the greatest threats to social and psychological resilience as a foundation for resistance is the continuity of governance. During AWG's interactions with Taiwan's MPC in Taipei, the MPC described how the PLA's strategy during the initial phase of an attack against Taiwan would be to destroy or neutralize 50% of Taiwan's warfighting functions, which include their "leadership" and "will to fight. personnel remarked in a 2019 Special Warfare magazine article on this topic, "Hope is a primary driver of resistance movements, and the best way to keep hope alive in a resistance movement is to keep people alive."4 1 0 F 411 Additionally, in her NPS thesis on resistance medical networks, USAF Lt Col (Dr.) Regan Lyon asserts that the level of medical care that a resistance medical network can achieve depends on the baseline medical skills and capabilities that exist prior to conflict. For example, a shortage of trained surgeons requires approximately 5-15 years to fill. Also, the level of training and medical standards in some countries may be very limited or constrained. For example, some PN militaries do not allow their medics to administer IVs, even in training, without losing credentials, which means the first time medical personnel conduct life-saving trauma care may be in the midst of a resistance campaign. Even if the medical network possesses the requisite skills and abilities, there may be tangible challenges (blood, medical supplies, evacuation assets, technological capabilities, etc.) as well as non-tangible challenges (freedom of movement, risk of compromise, interoperability with foreign medical personnel, etc.) that the PN and U.S. advisors must account for and mitigate well in advance of conflict.4 1 1 F 412
Implementation of the ROC within a comprehensive defense approach is not contingent or dependent on outside support, although foreign security cooperation and SFA activities will greatly enhance it. Prior to conflict, U.S. support to resilience and resistance planning will take the form of security cooperation, DOD-administered security assistance and FMS, and SFA. Specifically, prior to conflict, advisors would conduct foreign internal defense (FID) and defense institution building (DIB) to enhance and support the PN's internal defense and development (IDAD). After conflict, the United States could transition to UW activities to support and enable the PN's underground, auxiliary, and guerrilla forces in the occupied territory.4 1 2 F 413 This is also why it is crucial for the PN to develop the legal criteria and policies for integrating resistance into its national defense strategy. It allows foreign partners such as the United States to support the PN legally and readily prior to and during conflict. As a 2015 CRS report on BPC stated, "A common denominator in most of the successful cases [of BPC] is that the recipient of assistance was a legitimate, relatively effective institution of governance."4 1 3 F 414
The added benefit of an operational approach of building resilience is that it is less likely to draw the aggressor's attention in the same way that a carrier strike group conducting FONOPS through the Taiwan Strait or a contingent of U.S. Marines on the island training amphibious operations would. In fact, resilience is difficult to even identify or measure, let alone target. That is not to say that the enemy cannot pursue a strategy of sowing chaos and disrupting civil society, but resilience is the counter-strategy to inoculate the populace against this strategy. For example, Beijing's public opinion or media warfare against the Taiwanese has been detrimental and has influenced elections and pressured the populace to oppose independence and accept reunification. But at the same time, Taiwan's repeated exposure to China's tactics and recognition of its own susceptibilities to division has the potential to build public resilience and inoculate against foreign attacks. Beijing's disinformation tactics in the "gray zone" could have the opposite intended effect and serve to reinforce public opinion and media antibodies within the body politic.
One of the chief principles of resistance states that, "resistance is fundamentally a political activity."4 1 4 F 415 And in comprehensive defense, the population is the primary actor in this political activity.4 1 5 F 416 As an aggressor moves further along the conflict continuum depicted in Figure

In December 2020, NATO Special Operations Headquarters (NSHQ) published the two volume CDH to provide a planning guide for nations to develop and implement comprehensive defense: "an official Government strategy, which encompasses a whole-ofsociety approach to protecting the nation against potential threats." The CDH divides the sectors of society into governmental and non-governmental actors. The government category or "public sector" consists of the military and civil government, while the non-governmental category consists of the "private sector"
(comprised of business and key infrastructure such as hospitals etc.) and the "civic sector"
(comprised of citizens and local organizations). Volume one of the CDH is intended for the public sector or the "2% of the nation's prevention and response capability" while volume two is directed to the private and civic sectors-the remaining 98%.4 2 2 F 423
The CDH expands upon the ROC and establishes a useful framework of five conditions for nations and foreign supporters to build comprehensive defense: national support, education, coordination architecture, human infrastructure, and legal frameworks.

These conditions are built on the six pillars of comprehensive defense: social & psychological defense, economic & essential services, military, cyber, civil, and internal & border security (see Figure

The ADC, in contrast, is a term used by the CDH to describe the nation's official resistance organization.4 2 6 F 427 It is the component of a comprehensive defense strategy which most embodies the concepts put forward in the ROC. However, the CDH makes the distinction between the ADC and a guerilla or insurgent force. Because the ADC is a standing component of a government-led, whole-of-society resistance capability, it differs from guerilla, insurgent, or terrorist organizations which may form in extremis apart from or in opposition to legitimate authority structures.4 2 7 F 428 The nation must establish, equip, and train the ADC prior to conflict for it have a deterrent effect on the aggressor and it will consist almost entirely of civilians and volunteers from the populace. However, because the ADC will ultimately comprise of a blended combination of regular and irregular armed forces into the ADC as the conflict worsens and the nation's capacity for traditional defense erodes, the exact makeup and organization of the ADC will vary by nation. The CDH calls this the "adapted force."4 2 8 F 429
It is also important to clarify the difference between the ADC and reserve forces.
The purpose of the ADC is not to supplement regular forces or serve as a secondary or paramilitary force. The ADC should not integrate into regular formations or battle plans.
For example, a Taiwanese ADC should not mobilize to defend the beaches. Rather, as PLA forces begin crossing the Strait, the ADC should immediately begin conducting decentralized operations throughout the population centers to transform the urban environment into a mobility nightmare for the PLA. Furthermore, while the Home Guard 426 NATO Special Operations Headquarters, 1:37.

may provide support to the ADC, it is distinct to the populace's participation in the ADC, otherwise known as the "auxiliary." Members of the auxiliary may also be part of the Home Guard, but their support functions are distinct.
A BPC strategy for unconventional deterrence in Taiwan should focus on enhancing each of the four layers of CDH's integrated layered defense structure: resilience, armed forces, Home Guard, and the ADC. The primary focus of security cooperation and related activities such as SFA, DIB, and FID should be to organize, equip, and train a professional ADC and corresponding auxiliary network in order to enhance Taiwan's resistance capacity and signal to China.
The ROC and CDH offers a compelling case for adoption or adaptation by Taiwan to deter and if necessary, resist an invasion by the PLA and subsequent annexation by China. The need and timing for Taiwan to adopt a whole-of-society approach as proposed by the ROC and CDH and the has never been more clear or advantageous than it is today.
Adoption of the ROC and CDH by Taiwan in whole or in part would effectively resolve its current strategy shortfalls and imbalances as articulated in Richard Betts's ten critiques of strategy. The ROC and CDH would also provide a clear role for outside supportspecifically from the United States.4 2 9 F 430 Moreover, there is a synergistic relationship between a nation's resilient legitimacy and perseverance and the influence this plays on outside, intervening support. The greater the resilience and potential of a nation to resist and deter a belligerent, the greater the likelihood that outside powers will join-in and support that nation for the advantages it would afford them over the belligerent. In other words, there is greater potential for extended coercion and deterrence. While this remains only a theory, recent events such as Taiwan's remarkably effective response to the COVID-19 pandemic and the World Health Organization's (WHO) complicity with China to exclude Taiwan from its assembly 430 For more information on how the ROC and CDH could apply for Taiwan, reference the 2021 NPS master's thesis "Weathering the Storm: A European Model for Taiwan," by Chris Pinkerton and Jay Gambill.
meetings have engendered positive reactions to Taiwan's plight worldwide.4 3 0 F 431 P P The recent PLAAF incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ have also sparked international debate and fellow small states like Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia have showed resolve to increase relations with Taiwan while absorbing costs from China.
Given this geopolitical dilemma, the ROC for Taiwan seems like a foregone conclusion. Many assume that Taiwan already has a well-developed civil defense and resistance plan, complete with a robust island defense network like that found on the Korean Peninsula, but this is not the case. The truth is that until relatively recently since 1949, Taiwan's objective has been to return to the mainland and reclaim political sovereignty-in other words, to conclude the Chinese Civil War. A case in point is that Taiwan's MND designed all of its urban training centers on the island to replicate mainland rather than Taiwanese architecture and building construction.4 3 1 F 432 In its estimation, the purpose of urban training has always been to fight in the streets of Beijing or Shanghai, not Taipei or Kaohsiung. And despite Taiwan's significant steps of late to adopt an everincreasing asymmetric approach to fend off mainland aggression, it is still exhibiting considerable growing pains in this transformation and has come up short in adopting a truly whole-of-society defense concept that will be necessary to deter or defeat a Chinese fait accompli. However, the recently proposed 2021 Arm Taiwan Act intends to redirect and refocus U.S.-Taiwan defense relations on the condition of asymmetric defense capabilities:
To defend itself effectively, especially in the initial period of war, it is imperative that Taiwan accelerate deployment of cost-effective and resilient asymmetric defense capabilities, including mobile coastal and air defenses, naval mines, missile boats, man-portable anti-armor weapons, civil defense forces, and their enablers.4 3 2 F 433 enemy at the beach.4 3 3 F 434 Debate persists as to the suitability, feasibility, and acceptability of this unilateral approach given China's growing overmatch and Taiwan's lack of treaty defense allies. Instead of changing the ODC to match its available "means" and "ways," Taiwan continues to rely too heavily on military and platform-centric solutions to accomplish this high-stakes objective, seeking high-end FMS cases with the United States such as F-16 fighter jets, M1A2T Abrams tanks, and MQ-9B Reaper Drones.
Moreover, there are recent indicators that Taiwan may be abandoning the shortlived ODC and reversing its trend towards asymmetric defense reform. The term "ODC" does not appear in Taiwan's new 2021 QDR or National Defense Review and there are rumors that it has been discouraged or even banned from use within the MND.4 3 4 F 435 It appears instead that Taiwan's new military strategy is "Resolute Defense and Multi-domain Deterrence" with new guiding principles to "resist the enemy on the opposite shore, attack it at sea, destroy it in the littoral area, and annihilate it on the beachhead."4 3 5 F 436 While there is ample mention of asymmetric capabilities, resilience, and "All-out Defense," there is no mention of resistance or operations beyond PLA forces landing on the island. The entire strategy is predicated on defeating the PLA in a largely conventional fight in the strait.
Taiwan also asserts its capability to mobilize approximately 2.5 million reserve forces with an additional 1 million additional civil defense volunteers-approximately 15 percent of Taiwan's 23.8 million population-as part of the "All-out Defense Mobilization" plan.4 3 6 F 437 If the PLA were to mobilize an invasion force of approximately 1.5 to 2 million troops, it would land on the island to face a total Taiwanese defense force of nearly 4 million soldiers, reservists, and civilian volunteers. From a purely force number 434 Lee Hsi-min and Eric Lee, "Taiwan's Overall Defense Concept, Explained," The Diplomat, November 3, 2020, https://thediplomat.com/2020/11/taiwans-overall-defense-concept-explained/.

436 Ministry of National Defense, 2021 Quadrennial Defense Review (Taipei: Ministry of National Defense, 2021), 19, https://www.ustaiwandefense.com/tdnswp/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/2021-Taiwan-Quadrennial-Defense-Review-QDR.pdf. ratio, the odds seem to be in Taiwan's favor, but Taiwan's reserve force and mobilization plan are drastically lacking in resources, training, resolve, and credibility, and they still do not adequately address the concept of an integrated civil resistance plan. U.S. advisors to Taiwan have frequently recommended to the MND that it examine the reserve systems of other relevant nations facing threats of large-scale invasions, most notably Israel, South Korea, Finland, and the Baltic States. But it was not until early 2020 that re-elected President Tsai Ing-wen formally announced the initiation of reserve force reforms, with a five-year blueprint beginning with an exchange with the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) planned for 2021.4 3 7 F 438 The timing has never been better for Taiwan to overhaul its reserve system and incorporate the ROC and CDH into its ODC and All-out Defense Mobilization plans in order to adequately develop civil resilience and resistance concepts sufficient to alter China's invasion calculus.
In April 2021, the MND announced it will integrate the All-out Defense Mobilization Office and the Armed Forces Reserve Command into a "Defense Reserve Mobilization Agency" by January 2022. The new organization will coordinate with the Ministry of Interior to "expand the scope of civilian forces and volunteers" and form "the legal basis for the defense ministry to mobilize civilian forces.4 3 8 F 439 The new policy will also extend reservist training from five days to two weeks per year. This change may be the needed step for Taiwan to begin transformation efforts towards implementing a resistance operating concept. The ROC recommends that a nation establish a lead agency or office of primary responsibility for resistance planning. For Taiwan, the Defense Reserve Mobilization Agency may fulfill that function when it becomes fully functional by 2024.4 3 9 F 440
The ROC seems like a natural and timely strategy for Taiwan, but is it a strategy of wishful illusion? Some of the most difficult obstacles for Taiwan to adopt the ROC and CDH are the civil-military and generational divides that exist among the populace. In private settings, many Taiwanese officials-particularly from the younger generationadmit that the current ODC is impractical and needs to change, but the sensitive socialpolitical situation forbids it. Simply put, the current administration cannot endorse a defense concept that does not center on defeat of the enemy at sea or shore because it would appear like a public acknowledgement of its inability to defend the populace. A defense concept with a high likelihood of close-quarters, street-to-street urban fighting by military and civilians alike would likely be a campaign non-starter and tantamount to political suicide in a time when party support from the populace is all-important. Therefore, there is tremendous political pressure to defend the island at the beachhead, even if this concept does not originate from sound military strategy. Richard Betts describes this as the problem of psychoanalysis versus conscious choice, wherein unconscious motives and biases prevent the logical integration of "means" to "ends."4 4 0 F 441 P There is also an undercurrent of organizational reticence and policy resistanceparticularly among the older generation-to fully adopt the idea of an asymmetric defensive strategy or resistance concept. This is simply because the concepts do not align with their self-ascribed notion as a superior, world-class, and technologically sophisticated fighting force-an image which Taiwan has enjoyed for most of its 71-year existence.
Moreover, for many Taiwanese, to adopt an asymmetric, protracted strategy of civil resistance is to adopt the very strategy of their former enemy, Mao Zedong. Civil resistance is the antithesis of the hard-fought, counter-revolutionary civil war waged by many a Taiwanese grandparent-some who are still alive to remember the Communists' brutality.
For this reason, many Taiwanese view the form of warfare proposed by the ROC and by outside advisors as a conceptual and institutional bridge-too-far. This is Betts's problem of goal displacement versus policy control, which describes how organizational process and bureaucratic parochialism often default to habits of operation and institutional interests.
Policymakers and strategic planners divert means and resources toward internal goals rather than subordinate them to necessary, higher policy ends.4 4 1 F 442 P
These internal challenges are formidable obstacles to adopting the ROC and CDH in Taiwan, but framing the problem within Art Lykke's strategy stool model further reveals the pressing need for Taiwan to adapt its current strategy. Currently, the "ends, ways, and means" of Taiwan's strategy stool are drastically imbalanced. As Betts remarks, "strategy fails when the chosen means prove insufficient to the ends. This can happen because the wrong means are chosen or because the ends are too ambitious or slippery."4 4 2 F 443 P P This is the case with Taiwan. On one end, Taiwan's policy and military objectives are unrealistically high: the unilateral defeat of a two million-strong PLA invasion force and the preservation of territorial sovereignty. Next to this towering leg and its high-stakes, Taiwan's "ways" or concepts are rapidly eroding. Taiwan's diplomatic, informational, and economic clout with China and the international community are increasingly diminishing, leaving the military's deterrence-factor to bear the burden of Taipei's skeletonized instruments of national power (DIME). Lastly, the available "means" associated with those instruments are equally diminishing, with the administration and populace relying more and more on the military to single-handedly deter and defeat a Chinese fait accompli. Bridging the gap between "ways" and "means," the MND announced in 2019 that it will transition its brigades into combined arms formations in order to defeat the enemy at the beach. But western defense experts and commentators have long criticized Taiwan's penchant for high-profile, expensive weapons, rather than multiple redundant and survivable systemsgiven the PLA's apparent and growing overmatch. Again, many cite Taiwan's large reserve force as its ace-in-the-hole and defensive COG. But as noted above, without significant reform and integration of civil resistance concepts, it places too much dependence on only

Adoption or integration of the ROC and CDH into Taiwan's ODC or a new military strategy as outlined in its 2021 QDR would reduce much of the inherent risk by balancing the three legs of the strategy stool in the following ways. First, by adopting the ROC as an alternative or additional concept to the ODC, it would elevate the "ways" leg to a level in which it can adequately link "means" to "ends," while simultaneously reducing the scale of the political-military "ends" themselves. As Betts remarks, "strategy can be salvaged more often if peacetime planning gives as much consideration to limiting the range of ends as to expanding the menu of means."4 4 3 F 444 In other words, the ODC is insufficient by itself to accomplish the monumental objective of defeating a Chinese fait-accompli, let alone deterring it. But the addition of the ROC and CDH alters China's cost-benefit analysis by introducing the concept of civil resilience and resistance as a "layered national defense indepth."4 4 4 F 445 Defeat of Taiwan's armed forces? That is a relatively simple, albeit costly, endeavor for China. The defeat and subjugation of an island-wide resistance campaign? That does not fit into China's idea of a fait accompli or ultimate goal of reunifying the Taiwanese into a single Chinese ethnic solidarity.
Secondly, the ROC and CDH would open the aperture of Taiwan's available means and resources in a multitude of ways. A reserve force comprising 15 percent of the population is certainly impressive, but a civil resistance corps or ADC comprising the majority of Taiwan's 23.8 million populace is a much more formidable deterrent and is more equal to the task of deterring or resisting a Chinese invasion. As the authors of the ROC stress throughout, "the population is the primary actor."4 4 5 F 446 P P The ROC and CDH would also free-up pre-existing means and resources to pursue defensive options in alternative ways than before. For example, Taiwan SOF Special Service Companies (SSC) could move away from direct action, commando-type operations and focus instead on a more

The ROC and CDH are also ideally suited for the dense urban and mountainous terrain of Taiwan. Andrew Mack describes the role of cities in guerilla warfare as, "the 'people sea' forms a sanctuary of popular support for the 'guerrilla fish'; in urban guerilla warfare the anonymity of the city provides protection."4 4 6 F 447 The city is not neutral, as a 2020

forces will have to conduct counterinsurgency operations in some of the harshest conditions imaginable: jungles, mountains, and megacities."4 5 0 F 451 Due to Taiwan's extensive urban environment which is concentrated in the littoral zone of the West side of the island, AWG urged TA and MPC leaders to take advantage of their intimate knowledge of the terrain and ability to rehearse defense plans. Two of the most challenging issues in urban warfare are the ability to understand the urban environment and understand how to operate in that environment.4 5 1 F 452 Taiwan has the benefit of overcoming both these challenges before conflict even begins. Furthermore, the vast majority of Taiwan's regular and reserve forces would be operating in their local cities. By utilizing frequent "terrain walks" and "tactical exercises without troops" (TEWT), units could conduct detailed rehearsals and engagement area development to identify likely enemy avenues of approach, pre-plan weapon system emplacements and indirect fire targets, and plan obstacle emplacement.
In his 2005 article "Why the Strong Lose," Dr. Jeffrey Record asserted that a "weaker side's possession of superior will and strategy is hardly a guarantee of success.
Substantial external assistance may be required to convert superior will and strategy into victory."4 5 2 F 453 Richard Betts echoes this when he notes that "half of all strategies-the losers'-must fail by definition."4 5 3 F 454 This implies that even though a strategy which incorporates the ROC and CDH in Taiwan may be fully rational and the most effective use of available "means" to achieve policy and strategic "ends," historical hindsight is replete with examples of how randomness and non-linearity are often better predictors of success-absent significant outside support. Therefore, the injection of outside support is necessary to shore up the deterrent value of the ROC and CDH in Taiwan. 
Bilaterally, the United States should follow its recent FMS cases with Taiwan with an equally robust direct and overt approach to security cooperation and SFA, focused on a persistent engagement strategy in which Taiwan could credibly compete with and deter its much larger adversary. The goal for the United States would be to codify the ROC and CDH in Taiwan's national defense strategy. If Taiwan officially incorporates elements from the ROC and CDH into its ODC, then it provides a legal approach to U.S. security cooperation and SFA with Taiwan. BPC programs and activities to increase Taiwan's capacities for resilience and resistance would merely be the provision of "defense services"
as authorized by TRA. The training between Taiwan and USMC Raiders-the first of its kind since 1979-is a superb example.4 5 4 F 455 Coordinated, persistent and episodic exchanges of professional SOF and SFA advisors would be "low-cost, small-footprint" solutions wellsuited to assist Taiwan with tasks related to making Taiwan a harder target for the PLA. Management Organization (SATMO) Technical Assistance Fielding Teams (TAFT).
Moreover, the SFAB could organize as a brigade combat team (BCT) with augmentation which would provide additional forces in theater for possible large-scale operations, or assist with the receiving and staging of coalition forces arriving on-island. 
Lastly, the United States could pursue clandestine options to support Taiwan in the form of operational preparation of the environment (OPE). This would entail a persistent forward presence to form the nucleus of an increased intelligence capability on-island, under the auspices of SOCPAC or the CIA. This small, permanent liaison elementaugmented officially or unofficially by SOF, SFAB, and other SFA elements on-islandwould be responsible for coordinating the human and physical infrastructure for direct U.S.
support of resistance operations in the event of an impending invasion. The team could facilitate rapid infiltration of follow-on forces and then direct subsequent paramilitary and unconventional warfare support to resistance forces as stay-behind forces.4 5 6 F 457 It could also prepare for Joint reception, staging, onward movement, and integration (JRSOI) to receive follow-on U.S. and coalition forces.
In conclusion, the adoption or adaptation of the ROC and CDH by Taiwan would be a timely and effective strategy tool to develop the much-needed resilience, resistance, and legitimacy that is necessary to deter Chinese aggression and garner sufficient outside support. Although the ROC and CDH seems like a natural choice for Taiwan, it must first surmount multiple internal challenges such as its mismatched ODC, reserve force reform, and various cultural and generational biases. Through the lens of Art Lykke's strategy stool, the ROC and CDH would effectually moderate Taiwan's inordinate "ends," diversify its "ways," and multiply its "means" and resources (both tangible and intangible). This would produce a force-multiplying effect not only domestically, but internationally as well, and would produce a balanced national security strategy. As the ROC's authors suggest, "Strategy is most important when it provides value added to resources, functions as a force multiplier, and offers a way to beat an adversary with equivalent resources."4 5 7 F 458 Lastly, the role of outside support to a Taiwanese ROC cannot be overstated. The United States has an array of pre-established and emerging strategy tools such as SOF and the Army's new SFABs to implement various, multifaceted operational approaches specifically designed along direct-overt and indirect-covert lines of operation. This synergistic relationship between a nation's resiliency and its role in influencing outside intervening support makes the ROC and CDH exceptionally appealing for Taiwan.
The 
The DOD's conception of deterrence in the Deterrence Operations JOC divides its deterrence into "direct" versus "enabling" means. Whereas security cooperation is listed as an "enabling" means to achieve decisive influence in deterrence, strategic communication is listed as a "direct" means.4 6 0 F 461 The doctrinal definition of strategic communication is: Even though the military instrument does exist, a threat to use it will not constitute effective use unless the threat is believed and feared. Thus we come to an almost complete mixture of two or three of the instruments of statecraft, because when it comes to belief and fear, we have entered the areas of intellect and emotion-the areas of the diplomatic and psychological instruments.4 6 2 F 463 a.
One of the greatest differences between a conventional versus unconventional deterrence strategy is the interrelation and complexity of their respective strategic communication plans. "Deterrence is an iterative relationship that requires regular communications between parties."4 6 3 F 464 With conventional deterrence, the deterrer acts unilaterally to message or signal its deterrence activities-whether direct or extended forms of deterrence. This is a direct communication model-the deterrer communicates directly to the aggressor. Even in the case of the DOD's incipient "integrated deterrence" concept, allies and partners are "interwoven" and "networked" into a strategy which "integrates them into our understanding of what deterrence means," as USD-P Kahl described. 
The distinction between direct and indirect communication models is important for an unconventional deterrence strategy because how a message is encoded and sent is often more important than the message itself. Wilbur Schramm, the pioneer and founder of communication theory, described the communication process as a cycle (see Figure 
15
The receiving destination then encodes and sends a return signal in the form of "feedback," which the source receives and decodes to determine the effectiveness of the original signal. This cyclical process is only possible within a "field of common experience" between the two sides. For example, the signal must be encoded in some form of language and meaning that both sides understand. Furthermore, each side must "interpret" incoming signals and feedback to correctly understand the intended meaning and distinguish it from the "noise"
or "interference" which may confuse or impede the clear transmission of meaning.4 6 6 F 467
A deterrer can send a direct signal to an aggressor by encoding it in such a way that it will be received with little interference or noise and by sending along a channel that is sure to reach the destination. For example, U.S. officials can release a press statement regarding China or Taiwan on a major news network that is sure to seen by China and requires little to no active interpretation. A direct communication model is beneficial because it is simple, unambiguous, and minimizes the misinterpretation of the message.
However, a direct approach is unlikely to hide the source and intent of the message and is limited to only those channels which the aggressor can monitor. In contrast, a deterrer can send an indirect signal to an aggressor by encoding it in such a way that it is not clear if the aggressor was the intended recipient or by sending it on a channel that is monitored by the aggressor, but not specifically for the aggressor. It can also be indirect by obfuscating where or from whom the signal originated. 468 Gordon Lubold, "U.S. Troops Have Been Deployed in Taiwan for at Least a Year," Wall Street Journal, October 7, 2021, https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-troops-have-been-deployed-in-taiwan-for-atleast-a-year-11633614043.
to their incursions into Taiwan's ADIZ. The benefit of this approach is that it provides an overt means to signal an aggressor without unnecessarily provoking escalation.
The simplicity of the direct model is partly the impetus for calls to shift from "strategic ambiguity" to "strategic clarity." To deter China, the logic goes, the United States must communicate its capabilities and resolve effectively if they are to be seen as credible in the eyes of Beijing, and it cannot do so without a position of "strategic clarity."
But some level of ambiguity is desirable in order to prevent the adversary from fully knowing a deterrer's capability or "red-line" and thus from developing countermeasures that avoid or negate them. "Strategic ambiguity" provides the ability to message China both directly and indirectly. In fact, the TRA provides the necessary legal language to do so. Nearly every news media publication and commentary on Taiwan today references its history and the general clause from the TRA for the United States to provide Taiwan with the ability "to maintain a sufficient self-defense capacity."4 6 8 F 469 But few are aware that Congress was very clear about one thing in the statute: the nature of China's reunification efforts. One of the stated purposes for the TRA is "to make clear that the United States decision to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China rests upon the expectation that the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means. [emphasis added]"4 6 9 F 470 While Congress was careful not to make a pledge to Taiwan, it was explicit about maintaining the capacity to "resist any resort to force or other forms of coercion that would jeopardize the security, or the social or economic system, of the people of Taiwan."4 7 0 F 471 This language gives Congress and the president extraordinary latitude and flexibility to come to Taiwan's aid for a wide-range of Chinese "force" or "forms of coercion."
The DOD and INDOPACOM specifically should develop a suite of flexible deterrent options (FDO) that align within this understanding of the TRA and which support an unconventional deterrence strategy for Taiwan. JP 5-0 Joint Planning provides multiple 469 Taiwan Relations Act.

There looks for and exploits any opportunity to expand relations with foreign entities. For example, in October 2021, the Taipei Zoo announced it will transport two pangolins to the Prague Zoo as part of a breeding loan project. Commentators were quick to label the "informal ambassadors" as "Pangolin Diplomacy"-akin to China's "Panda Diplomacy" beginning in the 1950s when the PRC donated giant pandas to nations in an effort to gain diplomatic recognition.4 7 5 F 476
It is also important to communicate one's resilience to the aggressor state in order to signal that any coercive aggression will not achieve its desired effect. "Hostile actors should also have an understanding of a deterring actor's resilience, with the aim of showing that hostility will be futile."4 7 6 F 477 But communication strategies should adjust according to the phase of operation, according to the ROC:
In the resilience phase, the government will communicate the national narrative within its borders and to allies, partners, the international community, and the potential adversary… During resistance, an exiled government must tailor messages to different internal populations: supporters of resistance, supporters of the adversary, and those who are neutral.4 7 7 F 478
Strategic communication of capabilities and intentions can be overt or covert, public or private. They can also be delivered through a myriad of possible channels and mediums which can have dual-audiences and dual-purposes as a functional as well as deterrent message. For example, it interesting that the ROC and CDH are unclassified documents. By publishing them and disseminating them overtly and publicly, it serves to inform and educate U.S. and partner audiences, but it also sends a message to aggressors like Russia and China that the nations which are the target of their aggression now have a means to build resilience and resistance capacities. Even contributions to the growing body of literature like this study send an indirect, yet overt signal to China.

Taiwan will be unsuccessful.
Public opinion messaging which aligns with a "deterrence by punishment" approach should emphasize the unlikelihood of success due to the tremendous costs and losses that would result from a protracted island resistance. One tactic could be to message the disastrous impact such a war would have due to China's one-child policy. Countless
Chinese family lines-some spanning back hundreds of years-would be irrevocably eliminated with the death of the last living male descendent fighting in the war.
In contrast, public opinion messaging which aligns with a "deterrence by denial" approach should emphasize the unlikelihood of political vice military success in a fight to annex Taiwan due to Taiwan's resilience capacity to absorbs costs and survive occupation.
One tactic could be to message how Taiwan's Home Guard and ADC capacities would render any Chinese military superiority over Taiwan irrelevant. Urban warfare in the streets of Taiwan would be the great equalizer.
Furthermore, the United States and Taiwan must utilize strategic messaging and targeted information operations in the form of public opinion warfare to ensure unconventional deterrence has the desired effect against CCP strategy and policy objectives. The declassified 2018 Indo-Pacific Strategic Framework (IPSF) outlines the need to "develop a robust public diplomacy capability, which can compete with China's information campaigns; puncture the narrative that Chinese regional domination is inevitable."4 7 9 F 480 For example, the United States and Taiwan should message to the Chinese populace in various ways how the CCP is increasingly unable to achieve its primary policy objectives and apply constant pressure on the CCP-along with diplomatic offramps-to change its policy and grand strategy. Doing so would also degrade and damage China's soft power proposition of a "peaceful coexistence" and "community of shared destiny."
Taiwan is already aware of the stakes and opportunities when it comes to public opinion resilience and public diplomacy to counter Chinese propaganda and false narratives. In October, President Tsai drew attention to the "contest of ideologies" in an essay for Foreign Affairs.  Taiwan's Premier also reminded the world of Taiwan's resolve during a press conference:
Today, there are powerful countries that want to swallow up Taiwan using force, and likewise we are also not afraid of being killed or imprisoned… We must guard this country and this land, and not be like certain people who always talk up the enemy's prestige and talk down our resolve… We also tell foreign forces who want to invade and grab Taiwandon't be deluded.4 8 2 F 483
Even President Tsai also took to social media, exhorting the Taiwanese to practice selfreliance: the "only option is to make ourselves stronger, more united and more resolute in our determination to protect ourselves… It's not an option for us to do nothing on our own and just to rely on other people's protection."4 8 3 F 484 Together, these are powerful statements of resolve, resilience, and the willingness to speak "truth to facts" in the face of pressure from China.
The United States could also employ the concept of seeking "truth from facts. The phrase is a traditional Chinese expression that became a central element of Maoism, then further promoted under Deng Ziaoping as a part of "socialism with Chinese characteristics." It embodied the principle of political and economic pragmatism and the flexibility to adopt models and markets that work. It led to a period of "pragmatic 482 Wen Lii (@wen1949), "If We're Going to Make Afghanistan Comparisons," Twitter, August 16, 2021, https://twitter.com/wen1949/status/1427277802148040706. 483 Ben Blanchard, "Taiwan Would Not Collapse Like Afghanistan, Premier Says," Reuters, last modified August 17, 2021, https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/taiwan-would-not-collapse-likeafghanistan-premier-says-2021-08-17/. 484 The Straits Times, "Taiwan Needs to Be 'Stronger.'" coexistence," rapprochement with the United States, and international recognition of sovereignty; in other words, policies that advanced its grand strategy. But of late, actions like repression in Hong Kong and Xinjiang has undercut the credibility and political philosophy of seeking "truth from facts" and seems to suggest that China may be renouncing its own "two systems" approach and idea of "peaceful coexistence." Given this evidence, there is an opportunity for Washington to amplify its strategic communication and public diplomacy approach by adopting the language of seeking "truth from facts" during dealings with China over Taiwan-effectually flipping the script on China. For example, China often employs "cheap propaganda" to sway public opinion regarding Taiwan, asking questions like "how Americans would feel if China were to have an Alaska or Hawaii Relations Act?" similar to the TRA. Caribbean partner with which it provides for that partner's defense against repeated attempts of annexation by an aggressive United States, to include incursions into their airspace or missile tests into surrounding waters. The reality is that Taiwan is no more an internal "domestic" issue for China than Cuba or the Bahamas is for the United States. It would be like the U.S. Union government saying to the French during the Civil War that it could not support the Confederacy because it would have been interfering in a "domestic" issue. The arguments and analogies that Chinese officials give to defend China's sovereignty over Taiwan simply do not hold water, and Washington should be quick to invalidate their claims and garner international backing. The real "truth from facts" is that emotion, not grand strategy or pragmatism, drives China's behavior with respect to Taiwan.
The United States must always refrain from responding with emotion, but instead use the very logic espoused by China: seeking "truth from facts." The United States could adeptly harken back to China's own historical successes and celebrated leaders like Mao and Deng as a means to expose and counter China's own false narratives. In this sense, the tools to refute China can be found in China itself.
The information environment pervades every operational domain, from the reaches of space to the depths of undersea cables. But it manifests most conspicuously in the human and cognitive domain. This implies that the dynamics of competition in the information environment reside chiefly in human interactions and psychology, and extend to the realm of politics and international relations. In global strategic competition between great powers, strategic deception in the information environment becomes paramount. Controlling the truth in a competitive information environment is less important than controlling the narrative and people's perceptions of the truth. The state that is more capable of deceiving the other for longer will gain a considerable position of relative advantage.
The most significant outcome from the system dynamics model designed for this study (summarized in Appendix A) was that U.S. and Taiwan capability development and BPC is not what drives China to develop countervailing capabilities. Rather it is China's perception of these capacities. Therefore, increasing strategic communication and deception to influence adversarial perceptions is likely to have more of a deterrent effect that accelerating capability development.
There are countless definitions and conceptions of deception, likely due to its operations take time and preparation to be effective, and often will not be available for use in wartime if they are not prepared and queued during peacetime. There are three broad steps to any deception. The first is to identify and condition a target's beliefs for deception.
This entails exploiting the target's cognitive biases for either "ambiguity-increasing" or "misleading" type deceptions.4 8 8 F 489 "Ambiguity-increasing" or "A-type" deception 486 Jon Latimer, Deception in War (Woodstock, New York: The Overlook Press, 2001), 62.

Deception is an exploitative act that takes advantage of a competitor's preconceptions… It relies on ambiguity as opposed to the bright lines between war and peace… Deception matters most, politically, in increasing the options available for competitive and aggressive interactions other than war or for providing adjunct support to military operations."4 9 0 F 491
Democratic and authoritarian states each have diametrically opposed advantages and disadvantages when it comes to strategic deception. In authoritarian regimes like China, deception is more routine and practiced within its societies than in democracies.
Centralized state control, particularly of the information environment, makes it very easy to manipulate access to information and to use deception for political gain. With the CCP's imperative to maintain domestic control and party security, the moral threshold for deception is also much lower. "The secrecy and total control available to dictatorships and authoritarian regimes, and the reduced inhibitions that accompany such exercise of power, facilitate and provide incentives for the exercise of craft, cunning, and deception." his or her intelligence system, which serves to mediate the truth for him or her-democratic deception stratagems can be highly effective in solidifying an authoritarian leader's certain, yet wrong, expectations.4 9 5 F 496 P P The result, if successful, is cognitive consonance; and after the deception is realized the result is psychological disequilibrium, which lends itself to "Atype" deceptions. "Deception adds to the ambitious attacker's already significant intelligence burden. Even if the defensive deception is not completely successful, paranoia about the mere possibility of deception can reduce an attacker's confidence and encourage some degree of restraint."4 9 6 F 497
The authoritarian nature of China's system makes it an ideal target for deception, particularly "M-type" deceptions. Xi Jinping is increasingly becoming more central in the decision-making apparatus of the CCP. The fact that the party abolished term limits and named him a "historic figure" on equal footing with Mao and Deng, and the fact that he has not designated a successor all serve as evidence that there will be less opposition and contradiction from the party which would overcome structural resilience to deception or potential cognitive biases.4 9 7 F 498 For example, one Chinese official revealed that sometimes Xi Jinping "is intentionally given exaggerated assessments."4 9 8 F 499 In his book about Chinese leadership from Deng to Xi, Following the leader, David Lampton highlights the stovepipe nature and "woefully inadequate cross-system integration" of China's military and foreign policy apparatus, wherein elements of nationalism also make it difficult to crosscommunicate effectively.4 9 9 F 500
The overall architecture of the policy-making system… creates a structural problem in decision making because other intelligence and foreign policy institutions report up through separate state and party channels. There
In his 2020 study on deterrence for the European Centre of Excellence for Countering Hybrid Threats, Vytautas Keršanskas outlines how to construct an appropriate "deterrence posture" by planning, employing, and communicating a wide range of deterrent measures or "means."5 0 3 F 504 This includes multilateral as well as national tools, punitive as well as denial measures, and the careful timing and "choreographing" of actions to ensure the greatest "cumulative effect."
A crucial part of developing a deterrence strategy is for a nation to map its own deterrent tools menu. Classifying them by sector or domain 
(political, military, diplomatic, culture etc.)
The tactical and institutional "means" to implement an unconventional deterrence strategy for Taiwan are the wide range of BPC programs, authorities, and activities derived primarily from security cooperation and security assistance. They also include a wide range of SOF, joint, interagency (IA), multinational, and academia organizations.
Figure

Within SC and overlapping with a large portion of SA and IW, DIB and SFA are often the primary "means" to accomplish various SC, SA, and support to IW activities.
DIB is primarily at the operational level while SFA is primarily at the tactical level.5 1 0 F 511 The ROC delineates these activities according to pre-and post-crisis: Within these U.S. DOD definitions, the U.S. engages in SC and SFA when supporting a partner nation's development of an organized resistance capability. If that partner nation loses full or partial sovereignty over its territory to a hostile actor, then the U.S. can engage in UW to assist the resistance forces. If that partner nation is under pre-or post-crisis threat from a foreign actor interfering in the partner nation domestically, then the U.S. engages in FID to help free and protect the partner from foreign subversion or insurgency."5 1 1 F 512 FID comprises primarily of various DIB and SFA activities, but also of some SC and SA as well as overlapping stability and combat operations. Like DIB and SFA, FID is fully encompassed within SC. Examples of FID are counterinsurgency (COIN), counter terrorism (CT), and counter drug or narcotics (CD/N). UW also comprises of various DIB, SFA, SC, SA, and SSA activities, as well as stability and combat operations. But some of its activities fall just outside the realm of foreign assistance and are conducted directly against an enemy. Within this overall framework, BPC activities comprise of various cross-sections (of various size and shape) of SC, SA, DIB, SFA, and support to IW missions, programs, activities, and authorities. Combined in various ways, the Joint Force, SOF, and IA partners can synchronize and communicate BPC to achieve "cumulative effects."
Foreign area officers (FAO) invariably form the core of any security cooperation or BPC initiative or program. FAOs are specially trained and strategically focused officers with language, cultural, sociological, and political expertise in a specific region or country.5 1 2 F 513 They typically serve as either defense attachés within the defense attaché office 513 Army FAOs are a functional area (FA 48). The Marine Corps have both a FAO track (994x designator) and regional affairs officer (RAO) track (982x designator). RAOs are similar to FAOs but without language skills. The Navy FAOs have a single track (1710 designator). The Air Force have two tracks: FAO (16F specialty code) and political-military affairs strategist (PAS) (16P). The Army National Guard have bilateral affairs officers (BAO) which manage the State Partnership Program (SPP). USSOCOM also established some special operations liaison officer (SOLO) and special operations forces liaison element (SOFLE) billets to represent SOF equities and BPC efforts within a MILGRP.
(DAO) or as security assistance officers within the security cooperation office (SCO) of the military group (MILGRP) of a U.S. embassy. The DAO is the diplomatic arm of the MILGRP and interacts with senior defense officials at the ministerial level. They also serve as the senior military advisors to the ambassador and U.S. Country Team (USCT). Security assistance officers manage the country's security assistance and security cooperation portfolio. FAOs also serve as country desk officers or strategic political-military planners on a GCC or SCC staff, sometimes known as the Strategic Planning and Policy (SPP) directorate or Security Cooperation and Policy (SCP) division.
Together, FAOs, desk officers, BAOs, and SOLO/SOFLEs serve as the frontline in BPC strategy and policy development and are the focal point for codifying five-year theater and country security cooperation plans. FAOs are often far-removed from current and emerging concepts and strategies. For example, during a security cooperation review meeting in 2019 between an unnamed SE Asia PN and the U.S. SCO in-country, the PN requested information on the U.S. Army's new multi-domain operations (MDO) concept due to China's A2/AD capabilities. The SCO was not well-versed in the concept and requested advisory assistance from AWG and TRADOC. However, AWG advisors drew attention to the fact that MDO would likely not be an applicable concept for the PN to adopt due to its geographic location within the range of China's A2/AD defensive layers.
The purpose of MDO is to penetrate, disintegrate, and exploit the multi-layered and multidomain "stand-off" produced by the A2/AD systems. In other words, MDO is an operating concept for forces outside the stand-off zone, rather than inside. Cases like this illustrate the need for FAOs to be well-versed in current doctrine and operating concepts in order to synthesize and propose appropriate and scalable long-term strategies in conjunction with the PN. Mirror-imaging is a heuristic dynamic that can play out on either side of the relationship, and PNs need concepts and solutions that are relevant and compatible with their operational environment and threat estimates.
The 2012 National Strategic Guidance states, "Whenever possible, we will develop innovative, low-cost, and small-footprint approaches to achieve our security objectives, 10 special operations activities, such as FID and operational preparation of the environment (OPE).
Within the model, FID and OPE in the supported role score the highest deterrence values. They score high because they have low risk with respect to escalation, they employ an indirect strategic interaction, and the presence of U.S. forces constitute a trip wire. These tasks also place forces within contested regions for longer durations, allowing them to act as an early warning detector.5  
While the optimal role for SF is to help build a PN's capacity for post-crisis resistance, the optimal role for CA forces is to help build a PN's governance and resilience capacity by identifying and mitigating civil vulnerabilities. The role of CA is "to engage transparency of government-led efforts, CA forces are the natural cornerstone for U.S. BPC efforts to build PN resilience and resistance from an early start. Due to their unique language, cultural, and engagement skills and attributes, CA forces are the "purpose built asset" and "commander's tool of choice" to help build a PN's capacity for resilience and resistance.5 2 7 F 528 CA forces such as civil military support elements (CMSE) and government function specialists conduct civil affairs operations (CAO) and support to civil administration (SCA) through their four core competencies: civil knowledge integration (CKI), civil network development and engagement (CDNE), transitional governance (TG), and civil-military integration (CMI).
The primary SOF CA mechanism is the CMSE, a task-organized CA element of varying size and scope sourced principally from the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade (CAB) (Special Operations)(Airborne) with the mission to "plan, facilitate, and execute Civil Affairs operations in support of civil-military engagement in a specified country, region, or theater."5 2 8 F 529 CMSEs and SOF CA forces from the 95th CAB (SO)(A) are not the only "means" available. CA reservists can and should play a significant role in the operational approach for Taiwan and other PNs. CA reservists are unique from SOF CA in that many of them are designated as functional specialists in government and civil administration.
Figure

The first CA core competency is civil knowledge integration (CKI). CA forces could conduct CKI through civil reconnaissance (CR) and civil engagement (CE) missions in order to identify PN civil vulnerabilities and resilience gaps. CKI is "the process whereby civil information is collected, analyzed, and evaluated; processed into civil knowledge; and integrated into the planning processes of the supported element" or higher headquarters.5 3 0 F 531 The ROC identifies the challenge for PN governments to conduct this process on their own: "Governments, responsible for fostering resilience, face a highly dynamic and complex contemporary operating environment. Self-organizing human networks engage in multifaceted, nonlinear behaviors."5 investing in social capital with key nodes within the network, CA forces can serve as "brokers" between disparate parts of the network and "cutpoints" to other networks-to include connecting individuals with various "reach back" capabilities from the U.S.
military or civil sector. CNDE facilitates the rapid understanding and dissemination of information and catalyzes the diffusion of messages, themes, and narratives which enhance resilience and civ-mil cooperation. The additional benefit of CA forces is their ability to operate in permissive as well as semi-permissive or denied environments. This facilitates unified action and the network outreach efforts of other interagency, intergovernmental, non-governmental, and PN organizations-some of which are often unable to access certain environments and therefore rely on CA.
Recently, the U.S. Army changed the military occupational specialty (MOS) designation for active duty CA officers from 38A to 38S: "Transitional Governance Expert."5 3 4 F 535 The subtle change allows SOF CA forces to better focus and specialize in transitional governance (TG) and support to civil administration (SCA) activities (e.g., from pre-crisis preparation to occupation or the transition from occupation back to full sovereignty). TG is "the actions taken to assure appropriate control and continuity of government functions throughout the range of military operations" while SCA is "assistance given by CA forces to stabilize or enhance the operations of the governing body of a foreign country, by assisting an established or interim government."5 3 5 F 536 During the resilience-building phase, CA governance experts (38S) and reservist government function specialists (38G) could support the establishment of a comprehensive defense plan by assisting the PN government in building the prerequisite legal frameworks, policies, and 535 According to FM 3-57, governance differs from government: "Governance is the state's ability to serve the citizens through the rules, processes, and behavior by which interests are articulated, resources are managed, and power is exercised in a society. Governance speaks to the administration of control by authorities exercising the role of the government. Government functions, however, refers to the structure that is used to conduct governance… Expertise in government functions, therefore, is an expertise in those systems. Expertise in governance, however, is an understanding of how those systems are related and utilized to provide for the needs of a population." Department of the Army, 2-4. 536 Department of the Army, 
1-5,2-4.
During the resistance phase, CA forces could provide TG and SCA to support a "shadow government" or "government in exile" and facilitate the continuity of governance.
In 2017, the 95th CAB (SO)(A) and JHU developed a working definition of governance as "population control practices employed by power holders to gain and maintain authority and/or influence over a target populace and its resources within the human environment."5 3 7 F 538 CA forces could also provide countergovernance support to degrade illegitimate governance structures and to support IW or UW operations with the PN. The 95th CAB (SO)(A) and JHU defined countergovernance as "activities in the human environment that intentionally undermine or compete with power holders' governance practices and their associated authority and influence."5 All these trends can be seen in Taiwan. According to the CIA Factbook for Taiwan, nearly 80 percent of the population live in cities and its "distribution exhibits a peripheral coastal settlement pattern, with the largest populations on the north and west coasts."5 3 9 F 540 With twelve cities that have populations over 100,000, nearly all of Taiwan lies in the littoral zone. Due to these trends, Kilcullen posits that CA forces may be the best-suited to be the joint command element:
In the future environment, given the need to keep footprints small, restart stalled urban systems, and deal with governance and capacity problem in a high-threat environment, Civil Affairs units may find themselves acting as the parent organization for task forces… an army Civil Affairs Brigade (Airborne) might find itself forming the core of a joint interagency task force.5 4 0 F 541 A CA element forward-deployed to Taiwan at the initiation of conflict may find itself laying the groundwork for a larger civil affairs task force (CATF), joint civil-military operations task force (JCMOTF), or even joint interagency task force (JIATF). For this reason, CMSE rotational deployments should consider partnering with Taiwan's Military Police Command (MPC), which is responsible for the defense and civil support of all urban areas. The MPC also facilitates the activation of reserve forces in urban centers. Because the MPC is a separate military service than the Taiwan Army, they do not typically have a U.S. counterpart but would be a valuable partner force for SOF, especially CA forces.
One of the interesting findings from the NPS wargame with 1SFG was that CA forces and their actions did not elicit strong counter-actions from the PRC players. The The fundamental value proposition of CA forces and CMSEs for building partner resilience and resistance is their overt and accessible nature, coupled with their wide-range of unique and scalable capabilities and skills with which to engage the civil component and bridge the gap between civil and military solutions.
While the optimal utilization of SF pre-crisis is to help build a PN's capacity for post-crisis resistance and the optimal utilization of CA forces is to identify civil vulnerabilities and help build a PN's governance and resilience capacity pre-crisis, psychological operations (PSYOP) forces play an equal role pre-and post-crisis. In conjunction with other authorities to work by, with, and through host nation partners, a valuable PSYOP mechanism is military information support operations (MISO). In many cases, regional and tactical PSYOP teams (RPT/TPT) establish country-specific military 
The greatest value of a MIST, however, is its capacity to identify and engage with "key communicators." Current PSYOP doctrine defines a key communicator as "an individual to whom the target audience turns most often for an analysis or interpretation of information and events" and is "deemed credible by members of a specific ability to conduct irregular warfare."5 4 9 F 550 In keeping with this vision, the Army Capability Manager for the SFAB (ACM-SFAB) noted in early 2020:
All or part of an SFAB can be employed across the conflict continuum to compete below the threshold of war. We believe that future SFAB's most significant contribution will come from coordinated episodic advising over time. An SFAB provides a low cost, small footprint professional advisor capability to fill the hundreds of SFA requirements currently filled by volunteers, red cycle taskings, and small unit deployments. An SFAB is capable of almost constant deployment of small elements over days, weeks, months, years, and decades. This would not only free up combat power, but also increase the quality of SFA across the globe. Given episodic employment over time, when the need arises, an SFAB can employ a larger entity from months to years as an effective deterrent to foreign aggression.
An SFAB deters two ways. First, the efforts to build partner capacity provide a stronger foreign security force, the best deterrent to external aggression. Second, the presence of U.S. Troops and their associated access to enablers discourages aggression fearing the result of U.S. intervention is our troops are engaged. As the U.S. moves closer to conflict, the full deployment of an SFAB signals significant support to an adversary as well as sets conditions for the deployment of a larger commitment.5 5 0 F 551 This concept provides a framework in which the SFAB could partner with Taiwan in order to deter China. Based on its five years of engagement with the TA, AWG proposed in 2019 that the deployment of an SFAB (in part or in full) to Taiwan, as part of a strategy of persistent engagement, would be consistent with doctrine and could build partner capacity within the TA and serve as part of a deterrence strategy to counter the PRC's goal of regional hegemony.
In part due to recent FMS purchases, the TA has begun to transition its brigades to The Army announced in early 2020 that 5th SFAB would be aligned with INDOPACOM. 5th SFAB has already begun to conduct multiple missions and exercises throughout 36 countries. As such, 5th SFAB likely will not deploy as a brigade to any single nation. Instead, it will send company advisor teams to advise at the tactical level and battalion advisor teams for operational and strategic-level engagements. This task force (TF) model is the most feasible and sustainable. Furthermore, SFABs should collaborate with Security Assistance Training Management Organization (SATMO) and their regional Technical Assistance Fielding Teams (TAFT) in order to learn from their respective deployment models. The United States has two TAFTs in Taiwan-tied to FMS cases.

Personnel: SFABs will require a robust liaison network capability to facilitate mission command. In addition, SFABs are working to incorporate Cross-Domain Integration Teams (C-DIT) comprised of electronic warfare, space, and cyber personnel to facilitate FSF connectivity and force protection.
• Facilities: SFABs will need both home-station as well as forwarddeployed facilities to house, train, protect, sustain, and conduct mission command for operations. civilian realms. With some smaller PNs, their NG counterpart units better reflect the size, scope, and capabilities of their military or emergency response services, making the SPP a more scalable and accessible BPC tool for some PNs. At times, PN forces may request exchanges and training with elite U.S. forces such as the 75th Ranger Regiment or Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC) when in reality the mission, focus, and skills of the PN make the NG a much more tailored and operational partner.
The unique characteristics of the SPP make it an ideal and long-term "means" to build a PN's capacity for resilience and resistance. Furthermore, the guardsmen and women who participate in the SPP also bring their unique civil and private sector skills and expertise to the table. Many are engineers, bankers, medical professionals, or IT JCISFA director (O-6). However, in order to implement any corresponding changes to security cooperation policy and strategy, the ASD for Security Cooperation and DSCA director would need to be involved in the final adjudication process. Since the ASD(SO/LIC), ASD(SC), and DSCA director all fall under the OUSD(P), the final adjudicating authority would likely need to be the USD(P). As the window of opportunity to annex Taiwan wanes and China faces increasing international and domestic pressure, the PRC may respond with force to take Taiwan.
Furthermore, the CCP may come to the conclusion that the reunification of Taiwan is so important for their regime stability that they will threaten the use of nuclear weapons to achieve it. Growing nationalism may play a role as well. As Chinese nationalism grows, particularly in the wake of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, the CCP may face increasing pressure to assert greater assertiveness on the world stage. "The predominant feature of Chinese conduct today is not grand strategy but a belligerent, defensive nationalism that lashes out without heed of consequences."5 6 2 F 563 Furthermore, a strategy which aims to increase Taiwan's resilience must be careful not to instigate premature reaction from China. One of the components for resilience outlined in the ROC is to increase the nation's national cohesiveness or national identity. This includes "psychological preparations" such as "patriotic education" to "help children build immunity to an adversary's propaganda."5 6 3 F 564 If Taiwan increases its "national cohesiveness" and "national identity" to the point that it begins to advocate for full independence, China may intervene militarily before Taiwan has adequately prepared its resistance capabilities. This is a dynamic which all U.S. advisors must take into consideration during every engagement with Taiwanese counterparts and which may engender immediate policy resistance.
One of the greatest endogenous risks to the proposal of any new strategy or concept is the powerful cognitive tendency toward policy resistance and bounded rationality, wherein actors within the system (both U.S. and PN) fail to implement new policies or adopt innovation due to limited bounds of information, a flawed mental model, or simply too many cognitive biases. This demonstrates the importance of employing design thinking and a systems approach to understand the problem. As system dynamics expert John
To avoid policy resistance and find high leverage policies requires us to expand the boundaries of our mental models so that we become aware of and understand the implications of the feedbacks created by the decisions we make. That is, we must learn about the structure and dynamics of the increasingly complex systems in which we are embedded."5 6 4 F 565 Christensen notes that Beijing's pessimism regarding devolving conditions which constrain Chinese action has been a major reason for the use of military force in the past.5 6 9 F 570 Ketian Zhang posits that China is a "cautious bully" but tends to engage in coercion more infrequently and rely on military means more when it perceives itself as getting weaker.5 7 0 F 571 A change to "strategic clarity" would also make it difficult to maintain a policy of "dual deterrence" between two Chinese nations that each possess "dual identities." While China maintains a "strange combination of self-superiority and self-inferiority," Taiwan maintains its identity as the legitimate government of China even as polls increasingly trend towards a Taiwanese rather than Chinese national identity.5 7 1 F 572 It would be difficult for the United States to maintain "strategic clarity" without aligning with one of these ascribed identities to the exclusion of the other. In other words, "strategic clarity" may tip Taiwan to declare independence while striking a significant blow against China's self-perceived superiority. "Strategic clarity" would also make it difficult to maintain "triple deterrence" with third-party nations, who may feel pressure to also adopt "strategic clarity" and either balance with the United States and Taiwan against China or bandwagon with China to avoid the costs of Beijing's reaction to the change in official policies.
Of all the crisis scenarios put forward in this study, the most challenging would be a disaster response scenario. If a large-scale natural or man-made disaster were to occur in Taiwan, such as an earthquake, typhoon, or nuclear powerplant failure, China would be able to exploit the situation in a myriad of ways to impose creeping or sudden annexation measures. Both the NPS-1SFG and NPS-MIT wargames conducted in 2021 demonstrated how China could quickly take control of all international aid flowing into its "province" and use Taiwan's diplomatic status as a means to legally and legitimately force countries to coordinate through Beijing rather than Taipei. China could take advantage of Taiwan's diminished military posture and response capacity to effectively control Taiwan's air and sea space. If Taiwan were to intervene militarily, China could escalate the conflict while painting Taiwan as the perceived aggressor.
The saliency of a natural disaster scenario, however, only further accentuates the need for a corresponding unconventional deterrence strategy for Taiwan centered around the capacity for resilience and resistance. The more robust and resilient Taiwan's military and civil response capabilities are, the more Taiwan will be able to signal to China that it can absorb costs and that any attempt to control Taiwan militarily or politically will be futile-whether in war or disaster.
If America's current grand strategy has a "negative aim" to prevent China from achieving dominance in regional or global strategic competition, then the loss of Taiwan 
The extent of success in which the Army has achieved BPC is inversely proportional to the constraints imposed and often times self-imposed. These constraints are derived from operational, organizational, legal, and more recently fiscal limitations or restraints. Taiwan encompasses all the constraints identified above with special emphasis on operational and legal restraints. The complexity of dealing with the environment not only involves cultural differences but the legal ambiguity of the U.S.'s relationship with the island of Taiwan.
One of the most significant value propositions for a strategy of unconventional deterrence focused on BPC is that it requires little to no change to current U.S. policies and authorities. The recommendations remain within existing legal bounds. No congressional or presidential approval is necessary, as the operational approach already fits within existing legal and operational constraints for Taiwan under the TRA and other legislation.
The DOD and INDOPACOM may need to review and adjust specific permissions and conduct interagency coordination-specifically with the DOS and AIT-but otherwise they can begin implementing elements of the strategy immediately. The main external factor is the colinear variable with Taiwan mentioned in the limitations section of the Introduction. Bilateral coordination and consensus with the Taiwan government and MND is critical to success.
Therefore, it is essential that the United States maintain its current legal and policy position of "strategic ambiguity" with Taiwan. With any policy or strategy of sufficient complexity and uncertainty, there will always be the temptation to implement some measure that will provide simplicity and clarity-something which will consolidate the complexity and package it into bite-size segments for clear understanding and action. The argument for "strategic clarity" with Taiwan follows this brand of logic: threats of punishment must be credible and without "clarity," Beijing will not perceive U.S. deterrence as credible. "Strategic ambiguity" supposedly reduces the potential deterrent value. But as the famous American journalist H. L. Mencken was known to say, "For every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong." With an extended "deterrence by denial" strategy, "strategic ambiguity" would actually enhance deterrent signaling because the goal of a denial strategy is to increase the ambiguity and uncertainty for an aggressor that it will be able to achieve its objectives. It would also amplify both misleading ("M-type") and ambiguity-increasing ("A-type") deception activities.
Washington does need to provide Beijing with greater "clarity" regarding the potential conditions and costs of war over Taiwan. Instead, it needs to continue inducing greater ambiguity and uncertainty into Beijing's decision cycle. A policy of "strategic ambiguity" provides flexible options to help work around strategic problems such as these.
Throughout the NPS-MIT geostrategic wargame, the Taiwan players continually tried to leverage multilateralism in order to hedge against the China team's unilateral attempts to subsume Taiwan under its disaster response auspices. The China team's agenda diametrically opposed multilateralism at every point, which matches China's current efforts to diplomatically isolate Taiwan. One way to preclude China from doing this is for other nations to establish official military relations with Taiwan's armed forces distinct from diplomatic relations. Washington could widely promulgate its unique partnership model with Taiwan to other nations that are willing to support Taiwan but lack the legal and diplomatic framework to do so. In essence, Washington could export and proliferate the TRA and similar bilateral congressional acts in a networked fashion. The built-in ambiguity may be precisely what other nations need to support Taiwan without infringing upon the "One-China policy."
None of these actions would amount to a sophisticated treaty alliance on behalf of Taiwan, but merely a hybrid legal and diplomatic framework designed to convince nations that it is in their best interest that Taiwan remain an autonomous-though not necessarily independent-sovereign polity. This is not to suggest a multilateral or even "minilateral"
or "hub and spoke" coalition in support of Taiwan, but a series of individual, bilateral security relationships with Taiwan that could-if needed-act as a "unified front" to counter Chinese public opinion and legal "lawfare" warfare in the future. The deterrent power of this framework is evident in the ROC:
When national resistance planning is integrated with allies and partners committed to the ideals of national sovereignty, territorial integrity and selfdetermination, it can become a powerful message against a potential adversary. It places a potential adversary on notice that it cannot violate a nation's territorial integrity and attempt to establish a new status quo.5 7 4 F 575
Ostensibly, the nations most amenable to this kind of ambiguous relationship status would be Japan, Australia, Singapore, and possibly the UK and other EU members such as the Baltic nations or France (based off recent changes in political and economic relations between these countries and Taiwan). The first and most logical nation to adopt this model would be Japan, which stands the most to gain from a resilient Taiwan in order to shoreup deterrence of China in the contested ECS. If Taiwan is the "elephant in the room" for China, then Japan is the "800-pound gorilla." Since the cessation of Formosa to Japan in 
In 2018, the Joint Staff J7 (Force Development) identified seven globally integrated operations capability development goals which the Joint Staff Strategic Multilayer Assessment (SMA) used to guide their assessment of globally integrated operations:
1. Identify potential crises before they develop and manage escalation favorable to the U.S. 2. Identify and counter competitor shaping activities that limit U.S. freedom of action. 3. Coordinate, synchronize, and de-conflict activities and messages across COCOMs and with DOD partners (U.S. and coalition). 4. Counter competitor influence messaging when adverse to U.S. objectives. 5. Assess intent of adversary activities (and messaging) and respond where appropriate. 6. Assess adversary assessment of U.S. and partner global activities and messages.

584 Hunzeker, "Taiwan's Defense Plans Are Going Off the Rails."
7. Assess risk of potential U.S. and partner mitigation options5 8 4 F 585
The "question" of Taiwan is central to each of these in the context of strategic competition with China. Therefore, Taiwan should be the central focus of the Joint Planning and Execution Community (JPEC). The JPEC should integrate the findings from this study and others into the Joint Planning Process (JPP) and the Adaptive Planning and Execution (APEX) enterprise, as well as system dynamics modeling.
Lastly, the DOD should fully incorporate IW into the emerging concept of "integrated deterrence" and codify unconventional approaches to deterrence with partners and allies alongside conventional approaches. The Pentagon and Congress should amend the PDI portfolio in future NDAAs to reflect greater components of "deterrence by denial" rather than "deterrence by punishment" that are less focused on platforms and technology and more integrated with partners and allies.5 8 5 F 586 The DOD and INDOPACOM specifically should develop a suite of flexible deterrent options (FDO) that align within this understanding and which support an unconventional deterrence strategy for Taiwan.
The most limiting constraint on achieving effective partnering efforts stems from a lack of understanding of the complex operational environment in which to build capacity during the design process and strategy formulation. What is lacking is a collaborative approach in the design process which capitalizes on the critical and creative cross-cultural perspectives by exploiting the similarities and differences of both the U.S. and PN, thus allowing the two to better identify the problem before recommending solutions.
With this understanding in mind, BPC planners and advisors should operate as directed telescope is a trusted representative of the commander who is able to cut across chains of command and red-tape bureaucracy in order to bring the "ground truth" to the commander expeditiously. Such advisors would also serve as "finders of strategy"-as described by management studies professor Henry Mintzberg-to search for and identify latent or emergent innovation strategies in PN engagements.5 8 6 F 587 These advisor-scouts would then act as both analysts and catalysts on an ad hoc basis to codify, elaborate, and facilitate the formulation of strategies and plans. They would blend formal and informal strategic planning and balance deliberate strategies with emergent strategies. This kind of approach would also cultivate weak ties across the system that would provide bridges between disparate parts of the larger system, bringing in new information and ideas that would help reduce bounded rationality and policy resistance.
It often takes outside observers, or "directed telescopes," for leaders to flatten the communications hierarchy and reduce uncertainty by sending trusted professionals to gather direct observations and lessons from the force. While all of the tactical and institutional "means" outlined in the previous chapter can serve as "directed telescopes"
and "finders of strategy" for building comprehensive defense and unconventional deterrence capacities within PNs, none can fulfill that role to synchronize and manage BPC efforts writ large. Each is able to identify key nodes and influencers within the PN network and identify latent or emergent innovation strategies in PN engagements, but there needs to be an organizing body with the capability and flexibility to cut across Joint and PN echelons of command.
The SFAB and higher headquarters SFAC could form the core for such an Similar to AWG's "operational advisors," this group should consist of "strategic advisors" capable of deploying globally to advise and assist PN and U.S. personnel at the policy, strategic, and institutional levels of warfare-to include governmental, ministerial, and civilian institutions. "Operational advisors" at the operational and tactical level could be billeted within the group or could be sourced from supporting organizations such as SOF, SFABs, and the NG SPP for specific and scalable mission sets. Also similar to AWG, the core cadre of the group should comprise of military, DOD civilian, and contracted consultants and should include liaisons at relevant organizations to ensure unity of effort:
• Joint and Interagency: JCISFA, DSCA, SOCOM, CIA, DOS, USAID • USA: USASOC, SFAC (FORSCOM), USASAC/SATMO, IWFMP (MCCoE, TRADOC), NG Bureau/International Affairs Division • USN/USMC/USAF: NSW Command, MARSOC, AFSOC • Institutions/Academia: Joint Special Operations University (JSOU), the Institute for Security Governance (ISG), NPS, JHU etc. • Multinational: NATO HQ, NSHQ, other partners or allies as needed Within this structure, the asymmetric operation working group (AOWG) and corresponding asymmetric warfare symposium (AWS) in Taiwan would be good models for future advisory support for comprehensive or asymmetric defense. The AOWG was designed around a collaborative and fully participatory approach by both U.S. and PN personnel to jointly identify the right people to participate in the right discussions while removing constraints which impede the defense transformation process. Applying the AOWG model to U.S. partnerships such as Taiwan creates a unity of effort to identify vulnerabilities and collaboratively recommend goals and activities to not only focus future exchanges but also determine the means with which to institutionalize change that corresponds to what both partners want and need or what they are capable of absorbing and achieving. The use of an AOWG can be a valuable tool when incorporated as part of the design process when developing BPC strategies and plans.
FUTURE RESEARCH
As noted in the introduction, the most challenging limitation of the study is how to measure deterrence because-by definition-it entails looking for something that did not occur. Further research could develop adequate criteria for determining feasible and suitable measure of effectiveness (MOE) for a strategy of unconventional deterrence.
Security cooperation initiatives and programs must meet the SMART criteria (specificity, measurability, achievability, relevance and results-oriented, and time-bound) with the addition of two: evaluated and reviewed. Without applicable evaluation criteria, it will be difficult to achieve the SMART-ER conditions. One potential MOE is to identify and measure indicators that the PLA are developing countervailing capabilities to focus more on COIN, CT, and IW in an urban environment. Another potential MOE could be an increase in PRC attempts to target or sabotage (kinetically or non-kinetically) U.S.-Taiwan BPC efforts to build resilience and resistance. These actions would indicate that China may see the BPC strategy as a credible threat.
Further research could identify viable options for compellence to coincide with and shore-up deterrence operations. In addition to FDOs, perhaps there could also be flexible compellence options (FCO). If deterrence is the decisive operation or main effort, compellence must be the shaping operation or supporting effort in order to provide the aggressor with viable and credible offramps should deterrence succeed.
Lastly, future research could collate and analyze the MAAG and AWG organizational templates for the potential formation of a Joint CDAAG. Currently, AWG's knowledge-base is housed within the Army's Combined Arms Center (CAC) in conjunction with the Center for Army Lessons Learned (CALL), as well as in the Joint Lessons Learned Information System (JLLIS). But many of AWG's previous members and leaders are still serving and could be interviewed to help determine a feasible force structure and operational & organizational (O&O) concept for a potential CDAAG.
The optimal deterrence strategy for the Joint Force and SOF to deter an invasion and annexation of Taiwan-in the context of global strategic competition with China-is an integrated deterrence strategy to build Taiwan's capacity for comprehensive defense through resilience and resistance. This strategy advocates for the integration of both conventional as well as unconventional deterrence components, as well as "deterrence by punishment" and "deterrence by denial" approaches to build "deterrence-in-depth" for To accomplish this ambitious yet sensible integrated deterrence strategy, U.S. and PN policymakers, strategic planners, and practitioners alike will need to reframe their mental models in order to adapt and overcome policy resistance and bounded rationality, among other cognitive biases. As the popular author of The Kill Chain, Christian Brose, admonishes: "Overcoming these obstacles will require leadership at the highest levels of government to set clear priorities, drive change in resistant institutions, remake their incentive structures, and recast their cultures."5 8 8 F 589 589 Christian Brose, "The New Revolution in Military Affairs: War's Sci-Fi Future," Foreign Affairs, June 2019, 134, https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/2019-04-16/new-revolution-military-affairs.
Causal loop diagrams (CLD) are valuable tools that allow one to test hypotheses about system dynamics and visualize the complex interactions and feedbacks between various elements that may be responsible for perceived problems, thus reevaluating previously held notions of cause and effect. The modeling process itself-from the creation of CLDs to the creation of functioning stock and flow models with initial data and relational equations-can greatly enhance understanding of the problem-set and help to adjust mental models. "Without the discipline and constraint imposed by the rigorous testing enabled by simulation," John Sterman asserts, "it becomes all too easy for mental models to be driven by ideology or unconscious bias."5 8 9 F 590 CLDs are often the first step in identifying how variables influence the behavior of other variables. Solid-line arrows-or connectorsrepresent causal directions and dotted-line arrows represent information connectors. Two hash lines overlaid on a connector represent a time delay of unspecified length. CLDs also specify polarities (+ or -) of interaction between variables to indicate the type of effect an action will have on a dependent variable when an independent variable changes. Polarities are either reinforcing or balancing. For example, a positive polarity indicates that when a certain variable increases or decreases, the variable to which it connects will increase or decrease beyond what it otherwise would be. If the second variable connects back to the first variable with positive polarity as well, this creates a reinforcing loop relationship (R).
A reinforcing loop amplifies what is already occurring; as one variable increases, so does the other. In contrast, a negative polarity indicates that when a certain variable increases or decreases, the variable to which it connects will change in the opposite direction. If the second variable connects back to the first variable with positive polarity, this creates a balancing loop relationship (B). A balancing loop represents goal seeking behavior; as one variable changes in one direction, the other changes in the opposite direction to balance it.  The CLD in Figure

These loops are intertwined with each other in a triquetra pattern or trefoil knot, meaning the output for one loop becomes the input for the other two loops. As one nation's capacity increases, the other nations will adjust their capacities accordingly. Each of these entwined "capability development" loops begins with the countries' respective capacities . With Taiwan, the desired capacity is to deter cross-strait aggression and defend against an invasion if necessary. For the United States, the desired capacity is to support

States. These feedback loops serve to balance their respective assessments by reducing the relative capability gaps identified by each actor.
A distinct, fourth balancing loop exists between the United States and Taiwan's side of the trefoil knot, which is U.S. BPC efforts with Taiwan (Figure 
23
24
Similar to the "capability development" loops, these strategies also form an interlocking trefoil knot, but they are reinforcing loops rather than balancing. This means that, rather than bringing the respective states of the system closer to a goal, they exponentially grow and feed each other, similar to an arms race or escalation archetype. Because they hold the same goal-to achieve and maintain greater capacity than their enemy-they become locked in an escalation archetype. That is to say, they also start with the countries' respective capacities and net assessments that lead to capability development. But from there the resulting increases in capacity further fuel the assessments and capability development of the opponent, leading to a vicious cycle of competition. Furthermore, there is a sublayer of information and disinformation that maps onto the system structure. For the sake of simplicity, this variable is depicted in the CLD as "strategic communication," which could range from official diplomatic communication to subversive cyber disinformation, propaganda, or fake news.
The purpose of this strategic communication is to alter the perceived values of capability gaps or strengths held by the opponent. This could be propaganda that aggrandizes the true level of a capability in order to instill doubt or fear, or it could be deliberate half-truths designed to conceal the full nature of a capability in order to prevent or delay the enemy from developing a countervailing capability. In the BPC CLD, the strategic communication information connectors have either positive or negative polarities. Positive polarity, such as the positive strategic communication of "US BPC with TWN" to "PRC-Identified Capability Gaps," indicates that as BPC increases with Taiwan, China's perception of relative capability gaps will increase, spurring capability development to match. But the polarity could just as easily be negative. For example, as "US Capacity to Respond/Support" increases, "US Strategic Communication" will increase, but the content of that signal could serve to mask the United States' true capacity and therefore decrease With this perspective in mind, the information sublayer of the system allows for a more complex and accurate mental model of both the physical and cognitive dimensions of the competition, deterrence, and capacity-building systems. It is not so much one's actual capacity that matters, but rather the other's perception of that capacity. Oftentimes the primary goal of BPC is for diplomatic signaling with the actual increase of capacity as only an ancillary benefit. This is the essence of deterrence, to signal and persuade the other actor to desist from aggressive actions. In summary, the BPC CLD and the model below provide a framework for both strategic capacity-building as well as information dominance-in other words, a framework for great power competition and the role that partner nations play in that framework.

dispersed capabilities and technologies to increase local capacity for deterrence, resilience, and interoperability across all domains including the "gray zone." It is evident that partnerships, capacity-building, and innovation are central to the new integrated deterrence concept-all themes explored in this study. However, it is not yet clear how BPC programs and activities of security cooperation and security force assistance will adapt to meet the demands of this new concept.

from competition to conflict to stability operations. Therefore, SFA may be the more appropriate convergence point within the realm of SSA for the DOD to conduct unconventional deterrence-utilizing the SFA expertise and doctrine of SOF and other elements such as the Army's new SFABs or the National Guard's State Partnership Program (SPP).

If China believes the only alternative to break U.S. hegemony in the region is through a narrowly focused conflict, then choosing to fight that conflict over Taiwan is the rational choice. Seizing Taiwan is the logical course of action because it achieves two grand strategic objectives with one stone. If China believes it can seize and hold Taiwan successfully, that is temptation enough. But if China believes it can break U.S. hegemony in the process, the temptation doubles in size.

resonate as true, they emphasize America's asymmetry of power without differentiating its asymmetry of interest or resolve vis-à-vis China. Despite the United States' military supremacy, it is not a guarantee of deterrence. Some adversaries like China may have a disproportionate level of interest and resolve to pursue aggressive action, regardless of the United States' power asymmetry. "If an adversary perceives that his stake in the confrontation is extremely high, while the U.S. stake in the crisis is not commensurate… the adversary may find the threat of U.S. military action non-credible."2 3 9 F 240 Moreover, it is important to note the difference between U.S. and Chinese perspectives of deterrence.

An organized resistance campaign or insurgency is not a mere policing problem that the PAP could simply pick up and readily address. Despite its large size, the PAP would not be adequately trained, equipped, or organized to adapt its operations for a full-scale insurgency. Additionally, the more PAP and PLA forces and resources which Beijing needs to commit to Taiwan means the less forces and resources that are available for restive places like Hong Kong, Xinjiang, or Tibet etc. COIN operations in Taiwan would stretch these forces thin and leave the CCP more vulnerable to opposition throughout the country. In other words, "the more credibly Taiwan can threaten insurgency, the more China's leaders will have to decide whether they are willing to trade Xinjiang for Taiwan."2 9 8 F 299 Instead of following the conventional paradigm for deterrence, unconventional deterrence strategies analyze the entire security ecosystem to identify causes and correlations below the surface.

represents more than just lost territory; it represents a common occurrence throughout much of its existence: a threat along the periphery. China sees any threat along its long land and maritime borders as a potential threat to sovereignty. Speaking of Chinese actions in the 1930s to suppress potential vulnerabilities in Xinjiang, Tibet, and Mongolia, historian Michael H. Hunt described how China "acted in line with the same compelling strategic logic that had long informed imperial policy. Loss of control on the periphery had repeatedly-both in the Qing and under other dynasties-rendered the cultural core vulnerable to penetration and attack."3 1 3 F 314 Furthermore, many foreign and imperialist powers have exploited China's weak periphery and posed a threat to China's rule in the past. Similar to the United States' interventions in Korea and Vietnam, China sees Taiwan as a U.S. hedge to contain China's historic rise. Given China's penchant for viewing the "past as prologue," the question becomes, as Hunt poses, "Which of the remembered pasts, we want to know, is likely to have the liveliest influence on policy?"3 1 4 F 315 requiring Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) General Milley to call his PLA counterpart and assuage the PLA's fears.3 1 7 F 318 The second interpretation is that the United States represents the rise of democracies worldwide which China sees as a threat to its authoritarian, party-centric governance model. With either interpretation, the CCP is apprehensively aware that few dominant political parties survive for more than 100 years (the CCP celebrated its 100th anniversary in 2021), therefore the idea of a rising democratic America may have the effect of making the CCP feel increasingly vulnerable and perhaps desperate.3 1 8 F 319 The rise of America and democratic values at a time when China is also attempting to return to its former prestige may cause the very structural stress which Allison Graham claims is the fateful trigger of the Thucydides Trap. Furthermore, Beijing may perceive that the United States is attempting to prevent, hedge, or reverse China's rise.
's strategic objective for Taiwan is to achieve a fait accompli, meaning China achieves its objectives in such a rapid and decisive manner that any foreign opposition is left signal de facto acceptance of the new status quo and would destroy what Elbridge Colby refers to as the "differentiated credibility" of America's commitment to partners and allies in the region.3 5 1 F 352 Ironically, China does not need to annex Taiwan in order to accomplish this strategy. In fact, the best strategy would be to invade Taiwan, cripple its defenses, then demonstrate self-restraint by allowing Taiwan to negotiate the terms of its special administrative status. This would signal to surrounding nations that it is willing to work with nations peacefully to resolve issues and that it is in their best interests to work with China rather than oppose it. This course of action is highly unlikely on the part of China, but it demonstrates the strategic latitude and advantage of a fait accompli strategy. For this reason, Taiwan's goal should be to deny China from selecting this option and prevent it from using Taiwan as a political pawn for future diplomatic gain. Instead, Taiwan should conduct a protracted resistance campaign to leave China no other option but to forcibly annex the entire island.

strategy and alter course, or would it remain rigid and stay the course? Would it continue to force the reinforcing feedback loops or accept a balancing shift in polarity?
The overall strategic "end-state" of a U.S.-led counterstrategy is to deny China's theory of victory. The goal is to continually force the burden of escalation back onto the Chinese. The United States should seek to deny China from invading Taiwan not simply to deter war but so that China will have to act in a way which escalates U.S., Taiwanese, and the international community's resolve. This requires a deeper incorporation of irregular warfare and political warfare into coalition "integrated deterrence" activities. A coalition counterstrategy of "deterrence by denial" could not only deny China's strategic objectives, but also thwart its foreign policy and grand strategic objectives.
Despite the supposed advantage of Beijing's long-term, generational grand strategy, Washington could actually sustain a better long-term strategy-perhaps not in terms of consistency or unity-but in terms of longevity, resilience, and long-term stability.
Washington's policy of "strategic ambiguity" and the TRA provide the necessary set of options and flexibility to adopt an indirect counterstrategy involving unconventional deterrence, asymmetric defense, security assistance, strategic deception and communication, public diplomacy, and political warfare.
During the first iterations of the AWS, participants focused on the shaping phase (D-180 to D-90 days) and the pre-crisis phase (D-90 to D-7), while the final iterations of the AWS focused on the invasion phase (D-7 to D+3) and the post-invasion resistance phase (D+3 to D+X). AWG created and refined a conflict scenario for the wargames and TTXs, with detailed results for each phase. Below are some of the observations from the post-invasion phase that are relevant to this study:
• PLA ground units have difficulty regrouping and reconstituting several of the divisions and brigades that made it to the beaches. After seizing airfields, some PLA SOF units were not reinforced and were surrounded by Taiwan Army units and SOF and wiped out while attempting to hold the airfields. Similarly, some PLA SOF units were unable to hold the Taiwan ports before being surrounded and killed by Taiwan SOF.
• Although some PLA ground forces, including armor units, successfully regrouped, they are held to positions outside of the interior of Taiwan.
Taiwan's mountainous terrain, held by Taiwan Army SOF, has prevented PLA ground forces from moving into the interior of island.
• PLA ground forces find that popular resistance is becoming an issue, with local militia supported by SOF mounting a guerrilla-like campaign against progressing PLA units.
• PLA units that had successfully landed on offshore islands they believed were secure find out that Taiwan SOF have conducted counter-landings and are engaging in espionage and special operations on these islands. Additionally, to the surprise of some PLA commanders, Taiwan SOF appear to have been inserted on mainland China and to be engaging in espionage and special operations there.
• There is some fifth column activity, but popular resistance is also apparent in this scenario, as are the coordinated efforts of the local population and Taiwan SOF. [emphasis added]3 9 3 F 394

In 2002, Walter Jajko decried the United States' tendency to view deception as unacceptable in all but the most extreme circumstances, such as the deception plan for the invasion of Europe in 1944-Operation Bodyguard. Since then, despite a "half century of sustained, systematic, and sophisticated Soviet Russian deception… the United States never resorted to a strategic political deception-not even for its own survival."4 9 2 F 493 Jajko believes that the United States does not include deception in its strategic arsenal because it fails to see the "virtue" of strategic deception-a vulnerability that adversaries who do not share the same inhibitions can exploit to their advantage. Thus, "American sensibilities are available as assailable susceptibilities."4 9 3 F 494
The differences in moral and strategic stances between democratic and authoritarian regimes seem to favor authoritarian regimes like China. However, there are authoritarian vulnerabilities and countervailing democratic advantages that provide democracies with unique deception opportunities-should they resolve to leverage them.
First, strong, central leaderships are more vulnerable to "M-type" type deceptions because they tend to believe what they want to hear and because the repressive climate is such that subordinates tend not to report information that is contradictory to the leadership's beliefs.4 9 4 F 495 Authoritarian decision-making is more vulnerable to cognitive biases such as the representative heuristic, confirmation bias, and the observer-expectancy effect, which all either ignore or misinterpret information in order to support preconceived expectations.
In fact, the tendency to perceive and confirm predisposed expectations is stronger than the ability to perceive and assimilate contradictory information, so it is far easier to reinforce a target's existing beliefs than to persuade the target to change his or her beliefs. Because the target of any deception operation is the adversarial decision-maker-typically through relying on exercises, rotational presence, and advisory capabilities."5 1 3 F 514 By nature and by design, this proposition describes the SOF approach. JP 3-05 for Special Operations states, SOF's primary role in military engagement, security cooperation, and deterrence is in support of a broader whole-of-government approach, integrated with both USG and partner capabilities… SOF provides a critical capability for the GCC to support and influence these activities. SOF provides an efficient and effective DOD commitment that builds and develops regional security forces while maintaining a positive forward presence during persistent engagement and pre-crisis periods. For example, CA forces could conduct CR and CE missions to assess the SWEAT-MSO civil capabilities within a specific urban center to identify vulnerabilities that-if left unmitigated-could upend resistance efforts during conflict or which could be exploited by the enemy to coerce the populace into submission. The medical component is particularly amenable to CA forces. CA teams (CAT) typically comprise of four-person teams, one of which is a special operations combat medic (38BW1) or civil affairs trauma medical sergeant (38BW4). CATs with these built-in medical assets can conduct extensive assessments of the PN medical infrastructure in order to identify and collate the medical shortfalls and vulnerabilities discussed in Chapter V. CATs could then develop a medical campaign support plan for the PN and conduct medical civic action programs (MEDCAP) to begin building the PN's requisite medical capacities for follow-on resistance activities.
Secondly, CA forces can conduct CNDE through CR and CE missions in order to identify key personnel and key nodes within the civil network in order to develop them and integrate them into the supported element's civil-military plan. CNDE is " the activity by which the civil network capabilities and resources are engaged, evaluated, developed, and integrated into operations."5 3 3 F 534 In concert with other U.S. advisors and personnel incountry, CA forces can avail of bridging and bonding social capital to create a "smallworld" and "benefit-rich network" within the PN. A small-world network, for example, could lay the groundwork for the development of a resistance auxiliary force while a benefit rich network would deliver timely resources and information within that network. By resistance by correctly identifying, engaging, and partnering with key influencers to shape the operational environment.5 4 4 F 545 In fact, PSYOP advisors are the best positioned and trained personnel to help catalyze a PN's defense transformation and the diffusion of innovation throughout the network. Because most new ideas and information spread like a "complex contagion," meaning one "exposure" does not always guarantee someone will accept the new ideas, SOF advisors can leverage key communicators to help overcome different people's contagion "thresholds," meaning one person may require only a few instances of exposure while someone else may require a great deal more. Individuals tend to look to their friend network or trusted personalities to interpret and react to new information, and because the PN populace will be the one preparing to resist against an enemy occupation, it is especially important for key communicators from the PN populace to message resilience and resistance, rather than outside or U.S. voices. This invaluable and systemic relationship of key communicators between the populace and government must establish well in advance of any potential crisis so that-if crisis erupts-the populace have readily available and trusted sources to turn to. Secondly, these sources and channels must be exercised regularly so that they are robust and resilient enough to continue operating and expand to fill the role of mainstream sources that will likely collapse during conflict.
1st Special Forces Command's (1SFC) Vision for 2021 and Beyond lays out the framework for "cross functional teams" (CFT) comprised from each of the SOF branches: SF, CA, and PSYOP-with multi-domain enablers such as cyber or intelligence. The most significant outcome from the NPS wargame with 1SFG was the critical need for a CFT approach in Taiwan and elsewhere in INDOPACOM:
The Joint SOF Commander's actions were most effective when different SOF capabilities (SF, PSYOP, CA) were used synergistically and in conjunction with one another in a particular country.  expert exchanges (SMEE) or more informal workshops and seminars to inform and instruct PN audiences. Academia can also employ the concept of "maker-spaces" that "emphasize knowledge sharing, experimentation, and the use of technological tools that have low barriers to entry-this effort would emphasize home-grown solutions that are technologically and financially 'right sized' for the host nation and the end-users."5 5 9 F 560
Lastly, one of the most effective "means" to catalyze change and implement a new strategy is to involve multinational partners. By involving other PN actors from the region, the PN can learn and observe different approaches and capabilities that may be more rightsized to their needs. Seeing operational success in a fellow PN may also inspire innovation and help to overcome policy resistance in ways that U.S. advisors may struggle to achieve.
While this is advantageous approach for many PNs, involving multinational partners in advisory support to Taiwan is the least likely of options due to its diplomatic singularity and reticence of many nations to officially engage with Taiwan. But this dynamic may change in the future. The most plausible third party military support would be from Japan, or perhaps Singapore or Australia. Taiwan has also conducted exchanges in the past with Japan, Singapore, Switzerland, Israel, and the UK.5 6 0 F 561
In addition to and in support of recent FMS and congressional acts, the Joint Force and SOF should develop a robust BPC framework for an asymmetric, persistent presence in Taiwan, one in which Taiwan could credibly compete with and deter its much larger adversary. No single "tool" or "means" can accomplish the objectives of an unconventional deterrence strategy on its own. Rather a "menu" of options integrated at the strategic through tactical and institutional levels is necessary. Furthermore, despite the 560 Leo Blanken, Romulo G. Dimayuga II, and Kristen Tsolis, "Making Friends in Maker-Spaces: From Grassroots Innovation to Great-Power Competition," War on the Rocks, January 12, 2021, https://warontherocks.com/2021/01/making-friends-in-maker-spaces-from-grassroots-innovation-to-greatpower-competition/. 561 Tzu-ti, "Taiwan Looks to Israel." "unconventional" aspect of the strategy, it does not entail a SOF-only approach.
Coordinated persistent and episodic exchanges of professional SOF and SFA advisors would be "low-cost, small-footprint" solutions well-suited to assist Taiwan with tasks related to making Taiwan a harder target for the PLA. A SOF CFT comprised of SF, CA, PSYOP, NSW, MARSOC, AFSOC, and enablers could form the core of a persistent engagement strategy, but it should integrate other tactical "means" such as SFAB advisor teams, SATMO TAFTs, NG SPP, and cadre from joint, interagency, multinational, and academia organizations. FAOs in-country and desk offices at the GCC and SCC will provide the long-term strategic continuity and linkage between the PN at the ministerial level, the ambassador and USCT, and the combatant commander.
The systems-based analysis presented in this study reveals several important risks, implications, and recommendations for the Joint Force and SOF as well as allies and partners to include Taiwan at the policy, strategic, operational, and institutional levels.
Art Lykke's "strategy stool" framework seeks to balance the "ends, ways, and means" of a strategy in order to lower "risks." While the goal is to completely balance a strategy, there will always be inherent endogenous and exogenous risks. With any strategy of deterrence or competition below the threshold of armed conflict, there is risk of miscalculation and unintended escalation. A 2019 RAND report on response options to "gray zone" activities stated that "any strategy for responding to gray zone aggression must balance excessive risks of escalation-including military, diplomatic, and economic aspects-with the reality that, to be effective, countering gray zone aggression demands some degree of risk tolerance."5 6 1 F 562
The most obvious and likely risk to any strategy of deterrence is the potential for miscalculation and missed reception or interpretation of communication signals. There currently is no channel for communication between Taiwan and the mainland. Even if China and Taiwan were to quickly establish such a channel in the event of a crisis, it would be unrehearsed and both parties would struggle to establish common understandings and protocols. Furthermore, recent news releases such as the Pentagon's wargame which "failed miserably" may cause China to overestimate and miscalculate their current capability vis-à-vis the United States. Public release of information of such events must be carefully controlled to ensure adversaries do not misrepresent the strategic environment one way or the other.

Rather than a grand strategy "lodestar" for the United States, America needs a national strategic narrative to help frame existing U.S. domestic and foreign policy and facilitate dialogue regarding potential derivative grand strategic aims. This was the premise of Navy Captain (CAPT) Wayne Porter (now professor at NPS) in 2011 in his influential article "A National Strategic Narrative."5 7 2 F 573 President Biden verged upon this notion in the 2021 INSSG when he stated, "I believe we are in the midst of an historic and fundamental debate about the future direction of our world," underscoring throughout the document the importance of democracy as "the single best way to realize the promise of our future."5 7 3 F 574
There are numerous policy and recommendations resulting from this study-apart from those already outlined in previous chapters. The target audience for these recommendations is primarily the OUSD for Policy, specifically the  
The DOD should consider utilizing NATO Article 3 as an example template for creating the legal precedent needed for a BPC strategy for Taiwan. Article 3 directs each member nation to "maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack," to include civil preparedness for resilience and the ability to recover from major shock such as natural disasters or hybrid warfare like cyber or political warfare.5 8 0 F 581
The Pentagon and Congress could amend the PDI to allow for specific BPC funds for provided "a dedicated, professional team, focused on preparing commanders and units to get beyond 'discovery learning' in order to more rapidly adapt to the requirements of the asymmetric battlefield."5 8 7 F 588 However, the unit was internal to the Army, and a comprehensive defense advisory capacity must be Joint and include representatives from SOF and the IA. The MAAGs were relatively effective, but any reinstatement of them must have the ability to engage with not just a PN's military but also its government, security forces (to include police and paramilitary), and civil agencies.
Regardless of the structure or sourcing organization, the Joint Force and SOF enterprise needs an AWG/MAAG-like organization to be able to deploy, identify emerging strategies and capability gaps in PNs, assist DOTMLPF integration, and serve as "directed telescopes" and "finders of strategy" to assist the PN and U. 593 Asymmetric Warfare Group, (UNCLASSIFIED) "Taiwan Asymmetric Warfare Symposium: Key Recommendations" (presentation, Taiwan Ministry of National Defense, Taipei, 2018); Asymmetric Warfare Group, (UNCLASSIFIED) "Taiwan MP Command Planning Workshop: Key Recommendations"
