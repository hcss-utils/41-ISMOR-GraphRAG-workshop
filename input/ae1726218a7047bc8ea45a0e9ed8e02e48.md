Russia's economic challenges following the end of the cold war forced Russia to seek asymmetric methods of warfare in areas such as the civil domain to continue to challenge U.S. hegemony.
After the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, Russia had several economic issues to rectify if it wished to grow its global position, while sorting through the Soviet era policies and culture that was left over from the Cold War.
Yet Russia has found asymmetric ways to make what resources it does have go further.
Russia has made significant investments in its special operations units such as its Spetsnaz units which make up Russia's unconventional warfare capability.
This capability was highlighted throughout the Crimean campaign.
