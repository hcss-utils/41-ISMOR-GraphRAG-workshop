We also observe that U.S. strategic forces continue to play an essential role in deterring potential adversaries and reassuring U.S. allies and partners around the world.
While the United States has successfully striven for many decades to minimize the degree to which it needs to rely on its nuclear weapons in its defense strategy and to seek mutual reductions in the number of nuclear weapons with Russia, they nonetheless continue to play a unique and crucial role.
America's strategic forces must remain the credible guarantor of this nation's and that of our allies' sovereignty.
We therefore strongly reaffirm the QDR's emphasis on the importance of a safe, secure and effective nuclear force, regional and homeland missile defenses, and a strong counterproliferation regime.
