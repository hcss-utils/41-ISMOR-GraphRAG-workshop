The years between 2000 and 2016 coincide with the implementation of Russian military policy under President Putin which led to the increase in activity, reformation, and recapitalization of its military effort including conflict with its former Soviet Union states.
Conflicts in Chechnya, Georgia, and Ukraine provide concrete case studies of the outcomes of the efforts pushed to improve the capabilities of Russian artillery and lessons learned therefrom.
During the same time period, the United States, which neglected any Russian military threat in the 1990s, after the fall of the Soviet Union, was focused on a COIN fight in both Iraq and Afghanistan during the so-called "Global War on Terror" campaign.
In 2016, the United States shifted its focus from a COIN-centric military of Full Spectrum Operations to Unified Land Operations and began to look again at deterring Russia in Europe.
