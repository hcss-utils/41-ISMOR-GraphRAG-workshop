In June 2016, Canada joined the United States, Great Britain, and Germany in becoming a Framework Nation that would lead a multinational battalion-sized battlegroup on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization’s (NATO) so-called “northeastern flank.” This vulnerable flank comprises Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland—NATO members that have become especially fearful of Russian aggression after the 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. Having assumed responsibility for the battlegroup in Latvia, the Canadian Armed Forces are contributing about 450 soldiers who partner with troops dispatched from Albania, Italy, Poland, and Slovenia. With $350 million committed to this deployment for the next three years, it is part of a much larger Canadian initiative—dating back to Stephen Harper’s prime ministerial tenure—to bolster NATO efforts in providing defence and deterrence in that region. 1 Canada has previously contributed to the Baltic Air Policing mission, providing fighter jets to protect airspace over the three Baltic countries. Its frigates have participated in training activities, military exercises, and other tasks organized by Standing NATO Maritime Group 2 in the Mediterranean and Black Seas. Canadian Army soldiers have also taken part in interoperability exercises with NATO allies in Poland. 2 These contributions complement Canada’s continued diplomatic and non-lethal military support for Ukraine while it fights Russian-backed rebels in its eastern territories.
