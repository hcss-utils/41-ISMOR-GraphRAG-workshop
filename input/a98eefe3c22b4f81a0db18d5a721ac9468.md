The crisis in Ukraine presents a different case study.
While the likelihood of committing U.S. forces to defend Ukraine following the seizure of Crimea is low, the postwar security architecture in the Euro-Russian space, so carefully constructed for a generation, has been thrown over.
The North Atlantic Council voted to defer NATO membership to Georgia and Ukraine and did not station NATO troops in the new member states, largely out of deference to Russian security concerns.
These confidence-building measures notwithstanding, Russia sent troops into Georgia in 2008, where they remain today.
