Chinese and Russian historic geopolitical and military relations along their shared border -the autonomous region of Xinjiang (Sinkiang) in China's west abutting Central Asia; Mongolia in the center with historic ties to Tibet (Xizang) to the south and Siberia to the north; and Manchuria, a battleground for centuries in the east -are surveyed in this chapter.
For past millenniums, the Himalayas and the vast deserts to the west provided natural defensive barricades to China in the south and west.
In the north, China built and maintained a wall to keep out its enemies.
This failed and crumbling barrier remains a symbol of unsuccessful attempts to thwart foreign aggression.
In two instances, full-scale invasions from the north created non-Chinese ruling dynasties, the Yuan (Mongols) and the Qing (Manchus).
