The last decade has seen the more aggressive predictions of human population growth not coming true, as the overall trend is toward lower rates of growth and fewer births per mother, especially in Europe, Japan, Russia, and China.
In 1989, the world was adding 87 million people per year; by 2002 the growth had dropped to 74 million additional people every year.
Most of the decrease in the gross number of births has been traced to a general decline in the number of children born per woman, which has dropped from 3.05 births per mother in 1990 to 2.55 per mother in 2005.
