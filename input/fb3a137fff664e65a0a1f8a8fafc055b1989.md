In the 1930s, Britain and the United States, observed global events with increasing dismay.
Adolf Hitler's invasion of Western Europe then made clear that fascism, not communism posed the greatest threat.
Hitler's invasion of Russia soon convinced Russia that the fascists posed a greater danger than the capitalists.
German and Japanese actions created a lethal opposing alliance out of the most unlikely partners.
Imperial Britain, communist Russia, and the anti-colonial United States cooperated in a way that would have been unthinkable prior to the rise of Hitler.
Britain, the guarantor of the pre-war world order, and the United States, which would become the guarantor of the post-war peace, spent the war years, not only carefully coordinating military campaigns with Russia, but also planning the institutional structures to maintain the post-war order.
Their plans ran counter to those of Russia, so it is not surprising that the unlikely alliance dissolved immediately after the common threat of fascist Germany disappeared.
