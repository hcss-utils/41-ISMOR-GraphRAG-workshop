The development of military applications for nanotechnology in the Russian Federation could be perceived as a threat to international security and could spark counter-militarization by states such as the United States, Western Europe, Poland, Ukraine, and Georgia due to the security dilemma.
Some Russian elites claim to be militarizing nanotechnology in response to the alleged military advances of the United States.
However, the Russian Federation does not currently pose a threat to the international community due to its inability to convert nanotechnology research into development as a result of financial mismanagement and changing views on the infrastructure.
The international community recognizes this lack of a threat and therefore the security dilemma is less likely to cause mass militarization and mobilization by states feeling threatened.
