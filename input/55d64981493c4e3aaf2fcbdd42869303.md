Assessing two strategic approaches, Joint Vision 2010 (evolutionary force design) and a rising advocacy of precision strike (revolutionary force design), in the future beyond 2010, this project seeks to identify the best path to future strategic military dominance and to explore related changes in service roles, functions, missions, and structure.
Using an interest-based strategic approach to force modernization, this study describes the future environment beyond 2010 and assesses the two forces within that environment, completing several tasks in the process: (1) describing the future and identifying probable conflict points and competitors; (2) modeling the two strategic approaches; (3) assessing these approaches' utility against probable competitors; and (4) examining the implications of the assessment outcomes. This thesis concludes that an evolutionary approach based on a variation of Joint Vision 2010 concepts and forces provides the more useful and decisive military capability as compared to a revolutionary, precision strike, stand-off approach to warfare. Organizational, doctrinal, and technological changes, incorporating unique service capabilities, are necessary to create a balanced, functionally based force that is rapidly deployable, decisively mobile, and dominant in peace and war.
before the conflict ended. The new Chief of Staff of the Army General Gordon R. Sullivan made force modernization and exploitation of the these new technologies' capabilities a priority.

Other factors, such as the coming millennium and the changing world security environment, accelerated the search for technological solutions to the future. With the success of Desert Storm and the collapse of the Soviet Union (USSR), technology was seen as a way to maintain the edge of a smaller force. Risk was limited in building a smaller force, given the demise of the threatening hordes of tanks coming across the "Iron Curtain." Yet, another view emerged advocating a true revolution in military affairs that pursued more than a qualitative improvement in existing, though decreasing, forces and doctrine. The fascination with the coming end of the century, coupled with the publication of the Tofflers' War and Anti-War: Survival at the Dawn of the 21st Century 3 and similar works, accelerated the search for a new way of war. The US is currently exploiting the promise of technology by pursuing a qualitative, evolutionary improvement to its forces. Still there are strong voices for more dynamic, revolutionary change--new equipment, new organizations, new ways of doing business. Both camps make strong cases, but only one path can be taken.
The pursuit of what is characterized as a revolution in military affairs continues with celerity and ebullience. It is important to the US and the pursuit of national interests and goals that an effective and efficient armed forces transition into the next century. This force must efficiently and effectively exploit the full potential of the information revolution, in order to remain preeminent. It remains to be seen whether this portends a revolution in military affairs or not.
However, failure to manage this change properly can result in catastrophe, as history clearly illustrates.
The Past--Why Exploiting Change Is Important Change or so-called revolutions in military affairs have had profound effects on warfare and society as a whole throughout history.
Seeking or more basically recognizing change, in the words of General Sullivan "seeing the elephant," and capitalizing on that change has been essential to victory throughout history. Failure has resulted in needless death, destruction, capital expenditure, and defeat. An examination of history will help in defining and analyzing the present revolution.
A revolution in military affairs is a difficult event to identify, as shown by the variety of positions on the present revolution, and in the historical context. There are various definitions and divisions of historical revolutions in military affairs. Andrew Krepinevich in "Cavalry to Computer" identifies ten revolutions, based on "technological change, systems development, operational innovation, and organizational adaptation."

These revolutions, or waves, correspond to the agrarian, industrial, and information revolutions. In The Military Revolution Debate, a variety of scholars advance or question the existence of various military revolutions and their impact on early modern Europe. It is immaterial how many military revolutions there were, if any, or what caused them-technology, society, doctrine, or innovation. The recognition and proper exploitation of change have been the key to success throughout the history of armed conflict.
Reviewing revolutions in military affairs illustrates the importance of recognition and exploitation. During the Napoleonic era, one of Krepinevich's revolutionary periods, social change, not technology, fostered change in the manner armies were employed. The levee en masse allowed Napoleon's armies to tower over his opponents in terms of size and ability to absorb casualties. His opponents had the opportunity to act on the other changes of the era--artillery, the beginnings of the general staff system, organizational modifications-except for one, the social revolution and rise of patriotism sprouting from the French Revolution. These social factors provided Napoleon the catalyst to change markedly the way war was waged. Military historian Peter Paret noted that "universal conscription . . . produced a great increase in the number of soldiers . . . enabl [ing] French commanders to fight more aggressively and costly campaigns, and to fight more of them." 
8
The beginning of World War II illustrates the consequences of failing to appropriately exploit change. The Germans' success at the opening of World War II was due to their recognition and fitting exploitation of technology, organization, and doctrine. As Eliot Cohen has noted, the "raw conceptual ingredients for blitzkrieg existed as early as 1918" 
9
The result of this failure to see and exploit the potential of this revolution is well known. It is embodied in the battle of Dunkirk, where the remnants of the British and French armies were forced off the European Continent.
Anticipation, recognition, and the ability to exploit revolutions in military affairs, be they technologically, politically, socially, or economically driven, or a combination, are essential to success on the battlefield and the corresponding security of a nation. Failure results in unnecessary casualties (the Civil War) and often defeat (France in World War II) or destruction of the nation (the Confederacy in the Civil War). Sometimes forces are unable to act on the revolution due to circumstances beyond their control, as in the case of France's monarchist opponents in the Napoleonic Era. However, regardless of the reason for failing to exploit the revolution, great powers who do not are invariably supplanted by others. This is why it is so essential that the US military's search for new ways of war "get it right."
The current revolution or impetus for change is framed in terms of technology given the corresponding information revolution (a "Net Year,"
or the period before another substantial change takes place, on the Worldwide Web is now about ninety days) but a revolution in military affairs incorporates many changes. Acting on change and incorporating the various components of a revolution in military affairs are essential to success and security. As the Italian strategist and proponent of airpower Giulio Douhet said, "Victory smiles upon those who anticipate change in the character of war, not upon those who wait to adapt themselves after they occur."

The Future--Two Competing Views
The revolutionary camp envisions future warfare built around systems and less and less dependent on man. Andrew Marshall, the longtime Director of the Secretary of Defense's Office of Net Assessment, as reported in a 15 July 1994 Wall Street Journal article, has advanced the proposition that US future force should take a new, more radical course in exploiting and integrating technology. He advocated a force designed to acquire targets, and engage them at long range with standoff or "brilliant" weapons that seek those targets independently after acquisition. The force described is devoid of "sunset" 
14
There are others advocating technology as the solution to future defense needs. At the 1996 Fletcher Conference, Richard Perle, former assistant secretary of defense in the Reagan administration, advocated that precision engagement was the best application of the emerging RMA.
Further, manpower should be reduced to free up funding.

The evolutionary approach applies technology in a manner that makes man more effective and efficient. Technology does not supplant the human being nor obviate familiar ways of war. In Joint Vision 2010 
20
Joint Vision 2010 emphasizes high-intensity, conventional operations as the first priority. With this capability, "full spectrum dominance" 
21
Vision 2010 forces can execute missions throughout the spectrum of and levels of conflict without major reorganization or change.
Which Path to Take?
In business, organizational effectiveness--doing similar functions in a similar, yet superior manner from the competition--does not provide a sustainable advantage over the competition. A sustainable and dominant competitive strategy rests on carrying out different activities or doing similar functions differently from the competition. 
22
The precision strike advocates suggest that their path to future warfare provides this competitive position, and Joint Vision 2Q1Q proponents will say the same.
It appears that Joint Vision 2010 is not a particularly controversial document, focusing only on the operational level of war and not addressing strategic implications and requirements. It may be conventional, particularly when compared to the revolutionaries' vision of twenty-first century warfare and forces. Joint Vision 2Q1Q is a vision of evolutionary change. Richard Perle, Edward Luttwak, the Friedmans, and others see a revolutionary force, fundamentally different in organization, ways and means, that dramatically alters the present notion of warfare. The proponents of both evolutionary and revolutionary forces claim suitability across the future world landscape. Yet neither group of advocates presents a vision of the future world environment that is sufficient to diminish the other's claims of strategic effectiveness and utility. The United States cannot realistically achieve both visions. Zero growth or declining defense budgets clearly reflect this reality; and advocates of each path are quick to discount the other.

In order to choose wisely, decision makers must know the capabilities and utility of an evolutionary or revolutionary force from a future perspective. They must know what value that each force brings to the spectrum of conflict, what the most likely threat or threats will be, and how well each force will impact that threat environment(s).
Evolution allows for the Department of Defense (DoD) organization to change incrementally over time. Evolutionary change may also provide a window for a competitor to exploit more rapidly the potential of the information age and gain an advantage. A revolutionary approach provides the opportunity to rapidly exploit the information age and maintain the advantage. There is developmental and technological change daily. There are also new social and political imperatives. The future may call for a revolutionary force, or it may not. Assessment of the future and the potential of each path of force development in that future will clarify the decisions that must be made in the present.
The purpose of this thesis is to determine whether the present course of modernization as described in Joint Vision 2010 is the wisest choice for the future, best exploiting the potential of an emerging revolution in military technology and military affairs when viewed from a future environment and threat perspective beyond the Year 2010.
To determine the utility of the RMA force in the future, this study will proceed under two assumptions. First, that information age technology advances can support the requirements of a revolutionary force. Given the velocity of technological change, this assumption appears reasonable. Second, that defense budgets will not increase, except for inflation. In order to implement change effectively, the US must choose the proper modernization path given the future environment and challenges within that environment. As former Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney said, "budget drives strategy."

This thesis deals with a number of concepts that require definition to ensure clarity of understanding. Some may be familiar to military and associated readers. Many reflect widely accepted terminology, but some do not.
Capabilities. Capabilities are a "properly organized, trained and equipped force" or services' "ability ... to accomplish . . . particular mission[s] or function [s]," 
28
Force Structure. For this study, force structure is the organization, equipment and manning of each branch of military service.
Force structure is designed to meet each service's roles and mission requirements.
Functions. Functions are "specific responsibilities assigned by Congress, the President, or by the Secretary of Defense to enable DoD components to fulfill the purposes for which they are established." 
29
30
Revolution-Revolutionary. Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, 10th
Edition, defines revolution as "fundamental,-" and revolutionary as "constituting or bringing about a major or fundamental change." The key word is fundamental.
Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA). The Office of Net Assessment, Office of the Secretary of Defense, defines an RMA as: "A Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) is a major change in warfare brought about by the innovative application of new technologies which, combined with dramatic changes in military doctrine and operational and organizational concepts, fundamentally alters the character and conduct of military operations." 
31
32
RMA Force. A generally accepted definition of an RMA force does not exist. Given the position of Richard Perle, Edward Luttwak, the Friedmans, and others, a definition emerges. An RMA force is organized around information control and long-range acquisition and fire-andforget missile or other systems that allow detection and engagement/destruction of enemy formations without friendly forces becoming entangled in close combat or maneuver warfare in any medium-aerospace, sea or ground. This force arises from information age technology and will require development of new systems, organizations, roles, missions, and functions.
Roles. Roles are the broad and enduring purposes specified by Congress in law for the Services and selected DoD components. For example, the US Army's role is to provide trained and ready ground forces in support of deterrence, and should deterrence fail to provide forces for sustained land combat. 
34
To allow for a wide dissemination and the use by others, this study will remain unclassified. The research will be conducted using only unclassified sources.
A fiscal analysis is beyond the scope of this study. The specific costs associated with developing either force will not be addressed.
The potential for development of new systems, as described in any discussion of revolutionary force capabilities, will not be addressed beyond what is covered previously in assumptions.
Risk-to-readiness and near-term operations associated with redirecting current modernization dollars to revolutionary force development will not be addressed.
This study will not determine whether a true revolution in military technology or in military affairs exists. Assuredly, some emerging technology, if properly acted on, will produce revolutionary results--as with the Germans and the Blitzkrieg, but it is not sure that the technology is truly revolutionary. Using the previously discussed example of a "net year" being ninety days on the Worldwide Web, information technology and all it portends may well have only an Affairs, the potential of information age technology, and future force roles, functions, missions, and structure transcends all services and ideas abound. There are many agendas, as forces and funds decrease, and competition for shrinking defense dollars increases. 
36
This thesis assists the decision makers by assessing each force's value in a specified future beyond 2010.
CHAPTER 2
The quantity of publications and information concerning the future and the steps the military should take to meet it is substantial. For example, two bibliographies from the US Army War College Library comprise seventy plus pages of references on the revolution in military affairs, the strategic vision of the twenty-first century, and the future in general. Most address several areas relevant to this thesis.
Topics include the geopolitical situation, the nature of war, possible economic and security threats, security policy for the next century, the potential of technology, and social and demographic changes. Like Joint Vision 2010. many fail to link change to a probable future national security strategy. Specificity in many cases is not forthcoming. Many authors are theoretical or at the very least general in their dealings with the future. This insufficiency, coupled with a scarcity of studies that compare and contrast the multiple military options on the direction of US defense in the coming twenty to thirty years, fails to illuminate the issue clearly.
It is hard to be specific about the future. However, assertions made as to the nature of the future and the steps the nation must take to meet this future must be presented and based on factors that connect with decision makers. 
1
Scenarios are unable to cover the world environment sufficiently, and require user acceptance. Discounting unlikely possibilities allows a study or recommendation to be more right than wrong. This allows for intelligent decisions to be made on which way to go and for reasonable course corrections to be made as the future becomes clearer. 
2
Due to the current focus on the twenty-first century, technological change, and the rapidly changing world situation, there are numerous short periodical, scholarly, and government study pieces.
Everybody seems to have an interest or position on this subject. The challenge is sorting through the tremendous volume of material in order to find the substantial works. Works that provide a historical perspective, develop a projection of the future environment, that identify strategic requirements, and that discuss the potential of military change and technology and its proper application are scarce.
In looking to fill this void, this paper assimilates and analyzes a variety of sources that address history, the future environment, strategy--geo-political, national and military, military technology, and the numerous proposals for military change.
History is important to understanding the future. As the old saying goes, those who do not study history are bound to repeat it.
Ignoring the past when looking to the future removes the perspective of human experience. History is a record of change. History is not a sine wave or predictive about the future. However, history provides a record of how cultures and nations have responded over time to circumstances that may be similar to future eventualities. History provides insight into the likely interests and behavior of peoples around the world.
History also identifies concepts and strategies that are proven over time. It is important to note that history is not dead. The historical record is alive and well in Bosnia, Albania, Rwanda, Nigeria, and Zaire, where ethnic and cultural hatreds hundreds of years' old have flared once again. As will be discussed in chapter 4, some of the studies of the future do not appear to have much basis in the past. Historical perspective was useful in preparing this thesis in three broad areas.first, long-term behavior and perspective; second, political strategy;
and third, military history and past revolutions in military affairs. Diplomacy examines the present global system and competition with a close look at how the world was shaped over the last one hundred years by the states present on the world stage today. Dr. Kissinger's perspective on the changing "world order," as laid out in chapter 1, is essential to any examination of the near future of the twenty-first century.

Three excellent works on military revolution are Andrew Krepinevich's "Cavalry to Computer, The Pattern of Military Revolutions,"

The Future Environment
The future environment determines where US national interests will lie, and who will threaten them and where. Military forces exist to counter these threats. Defining the future is essential to understanding the threats and what forces are required to deter or defeat them. There is no DoD wide future set or collection of scenarios to establish focus and direction in pursuit of Joint Vision 2010 or any of the supporting service modernization programs. 
9
The key work in this area, if only because of its influence and circulation, is the Tofflers' War and Anti-War: Survival at the Dawn of the 21st Century. The Tofflers are the popular visionaries that have been providing a view of the future since the 1970s. Their most current project War and Anti-War has inspired much thought and great debate within the government and has found many adherents, including the former Army Chief of Staff General (retired) Gordon R. Sullivan. This work focuses on the relationship between the making of war and the production of wealth. 
10
Two other books that take differing views of the future environment and sources of conflict are Samuel Huntington's The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order 11 and Robert Kaplan's The Ends of the Earth: A Journey at the Dawn of the 21st Century. 
12
Herman Kahn's The Next 200 Years: A Scenario for America and the World. 
13
It provides a generally positive view of the world, discounting many currently worrisome trends such as energy depletion, resource shortages and population explosions. This work is particularly useful in the areas of demographics, economics, resources and trend projections.
Kahn's long-range view of the future provides a contrasting perspective and John L. Petersen's The Road to 2015. Profiles of the Future. 
15
McRae's work is more economically driven, and Petersen's is perhaps more comprehensive, but both are extremely useful to any study of the future.
There are a plethora of government studies and think tank publications concerning the future environment. Charles Taylor's A World 2010: A New Order of Nations 
16
Another extensive study is the National Defense University's 2015:
Power and Progress. 1S This is a very comprehensive work, addressing the world's great powers, coalition building, the world environment, the nature of conflict, and the impact of technology on warfighting. This study suggests that conflict involving the US will be rare. Warfare may transition to defensive primacy, platforms (tanks, ships) will become obsolescent in a conflict environment of sensor-fused standoff weapons, and coalitions are essential to US security. 
19
The Air Force's 2025

Of particular use are the annexes on long-range planning and trends. 
The application of military power, to paraphrase Clausewitz, is an inherently political decision. In order to adequately address military strategy, it is essential to understand the underlying paradigms of world power, national interests and strategy, and national power. Hans J. Morgenthau, the father of realpolitik, in Politics Among Nations:
The Struggle for Power and Peace 23 lays out a paradigm for national strategy based on the promotion and defense of vital national interests.
Recent US history and actions reinforce this paradigm. US actions that
were not linked clearly to some vital national interest have ended in disaster--Vietnam, Beirut and Somalia to name a few--while Desert Storm's success may be linked to the US defending its vital national interests. The paradigm of national interests defined as power is a very useful means of assessing a nation's actions in a future environment.
understanding geopolitics is also essential to forming concepts of national security and military strategy. Geopolitics and War:
MacKinder's Philosophy of Power 
24
Control of this region, which is resource rich and independent of the sea for survival, yields command of the world.

32
In contrast to Summers' embrace of Clausewitz's view of war as politics between states is historian Martin van Creveld's The. In addition to the many service college publications, the article "To Change an Army" by General Donn Starry is an exceptional piece and should be required reading for anyone involved with changing their service or incorporating the RMA. 
36

40
Technological change is an essential part of the so-called RMA and Krepinevich. This general inadequacy harms the process, as an honest debate is not possible without some radical suggestions being available.
The reluctance of the authors cited here and others 'to provide specific recommendations on force structure and on roles and functions complicates the overall discussion of where the military should go with this so-called revolution. In reality there is no vision of a force structure to support Joint Vision 2010. Neither is there a vision of an RMA force beyond the notion of no "sunset" systems, an emphasis on a systems of systems, long-range precision strike, and war from afar.
The body of material is insufficient in the area of roles, functions and mission, particularly on the part of the proponents of precision strike.
Proposals are too general and fail to address changes to the basic functions of the military services.
Future force organizations and methods of operation, as manifested in the EMA and RMA forces that will be discussed in later chapters, will He postulates that systems and organizations similar to those familiar to present day military establishments will be superseded by "new, far more capable means and methods of warfare and . . . military organizations" derived from the information technology revolution. In order to accomplish this, he advocates an end to "sunset systems," such as aircraft carriers, tanks, and perhaps bombers, as a drain on potential investment in new capabilities. 
45
46
David Ochmanek, a former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy, views the future military environment as one of challenges and constraints on US force options. He also sees many of the same challenges that Krepinevich outlines and similar prescriptions, but sees the US constrained by its obligations as a great power. 
47
48
50
The last question assesses the utility of these two forces in meeting the nation's needs in a probable future environment. An assessment of each force will be made as to its general capabilities against the extremes of probable, potential competitors: a regional near peer competitor and a first wave force in an operations other than war (OOTW) environment. Use of these two conflict environments will establish the utility of the RMA and EMA forces across the spectrum of conflict. Then each force will be assessed against the most likely threats, given probable US interests and its ability or inability to avoid conflict. Criteria for assessment are the ability of each force to achieve: deterrence, compellence, and decisive victory. These criteria are the most relevant and of primary importance: deterrence is the first role of each armed service; compellence is essential to diplomacy,-1 and decisive victory is the standard expected by the American public.

CHAPTER 4 The Future Environment and the Future Military
The future environment frames the requirements for any future military organization. Military strategy and supporting forces are derived from a national strategy that seeks to deal with the world environment. Any military approach to the future must be clearly linked to a probable future environment and corresponding national security strategy.
Military forces have changed as the environment and challenges to national interests have changed. For example, prior to World War II the US relied on a large Navy and a small Army, based on an assessment of the threats to US interests. 
2
3
4
The same will be true in the future. Changes in the world environment will compel changes in the United States' requirements of the Armed Forces and how those forces will accomplish those requirements. In order to determine those requirements, and to develop a viable strategy to meet those requirements, the environment must be defined.
A useful strategy is one that springs ahead of events. Describing the environment that contains those events--the future, a market, a region--is key to developing a strategy that best meets the projected environment's challenges. In the case of this thesis the environment in question is the future. Developing an appropriate, probable characterization of the future is essential to evaluating the potential of RMA and EMA forces to meet effectively the needs of the US.
There are numerous ways to describe the future. One method is prediction, where analysts look to provide certainty that events will take place or conditions will exist. 
5
Prediction is of questionable long-term utility where most factors are more likely to shift and change. Another way of depicting the future is to provide scenarios that portray various possible outcomes or environments that stimulate thought and planning for the future.
However, a scenario-based approach to the future must connect with the user. Scenarios like some in the ÜSAF's Space Cast 2020 and 2025 are indefinite to the present and future environments, may not be linked to existing actors, and may appear to be fanciful. 
6
Scenarios are useful when taken in conjunction with a forecasted future environment. They allow possible variations to be investigated and contingencies to be anticipated and planned for.
This chapter will utilize the forecast method to present a probable future environment. This environment is based on a synthesis of the views of a variety of futurists and scholars and on a projection of trends identified in a variety of sources, all tempered by history.
This method of forming a probable future can also be described as a modified Delphi technique. The Delphi method, pioneered by RAND Corporation, involves surveying a number of scholars on a particular subject, searching for consensus. In the modified Delphi technique, used in this chapter, the scholars works are surveyed for trends and continuity to answer questions about the future. 
9
However, describing the future is not so much an exercise in probabilities as it is an invention based on value judgments. 10
A good forecast must have certain components in order to be credible. The Futurist, magazine of the World Future Society, lists ten elements to look for: the author--credentials, bias,-method--Delphi, The forecast outlined here describes a probable environment in the decade beyond 2010. In addition to reflecting the elements outlined in the preceding paragraph, this chapter will describe the decade beyond 2010 on four axes--social, economic, political, and security; within seven regions--North America, Russia and Eurasia, Europe, the Middle East and Southwest Asia, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. It will establish US interests in that environment and then identify potential sources and points of conflict. This future environment will serve as the battle space for an evaluation of the utility of EMA and RMA forces.
The bottom line is that a forecast is the most usable means of describing the future, providing a familiar and probable environment.
The US is at a minimum a global power with global interests. Hence any US military force not based on a strategy corresponding to the world situation may be at best inappropriate, or at worst ineffective.
The assumptions made in establishing this future environment generally follow those of the Army War College's Charles Taylor. Those assumptions are: there is a very low probability of general war between the US and any peer competitor; a worldwide economic depression is unlikely; nor is a probable scientific or technological breakthrough on the horizon that allows one nation total domination over all others.
An added assumption deals with the world view of the US: the US, as the primary great power, will most likely remain sufficiently engaged in the world to prevent domination of the Persian Gulf by either a resurgent Iraq or a rising Iran, in the years leading up to the period of 2010 to 2020. 
13
These outcomes are trends that shape the future environment. The trends below reflect continuity within major studies, the judgment of the author, and are important to forming the future contained in this chapter.
Global population growth through 2020 probably will not substantially decline, but will start to slow. World population may be thirty percent larger by 2010, at about 7.2 billion, and could increase another 3 billion by 2025. 
15
16
The Ends of the Earth 17 Competition for arable land, fresh water, housing, and economic viability may be potential sources of conflict given these nations' large populations and present connections to crime syndicates, drug cartels, and violence. US involvement will be limited, particularly regarding wars in Africa, to assistance and peacekeeping.
Additionally, these nations' abilities to sustain conflict are suspect. 
18
1
Taylor describes it as a "devolution of power." 
20
These trends have corresponding impacts on political and securitytrends .
Increasing economic interdependence should expand free market economies and support a rise in economic growth. 
22
Economic stratification will follow the Tofflers' three waves-post-industrial information based economies (third wave), industrial economies (second wave), and agrarian economies (first wave).
Stratification within these waves is likely. This stratification is best characterized as: third-information/post industrial nations and economies; second-transitional and industrial nations and economies; and first-emerging/pre-industrial nations and economies. 
24
Reliance on, and demand for, petroleum and other fossil fuels will continue. Despite the attractiveness and rapid development of improved battery technology and alternative energy sources such as wind, solar, and geothermal, the world will still be a slave to petroleum and fossil fuels for energy, plastics, synthetic fibers, chemicals, and fertilizers. An oil crisis is unlikely due to a historic link between demand and exploration and supply. However, nuclear power will increase both in terms of use and abundance.
Science and technological development will increase with greater velocity in every conceivable area. Access to technology will approach uniformity in almost all nations. The ability to act on that technology, however, will not necessarily be uniform. Computer technology will become integrated to the point that its existence may be transparent to the user. Access to technology and space (communications, imagery, and navigation) in particular will no longer be confined to a select few, but will include most of the world through direct access and control or subscription to commercial services. 
26
Sociopolitical changes will uniformly impact developing and emerging economic states. 
27
28
There is a very low probability of a general war between a peer competitor and the United States. Indeed, the probable proliferation of nuclear weapons will serve to limit conflict between peer and regional competitors. 
29
Weapons proliferation will increase. Most Western militaries will be substantially smaller (perhaps half as large) after a period of declining resources and steady, in cases startling, reduction. Other parts of the world are expanding their militaries and arming at a rapid rate, particularly in Asia. 
31
32
Another lesson of Desert Storm--the Indian Foreign Minister's comment that "One doesn't fight the US without Nuclear Weapons," will be fulfilled by an increase (from the current five to seven to over twenty) in nuclear armed nations.
Increase in the globalization of crime is likely to continue unabated, despite current recognition of and plans to confront the problem. This is due to a number of factors including first wave population growth, government corruption within the first and second wave nations, the continued growth and profitability of the drug trade, and the rise of ungovernable nations.
The World Environment 2010 to 2020
The seven regions, and the social, economic, political, and security axes within them, respond differently within the general framework of limited war, economic and energy stability, and technological parity described in this chapter's assumptions. The same is true regarding those trends identified and described above.
Different reactions are in part due to cultural factors and a region's present position or starting point. This section provides a synopsis of the social, economic, political, and security landscapes in and around 2020 based on the world's response to these trends. Each landscape depiction will be followed by a more specific regional assessment.
Omission of a region or nation in this overview reflects its relative lack of impact within that particular landscape. 
36
The world should find itself divided into three economic categories that will correspond closely to the social position of each nation, the potential for advancement, and the general satisfaction of the people.

China is a large example with its one-hundred million migrants who can be found in the special economic zones looking to increase their station.
Third wave nations will assist those first wave nations that have the best chance of survival or have something to offer, but will be loath to become involved in those on the verge of anarchy. 9 Ethnic strife will continue to plague much of the first wave world, and will not be entirely eliminated in the former East Block, particularly in the Balkans.

Asia is the center of the world, with an unchallenged economic boom fueling substantial development and freedoms.

The economic landscape will probably be characterized by continued worldwide growth, including in Russia (despite its current six year down turn in industrial output). This landscape, as stated previously, reflects three economic divisions. The importance and influence of the multinational corporation (MNC) will be unquestioned, but will probably not supplant nation states as primary economic actors due to a lack of control of the other instruments of political power--diplomatic, information, and military. Indeed, nations may often use those other instruments to support the interests of an MNC(s).
Asia will be the world's economic "center of the universe." China most likely will surpass Japan as the second largest economy in the world. While China may possess the second largest economy, it is likely that China will suffer from instances of the previously described Social Landscape of the haves (east and south-east) and have-nots (north and west) due to social, cultural, and geographic constraints, poor government management and political change. Hong Kong will most likely survive Beijing's attempts to impose too much control and will emerge as the economic center of China.

economy in terms of per capita income.
North America will still be the largest and most prosperous region in the world, with Mexico having overcome its severest problems about midway through the next decade. The United States economy will fully realize the potential of the information age and will just hold onto its position as the world's largest and dominant economy. 
45
Though Russia still will not be a full partner and participant with the major economic powers, economic development should fuel support for a freer market and the continued development of a Russian democracy.
The European Union (EU), including much of the former East Block, will still be working to emerge as an integrated economic and political entity. It is doubtful that the EU will be able to overcome hundreds of years of nationalism, distrust and notions of sovereignty. Taken as a whole, Europe may well be the largest economy; however, socialism and a lack of unity will prevent this entity from realizing its full potential .

The world will be dominated by third wave nations in a multipolar world with the United States first among several not so equal peers.
Neither China, Russia, the EU, nor any other nation or block (Japan, India, ASEAN, etc.) will be able overcome its own internal problems sufficiently so as to challenge the US directly. The continued increase in free market economies will result in a growth of representative forms of government; not necessarily on the US model, but similar. Regionally and culturally distinct democratic institutions will follow the development of capitalist economies in Asia and South America (South Korea is a transition model).

Russia should stabilize as a nation, and will probably see several peaceful changes of power. It will not be a full partner yet, with the east or west, and will have significant problems with its internal minorities, as well as with the Russian minority and nations of the "near abroad," or former Soviet states.

The European Union is still emerging as a united political and economic entity. Germany will probably dominate the European political scene. Britain's position will change little. France may find itself limited due to its economic position.

Regardless, it is important to understand the future from a regional as well as global perspective. US national and regional interests differ by region and certainly may be challenged differently within each region. Each region cannot be forced into the same one world mold without problematic or even disastrous consequences. This section seeks to preclude this problem by describing the future environment for the world's major regions.
North America North America's environment probably will be the least altered in the world. The two largest challenges to the region's prosperity and stability, Mexico's political instability and economic malaise and the Quebec separatist movement should be resolved favorably. In particular, Mexico will require a great deal of investment and quiet US and Canadian involvement over the next decade to realize reasonable growth and stability. 
69
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) should prove successful for the US, Canada, and Mexico, and will be extended south into Latin America, complementing, but not completely replacing MERCUSOR, the South American regional trade block. 
70
71
Canada's position will not change markedly, and the Quebec question should be settled without disintegration of the nation. Mexico still will be NAFTA's weak partner. However, continuing ties to the US and the gradual hispanicization of the US will strengthen Mexico. 72 There will still be emigration questions and trade disputes. There are no real security concerns, except continuing, though less rampant (due to improving economic conditions), drug trafficking from and through
Mexico.
The primary issue with Russia is security. This includes both their security and the rest of the world's as a whole, if Russia became a threat again. Russia as a global threat is unlikely, but it is possible along its border, particularly in Asia,

Distraction with great power games will only prolong the arduous change to a free market and eventual economic recovery. The long-term outlook is positive, 79 but that does not mean twenty-five years without substantial difficulty and possible confrontation.
The Russia beyond 2010 will probably occupy the same geographic position, but may have absorbed Belarus. Despite its internal focus, Russia will find itself, like the rest of the world, facing economically to the east towards the Pacific Rim and facing both east and west politically and militarily. Raw materials and energy exports from eastern Russia will link it closely with the growing China, a reunified Korea, and Japan. 80 Russia will also find itself behind China economically, which will cause tensions. However, economic selfinterest will dictate closer ties, perhaps driving Russia away from a Eurocentric focus and changing the current relationship with the US.
Europe will still be divided between east and west, and within the East it will be divided between north and south. 81 Ethnic clashes will be an increasing problem. Clashes are prevalent between Europeans and emigrants and expatriates from the Middle East and North Africa, and between east and west Europeans. The eastern North is focused on becoming part of the West's economic and security apparatus. This will be incomplete, perhaps only in its initial stages, due to uneven economic development, ethnic conflict and Russian resistance.

It is highly unlikely that the Middle East will achieve unity, regional prosperity, or collective security. This is due in large part to the lack of a representative government tradition in the region, coupled with the challenges of religious fundamentalism, and religious and cultural conflict between the Arab majority and Israel and the West.

Greater Asia will be the center of world attention. Economics and pursuit of prosperity are the primary forces linking Asian nations now as the boom continues. As security trends indicate, arms build ups will continue, but regional forums (such as the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) that has US and EU participation) and economic and political engagement provide the best chance for continued development and conflict management. Economic access to this boom region, regional stability and increased resource consumption will concern the entire world. There is cause for both confidence and concern in this region. While this section focuses on those nations with the greatest power potential, the entire Pacific and Indian ocean regions possess vast economic potential.

Defensive improvements in the Japanese Self Defense Force will maintain a limited blue-water naval capability and a first class land based air force. Maintaining a security relationship with Japan will be essential to preserving stability in the region. 110 Japan will both engage and feel challenged by China, a reunified Korea, and possibly India.
Korea will continue to be important, but not due to its present security situation. Korea will probably be reunified due to the implosion of North Korea. 111 An implosion will probably require more than three years, and will most likely involve some limited conflict on the peninsula. This will have a great impact on Asia, and on any assessment of either China and Japan. If the implosion occurs around 2000, a unified Korea, with twenty years to solidify its position, could be a substantial economic and political force by 2020.

Korea. An economically viable unified Korea can press Japan for regional and world economic influence. South Korea took 5 percent of the US car market away from the Japanese,-long term a unified Korea is capable of far more. This may result in a military resurgence in Japan, economic warfare, and potential conflict if these two regional competitors cannot reach a rapprochement. Despite the fact that both Japan and Korea have democratic traditions spanning fifty-plus years, their underlying cultural conflicts and history of hatred may prove wrong the axiom that democracies do not fight each other.

As Lord Palmerston suggests, a nation's vital interests are enduring. In fact the United States' vital interests, as will be shown, are consistent, enduring even changes in political leadership. While our interests may be invariable, the environment is not, as the preceding discussion has shown. The changing environment contests our interests in new ways, requiring change in how the ways and means are employed. How the military should change its means to meet future requirements is the crux of this thesis. However, the first step is to define our nation's enduring interests.
As stated earlier, the US will no longer be a superpower, but it is a great power with global political, economic, and security interests. While the US position will have changed, its interests will reflect those national objectives and principles that are consistent over time. Reviewing the present and former administration's security strategies (which span some sixteen years) for continuity, the following overarching interests are identified:
1. The security of the US as a free and independent nation 2. Global and regional stability that enhances US security US interests lie, and where national power--all instruments--will be used to counter challenges to them. As an example, regional hegemony is intolerable to the US in areas with critical resources, where freedom of access or navigation are impeded, or representative governments are threatened. Identification of US interests by region will assist in understanding its level of engagement in that region, and assist in determining potentials for conflict.
US interests in North America directly reflect the enduring and vital interests outlined above. Though forecasted to be successful, economic expansion will nevertheless continue to be paramount for both the US economy and general regional stability. Democracy, and in the maintenance of Mexico's democratic institutions, will also be a priority. Security focuses on maintaining the integrity of the southern US border. 
134
Interests in Eurasia and Russia focus first on security and global and regional stability. Of primary importance is preventing Russia from reemerging as a military threat while treating Russia as a major power.
American interests then center on maintaining the momentum of reform by encouraging growth in democracy, promoting and supporting economic reforms, promoting regional stability, and control of the Russian nuclear arsenal. 
135
West and the US in particular will still be engaged with Russia over future security cooperation, ensuring consultation on world affairs, and continued disputes over NATO expansion. 136
American interests in Europe pivot on maintenance of global and regional stability, prevention of regional domination, and maintenance and access to a free-market economic system. 137 American leadership is still required, and US engagement is essential to mitigating the challenges of strife in southeastern Europe.
The Middle East, due to its energy wealth, is of primary concern to the entire world. American interests in this critical region are primarily twofold. The first interest is in maintaining unimpeded access to key geographic regions and critical economic resources,-in this case the Persian Gulf and oil. Second, the US wants to ensure regional stability, prevent regional domination by a hostile power, and counter proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. These interests are linked to oil, access to the Persian Gulf, preventing Iran or Iraq from gaining control of or establishing hegemony in the region, and the security of US friends and allies. 
138
As the economic center of the world beyond 2010, the whole of Asia will be a source of US markets and competitors. US interests in this broad and varied region are comprehensive and include: protecting the US; maintaining unimpeded access; maintenance of global and regional stability; the prevention of regional domination; promotion and maintenance of a free-market economic system; developing and supporting representative governments; and countering WMD proliferation. 
139
US influence will not be maintained without physical presence in the western Pacific and Asia. Japan offers the best location strategically and from a relationship standpoint. 140 A strong US-Japan relationship must continue for this and other reasons. Former
Ambassador Mike Mansfield's conclusion.is that "The US-Japan relationship is the most important bilateral relationship in the world." 141 The NDU's Dr. Patrick M. Cronin sums up Japan's importance this way: "As Asian nations grow stronger economically, politically, and militarily, American leaders must grasp the significance of an integrated and consistent strategy toward Japan, not just for the results it can produce vis-ä-vis Japan itself, but for the impact such a policy can have on America's standing throughout the region." 142
Interests on this continent focus on stability, promotion of a free-market economic system,-and developing representative governments.

Iran and Iraq, and may also include one or more of the "Stan brothers,"
if they are able to exploit their energy reserves.
Committing US forces to a conflict requires challenges to enduring and vital US interests. While it appears certain that the US will continue to have global interests, challenges to those interests will probably not be global. Regional challenges may well result in conflict, military or otherwise, but the future synthesized in this chapter does not indicate the rise of a nation with aspirations of world hegemony. There are nations with interests in their own regions that will probably run counter to those of the United States. US interests in the future described here indicate potential conflict over regional hegemony, freedom of access and navigation, threats to representative governments, and counterproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
Regional Hegemony A regional hegemon is the most likely source of confrontation for the US military. China and Iran are the two most obvious possibilities.
China will be a de facto hegemon if only because of its size and India--due to its size, military potential (conventional and nuclear), growing economy, location, and self image as an eventual great power-is, and will be, hegemonic within South Asia, but not confrontational regarding the US. Increased wealth, coupled with a rise of Hindu nationalism, could produce a hostile and more capable hegemon. Further, nuclear weapons have helped prevent a major war for over forty years, and may have a damping effect on those nations who possess them.
National interests should determine US involvement abroad. 150
Generally, the future is bright for most of the world. Economic growth and improvement in standards of living are a key trend for a large portion of the world. Prosperity will probably fuel the demand for and emergence of various forms of representative government.
Economics will define national security in the future beyond 2010 and will drive decisions, as is the case for most of history. Economics may well be the weapon of choice in many cases. These developments will be positive. However, there will still be clashes of interests between nations, though generally confined to the regional level. History, can serve as a guide for anticipating the reaction of nations to this future. While it is not predictive of what will happen next--the historical record is not a sine wave--history can serve to help anticipate interests and potentials for conflict.
The world environment will reflect, in varying degrees, the visions of Toffler, Huntington, and Kaplan. The world will be trisected with categories of nations reflecting the manner they make wealth, and war. Differences in culture will be exacerbated by the ever shrinking world. Without changes in the missionary like zeal of the US regarding the universal applicability of western values these differences may become a fault line for conflict across political, economic and military lines, unfortunately, the first wave world of Africa will reflect Kaplan's vision of failed states, anarchy, and chaos; portions of South Asia and Latin America may as well.
Clashing interests guarantee that conflict will not go away.
However, the world will not, thankfully, provide the US with another great war to fight. What will be prevalent is a lot of "almost" wars requiring shows of force and posturing, clashes between regional powers, and perhaps clashes between regional powers and one of the great powers--most notably the United States. China possesses the greatest potential for rivalry and conflict. That said, China does not have to become an adversary; a competitor for sure, but not necessarily an adversary.
India is a distant possibility, but unlikely. Russia will be too mired in its own internal problems to realistically challenge the US. Japan should not become an adversary given continued engagement by the US and continued regional presence. Iran and the Gulf region will remain volatile.
Physical presence, not potential presence, in Europe and Asia will remain essential to maintaining "a place at the table" and to the US ability to exert leadership and influence when necessary. Presence must include ships at sea, particularly in Asia, and troops and aircraft on the ground. Only with presence does US commitment become clear.
Presence and its corresponding "place at the table" will allow the US to mitigate potential points of conflict. Presence is what will allow the US to keep China as a competitor, instead of an adversary.
Conflict will change in line with the trends covered in this chapter. What war will look like and what types of forces are required to fight it will be explored in the following chapters. However, conflict will be a reality best described as of medium intensity.
Potential competitors will have access to most of the same information based tools as the US and its Allies. Competition and conflict will most likely occur in Asia and the Middle East over hegemony, access to markets and resources, and freedom of navigation. Conflict over WMDs will be continuous, both in the shadows and in the open with diplomacy and sanctions. American forces probably will not be committed to areas where vital US interests are not challenged, particularly in Africa.
Accepting that US defense is not a growth industry, the US must narrow its focus. The current defense strategy calls for developing a capabilities-based strategy and force that may be unnecessary or perhaps insufficient. The argument goes that a great power must be able to project military force to two regions within a compressed time period.
Similar concepts resulted in the downfall or decline of several great powers that preceded the US. 
151
152
Forces must be able to deter war with one of the other great powers and win wars decisively against regional powers. Deterrence will not be genuine without decisive victory being assured against Iran or another actor. How these forces are organized, equipped and used will be discussed in the next two chapters. Regardless of what they look like they must provide a viable way to protect or achieve US interests. 
As explained in chapter 4, there are many probable challenges and several related challengers to the United States' future interests.
These challenges threaten the end state of US military strategy which is stability. Briefly, the challenges facing the US in the future environment are: regional hegemony; obstructed access to regions, markets and resources; opposition to representative governments,proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD); and regional instability. Chapter 4 identified what the challenges were, and who would precipitate them, it is important to outline how those challenges would be advanced.
Regional Hegemons
Hostile regional hegemons prevent nations from freely exercising their prerogatives in trade, security, government, and relations with other nations, both internal and external to the region. Hostile regional hegemons can destabilize a region, adversely impacting friendly governments and the regional productivity. Ocean. As previously discussed, Iran appears to be pursuing a strategy of rebuilding its basic capabilities coupled with procurement of capabilities asymmetrical to those of the US. These asymmetrical capabilities include purchase of submarines, development of WMD, and ballistic and anti-ship missile technology. Iran does not need to seek direct combat with the US to assert control over the Persian Gulf.
Denying access through the Straits of Hormuz and the eastern ports of Saudi Arabia may be sufficient to prevent successful US intervention.
This also places the region under de facto Iranian control. India, while not necessarily a hostile hegemon, sees itself as an emerging great power with direct and unassailable interests in the control of Indian Ocean. India is currently a developing economic giant with a stable democratic tradition. Substantial change in India's current Situation would be required for India to become an antagonist. That said, India possesses the world's second largest military with significant land forces, a reasonable air force, and a navy that could project control over the Indian Ocean region with increased investment.
However, increases in capability can be easily tracked.
Threats to US access to regions, markets and resources are directly linked to the most likely hostile regional hegemons, China and
Iran. China's blue-water navy is not intended to challenge US dominance of the high seas, any more than the Soviet Navy could during the Cold War,-it is intended to secure Chinese influence and dominance over those areas that are essential to Chinese interests. In this vein, China has historic, economic, and strategic interests in asserting control over the South China Sea. These sea lanes are essential to the commerce of Japan, China's primary regional economic and political rival.
Additionally, given China's status as a net energy importer, the potential energy reserves in this area may be essential to China's continued economic development. Control of those resources only improve China's relative economic and security positions. Finally, this region is seen by China as its area of influence. As China continues to assert itself as a great power, these image issues will become more important.
Another area for concern is China's involvement with Burma. Control of the approaches to the Straits of Malacca from bases in the vicinity of the Bay of Bengal, coupled with hegemony in the South China sea, would place China in a position to influence about half the world's trade, and place a stranglehold on the whole of Asia.
Iran, as previously discussed, sees itself surrounded by enemies.
It is improving a growing military capability. 
2
As discussed in chapter 4, "nuclear club" membership will increase. A nation holding nuclear weapons is not in and of itself a direct threat to the US, anymore than a regional hegemon may be.
Rather, nations with that capability and with interests in contradiction to those of the US are a threat. Despite current efforts to end the production of chemical weapons, it seems unlikely that success will follow. They are the poor man's equalizer and are easily produced and concealed as both Libya and Iraq have shown. A primary threat to US interests in the proliferation of WMD will be Iran. Where China and India have the mass--the first and second largest armies in the world, growing economies, etc.--to confront US power within their spheres of influence, Iran does not. Weapons of mass destruction are part of a visible trend in Iran's development of asymmetrical capabilities. China will continue to refine its nuclear capability.

Treaty. Being denied this tool of the great powers directly contradicts India's aspiration to be a great power.
Regional stability is the goal of US deterrence. Stability allows economic growth to flourish. Europe, Asia, and recently large portions of Latin America, show the fruits of stability in those regions. It is no accident that the majority of US trade is linked to those three regions. 5 US regional presence has been a key component in achieving the stable environment so essential to the growth and opportunity prevalent in or growing in those regions.
Instability is destructive to economic growth and economic and social justice. The degeneration of Zaire and Nigeria, two mineral rich nations with great economic potential, clearly illustrate this point.
To a great extent, regional instability will be a by product of any confrontation between the US and China, Iran, and perhaps India. This fact alone may provide the necessary mitigating factor in possible confrontation between the US and China or the US and India. Both China and India are benefiting from economic development that is the product of stability in their regions. Neither is likely to abandon impulsively the obvious benefits of economic growth predicated on stability. Iran, however, is a different case. Iran is not benefiting from an economic surge, and its isolation may embolden it to take destabilizing actions.
The other threat to regional stability in the Gulf and the Middle East is the threat of radical Islamic fundamentalism. The overthrow or threat of overthrow of a friendly Middle Eastern nation threatens US influence and interests in the region. An intelligent presence, attuned to the social and political realities of the area, may be required.
Additionally, depending on the nation involved, US involvement may extend beyond advice, support and assistance. A step such as this should be tempered with the experience of the US with Iran in the late 1970s.
China, India, and Iran occupy regions where the US has vital interests, and US action is probable in restoring stability. Africa is not such a region. Africa is a region where instability is prevalent and likely to continue. The US is unlikely to become involved, and unless a vital interest develops and becomes threatened, the US probably should not become involved. The national will is not present to support the kind of long term military involvement required to settle the many historic disputes that characterize conflict in Africa. It appears that a series of African solutions--some emerging from the end of the gun as with Executive Outcomes, along with regional forums, and sadly civil war--may provide the most realistic answers to these intractable solutions.
The thread of continuity in Europe, Asia, and Latin America has been a reasonable US presence and active US involvement. Those regions have experienced reasonable stability for between twenty and fifty years and economic growth and trade have followed. As stated in the conclusion of chapter 4, presence equates to commitment in the eyes of allies and observers in a region. Presence is costly, and the trend is to scale it back. However, given the national economic benefits of trade in stable regions, it is a wise continued investment. As an old UN slogan says, "If you think peace is expensive, try war." In this case while presence is costly, the costs of instability far outweigh the costs of maintaining presence.
China has the greatest potential for clashing interests with the US and the greatest likelihood of developing the forces required to back up their competing interests. That is not to say that war with China is inevitable. However, it is to say that deterrence will be required.
The bulk of China's armed forces will still be oriented at maintaining internal stability and will possess only limited objective force projection capabilities. Just beyond 2010, China will possess land forces with about seventy divisions, twenty of which will be equivalent in capability to the US forces of Desert Storm. China's navy probably will be hegemonic over the South China Sea and perhaps the Straits of Malacca. This navy will have limited expeditionary capabilities and have no more than three carrier battle group equivalents.

However, overestimating the power of economic engagement while underestimating the utility of military power in this relationship could be disastrous.
Iran's modernization program appears to focus on two axes. The first axis is the rebuilding of its conventional force, devastated by the eight year war with Iraq. This first approach should not necessarily be viewed with alarm. Iran's armed forces are probably below the levels they need to be for control and defense of its own territory. The same cannot be said for the Iranian's second direction India's army is the second largest in world. This army is currently oriented primarily on internal security operations and operations along the Pakistani border. Given the geography of the area, it is doubtful that India will develop a force projection land force beyond improving its capabilities regarding Pakistan. The naval picture is not as promising. Currently, India's navy is only about fifty percent operational and capabilities for blue-water operations are limited.

V.' hegemonic in terms of its neighbors in the region. An increased naval capability would clearly be oriented on controlling access to the Indian Ocean. Perceiving itself as a great power, India sees the Indian Ocean as being under its purview. Chinese naval activity in and around the Bay of Bengal may spur this on. The US task is to maintain deterrent capabilities that prevent India from extending control over the Indian Ocean.
Russia, despite its present problems, severe as they may be, still bears watching. Its military equipment is still considered to be top rate, and its nuclear forces are substantial. While it is unlikely that Russia's conventional forces will recover from their present slump in the near term, their quantity still bears consideration. Additionally, the nuclear threat is still an issue regardless of where the missiles are currently pointed. The US deterrent focus should be on first maintaining a credible nuclear retaliation threat. Fifty years without a "hot" major power war attests to the advisability of continuing this strategy. Second, US forces should be able to discourage substantial Russian operations in major former Soviet states such as Ukraine, the Baltic, and Georgia. Third, there must be a credible deterrent to Russian pressure against the former Warsaw Pact countries.
Regional instability is most likely the product of transitional regions such as Africa, where a US military presence is not attendant and US interests are not substantially threatened. A failure to maintain presence in those areas of Europe, Asia, and the Middle East where US interests are high will likely result in instability. The future force will have to be applied judiciously to promote and protect vital US interests. Lengthy deployments of US forces to restore stability to regions where US interests are not clearly threatened will only detract from the overall deterrent and warfighting capability of a leaner future force.
The Military Environment of 2010 to 2020
From the previous review of potential competitors and their general capabilities, it can be seen that US force requirements can be focused through strategy, rather than the current capability based approach. The threat may appear to be more diffused than during the Cold War, but in fact it will be probably no less diffused in the future as it was then. During the Cold War the target of military deterrence was clearly the USSR, and to a lesser extent China, but the scope of US involvement spanned the entire spectrum of conflict short of global war.
The Korean War was what is now referred to as a major theater war (MTW).
Vietnam could be characterized as an operation other than war (OOTW).
Afghanistan, El Salvador, and Panama also fall into the realm of OOTW.
Desert Shield/Desert Storm was a MTW. Likewise, the threats outlined in the preceding paragraphs and in chapter 4 will generally reflect these same conflict environments. Despite Martin van Creveld's contention in
The Transformation of War that low intensity conflict will become preeminent over all others, it is unlikely that one war form will overshadow the others where the US is concerned. The conflict environment will probably reflect all the various forms previously and currently executed by the US, covering the spectrum of conflict from peacekeeping, peace enforcement, and perhaps even counter insurgency, to major theater wars similar in scope to Desert Storm. Due to efficiency 96 w> and effectiveness requirements, an MTW focus is necessary. Forces can transition from a combat to a noncombat focus, but moving the other way is very difficult. However, while the US military will continue to face a conflict environment that spans the spectrum of conflict up through MTW, the components of that spectrum and the ways of war may be quite different. These components and ways are briefly outlined below.
The military forces that will confront the US will have many of the same capabilities currently the exclusive possession of US and allied forces. Night vision equipment, satellite communications, global positioning system access and exploitation, precision guided missiles and munitions, stealth technology, and satellite and UAV imagery will be common. These realities will require the US to fight smarter, and develop countermeasures to these capabilities. Some observers have characterized this trend as a prelude to the death of the platform. A primary product of IW is best captured in the concept of dominant battle space knowledge (DBK). Dominant battle space knowledge presupposes that US commanders at all levels will possess a common picture of the battlefield where the location and type of every enemy and friendly unit will be known, and enemy moves will no longer be a surprise. The Friedmans postulate that advances in multispectral technology will make it impossible for war machines to exist without

Antiship cruise missiles are a subset of LRPS which complicates littoral naval operations. Currently, shore radar and acquisition systems often dictate that naval and amphibious forces operate, at a minimum, over the horizon (beyond the curve of the earth). Coupled with unimpeded access to GPS signals and commercial satellite imagery, coastal nations will be able to detect and engage naval forces even operating over the horizon. This will complicate naval operations against shore and inland targets due to extended ranges--in excess of two-hundred miles.
Mine warfare is old, and yet new again. In 1915, the British Navy was turned back from running the Dardenelles, not by the numerous Turkish forts and gun emplacements, but by a single minefield that went The new developments in naval mine warfare include non-metallic bottom laid and sensor-fused mines that are passive until activated by a ships noise or electrical fields. Just as the British Navy lost ships in close to shore over eighty years ago, these new more sophisticated mines will slow decisive naval operations in the littoral area as well.
Additionally, clearing operations will become more difficult due to the difficulty in locating the mines.
The improvements in diesel-electric submarine technology have resulted in boats that are quieter, with longer range and greater capabilities than previous generations. These boats can lie along probable sea lane approaches, lay mines, target merchant vessels carrying force projection equipment or supplies, or go after prize naval targets such as an aircraft carrier. These systems are not impossible to detect and destroy, but their substantial improvement in capability adds a threat to the naval equation not previously a significant factor in regional conflict. Desert Storm operation was a force projection operation. The reduction in scale of force commitments overseas will require a greater percentage of forces from CONUS, and the speed at which events move will require that they move decisively and often be committed to combat immediately upon arrival. Alliances, regional access to ports and airfields, prepositioned equipment sets, both sea and air strategic lift, and the capability to put forces into a theater without ports (joint logistics over the shore (JLOTS)) will be the tools that allow US forces to be decisively deployed into a theater.
Recent and current operations point to a blurring of the strategic, operational and tactical levels of war. The distinctions between these levels began to merge as far back as World War II, in part due to the increasing depth of what were previously tactical operations. 
21
Information and depth are blurring these lines to the point where the levels of war can be seen as concentric or interlocking spheres of responsibility (see figure 
1
Desert Storm was a precursor to the blurring of the distinctions of service operations and operational dimensions. 
The rapid growth of areas such as Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, Mexico City, Seoul Korea, and coastal cities in China indicate a high probability of urban combat for any land force. Complex terrain may be unavoidable and will require soldiers to fight in it. 
23
Warfare was once spoken of in two dimensions, the depth and breadth of the battlefield. With the advent of air warfare, and now aerospace warfare, the operational dimension has increased to three, the depth, breadth and height of the battle space. In fact it is this change that coined the characterization battle space. The importance of the electromagnetic spectrum added a fourth dimension, which is increasing in importance with the explosion of information age capabilities. With the addition of information technology and its associated concepts of dominant battle space knowledge and information dominance a fifth dimension is added, that of time. The ability to process information and cut the detection to engagement time frame,

The emerging realities of the future conflict environment will impact any force operating in the early decades of the twenty-first century. Some may make current organizations and ways of war less relevant or perhaps obsolete. Others will only make war more lethal and complex.
It is these changes that many observers and students of the military, strategy and operational art have seized on in promoting their prescriptions for change going into the twenty-first century. Likewise, these challenges and environmental realities figure heavily in the design of the EMA and RMA forces to be described in the next chapter.
CHAPTER 6
We must hold our minds alert and receptive to the application of unglimpsed methods and weapons. The next war will be won in the future, not in the past. We must go on, or we will go under. be wholly an organizational effectiveness approach to maintaining strategic dominance. 
12
A business analogy provides an appropriate explanation of how these three factors--effectiveness, efficiency and obsolescence avoidance--tie together into a coherent future defense strategy. The US government and the Nation's taxpayers can be seen as stockholders in their armed forces. Potential enemies and competitors are the customers. The product of the armed forces is deterrence. The dividend to the stockholder is stability which allows the US to pursue its interests unfettered of threats. Wealth and capital follow stability, economic production flourishes and all nations benefit--particularly the United States. As long as the US Military produces a brand of deterrence that others will "buy," then stability is maintained and national interests and growth are protected. However, perfect stability in and of itself cannot be the exclusive concern of a US strategy. A balance must be struck. Should efficiency, effectiveness, and obsolescence avoidance (maintaining relevance) fall out of balance the nation will not have the wherewithal to pursue its interests, due to inefficiency, or deterrence fails due to ineffectiveness or obsolescence. The issue is to ensure that the armed forces are capable enough to deter or if necessary defeat challengers to US interests, but at a cost acceptable to the country as a whole. Put another way, the US Armed Forces must avoid the fate that befell large, dominant corporations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Xerox, IBM, and AT&T all found themselves struggling for relevance in a changing strategic environment. 
13
14
As Joint Vision 2010 states clearly, the primary mission of the US Armed Forces is to deter conflict or fight and win the nations wars.
In that regard the first requirement of the Armed Forces is to deter conflict with China, Iran, and perhaps India. Stability is an economically and politically beneficial product.
A joint US presence in Europe, Asia, and Latin America has been a substantial contributor to stability and the corresponding growth and development experienced there. Given the importance of trade in all three of those regions, US presence, in some visible and permanent manner, must be maintained. Force types, size and support arrangements can change based on modifications to the US military and the regional economic and force balance, but in order to have a "seat at the table," commitment must be seen through physical presence.
Whatever the force design, these broad requirements must be met in order to promote and defend US interests in the future environment.
Failure to link capabilities to these requirements will incur substantial risk. How EMA and RMA forces could be designed is based on the discussion of change in chapter 2, the future environment described in chapter 4, the military environment described in chapter 5, and the requirements outlined above. One reasonable and possible approach to these forces, accounting for these factors, follows.
As touched on in chapter 2, the apparently evolutionary vision of the future US military is described in a series of joint and service Dimensional Protection and Focused Logistics. The synergy of these concepts will allow US forces to achieve Full Spectrum Dominance-deterrence in peace, dominance in war across the spectrum of conflict.
Information Superiority and Technological Innovation are the key enablers of all of these concepts. 
20
21
Precision Engagement is a system of systems that enables our forces to locate targets, respond, generate effects, assess, and reengage as required. This concept is tied to the success of information dominance.
Full Dimensional Protection is essential to preventing disruption of these new operational concepts. Control of the battle space is the primary prerequisite, and must be achieved prior to the execution of decisive operations. Information superiority is a key enabler of this concept as well, focusing on the identification of all forces on the battlefield. Other enabling concepts include dispersal of forces, enhanced deception, and improved protective equipment and sensors.
Focused Logistics fuses information, logistics, and transportation technologies to provide rapid response and deliver tailored sustainment packages directly to the theater, and below. The impact of this concept will be a smaller, more capable deployed force, requiring less continuous support and having a smaller logistics footprint.
This vision provides the foundation on which the services may build their 2 010 visions. It studiously avoids future strategic issues, nor is it linked to a future national security strategy. 
23
Current Secretary of the Air Force Sheila E. Windall's remarks on her own service's vision are perhaps instructive to specificity. She states that "We need to build an actionable vision. We needed to go beyond lofty statements of intent, to outline a vision specific enough for action, and specific enough so that we could lay out pathways to take us toward our goals." 25 It is not entirely clear that Joint Vision 2010 achieves this level of clarity. However, it does provide a focus on deterring and winning war, which this vision maintains will provide the forces capable of achieving full spectrum dominance. Given this emphasis on war, this thesis will focus on warfighting as well.
Presumably, the US political leadership also has embraced this focus.
Army Vision 2010 provides a visualization of concepts and technologies that will improve capabilities circa 2010. The key phrase is to improve capabilities, since the Army's vision is a conception of organizational effectiveness. The Army vision appears to be a linking of the existing Army XXI program and documents to Joint Vision 2010.
Indeed, the Army After Next project, the Army's current means of looking beyond 2010 is the link to the so called revolution in military affairs.

Army vision 2010 focuses on the operational level of warfare and promotes landpower as the decisive dimension in warfare. The Army vision also addresses indirectly the limitations of landpower, and the need for a balanced approach to future military operations that takes advantage of the many unique contributions that each service brings to the operational environment. This hedging strategy is based on history and a desire to be capable in an undetermined military environment.
That approach may have merit. The Army is a beneficiary of the capabilities of the other services within the Joint Vision context, and does not position itself as the primary service that can realize the full potential of Joint Vision 2010; it is a team effort.
The Air Force's vision, Global Engagement, takes an approach different from the Army's when describing its role in realizing the mean to the nation--the ability to hit an adversary's strategic centers of gravity directly as well as prevail at the operational and tactical levels of warfare." 
35

45
Capabilities not executed to that standard or not essential to the product of the company are outsourced or eliminated. The Air Force's focus is bifurcated between air and space superiority and mobility.
Redirection of the air mobility competency to another agency or activity within DoD would remove this distraction from aerospace superiority, the USAF's most critical focus.
Precision engagement is more than merely targeting and killing the enemy with high probabilities of success, though this is a substantial portion of the Air Force contribution. "The Air Force's core competency of Precision Engagement is grounded in Joint Vision 2010's definition." 
47
52
The bureaucratic approach, with each service competing for power and position is not reflective of the military as an organization. The Space dominance from a weapons and defense perspective would still remain with the Air Force, redesignated the Aerospace Force. This ensures a balanced approach to space assets.
Intelligence is the provision of dominant battlefield knowledge to the commander, coupled with analysis of capabilities and intentions.
The variety of organizations involved in this process requires an "army" of experts to descend on a command when these products are required. This leaner force structure would consist of eight active divisions under three corps equivalents. Given the increased lethality of the modern battlefield, mobility will be key. Due to this reality, all forces will be mobile by ground or air. Six divisions will be heavy and two will be airborne and air assault capable. Each division will consist of three all arms brigade groups, commanded by a brigadier general and capable of sustained independent operations. Macgregor postulates a close fight assistant corps commander in lieu of a division command structure. 
75
76
The key here is that there are no corps headquarters without troops, as is the case with I Corps at Fort Lewis today, nor any posts commanded by general headquarters not tied to warfighting. The Army reorganization would be total, eliminating unnecessary layers of staff and dismantling structures that are leftover from the Cold War. These While maneuver brigade strength is reduced from the current thirty-two to twenty-four (three per each of eight divisions), each of the twenty-four brigade groups is a fully capable, all arms organization. The lethality of the organic organization, coupled with its links to joint force capabilities through the C4I battalion (see figure 
2
This land force is large, much larger than many would think necessary in this age of information and long-range precision strike. The reduction in air wings is not substantial when compared to the base force proposal of fifteen active and eleven reserve wings, or any of the more restrictive proposals made by Les Aspin. 
83
proposal is over a one third reduction from the 1991 level of twenty-two and twelve; however, given anticipated increases in the capability of precision munitions and information superiority, this force will be more capable. Using Iraq's 1994 feint against Kuwait, Paul Braken postulates that given PGMs with a fifty percent kill probability half of Iraq's 1,700 armored vehicles could have been destroyed by two-hundred aircraft flying two sorties on one day. 
84
This aerospace organization provides a focused aerospace superiority force that is functional and tailored to conduct decisive air and space operations for the joint commander. The AEW organization provides a multi-role element that provides a joint commander with a full range of air and space operations. It is uniquely organized to conduct global attack, and provides the wing commander with all the assets to be a JTF joint force air component commander (JFACC). It does not depend on ad hoc organizations to achieve superiority within the third dimension.
Whether the US is in fact a maritime nation, as Forward . ,-, From the Sea contends, or not, the sea provides three important capabilities that the US must maintain. These capabilities are: the passage of commerce; the passage of military force in support of diplomacy or land, sea or air warfare; and the exploitation of resources. The uniqueness of this approach is that the Marines can deploy and immediately begin realizing true precision strike capabilities for the joint force commander.
The Marines would reorganize along the concept of British Special Air Service units. Battalion landing teams start from a four man cell designated as a team; two teams make a squad, six a platoon, twenty-four a company, and so on. This organization would allow four man teams to be flown in by V22 from extreme over the horizon distances, land with sensor and weapon laden all terrain fast attack vehicles, and conduct mobile reconnaissance and target acquisition in support of forced entry operations, precision strike, and denial operations. These teams when combined into larger formations as described above would conduct raids and key facility seizures in support of forced entry operations, deploying from converted Trident submarines, or by air or LCAC from over the horizon. This force is where the transition to the force after next begins. Marine armor and artillery would be discarded. Marine air (fixed and rotary wing) would remain, as would LAVs and amphibious assault vehicles (or equivalents). The air capability is essential to insertion support and fire support capability.
Marine deployments would be based not on routine float schedules, but on a deliberate analysis of potential problem areas, and locations requiring off shore US presence. 
91
A Special Operations Force for 2010 and Beyond Special Operations Forces (SOF) will become an accession service drawing from the functional force CINCs (Land, Aerospace, and Naval) and the Marines for troops to become special operations forces. The Marines would be a part of USSOCOM, essentially as maritime Rangers, though larger in number due to MEU(SOC) float requirements. SOF must provide forces that are capable of augmenting space and UAV acquisition to make LRPS a reality. These forces would also be essential to peacetime engagement military to military contact operations, OOTW, and support of counterinsurgency operations.
While the organization and roles of the forces described above reflect a radical evolutionary approach, these organizations cannot realize their capabilities without changes in equipment. Each service has its own current modernization priorities, all of which are not essential to this suggested path to future dominance. Likewise, some of these programs may hinder the military's ability to meet future requirements. Some priorities for equipment and technology exploitation that would assist in realizing the capabilities of the EMA force are described below.
Land Forces require several significant technological fixes. Land Aerospace forces will need a new aircraft, but the aviation community, aerospace and naval, do not require two or more systems. The F15 is touted as superior to the upcoming Euro-fighter and Russian systems. 
93
Naval forces must develop a stealth arsenal ship and the refit of existing Trident submarines is the most cost effective and survivable option available. Surface stealth costs money and may be defeatable, US submarine technology is still unchallenged. 
4
Defense Intelligence Command must fuse all source intelligence systems into a pull based information superiority system that allows the commander to designate the questions that need answering, and the system pulls the answers to him. Secondly, an information warfare service, probably in the main civilian, should be established to conduct strategic and operational offensive information strikes against any foe.
This includes attacks on civilian and military infrastructure, C4I, space and service systems.
LOGCOM must develop and procure more strategic lift assets. The service will be more tied to force projection due to decreased size of forces forward deployed. Shipping will still be a requirement, even with lighter Land Force MBTs and IFVs. In order to be decisive, ship speeds must increase to forty knots and space must increase. Shipping lagged twenty-three days behind during Desert Shield, ships averaged between fifteen and twenty-three knots, and units, Army and Marine closed between nine and twenty-five days behind schedule. 
95
sets should be increased to two division equivalents in both the Pacific and the Indian Ocean regions with a joint logistics over the shore (JLOTS) capability so that forces can deploy directly off the ships onto a beach. In this concept, forces would fly to and marry up with MPS in Guam or Diego Garcia, convoy to the contingency area, upload and prepare all equipment enroute, and deploy over a beach secured by the Marines and an airborne-air assault division or group, directly into combat.
SPACECOM must have expendable, short use, backfill satellites for navigation, communications and intelligence. These low earth orbit systems would be sent up to meet theater requirements for specific periods of time when the enemy has interdicted or destroyed a similar permanent system.
Given the changes in organization as discussed above, and Hawaii. This is key; for as important as Japan will remain to US interests and security in Asia, given China's rise it would be unwise to station such key assets in a nation that can be directly threatened by China. The consequences could be the inability to operate forces from Japan depending on the dispute with China. Forward-deployed land force locations would be subject to the same calculus. If the host nation was hazarded by a US presence or was uncomfortable with US forces deploying from its territory into a conflict area, then the forward location would need to be moved.
In addition to the three forward-deployed divisions, CONUS forces would be configured for rapid and decisive deployment. The two division MPS sets stationed at Diego Garcia and Guam would allow CONUS divisions to fly to these locations, well out of harms way, board ship, upload and prepare enroute, and deploy from ship into combat. This could be from either a friendly port or across a beach area seized by the actions of a Marine limited objective attack and forced entry airborne-air assault brigade groups or division operations. These initial entry forces could seize the initiative by deploying to a reinforce a friendly nation prior to hostilities to deter conflict,, or move directly into combat.
Likewise, the remaining CONUS based or forward deployed land forces could load on fast sealift and be present in about thirty days. This method would provide a five-division Land Force component in theater well under the currently planned seventy-five days.
Aerospace Forces would be generally CONUS based. Two of these multifunctional forces would be capable of immediate employment, even while deploying, through the exploitation of the concept of global attack. Once an enemy force challenged a US interest important enough to warrant an act of war, the AEWs would launch their bomber components to begin LRPS in conjunction with naval forces in the area to seize the offensive and the strategic initiative. Even as aircraft were being alerted to move ground divisions to the MPS port of embarkation, the enemy would be under attack due to Aerospace global attack capabilities.
As previously stated, Naval Forces would generally be CONUS based, yet with the number of destroyers, cruisers, and frigates larger than what is required for CVBG operations (see figure 
5
2
While this force would be fully capable of operating independently of coalition support, this would not be a desired method of operation.
In some cases, as with the previous China example, it may become necessary for the US to act unilaterally in a multipolar world of diffused power. However, independent operations would be more costly, in terms of both dollars and regional relations. This force, with its improved information operations capacity and ground, sea, and air capabilities, would be positioned to provide the lead as in the past and be a full and equal partner in combat. A sense of shared hardship is always important to wartime leadership and credibility as an alliance member.
As stated earlier, proposing change to a thoroughly entrenched organization is daunting, and reception is rarely positive. Due to the operational focus of JV 2010, and the conventional organizational approaches suggested by the service visions, the EMA force required a great deal of analysis in order to justify its existence, so to speak.
Failure to provide detailed analysis and justification allows for the proposal to be more readily dismissed out of hand. As proposed, this force could accomplish several different things. The focus on functional capabilities tied to a strategic vision could reduce structure and free funding for necessary modernization. This organization could establish true force projection capabilities.
However, perhaps most importantly, this proposed path to future strategic dominance could begin changing the organization so that it can exploit change instead of just making it an add on.
Many of the authors referred to in the review of prescriptions for change advocate some form of precision strike warfare as the right and correct application of the information revolution. Edward Luttwak supposes that war from afar is a more usable instrument of national power.
In order to achieve this notion of a more usable instrument of military power, Richard Perle recommends the US cut the personnel accounts and move rapidly down the path towards a precision strike based military force. He states that "If we are smart about smart weapons and take only smart weapons with us when we contemplate fighting a long way from home, the vexing problem of affording enough air-and sealift will become much more manageable." 
99
100
This RMA military strategy and force structure relies on the continued development and rapid attainment of information dominance coupled with improving long-range and precision strike capabilities.
This approach presupposes inadequate countermeasures to the ability to find, fix, or track and target anything that moves on the surface of the earth. This defense strategy would radically alter DoD and the American way of war. This approach would also require substantial reductions in manpower to fund required systems. 
102
In some cases an exclusively air based campaign cannot be waged and a surface component may be required. One instance might be a target country's proximity to hostile nations is such that overflight is impossible. Another situation deals with requirements for deterrence through some sort of regional presence.
A 
The precision strike force, using Luttwak's calculus, would be the more utilitarian force in the service of US national security interests. This is due to the inherently removed nature of its employment and the likelihood of minimum casualties. In following his reasoning, the US would be better able to shape the world and support and defend its interests through the threat or use of force. The leadership would be unencumbered by considerations of US casualties. This notion of a more useable force would provide deterrence through an understanding by potential rivals that this precision strike capability would be devastating and its use was not constrained by the possibility of US casualties.
The RMA force's capabilities would also be generally CONUS based, except for some of the naval component and perhaps two brigade groups, one each in Europe and Asia. This token regional presence may still be required, even in this new age of warfare, as allies will still equate presence with commitment (some paradigms will just be harder to break 
This chapter has established forces that reflect the vision of their advocates, the impact of history, technology, the probable future strategic environment, and to a degree the judgment of the author.
These forces provide one possible path to the future for each concept.
These constructions provide viable, capable forces that can deploy and mass power in response to challenges to the nation. Which concept is most relevant in the future environment will be determined by assessing these forces' organizations and operational concepts for utility in the following chapter. The RMA force can provide similar effects, but seemingly at lower costs in terms of US lives and political capital. Global attack capabilities truly realized in sensor-fused, satellite-linked and fully capitalized AEW could fully accomplish Luttwak's notion of war from afar. Arsenal ships and submarines, linked to satellite acquisition systems may provide deterrent capability against Chinese or Indian naval hegemony. Demonstration of this capability up front will be essential to the initial credibility of this new naval system. What is unclear is the ability of this force to impose its will on an opponent in a manner that is both effective and tenable. The impact of airpower in the Gulf was significant, but it did not force Iraq to capitulate anymore than the fire bombing of Dresden forced German capitulation in World War II.
While the capabilities of an RMA force are in no way as crude as the two examples cited above, the capabilities of this force look to produce s imi1ar out come s.
On the face of it, both forces seem viable. Providing that Luttwak's assertion that LRPS is the more usable warform proves correct, then an RMA force or a similar capability should be the path that DoD should follow. However, more so than EMA advocates, RMA force proponents do not link the LRPS approach to a future environment, probable opponent capabilities, cultural makeup and interests or US strategic requirements. Without this important link and assessment, neither force can claim preeminence. The analysis to follow in the next chapter seeks to resolve this issue.
CHAPTER 7
If there is one attitude more dangerous than to assume that a future war will be just like the last one, it is to imagine that it will be so utterly different that we can afford to ignore all the lessons of the last one. 
1
The two forces outlined in chapter 6 must meet the requirements of the nation and its interests beyond 2010 to be of any utility whatsoever. Capabilities that do not obviate the capabilities of potential challengers to the US are a waste of money and effort. It is this apparent failure that diminishes Joint Vision 2010: the vision describes concepts and capabilities, but does not link them to a strategy or set of potential challengers. The same can be said about those who advocate a precision strike based military. If these great capabilities fail to deter an opponent, or prove to be marginally applicable or even irrelevant to the type of warfare being waged, then they too are a waste of funding and effort. The purpose of this chapter is to examine this issue in order to determine which force design is more applicable to the future environment given the probable challenges and challengers to US interests.
To accomplish this examination, the threat must be defined, Likewise the criteria for evaluation must be defined. From these first two steps, the two forces can be evaluated against the opposite ends of the probable spectrum of conflict, a regional near-peer competitor and a non peer competitor operating in a low intensity or OOTW environment.
Forces and equipment that are generally effective or have value in both conflict situations would provide full-spectrum utility and contribute significantly to full-spectrum dominance. 
2
There are four general categories of military competitors discussed in the strategic literature. These categories are: the peer competitor, the regional competitor, a niche competitor, and a non peer competitor. There are generally accepted definitions linked to each of these categories, but there are also important nuances of difference depending on the author. Some categorize potential competitors by technology, some by strategy, some in combination. 
3
Peer Competitor. A peer is a nation, or perhaps an alliance, with the economic, political, and military power to challenge the US globally, using armed forces as advanced but not necessarily the same as those of the US. 
4
The Soviet political system in the 1950s and 1960s had an attraction for many nonaligned nations, but through the 1970s and into the 1980s, the Soviet brand of communism became bankrupt. Its military power, composed of an eventually unsustainable conventional military and its nuclear forces, gave the USSR its most visible claim to great power or superpower status. However, the USSR was never able to realistically challenge the US on the high seas, and its economic power was always suspect. This lengthy discussion of the USSR demonstrates how difficult, at this point in history, it is for a nation to achieve peer competitor status against the US. This difficulty should reinforce the proposition that a peer competitor rising up in the next fifteen to twenty years is highly unlikely.
Regional Competitor. A regional competitor, also referred to as a regional hegemon, is a nation that is hegemonic within a region and possesses sufficient power to realistically challenge the US, in symmetrical and asymmetrical ways and perhaps deny US interests within its own region. 
5
Niche Competitor. A niche competitor is a state or perhaps a nonstate actor that exploits one or more sources and instruments of power in a manner that is equal to or better than the capabilities of the US. 
6
The counter-air and counter-naval systems prevent both sea and air global attack systems from moving within striking distance, and the WMD capability would intimidate neighboring states sufficiently to prevent the US from establishing a foothold in the region. Terrorism is another possible form of niche competition.
Non Peer Competitor. This category covers nations or nonstate actors that challenge US interests, but do not possess a capacity for conflict with the US. A guerrilla war waged against a government friendly to the US is one example, particularly if the guerrilla movement is sponsored by a regional competitor. Cuba is another example of a non peer competitor. Cuba has neither the military, political, or economic wherewithal to challenge the US, but does so anyway. In this case, the power of information--the romantic notions of Castro and the revolution and the hesitation of the US to want to regain the mantle of Yankee imperialist -as much as anything else, prevents the US from taking any direct action against the regime.
The assessment of the future environment provided in chapters 4
and 5 suggests that a peer competitor is highly unlikely over the next fifteen years. Russia is in a slump it probably cannot recover from and time is insufficient for China to modernize its forces adequately to compete with the US globally. However, the possibility of regional near-peer to non peer competition appears likely. China demonstrates the best set of indications that it will become a regional near-peer competitor, with its growing wealth, recent history of being slighted, and expanding interests that often run counter to those of the US.
Those interests which clash with those of the US include navigation of the South China Sea and associated choke points, a free Taiwan, a democratic and stable Korea, and access to oil. In the out years towards 2020, China may transition to a near-peer competitor. Iran also demonstrates many of the traits expected of a regional competitor, and its present defense programs indicate a development of niche or asymmetrical capabilities. Iran challenges several US interests which include freedom of navigation throughout the Persian Gulf, access to oil from the region, and the stability and political viability of Iran's Gulf neighbors. It is unlikely that Iran will look to challenge the US in a direct symmetrical confrontation, but Iran does look to confound US interests in the Gulf region.
Other possible challengers include India, the possibility of regional instability or the disintegration of states important to the US. India may develop naval capabilities similar to US capabilities normally present in the Indian Ocean. Depending on China's actions, this navy may be more oriented on deterring and countering Chinese naval presence than on countering a US presence. Given the historical record, regional or state instability, particularly in terms of radical Islamic fundamentalism and the destabilization of friendly nations, is a difficult challenge for the US.
China is the most likely near-term regional or near T peer competitor the US will encounter. As stated in chapter 4, this challenge does not necessarily have to result in conflict, but caution is always warranted when dealing with the world's largest army. This is particularly true considering that they will very likely have seventy divisions, twenty of which are Desert Storm equivalents, a limited objective blue-water navy that can operate without concern for allies in the region, and regional power projection capabilities. With Japan and Korea being so close to China the US does not have the luxury of operating without regard to allies in this region.
Iran is the most likely threat to be encountered and the challenge will be to discover how much the Iranians learned from observing the Gulf War. If they draw half as many lessons from this experience as Indian General V. K. Nair did in watching it on television, then port, airfield, and sea lines of communication security will be very difficult. The rising internal opposition to those Gulf governments friendly to the US is another possible form of niche warfare the US may have to contend with in regards to Iran.
India's naval potential is not so much a probable point of war but a note of caution that must be taken into account when developing capabilities for the US armed forces. A routine and credible presence of US naval power in the Indian Ocean, probably incorporated with Persian Gulf operations, could well be sufficient to mitigate any direct challenge from India.
Asian corporations may well mitigate a confrontation between China and the US. This only enhances the mitigating potential derived from the fact that China and the US both possess nuclear weapons. Iran, on the other hand, is not is this category on either economic count today and nuclear weapons are unlikely, but not impossible in the future.
There is a high probability of conflicting interests between the US and China and the US and Iran. These conflicts may or may not lead to armed confrontation. However, the likelihood of conflict suggests a need for sufficient military capability to deter armed confrontation and compel these nations, and others, to adhere to internationally accepted standards of behavior and not take actions prejudicial to US interests.
An assessment of the EMA and RMA forces to provide just that sort of capability follows.
Warfighting is the most important capability the US armed forces can possess. The military can provide substantial capability in humanitarian actions, peacekeeping, and the like, but as the military instrument of a great power, fighting and winning wars must be an unquestioned capability. The application of the military instrument of power in war reflects the nation's commitment to the defense of a vital interest in the face of exhausted or untenable alternatives. There is little room for failure at that juncture. The strategy of the US has depended on this capability throughout history, and the service members who volunteer to do the nation's bidding deserve that this be the primary focus of the military. The focus outlined in Joint Vision 2010 and the current national security strategy supports this assertion as well. 
7
This section will provide an overview of how each force would operate in the future environment. Further, both forces will be assessed for effectiveness against deterrence, compellence, and decisive victory in dealing with these two possible levels of conflict. This assessment of effectiveness will be made with consideration to the principles of war and the operational concepts described in Joint Vision 2010. The desired outcome is to determine which force type provides the nation with the better opportunity for full-spectrum dominance.
The following provides a brief definition of the criteria used for assessing the two forces' utility. Deterrence is discouraging attack against the US and its allies through the maintenance of sufficient military power and an understood will to use that capability to defend US interests. Compellence is the ability of the US to cause other nations to conform to accepted behavior or take actions favorable to the US without force of arms, but backed up by the elements of deterrence.
Decisive victory is the rapid termination of a conflict on terms favorable to the US, with minimum US casualties and a decreased likelihood of the transgressor emerging as a threat in the foreseeable future.
The Principles of War in the 2010 Environment
The principles of war universally accepted within the US military are defined in Joint Publication 3. Doctrine for Joint Operations. 
8
The purpose of mass is to concentrate the effects of combat power at the place and time to achieve decisive results. Economy Of Force: The While these principles are accepted as the foundation for planning and executing operations, they were derived from nineteenth century strategic thought. Many of that period's strategic considerations, however would be best related to today's operational level of war. At the strategic level, war is a more intellectual pursuit, still requiring a framework of analysis, but not a checklist of time proven axioms. While the differences between these two sets of principles may appear cosmetic, the focus and scope is noticeably different in important ways. For example, the principle of the offensive is not part of the strategic lexicon, but initiative is. In the offensive definition, initiative is achieved through offensive action; initiative in the strategic context may be achieved through economic action or even deploying forces to conduct defensive operations. A case in point was the 1994 deployment of US forces to Kuwait to counter an Iraqi troop buildup. The mission was defensive; however the initiative was clearly with the defense in this case as Iraq could not continue to threaten Kuwait. One other point is the use of the word "resources" in defining "economy of effort" rather than "combat power" in defining "economy of force." Strategic level decision makers, except perhaps in the case of nuclear war, deal in allocation of resources and application of instruments of power. The application of combat power is an operational task. Both of these sets of principles are useful in the discussion of the utility of EMA and RMA forces as these forces are described and applied at both the strategic and operational levels. Strategic considerations include deterrence and compellence, as well as global attack, information warfare, and presence. Operational considerations include dominant maneuver, precision engagement and strike, and decisive victory.

provide a gauged response to a potential challenge. The inherent flexibility of this force design allows for its operational concept, as outlined in chapter 6, to be modified to the situation given the specific competitor and its menu of military capabilities. For instance, global attack against China would necessarily be limited to the operational forces being used to achieve that nation's immediate goals. To realize COL Warden's concept of attacking the inner ring

The evolutionary force, with its tangible presence and capability to rapidly increase that presence may prove to be a more decisive and reasonable deterrent, except over an issue of national sovereignty or economic viability. In that regard, should Taiwan declare independence or should China find it necessary to secure the South China sea to exploit the oil reserves there to continue its economic growth, or a viable, reunified and democratic Korea, China may take action.
Given the changing strategic situation, the EMA force still presents a robust deterrent capability. With no more than three aircraft carriers, China's power projection capacity is limited. The US can expand from two to between four and six carriers and accompanying Iran provides a different set of considerations with regard to deterrence. Iran's pursuit of asymmetrical capabilities and failure to link into the world economic system, or that of the Gulf for that matter, makes the possible economic repercussions of war with the US and its allies less of a deterrent. However, given information dominance and reasonably clear intelligence on its WMD sites, Iran could be put on notice through sharing of a portion of that information dominance picture with them. This exploits the global attack system and demonstrates the potential for removing significant portions of Iran's asymmetrical capabilities. Further, attacking the inner political and economic centers of gravity, after removing significant portions of its WMD delivery capacity would be viable. In conjunction with this spelling out of the US information and global attack capabilities, Iran's primary oil fields are within striking distance by land forces from the Gulf coastal area. This action would remove one of Iran's major sources of income. The demonstrated capability to attack its regime and WMD capability, coupled with a real threat against its major source of national income should provide even a nation like Iran with the motivation to remain a reasonable neighbor. This does not mean that efforts to destabilize GCC states will cease, but it should mean that Iranian efforts to close the Straits or directly threaten GCC states would remain only a potential and not an eventuality.
An EMA force capable of deterring the likes of China and Iran should be sufficient for other potential threats. There have been few
instances where nations have gone to war simply because a great power was already engaged in another conflict. Nations initiate wars in their own interests, not necessarily in support of another nation's wants and desires. North Korea did not launch while the US was engaged with Iraq, nor did Russia attempt to take advantage of US involvement in Vietnam by attacking Europe. Thus Russia, beyond action in some limited portions of the near abroad, will probably remain peaceful, particularly towards the US and recognize their inability to challenge the US in Europe. A CVBG presence in and around the Arabian Sea should be sufficient for general deterrence of any potential Indian initiatives.
In both probable scenarios, though taking a slightly different approaches, the EMA force provides a sufficiently robust mix of LRPS, global attack, and conventional forces, both CONUS based and in theater, to provide reasonable deterrence to a China or an Iran. This is particularly true if allies in the region remain supportive to a US presence. Accepting that this force should provide reasonable deterrence against these two probable competitors, the chance of war is still very real. However, before examining the potential of the EMA force to achieve decisive victory, the potential for supporting compellence will be addressed.
Compellence is an inherently diplomatic effort backed by the various instruments of national power. A strong deterrent capability coupled with significant economic, informational, and diplomatic power and credibility provides the means for compelling another nation to adhere to accepted norms of international behavior or even take certain actions beneficial to the US. This is not to say that a regional power could be compelled to take actions contrary to their own core vital interests, but that agreements could very likely conform to the desired US outcome.
In the case of China and Iran, there is some question as to whether this is possible. As discussed in chapter 4, nations with strategic resources but isolated and without a freemarket system and representative government can become rogue states. Iran clearly fits this description. Barring unforeseen developments, the ability of the US to compel Iran may be limited. However, even radical, anti-west regimes require basic trade ties and through a combination of deterrence, information campaigns, and economic restrictions, Iran may be kept within the general bounds of acceptable behavior. Compelling
China will also be difficult given its market's rising importance to the world economy. It is also doubtful for example that an embargo would be sufficiently supported worldwide to have an impact. However, as its economy grows and its population becomes accustomed to an increasing standard of living and as well as being more educated to support the evolving economy, China's ability to control information will wane.
This development, when combined with a viable deterrent, should result in a reasonable potential for compellence on certain key issues such as refraining from adventurism outside of its borders, destabilization of a Korea, and the like.
The Evolutionary Force and Decisive Victory-While deterrence and compellence are important to the prosperity of the US and the advancement of its interests, decisive victory can be essential to the survival of the nation as the US now understands it.
The rapid termination of a conflict on terms favorable to the US is the This obviates the missile threat and challenges the submarine threat.
The inability to predict where ground forces will arrive, given their ability to land without port facilities, would cause any opposition force to spread itself too thin in trying to anticipate the US action.
The lighter, more efficient armored systems used by the heavy force would be capable of operating at three to four times the radius of current systems, reducing the logistics tail. Concurrent to these maneuver operations. Marine operations would focus on attacking the coastal oil fields to further challenge the Iranian regime. These attacks would focus not on destruction but neutralization of this crucial economic asset. Under attack throughout the depth and breadth of their geographic and strategic environment, the Iranian regime would find itself faced with the choice of submitting or being destroyed. The rapid and selective employment of power across the entire country, focusing precisely on key infrastructure, the leadership, and forces would destroy the regime without destroying the people.
Revolutionary Force Interaction with a Regional Competitor
In comparison to the EMA force, the operational concepts of an RMA force would be very difficult to modify. Accepting Luttwak's thesis, this force may be more readily committed, but it may not be as flexibly employed as the EMA force. The theory of gradual escalation was left on the ash heap of Vietnam and despite tremendous doses of aerial attack, precision and otherwise, the Iraqi Army did not quit the field of battle until the Coalition ground force forced the issue. What this means is that destruction of a force is the inevitable outcome of any employment of a precision strike based RMA force. In some cases it may be sufficient to attrit forces in an operational area. However, should these forces become intermixed with civilians, it is highly doubtful that precision strike will be precise enough not to result in high levels of collateral damage. This point is essential; historical trends demonstrate that fires have yet to compel a force to quit the battlefield, therefore destruction is the only option. Further, when dealing with a nation such as China or Iran, where life has a different cultural and political value, an attack against the regime itself may be necessary to end a conflict. In the case of China, that is unrealistic due to China's nuclear weapons capability. This limitation is not so apparent with a nation like Iran, due to its pariah status and lack of strategic weapons. However, even in Iran's case destruction of the regime by stand-off weapons requires careful thought. While unable to target the US, failure to destroy WMD launch abilities as a part of an RMA attack could allow Iran or a similar adversary to attack a US ally.
The revolutionary force, with its limited presence and inability to rapidly increase that presence may prove to be an unrealistic deterrent due to the limitations of absolute power. Indeed, this capability could be likened to Morgenthau's distinction between usable and unusable power where "an increase in military power is no longer necessarily conducive to an increase in political power."
Additionally, a moral and political issue arises when dealing with conflict from afar. The moral high ground once occupied by the US may be abdicated to the adversary. With a substantially decreased chance of casualties, the US could be seen as a bully wreaking havoc on another country without any chance of suffering any losses of its own. The reaction of the Middle Eastern region to the cruise missile strikes against Iraq during the fall of 1996 is a case in point. Support among allies in the region was negligible, and many were vocal in their opposition. The moral standard the US lays claim to could quickly disappear with a multitude of such operations.
An RMA Force in Deterrence
The RMA force operational concept is based on information dominance tied to the shooting platforms. This capability, as it appears to be developing, will be supremely powerful, and for massed forces and the critical areas of a government's legitimacy, the outcome could easily be one of destruction. However, the utility of such an exclusive capability remains to be seen. The fire bombing of Dresden did not break the spirit of the German people and neither did similar attacks against Tokyo. The record of effectiveness of escalation during
Vietnam is mixed, though the immediate results were certainly inconclusive given the eventual victory of the North over the South.
Nuclear weapons have provided stability in the realm of great power confrontation over the last forty years, but they have not proven to be decisive. The future legacy of a precision strike force may be the same.
Even with the sharing of information dominance products and the almost assured destruction of a foe given the capabilities of the RMA force, deterrence may not always be achieved. Nuclear weapons precluded head-to-head great power war, but it did not preclude warlike competition. This capability, which cannot be applied in an escalating manner with any lasting effect, can only be employed with the intention of destruction of a regime. As previously discussed, China's possession of nuclear weapons obviates any threat the RMA force may pose to the Chinese regime. The sanctity of human life is too high in the US to risk the lives of its citizens in a confrontation with a state like China that can target the US. Additionally, given China's size-population, military, and economy--coupled with the fact that it is still developing an infrastructure, it may be able to absorb more punishment than the US could absorb or would be willing to deliver.
In the case of Iran the threat of destruction may be sufficient to deter it from taking action against US interests or its allies.
However, it may not be sufficient. If Iran does station forces on the Straits of Hormuz and declare the region closed to US commerce, or some similar action, the question returns to what reaction will be acceptable to world opinion. The US did not attack aircraft and missile launchers placed near schools, in residential areas, and near historic landmarks during the Gulf War. It is unlikely that this policy will change. If that is true, then Iran can maintain a viable WMD threat against its neighbors, and allies of the US, as a hedge against attack from the US.
The inability to place decisive force on the ground in conjunction with air and sea attack may prove to be decisive to an adversary. The other limitation in this may prove to be a moral one. If regional allies and trading partners react to a decisive precision strike by an RMA force in a manner similar to the Arab reaction to the attack on Iraq, US leadership and credibility may come into question.
In both probable scenarios the ability of an RMA force to destroy is unquestioned, the issue is to what end does this force cause destruction. In the case of China, nuclear weapons may preclude the use of this precision strike capability all together. 17 In the case of Iran, the bully factor in this age of instantaneous new coverage may prove detrimental to the US position in the world.
An RMA Force in Support of Compellence
As with the EMA force, compellence is still an inherently diplomatic effort backed by the various instruments of national power, including military power. The previous conclusions as to the significant limitations of precision strike forces answers the question of compellence. Saddled with an unusable military instrument, the other instruments of power become more important. If precision strike had been previously employed, and US prestige was reduced as a result, then the nation's ability to compel others is diminished as well.
The capability to conduct RMA operations is viable and the large reduction in manpower would provide funds for additional space and LRPS air and sea launch platforms. The sensor-to-shooter architecture could be established, and the ability to strike with global attack air and sea systems against any target on the face of the earth could probably be realized. On the face of it, this concept of operations should be decisive. However, the ability to achieve decisive victory with an RMA force may be limited by the same factors discussed in the section on RMA deterrence. As stated earlier, the question is not whether the capability can be realized, but whether it can achieve its purpose. The goal of rapid conflict termination may be achievable by the RMA force, but most likely through the destruction of the adversary's regime. When faced with this prospect, another nation will look at this issue as a question of survival. When fighting for survival, the means of war quickly become far more violent and destructive. The linkage between an RMA attack and China and its nuclear weapons has already been discussed.
The chance that the Iranian regime might lash out with WMDs against a US ally is also a very real possibility when it is faced with the violent end of its existence. Time and treasure may be efficiently expended using this capability, but the repercussions may be unmanageable.
Operations against China could not be limited to the operational forces conducting the incursion. Without a balanced combination of Operations against Iran would follow a similar path. The consequences here are not so much a threat to the US as it is possible WMD attacks against allies, and a corresponding loss of US prestige as it methodically goes about destroying Iran without suffering any possible consequences. Even if Iran capitulated, the US would be unable to impose its will on the government due to the limited ground forces available. This could place the US in position similar to the aftermath of the Gulf war, where the victor finds a hollow victory. In the case of Iraq, the decision to leave the regime intact was a conscious one, which could have been easily reversed with the ground forces in the theater. The same would not be true for a regime that quit prior to destruction by an RMA force. Given the limited ground forces available, the regime could almost claim victory, or at least victim status and still continue to exist.
The reliance on technology and missile type systems would also allow potential adversaries to plan against only one kind of attack.
This could focus the effort on innovation to a point where sensor and brilliant weapons countermeasures might develop more rapidly, thus detracting from the effectiveness of the RMA force. The difference is the lack of a balanced force capable of full spectrum dominance. This force when operating against a regional power provides only single or dual spectrum dominance.
Operations other than war, currently a growing part of the operational landscape, provides particular challenges for both force designs as they are built around information dominance. Depending on the physical environment and the lack of mass formations to target either for dominant maneuver or precision strike, neither force may be particularly useful. However, as Bosnia has demonstrated, for reasons that are beyond the scope of analysis of this chapter, land forces and air forces can make a difference in an operation other than war.
Airpower, in conjunction with the Croatian offensive broke the Serb Army and brought them to the negotiating table. The presence of several heavy brigades has assisted in maintaining a tenuous peace.
Bosnia also demonstrated the limitations of information based systems and precision strike in the futile effort to find and destroy mortars, artillery, and mobile guns in the mountains surrounding Sarajevo. Airpower contributed decisively, as could precision strike, against Serb Army formations and installations, but not against systems and positions hidden deep in the forests of Bosnia.
Should the US find itself engaged in a conflict in a region such as Bosnia, ground forces will be needed to locate and target systems in the trees. The EMA land force organization contains sufficient forces of both light and heavy varieties to support such operations. The RMA force does not. This limitation in capability is important, because while winning wars is the essential reason for having a military, these other missions become essential to US credibility and maintenance of alliances. US participation in Bosnia, as an example, was essential to demonstrating US leadership within the NATO structure. Failure to participate could have brought the viability of NATO into question and that would not have been in the interests of the US.
In supporting a friendly government engaged in a counterinsurgency, the SOF components of both forces would be best suited to prosecute that campaign. As Vietnam demonstrated clearly, conventional US troop formations are a poor tool in conducting counterinsurgency operations. As the Marine experience in the 1920s and 1930s shows, and the more recent experience in El Salvador reinforces, small US missions that assist the host government in conducting a national counterinsurgency war are more likely to succeed than an outside intervention. Using this as a model for future counterinsurgency operations, then either the EMA or RMA force could conduct the operation successfully using its SOF component.
In order to conduct OOTW operations similar to Bosnia or conduct relief operations within CONUS, the nation requires landpower. While training and focus should always be placed on fighting and winning wars, the nation has interests and commitments that do not always require destructive elements to support them. In these environments, landpower is essential to conducting the operations. The RMA force cannot be funded if an eight division land force is maintained, and the LRPS capability is of little value in these operations. The RMA force specified in this thesis has a paucity of landpower for the conduct of OOTW missions if any long term presence or wartime response capability is to be maintained. It seems clear that the EMA force provides more flexibility in this very difficult and varied mission environment.
The strategy based EMA force provides the requisite balance between technology and manpower, and fire and maneuver. This balanced, functionally based force is sized to meet the probable strategic requirements of the twenty-first century. Contrary to the assertions of Edward Luttwak, Richard Perle, and others cited throughout this thesis, the RMA force, while sufficiently powerful to realize its operational concept and prevail against an opponent, is not the more strategically and operationally useful force. While both forces will always have limitations, the analysis of this chapter certainly suggests that the repackaged assertions of Douhet and Mitchell are still not valid. What is valid, however, is the realization that fires and maneuver are a key and symbiotic relationship that cannot be allowed to fall out of balance or stalemate will follow. Additionally, the contributions of land-, aerospace-, and seapower to national security are unquestioned when packaged in a balanced, thoughtful manner. Aerospace power provides the reach, simultaneity, and depth of continuous attack, seapower projects force and forces in conjunction with land and aerospace power, and landpower allows the nation to impose its will on others--with the support of the other arms. War will change, but the requirement for all services to act in a symbiotic relationship will not.
Chapter 8
You may fly over a land forever,-you may bomb it, atomize it, pulverize it and wipe it clean of life-but if you desire to defend it, protect it, and keep it for civilization, you must do this on the ground, the way the Roman legions did, by putting your young men into the mud. T. R. Fehrenbach, This Kind of War
The quote above seems to suggest that only landpower is decisive in war, but in the greater context of the Korean War, to which it speaks, the importance of all the services capabilities cannot be overstated. The soldier in the "mud" could not get there without airand sealift, nor could he survive without airpower and seapower. This quote also speaks to one of a list of tragic experiences in US military history--Task Force Smith--where the US got it wrong and soldiers died needlessly. The nation's leaders did not assess the future correctly, embraced "easy" solutions like the supposed preeminence of the atomic bomb and ignored the experience of history. The purpose of this paper is to help get it right and prevent the present generation of soldiers and the next from having a similar experience.
This thesis sought to determine the best strategic and operational approach for the US to maintain continued military dominance. The path currently undertaken by the Department of Defense is embodied in Joint Vision 2010 and its companion service visions, and its antithesis is embodied in the prescriptions of defense theorists such as Richard Perle, Edward Luttwak, the Friedmans, and others. Based on the future forecasted in chapters 4 and 5 and the analysis of these two approaches to military dominance in chapters 6 and 7 several things are clear.
First, the forces that are currently envisioned for Joint Vision 2010 are inadequate. Joint Vision 2010 is not the best path to continued dominance. The structure of Force XXI, the pursuit of systems such as the F22, the retention and protection of service prerogatives, the resistance to real change could well be the undoing of the emerging twenty-first century US Armed Forces. Second, it is absolutely clear that standoff warfare and long-range precision strike are not silver bullets capable of providing usable and affordable military power. This presentation of a military capability as a strategy is based on a false hope unfounded in military history and realistic strategic thought.
Finally, the US military must change, from the top down in order to effectively and efficiently exploit the strategic opportunity the near term future provides for the military to exploit the potential of the information age. It is unimportant whether the information age provides a revolution in military affairs. As discussed in chapter 1 it may be that the pace of change dictates an evolutionary approach that results in revolutionary capabilities. What is important is that the military and national leadership first recognize the need for change (perhaps radical) and second embrace the opportunity the current and near term strategic environment provides to realize genuine and meaningful change.
Failure to take advantage of this opportunity may result in a loss of Having addressed these issues, and others, in a rational and detached manner, the probable resistance to any of the changes described above or in chapter 6 is daunting.
The record of history is on the side that embraces change, rebuilds or creates new organizations, develops new doctrine and then integrates the best of the emerging technologies. More, better, faster will not position the US military for success in the twenty-first century, but different, innovative, and better will. While budgetary realities and procurement cycles dictate radical technological change in the out years, these factors do not dictate organizational and doctrinal change. Failure to evolve now may result in organizational dislocation later. Leadership and vision are required to move forward.
There are several important areas that fall out from the conduct of this study. They deal with the future environment, the importance of strategy, the dominance of organizations and doctrine over technology, the validity of the Joint Vision 2010 operational concepts, the relationship between fire and maneuver, and that strategic dominance is maintained through fundamental change, not organizational effectiveness.
The future forecasts developed by the National Defense University and the Army War College seem to get it about right. Based on amalgamating these documents with several civilian commercial and academic works, and some original material, the conclusions arrived at in this thesis support the predominant themes found in these government publications. Based on the variety of sources used, this would appear to bode well for the world in general and the US specifically. However, caution or a healthy skepticism must always be applied when looking to the future as history is replete with examples of events proving the conventional wisdom wrong.
The purpose of a military strategy and its accompanying forces is to support the US national security strategy by protecting US vital interests. A national strategy is essential to determination of force design. The current headlines attest to this as does the analysis presented in chapters 4 and 5. A military force exists to support strategy. To do otherwise is to stand the process on its head. Force capabilities and structure must be directly linked to the ends of a national strategy. Without this guidepost, the military develops without purpose and direction, particularly in a nation like the US where the civilian leadership sets the course for the nation and its military. Joint Vision 2010 reflects this transposition of process.
Until a national direction is set for 2010 and beyond, defense visions are only intellectual exercises with little basis in reality.
While the emerging force structure associated with Joint Vision 2010 is inadequate for the future, the operational concepts of dominant maneuver, precision engagement, full dimensional protection and focused logistics are valid and have great promise. A functionally organized force that effectively executes, but is not dependent on these concepts will be unassailable. The only note of caution must be directed at relying on information superiority as a requirement for operations, or assuming successful force projection operations. No strategy can assume that countermeasures will not exist or that nations will not find weaknesses and exploit them. Indian General V. K. Nair outlines this point succinctly in War in the Gulf. 
While this study attempted to be as comprehensive as possible, a number of issues developed that require further study. Some are strategic questions, some are technical and others are operational. In order for the overall question of which is the best path to the future military to be answered, these issues should be addressed.
As discussed in several places, perhaps to the point of redundancy, the first step in developing a viable defense strategy and a corresponding strategic approach to force design is articulation of a national security strategy. This document does not exist, though several come close, including Foreign Policy into the 21st Century from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. While it is a fine piece of work, it does not have the approval of the elected leadership of the US. A commission, an interagency working group, or a think tank must produce a document, commissioned by and embraced by the senior elected leadership. Only once a document such as this is published can there be a truly productive debate on force structure and missions.
Given flat defense appropriations continuing for the foreseeable future, an approach to modernization might be to develop exploitation forces that are rapidly deployable and capable of tremendous mobility.
There are two models for this approach. One is to have such forces comprise only a part of the overall force. This was the German approach to the Blitzkrieg, where the armored maneuver forces actually made up a small portion of the overall force. This blitzkrieg force made the penetrations and exploited success while the less capable regular forces conducted follow and support and more conventional attack missions. A second approach is to use technological superiority to clear a path for the follow on forces to follow. This is the one currently employed by the USAF where high technology systems such as the F117 precede less capable aircraft. The benefits to this approach may be a more capable force sooner for less money, as well as providing a model for transition of the rest of the force as funding becomes available.
A Transition Strategy from Joint Vision 2010 to the Force After Next While there are activities studying what the forces after next should look like, they are almost all service based. This approach runs counter to the holistic approach advocated in this thesis. A joint coordination effort and study should be commissioned to look at integrating these efforts so that the force after next arrives as a truly joint vision.
The information age appears to be creating a seemingly smaller world. One of the unfortunate outcomes of the rise in jointness in the US military is a proliferation of new headquarters and layers of bureaucracy. The US force structure is shrinking, but the joint headquarters structure is not. The Unified Command Plan should be reviewed and changes made to streamline this growing bureaucratic assembly.
To make war without a thorough knowledge of the history of war is on par with casualness of a doctor who prescribes medicine without taking the trouble to study the history of the case he is treating. The record of history and the theories of the likes of Hans Morgenthau stand in opposition to this approach of war from afar. With these outcomes, a direction can be set for the future, one that is tied to and protects the nation's interests against the most probable threats.
However, the assessment and definition of the nation's interests are without true value until the political leadership focuses on the future and articulates a strategic vision for 2010 and beyond. Without this direction, any force derived to fulfill the valid Joint Vision 2010 operational concepts will only be a reasonable guess. In an era of defense growth, a best guess may have been acceptable. In the current era of defense stagnation, a best guess may well be a waste of precious resources, causing the expenditure of unnecessary funds on security at the expense of productive investment, or vice versa.
While strategy is critical to the force design process, warfare requires a holistic application of functional capabilities. The analysis provided here demonstrates that no one service is the keeper of future warfare. The notion that precision strike and aerospace power by themselves are the most useful tools for the national leadership is simply a mistake. These capabilities are more limiting than either seapower or landpower, neither of which can exist without aerospace power.
The importance of this conclusion is that a balanced force will best serve the nation's needs, but that force must first be based on a strategic vision, focus on organizational and doctrinal change first and technology second, and that organizational change must permeate DoD, not just brigades, wings, divisions, and CVBGs. Modular, functionally aligned forces in new organizations that can be rapidly deployed and effectively employed, exploiting information age technology and executing the function of war differently than the competition will be the key to victory in the future.
This thesis has developed a strategy based force that presents one path to maintaining continued strategic dominance. The first contribution to the body of knowledge is this approach, which appears to be muddled within the context of the current QDR and NDP processes. The EMA force is actually a radical departure from the present visions and modernization plans of the US Armed Forces. This is for the simple fact that organizational change is essential, and Joint Vision 2 010 did not articulate enough of it. Having said that, the more important conclusion is the a balanced force is still necessary for deterrence and the successful conduct of war. The two forces compared in the future environment were specific enough to allow visualization of organizations so that others have reasonable departure point for alternative force designs. The other significant outcome that must be grasped is the futility of searching for a silver bullet--war is a mean nasty business that requires multiple tools. Precision strike is a capability to be melded into the joint force, not a means unto itself. The bottom line is that future discussions of force design and capability should be first based on a strategy and second include all of the services capabilities--there is no decisive force except the joint force.
The key to maintaining unassailable strategic dominance is organizational, doctrinal, and technological change. This change should not be around the edges, but at the core of the institution. There may be other books like Breaking the Phalanx that address the Air Force, the Navy and the Department of Defense, but they are not prolific. This study has attempted to address that sort of organizational change in a broad manner that identifies issues and provides some suggestions.
There is neither the space nor the time to give any of them the attention they deserve. Besides this crying need to develop specific blueprints for change, there is a another urgent need for the services to put away their parochialism and together pull the Defense Department into the twenty-first century.

These two USAF studies provide scenarios to assist in the discussion of future space and aerospace systems and doctrine. Space Cast 2020 considers the development, utility and employment of space based systems,-Space Cast 2020. available: http://www.au.af.mil/ Spacecast/Spacecast.html (Internet). 2025 deals with the overall strategy for the development, employment and utility of aerospace force; 2025. available: http://www.au.af.mil/au/2025/monographs/E-S/e-s.htm (Internet). These scenarios, using 2025 as an example, were based on changes in three drivers: the American World View (global to domestic), development of technology (constrained to exponential) and world power (concentrated to dispersed). While the methodology was sound, indeed both studies enlisted the participation of many noted futurists, some of the conclusions and hence the scenarios failed to connect with the audience.
In the case of 2025, the scenarios were "out of the box" and finally required the development of an intermediate future with which the "customer" could relate; see Alternative Futures for 2025. in 2025 (August 1996), Maxwell AFB, AL: Air University (on-line), available: http://www.au.af.mil/au/2025/monographs/A-F/a-f-2.htm (Internet). This need of an intermediate scenario demonstrates a pitfall of a scenario based approach to the future. These illustration is not a dismissal of the utility of the issues raised by these studies, merely a representation of the potential shortfalls of this approach to the future. Another example is found in Andrew F. Krepinevich's The Conflict Environment of 2016. In it, China is depicted as attacking Indonesia for oppressing the Chinese minority. This scenario depicts China conducting itself in a historically unprecedented manner, operating well outside its realm, and taking umbrage at the oppression of expatriate Chinese when the PRC Government has shown no such concern regarding its own citizens. The scenario has utility in providing a vehicle for discussion of force projection, but the players are not linked to their historical and cultural roots.

'Frederick Pohl (futurist, science fiction writer and University of Kansas professor) describes several of the more accepted future methodologies: Delphi, trend-line extrapolation, and scenario writing. The Delphi method, pioneered by RAND Corporation, "is a procedure in which questionnaires are circulated to a group of people, asking them for their estimates of when, or if, a long list of technological changes are likely to happen." Frederick Pohl, "Thinking About the Future," Futurist 30, no. 5 (September-October 1996): 10-11. In the case of this chapter, the previously written estimates of the future are used to answer questions about the future.

. it is not linear . . . [and] the true principles of economic behavior are almost certainly closer to sociology or biology than they are to physics." Peterson goes on to outline "Major American Problems" given increasing bankruptcies, an increasing trade deficits with Asia, Europe, Canada and OPEC, and the national debt as a percentage of the federal budget.
He also cites the 60 year Kondratief cycle where three depressions--1814 to 1849, 1873 to 1896, and 1930 to 1939--have occurred in the last 200 years. This implies that the world is due another depression in the 1990's. Petersen, 247-261, 263. Assuming possible economic disaster away is also appropriate for this study. Its existence would make an EMA force highly improbable due to severely constrained resources caused by US debt servicing, an increased trade deficit, and the potential for another depression. Also, addressing a possible economic calamity is beyond the scope of this paper and would greatly complicate analysis of RMA and EMA forces. TECHNOLOGICAL DOMINANCE: Assuming that no one state or world actor will develop dominating technology is valid. Historically, technological breakthroughs have not provided any actor dominance over the whole. Even nuclear arms failed to provide the US dominance over peer or even regional competitors, in part due to proliferation of the technology, and in part due to the limiting factor of their very power. With the pace of change increasing daily and unrestricted technology transfer on the verge of becoming a reality, it is unlikely that any actor will be able to develop, protect and retain exclusive access to and use of a dominating technology. administrations: Reagan (Operations EARNEST WILL--Kuwaiti Tanker Reflagging) ; Bush (Operation DESERT SHIELD/STORM) , -Clinton (more recent dealings with Iraq). Given continued dependence on oil, it is highly unlikely that the US would disengage from this region, regardless of the Nation's overall isolationist or internationalist tendencies.

"The emerging lines of division appear to be the following: . . . market democracies . . . transitional states . . 25 Energy is the critical resource, after drinking water and food. Analysis of this issue is critical to depiction of a future world environment. The trend extrapolated here is very positive, and contrary to that of many analysts. CONCLUSION: Fossil fuels are the most convenient forms of energy currently or envisioned to be available. This fact alone suggests a continued reliance on and increased demand for fossil fuels, particularly oil. Supply may swing between sufficient and momentarily constrained, due to current demand and price driving the requirement for exploration and exploitation of new sources of supply. Development of alternative energy sources will continue, but it is highly unlikely that they will supplant fossil fuels. RATIONALE: Patrick L. Clawson (former editor of Orbis, former senior World Bank economist, and currently a senior fellow at the National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic Studies) counsels caution in forecasting a resource crisis with two examples. In 1975 analysts projected total consumption of energy, minerals and food, and in 1955 there was concern about US dependence on foreign sources of strategic minerals. In neither case, over a period of 2 0 and 4 0 years respectively, were these concerns realized. Patrick L. Clawson, "Environment," in 2015: Power and Progress, ed., Patrick M. Cronin, (Washington, DC: Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense University, July 1996), 69. This same caution should be applied to any forecast of energy shortfalls in the next 20 to 40 years, and that caution is applied to the supporting analysis of this trend. ANALYSIS: RELIANCE--Taylor contends that fossil fuel consumption and demand will increase; Taylor, A World 2010. 8. Daniel Yergin describes the world's, this "Hydrocarbon Society's," utter dependence on petroleum based products in almost every aspect of our lives--from energy, to the clothes we wear, to the body panels of our cars, to the chemicals used to grow our food. Daniel Yergin, The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil. Money, and Power. (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1991), 14-15. 2025 further reinforces the assertion that demand will increase, citing a 30 percent increase. "Appendix B," Alternative Futures for 2025. in 2025. available: http://www.au.af.mil/au/2025/monographs/A-F/a-f-b.htm (Internet). Hamish McRae confirms demand increases because "the world is overwhelmingly dependent on fossil fuels," and other alternative energy sources, such as nuclear and hydroelectric power have been "disappointing" and/or limited in ease of application. McRae, 127-130. Petersen cites the recent global economic slump as a reason for the recent downturn in the price and demand for oil, in Petersen, p. 146. Taken on the whole, given oil's ease of use and applicability to almost any energy producing or consuming activity and the increase in the number of nations joining the industrialized world, demand and consumption of fossil fuels, and oil in particular, will continue to increase. SUPPLY--Taylor contends that petroleum resources will continue to decrease,-Taylor, A World 2010. 8. Petersen states that there "are plenty of oil reserves to meet the conventionally assumed growth in demand well into the next century," but then goes on to say only the Gulf States "have the scope for expansion." A danger to supply also lies in the possible instability of Russia, as the world's largest oil producer. Petersen, 145. McRae postulates an energy shock in about 2015, with East Asia being the most vulnerable due to its lack of regional supply and fast growth; McRae, 131. Taking the contrary view, Herman Kahn contends that resources are constantly "renewed" when demand is high enough--demand (requirements and a potential profit) drives exploration. He states "the proven reserves of . . . major fossil fuels . . . alone could provide the world's total energy requirements for about 100 years [2076] . . . and only one-fifth of the estimated potential resources could provide for more than 200 years of the projected energy needs." Further, there is a "tendency [when talking about resources] to confuse temporary shortages with permanent ones." Kahn, 63, 93. Kahn's premise is supported by the current energysituation. Two examples of untapped petroleum resources are the potential reserves located in the Spratly Islands of the South China Sea and a rumored "Elephant" (a mega oil deposit rivaling Alaska) in the Gulf of Mexico. Yet demand has not driven exploitation of these two deposits. In the case of the Pacific region, "[t]he high cost of recovering offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil since 1985, has slowed . . . new drillings." Central Intelligence Agency (1995), "The World," in The World Fact Book, available: http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/zn.html (Internet). Though the short term outlook appears to be bleak given known reserves, Kahn makes a convincing and historically supported argument that known reserves have not and do not directly translate into the only reserves. Therefore, the outlook for oil supplies through 2020 is good, barring war or embargo,-though supply may become constrained for short periods of time, perhaps resulting in a McRae's crisis in 2015.
ALTERNATIVE SOURCES--Taylor ties alternative sources to his projected decrease in petroleum reserves, and looks to nuclear power to fill the void; Taylor, A World 2010. 8. 2025 states that further demand for alternative energy sources will increase due to increasing dependence on Mid-East oil and environmental concerns; "Appendix B," Alternative Futures for 2025. in 2025. available: http://www.au.af.mil/ au/2025/monographs/A-F/a-f-b.htm (Internet). McRae finds most alternatives to be disappointing, and substitute development requires demand. "The techniques are there; the problem is . . . [their products  are]  . . . more expensive than what flows out of the deserts of the Middle East." McRae, 131. Kahn again strikes an optimistic cord, stating that "too many options for new [energy] supplies already exist and they will increase over time. " Kahn, 83. Alternative energysources will be developed due to long range concerns over dependence, the environment and the relative cost of fossil fuels. But it is unlikely that alternatives will overtake fossil fuels. Use of nuclear power will increase due to the willingness of many economically advanced nations (France in particular) to provide the technology free or at reduced costs to developing nations; no nation would spend money for oil, when nuclear power is "free." Technology will continue to improve and generate new alternatives, but through 2020 these alternatives will not be economically realized and petroleum will probably still be king.
benefiting economically (limited only by their ability to finance) and socially (limited only by their capability to absorb) from the almost constant flow of scientific and technological innovativeness and discovery that will emerge by the year 2010 . . . [and] will permeate extensively throughout almost all nations of the new world order." Taylor, A World 2010. 52. It is supported and expanded upon by every work used in this study. Also note that technology, as referred to here, is primarily, though not totally, related to information based or linked technology. DEVELOPMENT: The velocity of technological change is staggering. It is succinctly illustrated by the notion of change on the Worldwide Web being described as a 90 day "net year." 2025 characterizes change in information technology as "so rapid it effectively renders systems obsolete within a year or two of introduction . . . [for example] the rate of increase in the speed of the central processing unit (CPU) of personal computers has risen from doubling every two years to doubling every 18 months . . . [e]xtrapolated ... 30 years at that rate would produce CPU speeds 1 million times faster than 1995 processors, but at the same price . . . In essence, the desktop computer of 2025 unarguably will be more powerful that today's Cray supercomputer." "Appendix B," Alternative Futures for 2025. in 2025. available: http://www.au.af.mil/ au/2025/monographs/A-F/a-f-b.htm (Internet). Biotechnology's rapid advances are linked to the ability of computers to map and simulate nature. Computer modeling allows designers to complete all prototype work without building models, in Petersen, 48. Computer modeling has become so sophisticated that it became a primaryjustification for support of the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty--the models were so accurate that they obviated the need for actual tests. While capability may slow, cost and convenience normally continue to improve. Where change in capability may be measured in terms of scale rather than standard (aircraft engines, automobiles, trains, housing), real cost has fallen. McRae, 168. One example is "because of increased use of ceramics and plastics, one estimate says that the average life of cars will increase from 10 years to 20 years by the year 2000," in Petersen, 57. ACCESS: Information is the fuel of change and the Internet is the clearest indicator that access to information and technology is increasing. According to the Defense Department's Advanced Research Projects Agency, the Internet increases by 25% every month, in Petersen, 37. The decrease in cost caused by the changes in "scale" mentioned above also increases access. Libicki states that "[i]t would be very difficult to maintain the distinct American advantage . . . over the next 20 years. . . . Over the next 10 years, [any "sophisticated" nation] will be able to buy or lease a wide panoply of capabilities from around the world: in GPS, surveillance, communications, direct broadcast, systems integration, Internet working, cryptography, and airbased imaging . . . [and]the costs . . . will progressively decrease," in Libicki, "Technology and Warfare," 131. Additionally, nations without previous links to space and other major information based technologies (not Japan, Singapore, Chile, etc.) are getting into the business. As one example, Thailand (not one of the Asian dragons) is studying the feasibility of launching its own communications and intelligence-gathering satellite. Spike Robinson, (1 November 1995), "Thailand Plans to Launch Spy Satellite," Military and Arms Transfer News. Issue 95/13 (on-line), available: http://csf.colorado.edu/ dfax/matn/matn9513.htm (Internet). The trend towards unimpeded access to high technology and space based resources is further reinforced by several other indicators. There are currently 14 government satellite imagery systems with products for sale, providing weather and visual imagery at costs between $113 and $5000. Resolution of commercial visual products runs from 10 to 2 meters. "The TELSAT Guide for Satellite Imagery" (27 December 1996) (on-line), available: http://www.belspo.be/tesat/sumtab/suse_pil.htm (Internet). Additionally, commercial exploitation of space is on the move. Motorola's IRIDIUM system has a 1998 start date for commercial service. "The IRIDIUM system is a wireless personal communications network [of 66 interconnected satellites], designed to permit any type of telephone transmission--voice, data, fax, or paging--to reach its destination anywhere on earth," Iridium (26 December 1996)(on-line), available: http://www.iridium.com/ (Internet). Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is backing a similar, but more ambitious system called Teledesic. "Scheduled to begin service in 2002, the Teledesic Network [of 840 active satellites] will provide two-way, broadband connections for applications such as voice, data, videoconferencing and high-performance Internet access." Teledesic (26 December 1996) (on-line), available: http://www.teledesic.com/ (Internet). In addition to these two systems, four other systems are under development. Lloyd Wood (26 December 1996), Lloyd's Constellations (on-line), available: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.Uk/Personal/L.Wood/constellations (Internet). Additionally, GPS access will increase. GPS and GLONASS currently exist, INMARSAT'S new INMARSAT-3 satellites provide navigation services to enhance GPS and GLONASS, and the European Community is trying to create GNSS, "a navigation system that is in international hands and independent of foreign military powers." Wood, available: http://www.ee.surrey.ac.uk/Personal/L.Wood/constellations (Internet).

[  20-25. The causes of these present conflicts and those to come center around tribal, ethnic, religious, and colonial conflicts. They involve the settlement of old scores, some, as with Bosnia, hundreds of years old. They involve the redesigning of artificial borders, imposed by colonial masters in the late 1800's and early 1900's, by tribal, ethnic and religious factions. These civil wars also involve the revolt of peoples held down by others or who find themselves in untenable situations, like the poor in Zaire, Nigeria, Mozambique, Sudan, Mauritania, Peru, Bolivia, and perhaps even Brazil. Finally, these wars may involve a struggle between a legitimate government and a non-state actor such as a drug cartel in South America or parts of Africa. In some regions it is doubtful that these wars will be particularly spectacular, or even attract much attention from the outside world--the Moroccans and the POLISARIO fought for 15 years in the former Spanish Sahara without much notice. In those cases conflict may end with exhaustion or continue for decades as a smoldering cancer that kills 10s and 20s daily or monthly for years at a time.
31 "[T]here remains a good chance that because of the increased competition for scarce resources needed by new and old industrial states, virtually all but the poorest nations will invest in a conventional military establishment, at least commensurate to their ability to pay. Others, in addition, likely will invest in a very modest nuclear capability." Taylor, A World 2010. 63; trend description and analysis 8, 63-73. This trend is selected not because of Taylor's cause--the increased competition for scarce resources needed by new and old industrial states--is necessarily correct (McRae and Kahn dispute the notion of resource shortages), but due to the change from a bipolar to a multipolar world. The US and Russia are no longer in a position to spread their umbrella over others. Nations will see themselves in a situation like pre-WW I Europe where they must arm to effect a balance of power in their region. The build down of western nations' militaries as contrasted by an increase in Asia is outlined by Michael T. Klare, Director of the Five College Program in Peace and World Security Studies. He states that while "most of the NATO and former Warsaw Pact countries are reducing their military expenditures . . . many East Asian countries are raising their military outlays--in some cases by a significant percentage . . . [and] it is the emphasis on technologyimports that sets the East Asian arms races apart from those in the Third World. Michael T. Klare, "The Next Great Arms Race," Foreign Affairs 72, no. 3 (Summer 1993): 136-137.
Regional competitors will increase in capability and sophistication. To suggest otherwise is to ignore several clear indicators. One is Iran's current build up and potential to become "the regional superpower, or minisuperpower, to replace Iraq in the Persian Gulf, Iran will realize that potential if left undisturbed." Major General Uri Sagi, Director of Israeli Military Intelligence quoted by Michael Eisenstadt, "Deja Vu All Over Again? An Assessment of Iran's Military Buildup," in Iran's Strategic Intentions and Capabilities, ed. Patrick Clawson, (Washington, DC: Institute for National Strategic Studies, National Defense university, April 1994). 93. Another indicator is the implications of an extremely thoughtful assessment of the US's strategic vulnerabilities entitled War in the Gulf: Lessons for the Third World by Indian Army Brigadier General V. K. Nair. Nair dissects the strengths and weaknesses of the American way of war, and identifies countermeasures an aspiring regional power might employ to succeed or mitigate US strengths. V. K. Nair, War in the Gulf: Lessons for the Third World. (New Delhi: Lancer International, 1991), 217-231. Additionally, China "has recently increased its military spending and appears to be placing greater emphasis on preparation for regional conflict . . . [and] China's Central Military Commission directed the PLA to shift its primary strategic focus from preparation for all-out war with the USSR to preparation for regional conflicts on China's periphery." Klare, 141-143.

"Conflict is to be avoided. Obvious exceptions involve sovereignty issues such as Taiwan, Hong Kong, or the South China Sea . . . The PLA is dealing with a two-fold security challenge. Immediately and tactically, China is determined to maintain control over the situations with the greatest potential for conflict. This means putting teeth into Beijing's sovereignty claims in the South China Sea and preventing a declaration of independence by Taiwan. By deterring potential conflict in these hotspots, it becomes possible for the Chinese to gain the time necessary to address the larger, more broadly strategic, dimension of the major security challenge: creating an economy capable of supporting the range of economic, political, and military options that will guarantee China's position as a great power."

108 Xu Xiaojun, 31, 33, 37, 41.    xll "By 2006, however, either there will be a different regime in Pyongyang or the two parts of Korea will have unified. The present North Korean system cannot be sustained for another decade . . . With reform, reconciliation or (less likely) the status quo are possible alternative to unification." See Wilborn, "Asia Pacific Region," available: http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usassi/ssipubs/pubs96/wdvu96/ wdvu96p8.htm (Internet). The projection of a reunified Korea due to an implosion of the North (DPRK) is based on personal and professional observation of this region over a 15 year period. The recent defection of the North Korean Foreign Minister, Hwang Jang Yop, the chief architect of DPRK's doctrine of self reliance is but one more indicator of the chinks in that nation's stability. An assessment of the DPRK's economic and political situation, coupled with this most recent of defections points to several outcomes regarding the DPRK.
1. The status quo can continue, but given the DPRK's current problems, this is unlikely. A recent CNN report cited the average height of DPRK military recruits falling to 4 feet, 9 inches a substantial indication of the impact of food shortages and the general economic conditions in the North. For this reason, something must give and one of the other outcomes is more likely.
2. The DPRK can explode. This probably will be marked by unrest and a power struggle followed by an invasion of the ROK. This invasion may be launched only to consolidate power within the North, and may be a limited objective attack, say to seize Seoul (the economic, political and cultural center of the South) and then sue for peace, simply to change the balance of power. However, even with a successful seizure of Seoul, senior leaders in Pyongyang must know that the North would lose a war. It would so devastate the North, given its already weakened state, that no real gain can be realized from this option. While the North Koreans do not hold Western values, neither are they total zealots-hence Hwang's defection.
3. An implosion of the DPRK with a hard landing would characterized by internal civil war, the consolidation of power among one or more DPRK factions, followed by some military action by the ROK and US to first contain, and then defuse the aftermath. Reunification would be the probable outcome given the North's non-existent reserves.
4. An implosion of the DPRK with a soft landing is the desired outcome and the one the US and ROK, in particular, are working towards. This situation will probably be marked by some sort of change of power, but not a civil war. It could very well be the result of exhaustion, as with the USSR and the former East Germany. The intelligence garnered from Hwang will provide the best assessment of which way the DPRK may fall. War must be prepared for, but it appears to be increasingly unlikely.

121 Africa has more than sufficient resources to lift itself, but has done little with it. Nigeria squandered its oil revenues on 25 years of haphazard projects, and on corruption, and has nothing to show for it. Passage, 3. In fact Nigeria, a region (nation may be too limiting a description) blessed with oil, is one of Kaplan's prototypical failed states. Kaplan, Ends of the Earth. 14, 83.
"Africa is one of the richest continents on this planet. What Africa needs is not more foreign aid . . . it's for its leadership to stop stealing so much of [its income from its riches]. . .

There is also a force of some 5,000 marines. These formations are equipped with the PLA's most modern ground weapons and are at the leading edge of training reform. While such "crack units" would be effective in operations in the South China Sea, their small size, their dispersal throughout China, and a lack of lift all limit their effectiveness for large scale operations, such as an invasion of Taiwan. The Air Force is making an effort to address the problem of strategic lift. It has acquired 10 Ilyushin heavy-transport aircraft from Russia and in 1995 began an effort to integrate long-range transport operations into the training cycle. However, the small number of suitable aircraft will make it difficult to conduct such training on a scale large enough to make a difference. The Air Force has also acquired 26 SU27 fighter aircraft. Although the SU27 provides a clear qualitative gain, the lack of an aerial refueling capability will deny the PLA their full benefit."

59 Some dominant maneuver working groups are using forces that operate as complex adaptive systems, resembling brigade type organizations with capabilities associated with divisions, and technologically, organizationally and doctrinally different from any force type presently in existence. In Office of Net Assessment, "Dominating Maneuver Workshop IV, Summary Report," Summary of presentations, assessments and outcomes from workshop IV, Carlisle Barracks: US Army War College, August 1996, 10, 23. One working group at Workshop IV examined the ability to transition from current forces to those being contemplated and concluded that "this kind of fundamental change almost certainly could not succeed without an intervening step." Ibid., 20. These conclusions were also reflected in a conversation with a senior contractor for the dominant maneuver workshops; Lancaster, interview.

In an article titled 'The War in the Persian Gulf: Lessons and Conclusions,' three Russian general staff officers noted the massive use of cruise missiles, the employment of AWACS aircraft to direct the air offensive, the waging of electronic warfare to blind and confuse, and deceive the enemy, and the overall American capability to project air and naval forces globally in order to exert political influence. The authors, however, went on to register three important stipulations: The air offensive failed to destroy the Iraqi ground forces; The air offensive failed to destroy the Iraqi nuclear complexes,-It was the ground offensive that compelled the Iraqis to submit unconditionally to the American-led coalition forces."

contributes to the body of knowledge in three ways. First, the synthesis forecast of the future will provide a realistic and probable environment, amalgamating points of continuity between the different studies and providing reasonable conclusions where continuity may be lacking. Further, this future environment will point to US interests and probable competitors. Second, competing force structures will be specified for evaluation. These evolutionary and revolutionary force designs will incorporate the potential of technology, trends in military requirements, and outline roles, functions, and missions. Last, this study will provide an assessment of each force's utility in a probable future environment, establishing what type of force best meets US national security needs in the early twenty-first century. derives points of conflict based on clashing interests between the US and probable competitors. These clashes or challenges determine defense requirements. Establishing who will challenge the US leads to discovery of what future warfare will look like. This discovery points to what the military will need to look like in order to win. This overview provides the strategic approach underlying the research and analysis conducted in this thesis. This thesis uses a nesting of questions to answer the primary question of whether the US is on the correct path to modernization. This primary question focuses the research to answer four secondary questions. First, what is the probable future environment in the decade beyond 2010? Second, what would a Joint Vision 2010 force design look like? Third, what would a technologically based military force built around long-range precision strike assets and doctrine look like? Finally, do those forces meet the nation's needs in the probable future environment? Subsequent questions provide supporting information to the secondary and succeeding sets of questions. Answers to these follow-on questions either provide descriptive information to answer an environmental or organizational question or provide yes no or maybe (requiring interpretation) answers. beyond 2010, covering four axes. These axes are the social, economic, political, and security environments of seven world regions--North America, Russia and Eurasia, Europe, the Middle East and Southwest Asia, Greater Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The same questions address each region. What is the social and cultural environment? Where does the region's economic power reside, and what is its source? What is the political center of gravity and who maintains it? What are the interests of the political and military power broker? What are the interests of the US regionally and globally? What is the security environment, in terms of power, threats, and potentials for conflict?
Quadrennial Defense Review, underway as this is being written, may provide more focus on what a force designed to meet the vision of Joint Vision 2010 will look like. However, presently there is not an integrated, joint concept of what this evolutionary force should actually look like. As with the RMA force, there are numerous documents and studies that can provide sufficient insight into this question. In line with Joint Vision 2010, this force will generally reflect current roles, functions, and organizations, though some change is inevitable.

command centers. National reconnaissance satellites can provide near real time imagery with resolution under one meter to strategic and operational headquarters. The ability to down link JSTARS, satellite and UAV imagery into strategic, operational and tactical command posts is already a reality. However, countermeasures to seemingly dominant capabilities are almost always just a step behind. There are camouflage systems available today that cannot be discerned by high resolution photographs and even the naked eye at low level. With this development at hand, multispectral camouflage cannot be far off.
deter or fight a competitor with systems, organizations, and methods that do not attack strengths, probably exploit a weakness, and are not generally prepared for These systems target US capabilities with dissimilar systems, and when taken as a whole may become a very difficult problem to solve. The approach looks to exploit weaknesses and avoid direct combat, a US strength. Missiles, air defense, and sufficient seapower to hazard the US fleet and commercial support and deployment assets in the Arabian Sea may be adequate to cause the US to reconsider forcing entry into the Persian Gulf. Terrorism may sufficiently intimidate some GCC state so that they back away from support of the US. Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) Trends indicate continued proliferation of WMDs. The chemical and nuclear projects uncovered in Iraq during and after Desert Storm, Libya's continual efforts in this vein, North Korea, Pakistan, and the list goes on, amply illustrate this trend line. While the US has forsaken chemical weapons, it has not forsaken the right to retaliate, and still maintains a nuclear deterrent. Continued efforts in counter proliferation, a political and at times special operations function, coupled with a strong deterrent capability will be required to discourage WMD use against US or allied nations and forces. (CONUS) in order to conduct operations in times of crisis or war. The fact is that the US has always been a force projection military, Korea, Europe, and the Middle East have always required substantial CONUS based forces to meet actual force requirements. REFORGER exercises were a prime example of this for Europe, and the entire Desert Shield and
This will require a force capable of deterring a mix of land, aerospace and naval forces. Based on the conclusions of chapters 4 and 5, a military force must deter Chinese designs on the South China Sea, Taiwan, and perhaps Korea and the Bay of Bengal.

"Air and space superiority is the control over what moves through air and space . . . [and] is a critical enabler for the Joint Force because it allows all US forces freedom from attack and freedom to attack. With Air and Space Superiority, the Joint Force can dominate enemy operations in all dimension--land, sea, air and space." This statement reflects a condition enjoyed by US forces almost without exception since the later stages of World War II. No marine, soldier or sailor would trade air (and now space) superiority--it is key to success on the modern battlefield. This has been the responsibility of the Air Force and will remain so. force deployment, protection, and sustainability." 44 This competency proposes capabilities previously associated with naval forces.

In contrast, conventional force [EMA force?] is usable as an instrument of foreign policy; for by inflicting limited damage with commensurate risks to oneself, one can us it indeed as a suitable instrument for changing the other side's will.

Conflict with China is the most dangerous and could begin with a Chinese invasion of Taiwan or Korea, or its imposition of hegemony over the South China Sea and the associated islands in the area. Any conflict over Taiwan would involve the US for three reasons: first existing law requires the US to aid Taiwan; second is the notion of protecting representative governments; and third is concern for US relations with other allies--particularly Japan. Conflict with Iran would center on freedom of access into the Persian Gulf or overt threats to its Gulf neighbors.
