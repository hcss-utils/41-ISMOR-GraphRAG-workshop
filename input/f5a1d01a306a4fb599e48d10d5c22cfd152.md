Again, one must resist attributing Allied victory in Western Europe exclusively, or even mostly, to superior Anglo-American strategic performance.
True, the Germans ultimately lost, despite their tactical superiority on the ground, but the causes were many.
Neither did Allied air power alone win World War II for the Allies, but "it proved to be the critical weakness on the Axis side and the greatest single advantage enjoyed by the Allies."
89 It was the Luftwaffe's failure to gain air superiority over the Royal Air Force in 1940 that precluded a German cross-Channel invasion of England and turned Hitler's thoughts eastward, to Russia.
While inferior strategic performance was not the sole cause of Germany's defeat in World War II, it was a major factor in the final outcome.
In this regard, German failure to develop heavy bomber forces comparable to the US Eighth Air Force or the British Bomber Command can be seen as yet another example of poor strategic choices under Hitler.
