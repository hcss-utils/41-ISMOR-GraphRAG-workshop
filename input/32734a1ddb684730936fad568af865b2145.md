A significant number of articles found in the journals were empirical assessments of military operations in urban areas.
Many were derived from recent Russian experiences in Grozny, but other articles drew lessons from Mogadishu, Lebanon, Vietnam, and World War II.
Authors tended to focus either on methods of force employment or on employment of particular weapons, classes of weapons, and other support systems.
