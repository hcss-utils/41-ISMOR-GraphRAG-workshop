In evaluating the Russian response to the challenges posed in Afghanistan to its understanding of warfare, this monograph applies this theoretical approach to determine if the Russian General Staff viewed the challenges posed by irregular forces as a refutation of their theory of war or just an anomaly to be explained by making minor adjustments to their theory.
This binary framing of the problem -Afghanistan was either an anomaly or a crisis -while simplistic, suffices for this monograph.
The various nuances of rejecting certain aspects of the Russian way of warfare vice the entire framework were certainly present in the deliberations following the departure from Afghanistan; however, the impact these nuances had on the Russian military was negligible.
Additionally, as this monograph will elaborate, the Russians viewed their way of warfare as supreme because of its effectiveness during the Second World War and during their interventions into Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
Therefore, any adjustments would require a great investment in people -primarily the education and advanced training of conscripts -and resources, assets they did not have in great supply.
