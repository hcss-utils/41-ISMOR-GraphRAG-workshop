The Soviet theory of operational art emerged out of a cauldron of war and revolution during the transition from tsarist Russia to Bolshevik Russia.
In 1922, Aleksandr A. Svechin first defined Soviet operational art as a critical linkage between tactics and strategy.
Svechin believed tactics solved immediate problems, strategy pursued goals defined by policy, and operational art governed intellectual creativity that linked tactical actions into a campaign to achieve strategic goals.
He correctly interpreted Clausewitz and asserted that no amount of operational proficiency could overcome strategic miscalculation regarding the nature of war.
