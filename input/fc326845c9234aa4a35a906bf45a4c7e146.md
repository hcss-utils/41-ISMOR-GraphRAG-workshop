The Army cannot confuse the priorities of the NDS to mean that it no longer needs proficiency in irregular warfare.
The new era of Great Power Competition can confuse policy makers into believing that the COIN lessons of Iraq and Afghanistan are not relevant, because the days of major conventional battles are back.
This is the most dangerous course of action that deserves a high priority, but it is also less likely because Russia, China, Iran, and other adversaries, have all prioritized countering the U.S. through irregular and limited war.
Thus, the Army needs to balance its preparation for both conventional and unconventional warfare.
If the Army focuses solely on developing superior firepower and technology, it will again be unprepared for the irregular conflicts of the future.
As Congressman Mac Thornberry warned, "the odds are that we are going to be involved in some form of irregular warfare in the future, just as we always have been in the past.
We have learned or relearned much about it in the last Coleman 35   decade at a tremendous cost of blood and treasure.
It would be incredibly shortsighted of us not to ensure that those lessons are taught, and ingrained, and applied going forward."
