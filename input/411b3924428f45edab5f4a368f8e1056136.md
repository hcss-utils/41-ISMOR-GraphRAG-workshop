The Military Society and the Berlin Institute became Schamhorst's vehicles for planting the seeds of Bildung within the Prussian officers' corps.
Scharnhorst expanded the curriculum of this "national academy" to include a three year course centering on military history, geography, applied and pure mathematics, logic and Scharnhorst's own lectures on strategy, tactics and the duties of the general staff.
He designed this curriculum with the principal aim of "forming the intelligence and at exercising the power of judgement."
Scharnhorst saw that "it is as important for a soldier to possess these qualities as it is to acquire knowledge more directly related to the practice [of war] .... It is extremely important to guide the student toward independent thought."
1 " This emphasis on the individual and his powers of independent thought was given the greatest practical application in the study of military history.
He sought to use history, "the most complete intellectual representation of reality," to guide the student toward an understanding of "war as it actually is" and was "not in the least impressed by the pretentious theories" of the then currently p'pular B1ulnv and Jornini."''
