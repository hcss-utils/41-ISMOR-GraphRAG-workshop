A focused MARSOC vision and strategy allows prioritization of core tasks and activities that will guide education, training, and resource allocation.
A focus on irregular threats and irregular warfare places a premium on foreign internal defense (FID), counterinsurgency (COIN), and unconventional warfare (UW) core activities.
Other, more direct core activities, such as direct action (DA) and special reconnaissance (SR), support the essential irregular warfare tasks of supporting or defeating an insurgency through or against proxies.
SOCOM's core activities, however, are necessary but not sufficient to effectively focus MARSOC's capabilities to implement and achieve its revised organizational strategy.
In addition to specialization in FID and COIN activities, MARSOC should also research and develop core capabilities to politically compete in irregular warfare and to understand counter-proxy warfare efforts by adversaries such as Russia and Iran in Syria, Iraq, and Ukraine.
