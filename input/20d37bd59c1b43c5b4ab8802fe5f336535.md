Around the world, civil wars rage that have been fueled or even caused by the involvement of foreign states pursuing their national interests.
For years prior to Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, separatists organized, armed, and directly supported by Russia waged war against Ukrainian government forces.
In Yemen, a Houthi rebellion militarily supported by Iran has fought forces supported by Saudi Arabia and (until recently) the Emiratis.
Perhaps the most prominent example is the devastating war that began in Syria since 2011, which has drawn in Iran, Turkey, Russia, the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah, and a broad military coalition led by the United States.
But these are just the best-known cases of the proxy wars taking place throughout the world, especially in the Middle East, Eurasia, and Africa.
