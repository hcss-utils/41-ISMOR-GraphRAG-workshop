The United States and Russia have engaged in negotiations to limit and reduce their respective nuclear arsenals for more than 40 years. The successful conclusion of the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START) in 2010 marked the latest step in this process and, according to Pres. Barack Obama, set the stage for even more reductions. 
1
The other declared nuclear weapon states-China, France, India, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom-have so far not played a direct role in this process. Since the United States and Russia possess the largest and most diverse arsenals, comprising nearly 90 percent of the world's nuclear weapons, the more-modest nuclear capabilities of these other nations have heretofore had only a minimal effect on the overall strategic balance and notions of stability between the two nuclear superpowers.
That, however, may be changing. If the United States and Russia do indeed significantly lower their numbers of nuclear weapons in the years ahead, the relative proportion of nuclear capability represented by the other five countries could significantly increase. Such a development would have two important implications. First, it would raise the question of how the theories of nuclear deterrence, originally developed in a bilateral and Cold War context, will apply in an international system with several nations holding nuclear weapons numbering "in the hundreds." It also suggests that the nuclear arsenals of the other nuclear weapon states will become an important factor in any future US-Russian discussions on nuclear reductions.
Officials in both the United States and Russia have already acknowledged that they will eventually need to address the other states in some form or fashion. In the United States, for example, the congressionally mandated bipartisan commission on the US strategic posture stated in 2009 that "in support of its arms control interests and interest in strategic stability more generally, the United States should pursue a much broader and more ambitious set of strategic dialogues with not just Russia but also China and US allies in both Europe and Asia."

Even if the United States and Russia finally agree that the moment is right, it remains to be seen whether, and to what extent, the other nuclear weapon states are prepared to enter into discussions on strategic stability and ultimately on possible reductions in their respective nuclear arsenals. As one might imagine, the likely answers vary according to the policies and perceived national security needs of each country-and no two are alike.
The nation that looms largest in both US and Russian assessments of future deterrence requirements, as well as the wisdom of making any further nuclear reductions, is China. While the nuclear stockpiles of the two major powers dwarf that of China, the latter still has a significant and growing nuclear arsenal. Moreover, the United States and Russia-for very different reasons-view China as a strategic competitor and a potential threat to important security interests in the region. Consequently, neither Washington nor Moscow relishes the prospect of China achieving parity in terms of nuclear weapons. They clearly wish to avoid reducing their own nuclear arsenals to the level held by China or, alternatively, reducing their arsenals to a level that could eventually be matched by China through continued or even accelerated development of its own capabilities.
A central problem in assessing the likelihood of either outcome remains the significant uncertainty about the current and planned size of China's nuclear forces. China has consistently held that it needs only enough nuclear weapons to deter nuclear attack and counter nuclear coercion. This purpose does not, according to Chinese writings, require that China necessarily match the major nuclear powers in terms of weapons. Indeed, China has repeatedly said that it has no intention of engaging in Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 5 ]   a nuclear arms race with other nations. Rather, as Taylor Fravel and Evan Medeiros argue, Chinese nuclear doctrine appears instead to be guided by the principle of "assured retaliation," wherein "a small number of survivable weapons would be enough to impose unacceptable damage in a retaliatory strike and thus deter nuclear aggression."

Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 6 ]   Ever since it first tested nuclear weapons in 1964, China has professed that it will never be the first country to use them against any nuclear weapon state and that it will never use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any nonnuclear weapon state or nuclear weapon-free zone. This so-called no-first-use pledge has become a routine staple of practically every official Chinese pronouncement on nuclear policy. Moreover, Chinese officials routinely criticize the United States and Russia for not explicitly declaring a no-first-use policy of their own and for allegedly retaining a "nuclear warfighting" posture, including the capability to conduct a first strike.
Yet, an explicit reference to the no-first-use policy was notably absent in the most recent Chinese defense white paper. In a New York Times op-ed, James Acton of the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment for International Peace ventured that the omission might reflect a change to China's 50-year-old declaratory policy. He suggested that Beijing's oft-repeated concerns about the potential threat posed by US ballistic missile defenses and conventional precision strike programs to Chinese nuclear retaliatory forces might be causing its defense community to rethink long-held assumptions about nuclear no-first-use. 
11

13
Both sides to this debate have a point. Much of the language on nuclear doctrine in the latest white paper looks cribbed from earlier editions, particularly the 2008 version. Thus, Acton is right to question why this latest paper would copy that language but remove the explicit references to China's no-first-use policy found in previous versions. Conversely, Yao is correct to point out that the other recent instances in which China has repeated its no-first-use pledge do little to support Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 7 ]   the contention that the Chinese government has abruptly and indirectly abandoned its 50-year-old pledge.
Whatever the truth, the episode underscores the lingering suspicions in both US and Russian circles about China's long-term nuclear plans. If China is indeed having second thoughts about its no-first-use policy in light of developing US conventional military capabilities, it might also be considering a very different nuclear force than one predicated solely on an assured second-strike retaliatory capability.
The uncertainty surrounding China's nuclear capabilities and doctrine have implications for future arms control measures involving the two largest nuclear powers. Until the United States and Russia can be more certain about where China's nuclear arsenal is, and where it is likely to go, critics in both countries will resist further reductions in their own arsenals, and strategic stability between all three countries will remain an area of concern.
US and Russian experts have repeatedly called for China to be more open about its current nuclear capabilities and future intentions. In a related vein, others have suggested that China, along with France and the United Kingdom, could voluntarily join the United States and Russia in disclosing information on their strategic nuclear forces in the manner spelled out in New START as a first step in enhancing transparency and building confidence. 
14
15
Likewise, China does not appear the least bit interested at the moment in engaging in more formal discussions on ways to limit or reduce its own nuclear weapons. While Chinese official statements do envision future multilateral negotiations on nuclear arms reductions, they also attach certain preconditions. For example, an earlier defense white paper (2010) stated that "countries possessing the largest nuclear arsenals bear special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament. They should further drastically reduce their nuclear arsenals . . . so as to create Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 8 ]   the necessary conditions for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons." And, before this can take place, "all nuclear-weapon states should abandon any nuclear deterrence policy based on first use of nuclear weapons."

In addition to active Track 2 efforts, there has been a noticeable uptick in the number of official visits and military-to-military exchanges during the past two years. For example, in September of this year, Gen Mark Welsh became the first US Air Force chief of staff to visit China in 15 years. 
18
Finally, China appears to be showing greater interest in playing a somewhat more visible and constructive role in multilateral arms control discussions. In 2012, it agreed to lead a working group of the five permanent members (P5) of the UN Security Council in developing a glossary of terms to facilitate further P5 discussions on nuclear matters.

The linear development of newer weapons deserves as much attention as the darker dual-use characteristics emanating from any modern technology or advanced scientific discipline. But the chief challenge of the twenty-first century is to determine whether advanced technologies and breakthroughs in science will be largely benign and beneficial to society or will they inadvertently, or willfully, spawn entire groups of sinister future weapons we cannot yet imagine. If new, more dangerous, and strategically significant weapons emerge, it makes sense to ask a few basic questions, including: will future advanced weapons technologies remain in the hands of peaceful nations, will they be available to all nations, and will they be restricted or controlled in any way?
We know the subject of technological convergence (TC) has arisen over the past 12 years, principally from a 2001 National Science Foundation (NSF) and Department of Commerce study which used the term extensively in its 2003 report, Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance. In that case, the main focus was on using convergent technologies (CT) to advance the human condition in health, life sciences, education, and overall social well-being. Of course, there were considerable and impressive commercial benefits to be derived from CT, Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 12 ]   and the report did delve into military aspects of the issue; however, the overwhelming emphasis was on human health and performance in a brand new century full of hope and optimism about harnessing new technologies to improve life and bring it closer to a more perfect state. 
1
The definition of technological convergence is a sensible starting point for the issues raised and the arguments about its strategic significance. Using a utilitarian definition, technological convergence is the tendency for different systems to eventually evolve, blend, and synergistically reinforce and interact with each other, sharing and extracting resources and energy to produce new and unique metatechnological products and outcomes.
It is precisely the future amalgamation, integration, deliberate blending, and synergistic transformation of discrete technologies into a multichimeralike dual-use metatechnology that has the potential to disrupt the global balance of power and alter our definition of asymmetric warfare. If we remain aloof and distracted by the myriad societal benefits and staggering achievements which could be derived from benign and beneficial advances in genomics, neuroscience, or cybernetics we will have missed a strategic shift at least as significant as aviation or the atomic bomb. The terrain which should hold our paramount interest is twofold. We must grasp the strategic significance of maturing metatechnologies in the fields of robotics, cybernetics, neuroscience, genomics, artificial intelligence, and nanoscience which culminate in products, achievements, and breakthroughs with dual-use properties. We must also reckon with the implications for inadvertent or deliberately engineered combinations, blends, and synergistic integration of these technologies which when combined display strategically significant dual-use properties. The degree to which these two parallel developments during the period 2013 to 2025 emerge as legitimate objects of study will make a critical difference to the United States for the remainder of the twenty-first century. For the sake of clarification, each technology below should be understood:
Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 13 ]   • Genomics/proteomics/synthetic biology entail all aspects of DNA-based systems design and engineered adaptation to enhance, enrich, hybridize, or create new life forms.
• Cybernetics and artificial intelligence refer to progressively complex engineered computer systems integrated with information systems and databases to bridge the man-machine interface, thereby making both machines and man more capable of complex thought, independent assessment, and analysis which neither could attain by itself.
• Neuroscience refers to the broad group of scientific and technological methods, systems, and structural pathways which involve manipulation and enhancement of major brain functions such as thought, perception, judgment, mood, and behavior.
• Nanoscience refers to the subatomic level of materials where design, structure manipulation, and combinations of basic molecules below the ordinary molecular level enable development, hybridization, and creation of wholly new structural machines and submicroscopic systems.
• Robotics refers to the entire class of engineered and designed automatons which mimic human shapes and dimensions and rely on cybernetic subsystems enhanced with advanced electronics but which display and enact behaviors, actions, and maneuvers at a level of depth, complexity, and accuracy that rivals or exceeds what ordinary humans can do.
We have seen the growth of space research and the degree to which its national security aspects dwell alongside the global quest for more and better information about the universe and its reciprocal impacts on our earthly society. No doubt, discoveries and revelations will emerge from this field, but unlike the areas of CT mentioned so far, space provides significant and daunting limitations and constraints on what can be discovered and achieved. Without doubt the steady growth and development of CT will be revolutionary in scope with the potential to radically change industrial, economic, and social structures in the twenty-first Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 14 ]   century. It is abundantly clear CT activities such as bioinformatics, DNA diagnostics, molecular electronics, and neural computation are revolutionizing the traditional interaction between researchers, industry, and society. New models for research management are evolving based upon networks which break down the barriers between traditional disciplines Among other things, this means both a cross-disciplinary and transdisciplinary array of interactions, collaborations, and exchanges will take place over the next decade. Genomics and neuroscience will combine, cyber systems and artificial intelligence will collaborate, and robotics and nanobiological research will merge over the course of the next 10 years. While there is currently no serious public debate about CT, it must be seen in this context. It has, and will continue to be, relentlessly driven primarily by research policy actors, foundation funding, and by experts from various disciplines and is part of a more comprehensive political and social discourse on nanotechnology, biotechnology, information and communications technology (ICT), brain research, artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, and the sciences that deal with these topics.
Obviously, the government has an interest in CT and will undoubtedly nurture as many aspects of the separate key technologies as possible to foster their individual lanes of growth toward maturity and a state of metatechnology. It is far less clear what the world's other advanced nations will be doing while the United States alternately infuses and deflates continuing research and development activities in these separate but strategic areas. Convergence will likely be welcomed and supported in the European Union (EU) and Russia, as well as Asia, and the oversight, direction, and trajectory of each distinct technology will be shaped and guided by experts, investors, leaders of global enterprise, and academics while the audience of interested states contemplates how each technology might conceivably convey some unknown or unexpected form of strategic leverage. It also appears likely the EU, Russia, and Asia may want to follow a very different path than that of the United States, and for good reason. Make no mistake; the key question tied to the strategic significance of CT is one that does not reside solely inside the ambit of US security thinking. Nor is it subject to US control, protection, or governance.
Whether an international consensus on CT should be derived prior to, or after, a national security decision which elevates this area as a strategic benchmark for the twenty-first century remains to be seen. It Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 15 ]   is within reason, and expectation that the EU, Russia, and Asia will want to put their own stamp on the development, control, and evolution of CT. If this is the case, whither the US strategic posture on CT itself? Some pundits would put the dead reckoning with CT far off and argue that we need not concern ourselves with its eventual maturation for another 25 years. This is more risk-management and gambling than serious strategic analysis.
Maybe the degree of public interest and congressional clamoring, together with the desultory drumbeat of the media, is insufficient to awaken US strategic thinkers to address CT issues. Perhaps they feel it is too soon to even formulate the question, as there are so many other pressing national security issues like Afghanistan, sequestration, immigration, trade, terrorism, loose nukes, Syria, and transnational organized crime. Evidently, this array of security issues is strong enough to drown out sustained discussion of CT for the time being.
Perhaps some would diminish or belittle the subtle threats which emanate from each discrete technology until that particular technology has been developed to a state of near perfection where all manifestations of its dual-use nature become apparent. For others this still falls short of caution, because the nefarious and negative side of dual use is seen as minimally dangerous if at all.
With this initial array of discrete but largely parallel technologies, it is enough to posit dual-use systems arising from their separate lanes of near perfection that could display patterns of behavior and actions which either enhance existing weapons or create new ones. Cybernetics and robotics could lead to a new warrior class of supra-human fighters against which conventional arms would be useless. Neuroscience and nanoscience could combine with genomics and create nanoscale aerial invaders which could inhabit our brains and remotely influence or direct our thoughts. As far as the most advanced researchers in each field are concerned, they uniformly claim there is no limit to the upwardly sophisticated actions and tasks which their field of technology can accomplish. They may disagree on how long it would take or how easy blending different technologies would be, but few are saying it is impossible to attain. Sounding the alarm about this impending watershed era in weaponization and over-the-horizon strategic threats is crucial. To argue against the likelihood and probability of this outcome is akin to saying every low-probability/high-consequence threat never merits serious Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 16 ]   policy attention. History has sadly shown that such threats are understood only after they have unleashed chaos and mortal damage. Over the next 15 years, risking that these emerging technologies by themselves amount to nothing more than substrategic threats is to seriously misunderstand the nature of the threat itself.
Maybe CT is understood to be largely benign, controllable, and ultimately governable, with the net result that strategic thinkers have dismissed the inherent risks embedded in CT as well as the strategic significance of dual-use matured metatechnologies. Perhaps this has been quietly studied at the classified level and found devoid of strategic significance because no one knows or can guess where each of the discreet technologies will be 10 years from now.
There is also a legitimate argument to be made that CT is not in public parlance and receives no serious media attention because open discussion of advanced science and technology has been constrained to a limited audience of academics, inventors, and scientists. One reason for this may well be the fact that CT itself has been inadequately clarified and is simply too ambiguous for anyone to generate concrete questions or ascertain its dimensions. It does not appear to trigger serious political or scientific debate, which therefore further constrains efforts to clarify the concept or make it more concrete in relation to clearly delineated areas of research and potential applications.
We must stop and assess the nature and scope of the issue, particularly if we argue that it is indeed a future threat. Ever since the 2003 NSF-Commerce report was first issued, there have been periodic discussions of CT in the media, and it has captured the attention and imagination of a few influential observers. The tone is understandably euphoric about the great achievements which could result. As cited in the report, futurist Ray Kurzweil predicted the arrival of singularity, which he defines in his book on the subject as "the culmination of the merger of our biological thinking and existence with our technology, resulting in a world that is still human but that transcends our biological roots." He writes, "There will be no distinction, post-Singularity, between human and machine or between physical and virtual reality."

However, it seems obvious distinctions that separate scientific disciplines will break down, as advances in one field enable new thinking in others. Moreover, Dr. James Canton claims in the NSF report, "This new holistic model will combine advances in four different fields-nanotechnology, biotechnology, information technology, and cognitive science (known collectively as NBIC)-to achieve "a golden age that [will] be an epochal turning point in human history." With all this attention devoted to the spirit of human cooperation and the symbiotic global harmony that will characterize the future of the sciences some were so idealistic as to presume that one day, "Technological convergence could become the framework for human convergence-the twenty-first century could end in world peace, universal prosperity, and evolution to a higher level of compassion and accomplishment." 
4
Finally, while the 2003 report proposes a national R&D initiative to bring this convergent future into being, the national security aspects of CT were ignored or underplayed. The central message was to promote CT wherever possible in the new twenty-first century along with broad NBIC injections and support inside the American education systemall this without much fanfare about the dual-use nature of CT, what the spinoffs of matured metatechnologies could mean in strategic terms, or whether the possession of CT by a prosperous peaceful nation mattered as much as whether it became part of the Iranian or North Korean arsenal.
The earliest CT initiative dealt with bioethical issues. This was partly due to the fact that the President's Council on Bioethics, which is generally considered to represent conservative values, criticized it. The focus of this Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 18 ]   criticism was the close linking of the CT conception of this so-called NBIC initiative with visions of far-reaching human enhancement-a technological modification of the human body and an ongoing merging of the human mind with machines. During the same period, elements of the NBIC initiative attempted an awkward alliance with transhumanists who sought to promote human perfection and progressively technical modification of the human body through applied technology. Among their beliefs were the use of hallucinogenic drugs and the elimination of human death by resorting to science and technology. It is especially these particular features of the initiative that led the CT debate to exhibit such an extremely visionary character and to focus on the topic of human enhancement. Another bizarre interest of the trans-humanists was to eventually create cyborgs that were cognitively superior to humans. This is simply to overstate the obvious-thousands of intriguing distractions, discoveries, and breakthroughs will eventually emerge from each aggregate subtechnologies discussed. But without serious and sustained discussion of the national security issues and aspects of CT and the ultimate ripening of metatechnologies, we will miss a crucial milestone in human history. There is a real danger that scientific achievements and discoveries will attract more attention and merit more public discussion than the wide array of security questions embedded in CT itself.
Is that because we fail to grasp what CT really is-or is it something more subtle and complex? If we are fortunate enough to master the evolution and maturation of metatechnologies and collaboratively manage and control the growth of CT, then concerns about neglected security issues will evaporate. However, nothing relieves the United States from the need to develop a strategic perspective on international commerce and trade involving CT or assessing the degree to which CT emerges as a bona fide weapon system in the EU, Russia, Asia, and among designated enemies. The opportunity to assess its true meaning and longterm strategic significance is now, and it deserves top priority among Pentagon and national security experts.
To remain passive and await emerging news and progressively moresophisticated developments and outcomes from these discrete areas of science and technology which exhibit societal benefits is to shun the use Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 19 ]   of coherent and comprehensive strategic analysis for the next decade. The principal argument is the imperative to begin paying serious strategic attention right now to CT or risk suffering some form of global security erosion detrimental to US interests. The areas of specific focus include genomics, synthetic biology, biomimetics, virtual reality applications for biological systems, nanobiotechnology and nanomedicine, artificial intelligence, nanoelectronics, nanophotonics, cybernetics, robotics, neuroscience, and the fields of simulations and modeling. It is a fair estimate that by the year 2023, major elements of CT integration and deliberate blending will have already occurred and considerable experimentation will have taken place. Regrettably, we lack the policy, doctrine, and strategy to address this event.
If we fail to study and examine the immediate and long-term implications of these complex dual-use areas of legitimate scientific inquiry, along with the related technologies they promote, we will have suffered a serious lapse in our national security that will be extremely difficult to overcome. Our nation's security and our national well-being require that we make the CT issue a top strategic priority for the twenty-first century.

Moving Toward Greater Cooperation or Conflict?
A great debate is taking place within the US government between those who believe China will become an adversary and those who believe Chinese-US relations will remain focused on trade and peaceful coexistence.

Former secretary of defense Robert Gates expressed the view of many within the Department of Defense when he said in March 2007, "I do not see China at this point as a strategic adversary of the United States. It's a partner in some respects. It's a competitor in other respects. And so we are simply watching to see what they're doing."

This article offers analysts indicators pertaining to each variable that can determine the trend of the Chinese-US relationship. Each variable is analyzed in terms of cooperation, conflict, and US options. We must note that no single current or future action described below necessarily serves as an absolute certainty of Chinese intent to cooperate or fight, but these actions are highly suggestive. Based on this perceived direction, certain options then become available to the United States.
While the debate over the nature and characteristics of strategic culture remain unsettled, the concept-credited to Jack Snyder (1977)has received considerable attention over the past three decades.

Chinese strategic culture differs greatly from that of the West in ways that too few Americans understand. The influence of Hellenic philosophy, Judeo-Christianity, Enlightenment rationalism, American exceptionalism, and the US experience in war have shaped a strategic culture that prefers direct engagement with the enemy, major combat operations, and total defeat of an adversary.

To explain this concept further, it is important to recognize that in Sino tradition, as illustrated by the writings of Sun Tzu, understanding the potential of a situation enables the state or the general to profit when advantageous circumstances arise. This is a critical skill/capability for a leader. Ambiguity, deception, secrecy, and the other characteristics Sun Tzu praises are all tools for maximizing advantageous circumstances.

It is important to keep in mind China's strategic culture and the influences that shape how its civil and military leaders view defense and foreign affairs. China observers-principally those concerned with the direction of the Chinese-US relationship-can garner a stronger sense of whether that relationship is moving in the direction of cooperation or conflict by observing three areas of interests within the context of Chinese strategic culture: China's growing economic power, its activities in cyberspace, and its ongoing military modernization. Recognizing anything more than a sense of directionality, however, may require clairvoyance. 
Sustaining rapid economic growth is a core tenet of China's current path and a primary variable that can either ensure Chinese-US cooperation or, should the two countries' economic interests diverge, lead to economic and/or military conflict. The role and importance of the Chinese economy to the regime is central to how China's foreign and military policy may evolve in the years ahead. This is why Chinese economic activity is selected as one of the three variables. Given the real or perceived fragility of the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) control over the country, the regime views maintaining strong economic growth as inextricably linked to its preservation-making this a core interest and key indicator. 
32
Former premier Wen Jiabao expressed hope for improvement in Chinese-US relations: "We also don't hope for this year to become an unpeaceful year in the China-US economic and trade relationship. This will require both sides to work together." 
33
34
35
36
Barring an economically debilitating regime change, China is expected to surpass the United States in economic and military might by midcentury-although such a transition is not inevitable. While the latest empirical research indicates that China's growth is likely to slow considerably over the coming decades, it will continue to outstrip that of the United States, giving China little reason to employ economic warfare in any form. 
37
38
39
Lastly, there is no indication that over the next decade China's need for food or energy will be constrained by the current international trading system. Should such constraints emerge, China would probably wage war if necessary to feed its people or power its industries. To avoid a potential conflict over energy issues, it is investing more in green energy than any other nation on earth and working to improve its agricultural industry. The Chinese government's actions and history suggest it is pursuing a strategy of cooperation and conflict avoidance when possible, while saving face.
Considering China's strategic culture and the geopolitical environment, antagonistic actions by the PRC toward the United States are more likely to be economic than military. Given its cultural preference for winning without fighting, economic warfare offers the PRC an approach that challenges the United States resorting to kinetic operations. In both Johnston's view of Chinese strategic culture and that of his critics, such an approach would be consistent with long-held tradition. These policies would be designed to slow economic growth in the United States and its allies or to create instability in their economies-speeding China's ascent.

China has been diversifying its currency holdings for some time and recently created an office devoted to finding new investment options for its large currency reserves. 
44
[ 28 ]
The 2010 Chinese embargo of rare earth minerals to Japan-over a maritime dispute-provides a small preview of what future economic conflict may entail. 
45
Finally, China could weaken US hegemony through gradually pursuing increasingly extensive high-technology partnerships with EU countries and Japan. The PRC is already the most prolific exporter to both the EU and Japan, offering reason to believe these countries could eventually judge such arrangements as better serving their economic interests than close relations with the United States. 
46
If the United States desires to prevent China from viewing such economic tactics as an opportunity, it would be well advised to strengthen its long-term fiscal position, pursue additional sources of rare earth minerals, and eschew protectionist policies. 
47
China's rapid rise as an economic power is in part the result of effective economic reforms but also of its use of cyberspace to conduct widespread state-sponsored espionage against governmental and industrial Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 29 ]   targets to "catch up" with advanced nations.

A variety of cyber cooperation options can serve as indicators of the direction the Chinese-US relationship is moving. Developing cooperation with China on cyber issues is necessary-but from a position of strength. Recent studies have concluded that intense international pressure prompted the PRC to escalate efforts to curb doping in sports, suggesting that similar efforts to prevent malicious hacking might encourage Chinese compliance with emerging international cyber security rules and norms. 
53
[ 30 ]
Congressional testimony by Larry Wortzel, a member of the US-China Economic and Security Review Commission, also makes clear that cooperation in cyberspace is possible, as evidenced by supportive activities for specific law enforcement purposes. Wortzel told the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, "In some areas of cyber-crime, such as credit card theft rings and the theft of banking information, China's law enforcement services have cooperated with the United States."

If China ignores US overtures such as those described above, this will serve as a clear signal it does not view cooperation with the United States as necessary to advance its core interests. Indeed, the ratcheting up of Chinese cyber espionage activities since the onset of track-two initiatives could indicate China's intentions to continue such actions until a US strategy is implemented that either offers incentives to cease or makes it more painful for China to conduct cyber espionage. 
61
China can also interfere with US cyberspace lines of communication (LOC). While closing sea and air LOCs to commercial traffic would clearly be seen as antagonistic and cause a loss of global goodwill, cyber attacks aimed at commercial interests (LOCs) can serve much the same purpose without arousing the same ire from the international community. Furthermore, targeted hacking of national security information systems can lead to the acquisition of key technologies with military applications. China's use of hacking to steal technologies has received [ 32 ]   veiled mention in the DoD's annual report to Congress on developments involving the Chinese military. 
62
63
Although the United States has been the technological pioneer in cyberspace, China is proving itself a pioneer in strategic thinking. One Chinese military theorist stated that "in confrontations on the future battlefield, what is scarier than inferior technology is inferior thinking."

Gen Joseph Ralston, USAF, retired, former vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, makes a compelling case for the long-term benefits of building trust with China through military-to-military contacts.

China's acquisition and development of advanced military technology also offers significant insight into the likely direction of the Chinese-US relationship and will ultimately prove central to any conflict that might occur. Thus, it was selected as the third variable. The military technologies China pursues over the coming decades should indicate whether it perceives the United States as a friend or a clear military threat and the steps it will take to deter or defeat the US military.

While the People's Liberation Army (Navy, Air Force, Second Artillery Corps) is in the midst of an impressive modernization program, whether capability improvements will increase the prospects for conflict between the United States and China is uncertain. It is, however, important to point out that the specific weapons systems China acquires and develops send a very clear signal as to where a prospective threat might originate. For example, the acquisition and development of a large number of anti-aircraft carrier missiles, "carrier killers," by the Second Artillery Corps or fifth-generation fighters by the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) signal that China sees a threat arising from a peer competitor. On the other hand, a PLA focus on such systems as military airlift, sea transport, and smaller combatant ships-all of which can serve a military, humanitarian, or counterpiracy mission-sends a very different signal. This specific point concerning platform acquisition and modernization also has cultural importance. The Seven Military Classics and Daoist writings place importance throughout on avoiding direct confrontation, particularly when facing a superior adversary. Thus, the PRC's modernization program is taking a form that appears designed to mitigate US strengths. This could promote cooperation and stability or create mistrust which degrades the Sino-US relationship.
Consistent with Chinese strategic culture, the PRC has shown a willingness to be patient with regard to securing core interests. In the case of Taiwan, it has waited more than 60 years for reunification and appears content to continue the ongoing integration process. The only indications of a willingness to use force have occurred at moments when Taiwan moved toward a formal declaration of independence. However, as Taiwan backed away from independence, relations with China returned to normal. 
74
In recent years, the PLAN-an increasingly capable blue-water force-has actively participated in counterpiracy operations, multilateral exercises, and, along with the PLAAF, is integrating into the global military community. 
75
Increased openness by the PLA is another indicator. Where, for example, the United States publishes a large number of national, defense, and military strategies elaborating US interests and concerns, China has historically remained opaque. The publication of periodic PLA defense white papers over the last decade is a positive development, but greater military transparency would indicate a desire to cooperate. 
76
The positive steps are offset by China's periodic aggressive acts, which often undermine confidence-building efforts. The ongoing modernization efforts of the PLAAF and PLAN are particularly concerning for the United States and China's neighbors.
The regular employment of ambiguity, disinformation, and secrecycharacteristics of Chinese strategic culture-in PRC foreign affairs has left the United States and countries throughout Asia reticent to believe that China's military modernization is solely for defensive purposes. With good reason, many nations in the region see the PLA undertaking an aggressive program of indigenous development and foreign (Russian) purchases that is enabling China to develop significant anti-access and area denial capabilities as well as the ability to project power regionally-a posture seen as highly provocative by US policymakers.

The danger for the United States is that it could be drawn into a conflict triggered by a miscalculation such tensions might cause. For example, just before the recent dispute, the United States had promised the Philippines it would come to its aid in the event of conflict. Had fighting broken out during the standoff, the United States would have had to risk serious damage to the Sino-US relationship or renege on its commitment to the Philippines.
Should the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) declaration of conduct (signed by China) become the framework for resolving [ 38 ]   South China Sea disputes, claims in this area may have a path for resolution. 
97
China claims it does not seek global power status and that its current military-development programs would limit its ability to conduct longrange force projection (except in cyberspace) for a generation. When pressed, however, Chinese leaders acknowledge they may reach global power status by 2030 or sooner. They then suggest that 2030 is too far away to think about and, at present, they do not seek a global leadership role. 
98
Monitoring China's actions in these three vital areas-keeping in mind the cultural context-will offer US decision makers a sense of whether the Chinese-US relationship is moving toward increasing cooperation or conflict. Ensuring the world's two great powers do not go to war will require US decision makers to understand Chinese strategic culture and its long tradition. Preventing conflict will call for an understanding of China that includes a deep and abiding appreciation for Sino metaphysics and philosophy, which have persisted in spite of six decades of Maoism and the new nationalism that is replacing it as capitalism leads to greater prosperity.
China is a state that will seek opportunities to advance its interests and restore traditional relationships with its regional neighbors, and perhaps beyond, all while attempting to avoid clearly challenging the international status quo. This is likely to mean China and the United States will compete on the world stage for economic resources and influence but will prevent that competition from escalating to war. However, if Alastair Iain Johnston is correct, preventing conflict will largely depend upon the United States protecting its interests while presenting China with a natural, cooperative path to continued prosperity.
Historically, great powers have found it difficult to become close friends. At the same time, a nonconfrontational relationship is possible.
Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 39 ]   Continued trade and cooperation on antiterror efforts, humanitarian relief, and antipiracy operations offer a solid foundation upon which to build relations. This does not, however, suggest that the United States should not carefully monitor the Chinese-US relationship. Observing the directionality of China's use of economic power, activity in cyberspace, and military modernization should give US policymakers and military leaders a sense of whether China and the United States may find themselves at an increasing risk of turning competition into conflict.

China is on course to follow this same historical example. And like past empires and great powers, China may seek to use its newfound power in more aggressive ways to reshape the international system-often in ways that appear to the detriment of its interests. See Jane Burbank and Frederick Cooper, Empires in World History (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2010).
41. Those who believe the PRC would not take such an action argue that it would impose an economic cost on China, thus it is unlikely to occur.

Although many people within the neoliberal institutionalist camp believe that China-US trade will ensure that the two nations do not go to war, this view either implicitly or explicitly suggests that neither China nor the United States has interests of greater importance than bilateral trade.

No institution is more important to the survival of regimes than their armed forces. As the recent upheavals in the Arab world have once again demonstrated, whether states are able to suppress uprisings or become victims to them largely depends on their armed forces' attitudes toward the protesters and the state itself. The military's role is also critically important to the transition prospects of political systems. No political regime can be consolidated in the absence of armed forces which support its political leadership. The generals' backing is an indispensable prerequisite of regime consolidation for polities of all types, whether democratic or authoritarian: quite simply, the new regime needs the military establishment's support.
Much of this article is about defense reform, particularly defense reform for states engaged in democratic transition. An alert reader might immediately summon a widely used definition of democracy-one that identifies requirements such as genuine competition for power, mass participation on a legally equal footing, and civil and other liberties that restrict the sphere of state power within the society-and reasonably wonder whether speaking about democratization in the contemporary Arab context is justified. Indeed, there are no genuine, consolidated democracies anywhere in the Arab world today, and although some of the post-Arab Spring leaders in Tunisia, Yemen, and elsewhere have paid lip service to democratization as their political end-goal, it is certainly prudent to maintain a healthy dose of suspicion regarding these claims. Democratic civil-military relations and defense reform for democratic states are important not just to set high standards, but also to be able to measure progress even if those standards may not be soon achieved by Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 47 ]   transitioning countries in the Middle East or elsewhere. Presented here is an ideal type of civil-military relations reform without illusions concerning the state of Arab polities or their determination to approximate them.
There is no mystery about what are the key attributes of democratic civil-military relations. What does make a great difference, however, is the starting point of defense reform. Are reforms being implemented in a political system just emerging from military or dictatorial rule, socialism, a major interstate war or civil war, or perhaps from a colonial past? The differences in these contexts cause the task of rebuilding the military and the manner in which reforms are implemented to be rather different as well. The fundamental question is how to build an effective, cohesive, and accountable military under the conditions of regime transformation. This article considers four Arab states-Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen-that fell into three different categories in terms of their political environments following the recent upheavals: Tunisia was essentially a single-party state, Egypt approximated a country emerging from military rule, while Libya and Yemen could be viewed as post-civilwar cases. First, it explains what specifically should be reformed, considering components of a reform package democratizing states need. To illustrate key points, examples from around the world show what defense reforms have been tried and what measures have worked or failed in different settings. Next the attention shifts to how defense reform should be conceived and conducted, with special reference to countries emerging from single-party regimes, military rule, and post-civil-war environments. Finally, the article seeks to identify special areas of concern and opportunity for the military establishments of Egypt, Libya, Tunisia, and Yemen.
Crafting democratic civil-military relations is an endeavor largely determined by the context in which it is pursued. It is essential to discuss the main components of the reform program to be implemented in virtually all political systems transitioning toward democracy.
A democracy should not aspire to a politically neutral military but to one that is firmly committed to democratic governance. The armed Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 48 ]   forces must be depoliticized, and its members must not play any political role other than exercising their civic right to vote. Active-duty military personnel must not run for, accept, or hold political office and should not appear at political rallies in uniform. The selection and promotion of the top military leadership must be controlled by civilians-ideally some combination of officials from the executive and legislative branches and, again, ideally (but not necessarily) following consultation with senior officers. One related issue is the need to codify the political institutions' areas of responsibility over the armed forces for all potential scenarios (peacetime, emergencies, war).
In most democracies, the head of state is the military's commander in chief, and a civilian minister of defense is responsible for day-to-day operations. Selecting a defense minister who possesses a measure of expertise or at least some demonstrated interest in defense-security matters and international affairs signals to the armed forces that the state takes them seriously. Ideally, the defense minister and the ministry are integrated into the governmental power structure, enjoy the confidence of the president/prime minister, and are willing to defend the legitimate professional interests of the military. It is important that chains of command within the armed forces are clearly spelled out and potential ambiguities eliminated. The top-ranking uniformed person of the military should be subordinate to the civilian defense minister, a cabinet member who represents the government in the armed forces and the armed forces in the cabinet.
The military must be accountable before the law, obedient to and supportive of the democratic polity, and its professional responsibilities constitutionally regulated. The armed forces should be staffed by individuals who are inclined to obey, and the state should adjust the incentives of the military so, regardless of their nature, they prefer to obey. 
1
All too often the elites of newly emerging democratic regimes have little understanding of and/or interest in learning about the military as a professional organization. This is a costly mistake, because it is in the direct interest of the state to maintain armed forces that are not Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 49 ]   only supportive of democratic governance but also capable of executing the missions assigned them. It is important not only that the military avoid politics, but also that it is content with the conditions of service. Although in a democracy the military should not have to be bribed or appeased, the state ought to extend the armed forces high professional status through the provision of up-to-date equipment and decent salaries and benefits; raise the social esteem of the military profession; avoid intruding into internal affairs, such as training and routine promotions; and, by all means, avoid using the military as a tool in domestic political competition. A democratic state must honor the military's esprit de corps while preserving democratic values and respect for human rights within the military culture. 
2

Since a principal objective of civilian leaders is to prevent the armed forces from interfering in domestic politics, the conditions under which the military may be used internally must be specified by law. Generally speaking, in the modern democratic state, the only legitimate internal role for the military is to provide relief after natural disasters-a mission it is ideally positioned to fulfill and which tends also to increase its societal esteem. It should not be used to quell domestic disturbances or perform crowd-control and other security functions which should be the responsibility of the police and other domestic security organizations. In particular, the armed forces should have no role in anti-drug-trafficking policies, because such activities inevitably increase the likelihood of corruption. In a similar vein, soldiers ideally would not participate in domestic programs such as rural infrastructure development that might foster politicization. States that maintain paramilitary organizations, gendarmeries, militias, national guards, and the like must clearly regulate the use of those organizations. The constitution must be clear about both the sort of domestic tasks permissible for the armed forces and the conditions necessary for their deployment.
There are a number of states with otherwise appropriate civil-military relations where the military is asked to fulfill functions it should not. One example is the Indian armed forces' continued involvement in the suppression of domestic conflicts. This constitutes such a troubling aspect of Indian military politics that, according to Stephen Cohen, "India is not a democracy in many of its districts where the army and the paramilitary forces supplanted the judiciary, the civil administration, and the ballot box as the ultimate arbiter." 
4
Business activities distract soldiers from their primary mission-the defense of the homeland-and create conditions for corruption, negative interservice or inter-unit rivalry, and harm to the professionalism and societal prestige of the military establishment. Thus, the armed forces should not be involved in the economy. China is one major power where the negative effects of the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) decades-long and perfectly legal economic activities were recognized by the political leadership. In the late 1990s the Chinese Communist Party leadership debated the issue and in 1998 promulgated the Divestiture Act that banned the PLA from all commercial activities. Recent analyses have confirmed that the new policy has contributed significantly to the PLA's growing professionalism. 
6
Military politics is played out between the triangle of the state, the armed forces, and society, where the state side is usually dominated by the executive branch, with far less clout enjoyed by the legislature. An important criterion of democratic governance is that civilian control over the armed forces be balanced between the executive and legislative branches. As Robert Dahl wrote, "the civilians who control the military [and police] must themselves be subject to the democratic process." 
8
In only a few polities does the legislature play the kind of role necessary for substantively balanced civilian control of the military. This role comprises not just the debating and passing of defense-related bills but also, crucially important, taking an active part in three aspects of the armed forces fiscal affairs. First, parliament determines the process of how defense budgets are devised, including the questions of what institutions (e.g., general staff, defense ministry, governmental advisory bodies, NGOs, the executive office, and/or legislative defense committees) are involved and in what sequence. Second, the deputies participate in the formulation of the actual defense budget. And third, legislators maintain oversight of the disbursement and implementation of defense outlays. Countries with a long-term record of active and vigorous parliamentary oversight are rare; of those with post-World War II transitions to democracy, Germany and Spain are particularly prominent.
It is important to realize that at the time of transition in most countries, the legislature, if it indeed exists at all, is seldom the powerful representative of the people. In the Arab world, in particular, legislatures have been, at best, pro-forma rubber-stamp institutions staffed by sycophants and used to lend the rulers a thin and spurious veneer of legitimacy. This is even more so in the eight Arab kingdoms-all of them absolute monarchies-in which only the Kuwaiti legislature has been able to carve out real political influence, but even there the emir can, and frequently has, dissolved parliament when he found its activities inconvenient. 
9
Independent civilian defense experts, nongovernmental organizations (NGO), and journalists focusing on security issues can play an important role in advising elected officials and the public about military affairs.
Their involvement can encourage transparency and promote confidence between state, society, and the armed forces. Introducing defense-related courses at universities, allowing civilians-journalists, bureaucrats, politicians, and others-to enroll in appropriate programs at military academies, and providing some public funding on a competitive basis to NGOs studying defense issues can all contribute to the overall improvement of democratic civil-military relations. In sum, in a democratic state the public has easy access to balanced, objective information regarding defense and national security matters.
States and societies make considerable financial and other sacrifices to educate, train, equip, and otherwise maintain their armed forces. Marginalizing military officers by not asking for their advice in the process of devising defense and/or foreign policy, let alone military strategy, is irresponsible public policy and wasteful of public resources. In other words, officers acquire their specialized knowledge at a significant cost to taxpayers who should get some return on this investment. Using military expertise does not mean politicians are obligated to adopt recommendations, but foregoing the opportunity to listen to expert military advice on issues concerning their own and other militaries' capabilities is unwise. The practice of regularly requesting that officers share their knowledge with their civilian masters is also beneficial for overall civilmilitary relations. It makes the military feel useful, important, relevant, and more vested in the success of the regime.
It would be difficult to find a case more illustrative of how things go wrong when the armed forces are ignored or marginalized than under presidents Néstor Kirchner (2003-07) and his widow, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner (2007-present), in Argentina. In 2005 Kirchner appointed Nilda Garré, a former leftist militant, to lead the defense ministry. Throughout her term, Garré and the all-civilian defense ministry leadership showed nothing but contempt toward the armed forces as an institution, did not ask for military advice, and seldom met with the service chiefs. The ongoing tension between the ministry and the military benefited neither. 
10
Zoltan Barany [ 54 ]   Identifying New Missions Samuel Huntington wrote that policymakers should equip their posttransition armies with "new and fancy tanks, planes, armored cars, artillery, and sophisticated electronic equipment," in other words, "give them toys" to keep them happy and occupied. 
11
Participation in internationally sanctioned operations has benefited the soldiers of especially poorer countries. For instance, the Bangladeshi armed forces have been heavily involved in United Nations peacekeeping activities. In the Bangladeshi case, these operations have constituted a major source of domestic and international prestige and much-needed resources for the military. 
12
13
Obviously, before policymakers begin implementing these reforms, they must consider the type of regime their country is transitioning from because it will largely determine their tasks. For instance, after military rule (e.g., the Egyptian setting) during which military officers enjoyed numerous political and/or socio-economic perquisites, the aim of democratizers is to "roll back" the army's privileged status and establish armed forces that are the servants of the state and its citizenry. After the fall of single-party regimes (e.g., Tunisia), the main task of democratizers [ 55 ]   is not to take the military out of politics-as in post-military regimesbut the opposite, to take the politics out of the military; that is, to abolish party organizations and party influence over the armed forces. 
14
In post-civil war Bosnia, for instance, the unusual strategy of keeping soldiers in units segregated by religion may be in large part responsible for the preservation of divisions, aversion, and distance between different ethnic communities in the military 18 years after the end of hostilities. 
15
The objectives of post-authoritarian defense reform can be well conceived, but a crucial part of the reform program is the manner in which it is put into practice. Especially in cases where the military had retained some leverage following the fall of the old regime, how reforms are implemented can be a very sensitive issue. Consider three principles to properly carry out military reforms.
Given the high stakes-that is, the military's ability to overthrow the state-it is essential to provide the armed forces with as unambiguous a political environment as possible. Constitutions should be clear about the chain of command in peacetime, wartime, and in national emergencies. What is an acceptable political role for active duty, reserve, and retired armed forces personnel? Should they be able to vote, join parties, appear in uniform in political rallies, run for office? This must be explained and regulated, and the consequences of noncompliance should be clear and consistently applied.
[ 56 ]
In dealing with the armed forces leadership, the government should strive for transparency. Political leaders should explain to the top brass, for instance, the political, social, and economic justifications for the defense budget, why the promotion of General X was vetoed by the prime minister, or the reasons for the party debates regarding abolition of universal conscription. Such transparency reduces insecurity, builds trust, and helps eliminate rumors. The importance of clarity in regulations and lack of ambiguity in laws has been demonstrated by the murkiness in the 1992 Chapúltepec Accord that ended El Salvador's civil war. According to Chapúltepec, the Salvadoran armed forces (FAES) are constitutionally limited to external security operations (defense from external threats) and providing help in national emergencies (this was to denote-but did not specify-natural disasters). Nevertheless, when opposition politicians questioned the deployment of thousands of FAES soldiers in the countryside to fill the vacuum created by the layoff of corrupt counternarcotics agents, the government responded that the operation was legitimate because crime in rural areas had reached "emergency proportions." 
16
In many democratic transitions from authoritarian regimes where the military enjoys an influential political role, swift and drastic changes are not advisable because they might unnecessarily provoke the ire of the soldiers for whom regime change signifies the loss of power and privileges. Following a gradualist approach that emphasizes coalition building and willingness to make acceptable compromises is usually a prudent way to proceed.
A fine example of this is Adolfo Suárez, Spain's first democratically elected prime minister (1976-81). Intent on radically transforming the Spanish defense establishment, Suárez moved prudently. He first sought and obtained the collaboration of influential military circles who were concerned primarily with the future of the armed forces. Only afterward did Suárez approach the confirmed democrats in the officer corps who might have objected to the former group. 
17
In countries where the armed forces retain some political clout and public esteem after withdrawing from power (e.g., in contemporary Egypt), it is Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 57 ]   especially important not to needlessly antagonize them by overly rapid reform programs designed to reduce their autonomy and privileges. The inability of politicians to compromise when necessary or accommodate the generals on issues of minor importance might easily alienate those officers who would be otherwise willing to subordinate themselves to civilian control. In other words, strategic compromises can enhance the prospects of successful democratic consolidation and cement civilian control over the armed forces. An apt example is Chile under its first post-Pinochet president, Patricio Aylwin (1990-94). At first, Chile's democratic reformers were forced to trade civilian control of the armed forces for short-term regime survival. 
18
19
Individual settings require different types of defense reforms. The main tasks for democracy builders range from having to build new [ 58 ]   independent armies on the shaky or absent foundations left behind by imperial powers to drastically reducing the autonomy, privileges, and size of the armed forces in post-praetorian environments. A thoughtful sequencing of defense reforms can be exceedingly important in ensuring the military's compliance and cooperation. Consulting with democraticminded military officers regarding the details and order of reform usually signals the state's willingness to consider the perspectives of the armed forces and can be expected to foster an agreeable inter-institutional climate. Such discussions do not mean the government is obligated to take the generals' advice, but as the Spanish case suggests, they are helpful in finding out the military's preferences and usually benefit both sides.
There are numerous other things the state should do. For example, civilian rulers ought to identify themselves with the armed forces, attend their ceremonies, award medals, and praise the soldiers as exemplifying the noblest virtues of the nation. 
20
The state must oversee the promotion of the most senior members of the armed forces. At the same time, politicians should make sure that if they do veto promotions, their reasoning is based on solid evidence regarding the objectionable candidate's professional competence or political attitudes. Politicians should not interfere in the routine promotions of lower ranks nor should they meddle in military education, training, and professional concerns unless those are in conflict with the regime's fundamental political values. When they do interfere, trouble tends to follow. A fitting example is the way in which Thai prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra (2001-06) frittered away his once considerable leverage over the Royal Thai Armed Forces. Notwithstanding his many conciliatory gestures toward the RTAF-which included steering his cabinet away from meddling in the army's internal affairs in his first couple of years in power-Thaksin enraged the top brass by repeatedly interfering in the army's promotion procedures to solidify his support base. Choosing to ignore signals of the deep-seated displeasure his actions provoked among the generals, he continued to appoint supporters and
even family members to top RTAF posts. These dangerous measures ultimately sacrificed not only Thaksin's regime, but more broadly, civilian rule in Thailand. 
21
All of the Arab states where uprisings took place in 2011 are currently far from democratic consolidation. In fact, it is unclear whether their political elites desire democracy. Nevertheless, reforming military politics and the defense-security establishment should be an important priority of their transition, even if it is from one authoritarian regime to another.
In many respects Arab armies have been rather similar to the armed forces of other authoritarian states. In the post-World War II era, numerous Arab monarchies fell to military coups (e.g., Egypt, Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen), and the coup leaders along with the officer corps ordinarily became a part of the ruling elite. The Arab republics born in coups, along with several monarchies where unsuccessful coup attempts took place (Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia), realized the grave necessity of coup-proofing. This meant relying on family, tribal, ethnic, and sectarian loyalties; creating new paramilitary organizations charged with the protection of the regime whose commanders reported directly to the ruler; and making sure that all entities entrusted with security functions were spying on one another.

rule, where the military did not play more than a relatively passive supporting political role. These four republics can learn from the experiences of earlier transitioning states in shaping new civil-military relations. 
26
Tunisia is where the wave of unrest began, in mid-December 2010. Once it became clear that the security forces were unable to control the demonstrators, President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali ordered army chief of staff Gen Rachid Ammar to deploy his troops to suppress the uprising. Ammar rejected the order and placed his men between the security units and the protesters, thereby effectively saving the revolution and forcing Ben Ali into exile. The military's decision not to side with the regime was not surprising. Ben Ali's predecessor, Habib Bourguiba, had deliberately kept soldiers out of politics during his three decades as president (1957-87), even banning them from joining the ruling party and withholding from them the right to vote. Ben Ali continued the policy of keeping the armed forces on the political sidelines. Unlike most other North African militaries, Tunisia has never attempted a coup, never took part in making political decisions, never was a "nation-building" instrument, and never joined in economic development schemes. Ben Ali kept it a small (approximately 30,000 strong in contrast to the five-times-larger police force), marginalized, and modestly funded force focused on border defense.
The armed forces are widely considered as a national institution by Tunisians in contradistinction to the Presidential Guard, the police, and the security organizations. Undistracted by politics and despite its meager budget and equipment, the Tunisian military in time came to rank among the Arab world's most professional forces. With its comparatively disadvantaged status and its officers' disdain for the notorious corruption of the presidential clique, the military had no special stake in the regime's survival and no strong reason to shoot fellow Tunisians on the regime's behalf. In no Arab country has the military been more clearly distinct from the regime in power: indeed, in Tunisia the term la grande muette (the big silent one) is often used to describe the army's noninterference in public affairs. 
27
28
[ 61 ]
From the perspective of civil-military relations reform, Tunisia is in an enviable situation indeed. The biggest task for reformers in polities that follow a regime like Ben Ali's in Tunisia-one similar to one-party rule-is to reduce political influence of the former elites in the military. But Tunisia's armed forces were highly unusual to the extent that the old regime marginalized them and did not require soldiers to continually demonstrate their overt political support. Moreover, the military had a relatively small budget, corruption in the army was not a serious problem, and the institution had played no role in the national economy.

Every Egyptian leader since the monarchy fell in 1952 has been a military man with the exception of Mohamed Morsi, who was president for a mere 368 days (30 June 2012-3 July 2013) before the army overthrew him. After the 2011 uprising that unseated President Hosni Mubarak, the position of Egypt's military seemed in many ways like an army emerging out of military rule possessing plenty of leverage. To be sure, this analogy is somewhat misleading; after all, the Egyptian armed forces were less politically influential in the last couple of decades of
Zoltan Barany   [ 62 ]
Mubarak's 30-year reign than the internal security apparatus.

The Egyptian legislature should certainly gain more voice in defense matters by actively involving itself in debates regarding defense budgets, the use of monies, and the manner in which they are distributed, along with calling leading officers to provide parliamentary testimonies. An example that might be instructive is Indonesia, where after Suharto's fall, a gradual transition took place that culminated in something approximating democratic consolidation in the past decade. The parliament in Jakarta does have a significant say in controlling the defense budget-it even has the right to change specifications of procurement items. Overall, however, Indonesian parliamentarians still exercise little oversight outside of budgetary matters, which are, admittedly, one of the most important areas to oversee. The reason is that many legislators lack the expertise or interest to ask the right questions, and they don't have the support staff to prepare properly. Parliament's role expansion had gone hand in hand with a number of new laws narrowing military prerogatives, creating a powerful constitutional court, and gradually growing the clout of civilian political institutions.

Another case Egyptian democratizers might study with profit is Turkey during the now decade-long prime ministership of Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. The Turkish military's power has been gradually diminished by political elites through the diminution of the army's representation in central institutions and the slow but steady expansion of the legislature's involvement in defense affairs. 
35
in terms of political, economic, and social development, its experience in the last decade demonstrates the continuous gains a moderate Islamic state can make in limiting the political influence of a once seemingly omnipotent military establishment. To be sure, not everything in the Turkish experience is worthy of admiration-the recent judicial campaign against leading generals is a case in point-but Egyptian reformers would have much that is progressive to consider.

Since 2011 the army remained a critical factor of the political equation in Egypt. One of the indispensable tasks of the Muslim Brotherhooddominated government in Cairo was to reduce the military's political influence and, if possible, turn the generals into obedient servants of the state.

Although Yemen is far poorer than oil-rich Libya, the two states share many similarities, among them a low level of institutional development and towering corruption. Prior to the Arab Spring, there were no public institutions capable of operating independently of Ali Abdullah Saleh and Muammar Gadhafi. Libya has not had a constitution since 1951, and corruption is rampant in both countries. Tribal affiliations, of relatively little consequence in Tunisia and Egypt, are of foremost importance in Libya and Yemen. In each country, but particularly in Libya, the mili-
tary and security establishment was divided into numerous organizations that had little contact with one another. The regular military was ostensibly charged with the external defense of the country while the security forces were supposed to protect the regime, though in practice, ensuring regime survival was the main mission of all these forces.
Another important characteristic shared by Libya and Yemen is that both should be considered as post-civil war settings. What are the most important tasks of reformers in these contexts and what can reformers learn from the experiences of other post-civil war countries? In every post-civil war situation the building or rebuilding of a national army is a critical component of the reconstruction program. In such environments, the demobilization of forces and the reintegration of erstwhile combatants into civilian life are two of the most pressing undertakings. The collection and destruction of excess weapons and ammunition are related tasks that-as we have seen in the cases of post-civil war Bosnia, El Salvador, and Lebanon-are often very contentious. Due to the lack of trust between former enemy forces, it is not surprising they generally want to retain some strategic advantage or security guarantee that would enable them to resume fighting if necessary. Therefore, promoting transparency and building trust between the different sides through a variety of confidence-building measures implemented by impartial security institutions is critically important for long-term stability.
Reconstructing the security sector may be the most important undertaking of the Libyan and Yemeni regimes. In the former, there are hundreds of rival militias representing different tribes from different regions of the country. Most of them need to be disarmed and dispersed, while some could be integrated into a new national army. But, as is clear from the foregoing, which militias to disarm and break up and which ones to include in the new national force is, indeed, a tremendously complex and politically sensitive undertaking.

Reestablishing security and creating and/or reforming a unified national military are some of the indispensable tasks that must be high on the agenda of Arab reformers in the wake of the recent uprisings. Several weighty issues are common to them all. Improving the effectiveness of the armed forces is just as important in Egypt-where the bloated military has been frequently described as lacking professionalism 
51
[ 67 ]
to drastically transform the armed forces, and the generals must be amenable to change long-ingrained routines. These conditions have seldom been present at the same time except where the military was built from the bottom up following a catastrophic defeat (as in post-World War II Germany and Japan).
Another concern likely to change all of these military establishments is the creeping Islamization of their respective polities. Prior to the Arab Spring, these armies were dominated by secularists or moderate Islamic cadres, given the political elites' deep suspicions of or overt antagonism toward religious extremism. Just how they are going to respond to the growing influence of Islamics in the new governments will depend primarily on the manner and directness with which religious currents affect them. The gradual but unrelenting Islamization of the Pakistan army which started during the presidency of Gen Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq (1978-88) is an example.

Growing Threats with Global Implications
Until rather recently, China was able to hew closely to Deng Xiaoping's advice to maintain a low profile internationally, particularly in regions of the world salient to the most active and dangerous international terrorist organizations. This limited foreign policy had the unintended-though surely welcome-consequence of keeping China off the radar of the international jihadist movement. Highly capable groups such as al-Qaeda neither directly threatened the country nor forged deep alliances with indigenous Muslim terrorist groups aligned against the Chinese state. Chinese policymakers have also had notable success limiting both the volume and effectiveness of terrorist attacks on their own soil, but this relatively calm state of affairs is under increasing pressure and is rapidly changing for several reasons.
First, China's global economic and political emergence has introduced an international jihadist element into what had been a largely isolated domestic movement. Economic growth and great-power ambitions have propelled China onto the international stage in search of resources, market access, and prestige. The growing Chinese footprint in the Middle East and North Africa is of particular concern since these regions are those most hotly contested by extremist jihadi organizations that consider foreign incursion into Arab lands an especially egregious offense.

To further clarify the nature of China's terrorism problem, this article provides a brief background of Uyghur separatism and violence in Xinjiang then outlines the origins and present shape of its counterterrorism policy and evidence on the forces heightening the threat of terrorism in China. These developments have policy implications for China and the international system.
Terrorist incidents have occurred in China with increasing frequency since the late 1980s as the result of the grievances of non-Han ethnic minorities, particularly the Uyghurs.

The collapse of the Soviet Union led to the establishment of new states along the western border of China. These states contain titular populations with ethnic and religious characteristics more closely resembling those of western China's long-restive non-Han populations, and this has contributed to an upsurge in Uyghur nationalism. The expectation that the collapse of the USSR would precipitate weakness in the Chinese state-a perception strengthened by the 1989 events in Tiananmen Square-further emboldened separatism.

The political divides between eastern and western China are increasingly clear. The security presence in Xinjiang is enormous, both in terms of manpower and spending. Over the past several years, the government has increased security with numerous "strike hard" campaigns in which suspected nationalists were rounded up and communication and mobility were severely curtained. In reality, the extent and reach of the security apparatus in Xinjiang would be utterly alien to an average Han Chinese

Over the past decade, the centers of operation of the most important Xinjiang groups-most notably the ETIM/TIP-moved into Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. The most militant Uyghur separatists have been forced into these volatile neighboring countries, including Pakistan, by the NATO war in Afghanistan and the security crackdown in Xinjiang and are developing ties with jihadist factions there affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban. This process of displacement has contributed to a web of relationships among key Uyghur terrorist organizations and major terrorist groups throughout the region (see fig.

There is, however, substantial evidence that more meaningful relationships have developed over the last decade and that the capabilities of terrorists operating in Xinjiang are increasing as a result. For example, in October 2009, Abu Yahya al-Libi, a high-ranking al-Qaeda leader, called on Chinese Uyghurs to wage holy war against the Chinese government, claiming that China would face the same sea of Islamic fighters that brought the Soviet Union to a standstill in Afghanistan. Al-Libi's comments point to the increasing interest of the broader jihadist movement as well as al-Qaeda's central leadership in expanding its reach into Xinjiang. This is fueled by the fact that, at present, the most militant elements of the Uyghur separatist movement appear to be concentrated in North Waziristan, the notoriously unstable and ungoverned tribal region of Pakistan that is home to important elements of the Taliban and al-Qaeda.
The ETIM/TIP leadership has been active in the tribal regions of Pakistan for some time. While the Uyghurs that were in Afghanistan prior to 2001 (including those picked up by US forces and sent to Guantanamo) were peripheral to the international jihadist cause, this is also no longer the case. According to Karachi Islam, a jihadist newspaper, the recently killed leader of the ETIM/TIP, Abdul Shakoor Turkistani, also commanded al-Qaeda forces and training camps in the federally Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 [ 75 ]   administered tribal regions of Pakistan.

Counterterrorism policy in China has evolved over the last 60 years in ways that reflect the country's transition from pariah to major power. Under Mao, China openly supported terrorist organizations such as the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine and the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine. 
22
As Deng Xiaoping brought China back into the international fold, these practices declined because the almost single-minded focus on development left little room, politically or financially, for relationships with radical organizations and marginalized states. Also, these relationships became liabilities as China sought acceptance into the international system to facilitate its economic growth.

product of dueling concerns over domestic stability and autonomy on the one hand and international stature and reputation on the other-a tradeoff that other scholars have identified as competing core elements of the country's foreign policy more generally. 
24
To accomplish these interwoven objectives of international emergence, improved relations with the United States, and confrontation of separatist violence in its west, China promptly voiced strong support for the United States in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks and initiated closer cooperation on international counterterrorism efforts. The United States, eager to build an international coalition, reciprocated by officially identifying the ETIM, the primary separatist group operating in western Xinjiang, as a terrorist organization. As a result, China was able to improve bilateral relations with the United States while clearing space for its preferred policies in Xinjiang. 
25
26
One can contextualize the relative success of China's counterterrorism policies by plotting the level of violence in that country alongside the number of attacks in Israel, Russia, and the United States from 1989 to 2008 (see fig. 
2
27
While still relatively low, even after its emergence in the late 1980s, the level of terrorist violence in China has varied over time in ways that can inform our understanding of the evolving nature of the threat. The general rise in number of attacks from between 1989 and 1997 reflects an upsurge in Uyghur nationalism in response to opening Central Asia after the collapse of the Soviet Union. During this period, key organizations such as the ETIM rose to prominence. Over the following decade, China had remarkable success in tamping down violence, with the notable exception of a cluster of incidents immediately following the 9/11 attacks in the United States. However, the long quiet did not indicate the underlying problem had been resolved, as there was a dramatic spike The historical case of China also seems to support the notion that strict authoritarianism can insulate against terrorism-terrorism was essentially unheard of in China prior to the 1980s. Some of this observation may stem from the lower reliability of the data from that period, but certainly the near absolute social controls in place in the Maoist era made terrorism especially difficult. Strict assignments to work units enforced with grain rations meant that mobility was minimal and several layers of watchful eyes kept close tabs on social order.
The liberalization that has occurred over the last 30 years stripped away much of the infrastructure of social control, but China remains nonetheless far better equipped to control and observe both its own citizens and foreigners within its borders than most liberal democracieseven many autocracies-given the reach and effectiveness of the bureaucratic state and security apparatus.

other weapons are difficult to obtain, as exemplified by the recent spate of high-profile stabbings in China. However, the relationship between weapons availability and terrorism should not be overstated. Suicide vests and improvised explosive devices can be fashioned from readily available materials, underlining the importance of the diffusion of tactics and knowledge and, by extension, international connections.

The 2011-12 upheaval in Libya illustrates several aspects of this emerging vulnerability. The uprising against the Gadhafi regime trapped close to 30,000 Chinese citizens in that country. This led to a popular outrage within China, mostly voiced online, and a dangerous situation for the government, since the perception of inaction could have put
the regime on the wrong side of nationalist sentiments.

The global jihadist community is clearly reassessing its view of China's place in the international system and its legitimacy as a target. Brian Fishman notes the example of Akram Hajazi, a major intellectual figure for jihadist strategists, who wrote in 2007 that China's rise to preeminence in the international system would only cause it to replace the United States as the primary enemy.

The model of growth that has allowed China to develop so rapidly is predicated on a partial loosening of social controls in support of economic liberalization, and many have pointed to this social liberalization and the preliminary flowering of civil society as positive externalities of that drive for growth. These changes, however, also increase China's vulnerability to terrorism. This tension between growth and social control is felt particularly in western China, where the official government goal for Xinjiang-having it serve as a commercial hub for the region-has come into direct conflict with the perceived need for strict social control to quell the restive Uyghur population. For example, preparations for the first annual China-Eurasia Expo in September 2011 required a substantial expenditure on increased security, and strict restrictions were put in place in ethnic Uyghur neighborhoods for the duration of the event. In the longer term, maximizing economic growth will not only require loosening restrictions on the movement and interaction of the local population but also accommodating foreign traders and investors who will demand a greater degree of openness, just as they have in eastern China. Officials tend to see this as a substantial risk, particularly since many Uyghurs view the outward signs of economic growth and investment as a grievance, owing to the fact that they generally do not share equally in the benefits of this growth.
Rapid changes in the means and effectiveness of social control are compounded by equally momentous changes both in governmental policies over control of the media favoring limited liberalization and in technological changes that make communication easier and censorship more difficult. While these changes can be positive when it comes to holding officials accountable in the context of the SARS outbreak, the Sichuan earthquake, or the recent high-speed rail accident, the rewards are less clear when it comes to terrorism. Indeed, increased media freedom has the potential to increase the rewards of terrorism for those who would perpetrate it. In the past, China has been able to downplay or completely obscure news of terrorist attacks, thereby eliminating much of its appeal as a political act. 
39

The larger concern for the terrorism/media nexus in China is therefore not traditional media, but the "new media." With more than 420 million Internet users, China has more people surfing the web than any other country, and new web-based technologies are increasingly directing media attention. Over the past decade, numerous incidents first reported online generated such outrage that traditional news media were compelled to report on them, often leading to changes in the government's positions. 
43
44
The decentralization of the flow of information, stemming in large part from the rise of Internet forums and social media, has made it increasingly difficult for the Chinese government to control information, including information about terrorist attacks. The popularity of Internet message boards proves highly challenging for government censors who find themselves nearly always in the position of playing catch up. The more recent explosion in popularity of Twitter-style microblogs (weibo) has the potential to completely upend the system due to their sheer volume and speed coupled with complete decentralization. Where Chinese authorities once were able to keep terrorist incidents out of the public consciousness, and therefore largely devalue them for potential perpetrators, technology has made this increasingly difficult.
An analysis of Chinese news from July and August 2008 (the height of the terrorist campaign preceding the Olympics) bears out the inherent tension between media incentives to report on terrorist events and government interest in suppressing this information, as well as the increasing difficulties in doing so.

unreported attacks is assiduously removed from Internet forums (even for attacks that went unreported in the Chinese media), indicating the limitations of censorship in this context.
There are reasons for serious concern about the future threat of terrorism in China. The forces that have prevented and limited violence to date are under increasing pressure as China grows and liberalizes, and this is occurring in the context of a maturing separatist movement emanating from a substantial, ethnically coherent population with deeply felt grievances. Put simply, one downside of growth and liberalization is increased exposure to both international and domestic terrorism.
The appetite for discussion, both in the media and on Internet forums, suggests that future terrorism in China has the potential to engender a substantial public reaction which will in turn require a response from the state. This stands in some contrast to the Japanese case, where the 1995 attack on the Tokyo subway system was notably ignored. This opened the political space for the organization to be dealt with in the legal domain. In this sense, China appears to more closely represent the global norm, where public reaction necessitates a less discriminate, less restrained response, which can actually increase the value of terrorist acts.
A popular nationalist response to terrorism can be problematic for Beijing. First and foremost, it can force a strong response the government would prefer to avoid for strategic reasons. Indeed a substantial body of existing scholarship argues that a primary objective of terrorism can be to goad the government into an overreaction, often fueled by popular sentiments. 
50
Many of the forces described here cannot be stemmed. China cannot withdraw from the international stage and cannot forestall liberalization indefinitely without substantial costs. Regardless of the Communist Party's stance on political liberalization or retrenchment, communication technology and access to it will likely continue to advance and make censorship ever more difficult. The implication is that Chinese policymakers have painted themselves into a corner. By responding to the growing unrest in Xinjiang with heightened repression, they have exacerbated ethnic minority grievances and introduced an increasingly stark tradeoff between continued security on the one hand and a growing political divide between the east and west of the country on the other. 
51
Despite fervent wishes of those in Beijing who hope the rising economic tides alone will diminish the threat of terrorism emanating from Xinjiang, there is little evidence to suggest growth alone will be sufficient. Policymakers have consistently pointed to the substantial economic growth in Xinjiang, which has averaged about 10 percent over the last 15 years, as evidence that their policies are working. The party's contention is that the same implicit contract that governs the relationship between the people and the government in the rest of China-robust economic growth in exchange for unquestioned political authorityshould hold here as well. However, in western China this formula is upset by the substantial ethnic and nationalist sentiments. Moreover, while the numbers would be enviable in the United States, growth in Xinjiang has actually lagged behind that of coastal China, owing in no small part to tight controls on the economy and society.
The economy in Xinjiang is dominated by the oil industry and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, which are both government controlled and together account for close to three-quarters of provincial GDP. The remainder of the growth comes primarily from government spending and subsidies. This is an expensive proposition, and it reinforces the structural divides between the regions and underlines the extent to which the economy is based primarily on resource extraction and redistribution rather than the vibrant production-based industry that Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013
[ 87 ]
we commonly associate with China and its growing economic clout. Indeed, Xinjiang's potential as a hub for oil and gas exploration will likely bring the divide between east and west into even starker relief. To the extent that the region's economic development is predicated on resource extraction to fuel industrial growth elsewhere in the country, it will diminish the need to promote growth through other channels. At the same time, the infrastructure surrounding resource extraction, such as pipelines and refineries, are vulnerable to attack. The result may be yet another spiral in which increased security and increased displacement feed on one another. More to the point, the widely held perception among Uyghurs in Xinjiang is that economic growth, regardless of its source, is accruing primarily to the Han immigrants and by fueling the influx of Han Chinese only serves to accelerate the demise of independent Uyghur identity.
The most viable long-term solution would be to address underlying grievances of the Uyghur population within the confines of the political system. This would ideally entail providing political space for moderates by granting more meaningful autonomy, thereby isolating extremists from the broader ethnic community. However, if past behavior is the best guide to the future, then it is more likely that increased terrorism will be met with an attempt to forcefully impose social control and roll back liberalization. This is already happening in Xinjiang, where social controls are substantially stricter than in the east. The implication is that the short-to-medium-term future of liberalization may be one of "two Chinas:" a relatively open east in which more freewheeling commerce and political behavior fuel one another's growth, and a lagging west characterized by mutually reinforcing isolation and authoritarianism.
The two-Chinas approach incentivizes the cross-border linkages between militants identified here. It also puts a premium on their ability to take the fight to eastern China where the government's capacity to disrupt it is lower and the rewards of an attack are higher. Thus, the more Beijing tries to bottle up grievances in the west, the higher the rewards for groups who can strike in the east.
This presents real challenges for Chinese leaders. While policymakers have identified growing inequality and geographically uneven development patterns as pressing policy problems, solutions are strained by the inability to put Xinjiang and other western provinces on the same security footing as the rest of the country. Furthermore, Chinese policies in Xinjiang are a substantial impediment to the country's aspirations to become the leading power in Central Asia. There has been some success in this domain in terms of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization as well as energy trading, but the sense that Beijing is substantially at odds with minority populations who share cultural and linguistic similarities with China's Central Asian neighbors reinforces the notion that China is a distant, foreign power in the region regardless of the contiguous borders.
A rise in terrorism in China will have unpredictable consequences for the international system. The trends identified here will be difficult to stem, and it is therefore prudent to consider the challenges and opportunities they present for US policymakers. Chief among these are the implications for regional relations in central Asia. To the extent that elements in Pakistan's tribal regions contribute to terrorism in China, they could potentially insert tensions into the relationship between China and Pakistan that closely mirror those that now plague the relationship between the United States and Pakistan. This has the potential to significantly complicate regional dynamics, including those involving India. The risk of regional tension is heightened by the reality that if attacks escalate, there will be a temptation to place the blame on the neighboring countries from which the terrorist organizations operate, be it Pakistan, Afghanistan, or elsewhere. Even if Chinese policymakers view such moves as strategically unwise, they may prove necessary to appease nationalist sentiments and deflect critiques of the state. Finally, any meaningful increase in terrorism in China may pose challenges for foreign policy strategies predicated on further liberalization in that country insofar as the intolerance of violence against the state leads to a broader reaction against liberalization nationwide. This overall pattern of violence suggests two key points. First, what terrorism there is in China appears to respond to broader geopolitical circumstances and strategic opportunities (e.g., 9/11 and the Olympics), which is surprising given it is perpetrated by ostensibly weak and isolated organizations with local grievances. Second, tensions and grievances can remain dormant for significant periods of time only to flare dramatically, suggesting the present quiet is no guarantee for the future. 
52
That said, from the US perspective there are potential upsides as well. As demonstrated by the rapprochement between China and the Bush
administration in 2001 and the ongoing regional cooperation within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, counterterrorism efforts also have the potential to tie China to the international community in productive ways. In particular, cooperation on counterterrorism furthers the ongoing erosion of its insistence on a strict interpretation of sovereignty norms. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, China's difference in perspective on this matter has prevented international cooperation in a variety of domains. To the extent that cooperation on counterterrorism could close that gap, it could have positive externalities for security cooperation elsewhere in the system. 4. This raises the thorny question of the definition of terrorism. Beijing has been known to characterize nonviolent mass mobilization in Xinjiang and Tibet, as well as protests by Falun Gong, as acts of terrorism. While few terrorism scholars would agree with that definition, outlining a common scholarly definition of terrorism remains a challenge. Because violence in Xinjiang has an ethnic dimension and therefore typically targets both ethnic Han and the Chinese security apparatus, I define terrorism as the illegal use of violence by a nonstate actor to attain a political, economic, or social goal through fear, coercion, or intimidation. This is a widely employed definition borrowed from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START).

6. The remainder is made up of various other minorities, led by ethnic Kazaks and Hui. 7. By way of comparison, China, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan-and by extension the Shanghai Cooperation Organization-have designated the Eastern Turkestan Islamic Movement (ETLO) as a terrorist organization. In general, the ETLO is more moderate than the ETIM/TIP and has been convincingly linked to relatively few terrorist incidents, most of which took place in the late 1990s. The Palestinian Arabs should go back to their homeland. Right up to the present time we have had no diplomatic relations with the Israeli government. The Arabs are the overwhelming majority. All Arab peoples are opposed to their fellow-Arabs being driven out of Palestine. If we don't stand on your side we will be making a mistake. That is why we are with you. But it is not just a question of Israel but of who stands behind Israel. Therefore it is a world question and particularly one concerning the USA.
23. There are exceptions to this trend. For example, China maintains ties to Iran, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma, and North Korea, though these relationships reflect strategic concerns about commerce, borders, encirclement, and local instability rather than concerns about international standing. 25. While the US fixation on terrorism during the Bush administration was useful to China in some regards, other aspects of the "war on terror" have made the Chinese foreign policy establishment more uncomfortable. Most notably, Chinese decision makers have tended to object to the degree that it has served as the basis for US unilateralism, though they have done so strategically. See S. Shen, China and Antiterrorism (New York: Nova Science Publishers, 2007), 10-17.
26. The shift can be clearly seen in foreign policy position papers issued during this period. See, for example, "China's Position Paper on Enhanced Cooperation in the Field of Non-Traditional Security Issues" (2002), which states, "As for international cooperation on counter-terrorism, China supports an enhanced leading role of the United Nations in combating terrorism."

It is easy for us to provoke and bait this administration. All that we have to do is to send two Mujahedin to the farthest point East to raise a piece of cloth on which is written al-Qa'ida in order to make the generals race there to cause America to suffer human economic and political losses without their achieving for it anything of note other than some benefits to their private companies. This is in addition to our having experience in using guerrilla warfare and the war of attrition to fight tyrannical superpowers as we alongside the Mujahedin bled Russia for 10 years until it went bankrupt and was forced to withdraw in defeat.
51. While many of the issues I discuss here have parallels in other areas of western China, such as Tibet, the primary focus here is on terrorist threats emanating from Xinjiang.
52. These patterns should be viewed with the caveat that all terrorism data, and particularly data on terrorism in China, is subject to selection biases and the particularly the problem of undercounting. Under certain conditions China has strategic incentives to obscure attacks. An additional cause for concern is the possibility that, due to the steady improvement in the quantity and quality of information coming out of China, this problem of undercounting is not consistent over time. This suggests a consistent downward bias of inconsistent magnitude.

Are Conventional Land-Based IRBMs a Silver Bullet?

in operational terms, one fact is clear: for the United States to deploy a new IRBM, it must unilaterally withdraw from the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty or cooperatively dissolve or significantly alter the treaty with its other signatory, Russia. The treaty removed these weapons from US and Soviet arsenals and remains in effect today, prohibiting their testing, development, or deployment.

For more than a decade, the development and deployment of conventional SRBM capabilities have been an important focus of China's military modernization efforts. With more than 1,000 shorter-range ballistic missiles (CSS-6 and CSS-7) deployed in areas adjacent to Taiwan, these weapons have been viewed as primarily dedicated to the mission of deterring leaders in Taipei from unilaterally altering Taiwan's current status and formally declaring independence.

in Taipei to reverse such a declaration and return to the status quo ante. However, as China's missile capabilities have expanded, the nature of the threat to Taiwan has also increased significantly. Experts now argue that a coordinated Chinese attack utilizing its missile forces to degrade Taiwan's air defenses and potentially destroy much of the Republic of China Air Force (ROCAF) on the ground-even units located within hardened, well-defended shelters-would virtually provide the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) with air superiority over the strait. With its quantitative advantage in fighter and strike aircraft, the PLAAF would be expected to overwhelm any surviving ROCAF units. This scenario underscores the crucial role of the United States in defense of Taiwan in the event of such an attack.

Therefore, Chinese missiles currently allocated to saturate Taiwan's air defenses, crater runways, destroy US aircraft on the ground at vulnerable forward bases, and potentially target US naval assets would now have to be retargeted to US missile bases. 
26
Some experts assert that US missiles deployed throughout the region will be less escalatory in the event of a crisis or actual conflict than "central" strategic responses deployed to the theater from the United States. Because they are visible and expected to be used in the event of a conflict,

US theater missiles are less likely to raise alarms in Beijing which could lead to further conventional or perhaps even nuclear escalation. 
27
Depending on the nature and size of the US deployment, a new generation of theater missile forces-a hypothetical "Pershing III" conventional IRBM-would confront China with an asset that threatens important aspects of its A2/AD forces including airbases, hardened command and control installations, air defenses, and perhaps most importantly, its mobile missile systems. In improving US deterrent capabilities and providing a clearly visible program that directly addresses China's most threatening capabilities, the deployment of theater missile forces will reassure US allies in the region and contribute to crisis stability. Despite the expected benefits, however, a new conventional IRBM is not without potential drawbacks.
Advocates of Air-Sea Battle and the more general deployment of missiles often discuss the expected benefits of such a program, but few have seriously considered the implicit assumptions critical to its ultimate contribution. Even beyond the potentially significant diplomatic and politicalmilitary costs associated with US withdrawal from the INF Treaty, a new generation of conventional land-based IRBMs is likely to encounter significant obstacles. The two most important challenges are basing and cost. It is important to consider the basing issue first as it may actually contribute significantly to the question of costs and affect expected benefits of the program.
Experts who support the US deployment of conventional land-based IRBMs assume that with adequate basing options the United States can present a relatively large and diversified threat to China's missile forces
that will rectify the perceived imbalance in conventional capabilities. Jim Thomas of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Analysis, which has done significant work on ASB and A2/AD, has presented the most expansive conceptualization of a new land-based US ballistic missile program, depicting a linked network of installations in a ring of bases around China's periphery in the Western Pacific. He also envisions a "magazine" of munitions that could be utilized for land attack, air and missile defense, and antiship missions. 
28
If the deployment of US conventional IRBMs were sufficiently large and diversified, China could be deterred from action. Such a scenario may indeed alter the balance in the region in a significant way. However, this is predicated on the assumption that multiple regional bases will be readily available to host US missiles, which is unrealistic. Rather, it is extremely doubtful that the United States will have access to basing that would actually maximize the expected benefits of the program as envisioned.

33
The more straightforward question is one of program costs. Would the program be a relatively high-end, technologically advanced solution that is prohibitively expensive and limited in practical utility, or is it a cost-effective program that may possibly have larger benefits? Perhaps unsurprisingly, the program costs associated with the development of a new, highly capable intermediate-range missile are likely to be considerable. The Pershing II program, which ultimately produced 234 missiles, would cost approximately $4.3 billion in 2011 dollars. 
34
basic cost estimate of a Pershing III program, a RAND study considered an initial deployment of approximately 600 missiles in the Western Pacific. That appears to provide the capacity required to target China's key air bases which are likely to be used in the event of a conflict with Taiwan. 
35
First, the attributes of a Pershing III would almost certainly require a range of at least 3,500 km-almost twice the Pershing II (1,800 km)to effectively threaten the important Guangzhou and Nanjing military districts adjacent to Taiwan and perhaps ranges in excess of 4,000 km to strike critical targets in Central China. Secondly, to be effective in striking hardened targets, the proposed missile would need to be highly accurate. Thus, a Pershing III is expected to be more expensive than a reconstituted Pershing II because of the demands for range and accuracy. Finally, industrial base issues must be taken into account. While the United States is obviously capable of developing and deploying such a system, the long period of inactivity in this specific area of research and development would likely add to program costs. 
36
One would expect the Pershing III to be road-mobile or perhaps placed in hardened silos to maintain survivability. It is not immediately clear which configuration would be preferred on Guam in terms of feasibility and cost effectiveness. So, while these new missiles would certainly enhance the firepower that could be delivered on key fixed Chinese targets such as air bases, command and control nodes, and critical military infrastructure, they are likely to be a costly solution to the problem of enhancing US offensive capabilities. Ultimately, despite the attractiveness of ballistic missiles as a response to China's A2/AD capabilities, other options may provide the requisite firepower to degrade China's ability to coordinate and conduct air operations across the Taiwan Strait and within the first island chain.
Beyond its substantial program costs, the deployment of US landbased IRBMs would likely have significant political and military implications for US-China relations. The actual deployment of a highly capable,
[ 104 ] intermediate-range conventional missile aimed at high-value Chinese targets is likely to be interpreted as very provocative and thus transform China's perception of a threat from the United States. It is unclear if China would respond by limiting its own deployments. If the US missiles are viewed as particularly threatening to its forces, China would be expected to actually expand its intermediate-range missile forces well beyond current levels, ultimately limiting the perceived improvement in the balance initially achieved by the US deployment. Rather than dampen potential dynamics that could lead to escalation, the deployment of perceived highly effective US missiles would likely decrease stability, placing pressure on both China and the United States in the event of a crisis.
The most straightforward effect of a US withdrawal from the INF Treaty would be to increase Chinese fears of US intentions. As experts have written elsewhere, China's limited nuclear deterrent-including its commitment to a "no first use" doctrine-and focused military modernization have been targeted toward averting nuclear blackmail and deterring what Beijing perceives as interference in its development. 
37
forces is perceived as an immediate and acute threat warranting such a controversial diplomatic response.
The deployment of new missile systems in the East Asian theater is likely to be perceived as highly escalatory and could perhaps even precipitate a diplomatic crisis. Though the US intent may indeed be to compensate for a perceived gap in deterrent capabilities and the vulnerability of its forward-based assets in the region, it is doubtful Beijing would view such deployments as merely addressing these factors.
A more basic point inherent in the logic of deploying theater missiles is that a buildup and even perhaps long-term diversification of those forces will alter China's cost calculus in planning for a Taiwan operation. 
38
Rather than responding to the asymmetry created by China's missile-centric modernization program with an in-kind response, it would seem prudent for the United States to leverage areas where it may possess comparative advantages, such as undersea, surface, and airpower operations. With the asymmetry of interests that exists in the Taiwan crisis scenario, it is unlikely the United States is ever going to completely overcome China's "home field" advantage in military terms. Given the centrality of averting Taiwan's independence, we should expect Beijing to commit whatever resources necessary to maximize its probability of prevailing in a conflict. Again, this does not entail a general war with the United States but a limited-aims conflict where China has distinct geographic advantages, bolstered by its military modernization program. 
39
[ 106 ]
In short, a deployment of US intermediate-range missiles that represented only a marginal improvement over existing conventional offensive military capabilities (because of limits on basing and costs) is unlikely to alter Chinese considerations and may in fact only prove self-defeating if China ultimately compensates for US improvements with a further expansion of its own missile forces.
US policymakers should expect China to view the deployments as highly threatening and provocative. 
40
41
42
First, if the United States is limited to deploying new land-based IRBMs only on Guam, the simple fact of their consolidated position in a relatively small geographic area creates a vulnerability, whether they are mobile or in hardened silos. China is presented with a limited, fixed target that could potentially be significantly degraded or eliminated in the event of an effective, coordinated first strike. Thus, in a future crisis, leaders in Beijing would have preventive motives to attack US missile deployments to remove the most threatening assets from the US arsenal. The second related dynamic arises from US perceptions of Chinese motives. Because of pressures for China to preemptively attack Guam, the United States finds itself in a position to "use or lose" its missile forces as a diplomatic crisis intensifies. Knowing that they are likely targets of a Chinese first strike, pressures build upon the United States to consider striking first out of fear that the probabilities of surviving a
Chinese first strike are low and that seizing the initiative would improve the probability of success. In either case, the potential for miscalculations and even accidental exchanges would increase, as forces on high alert seek to avoid being caught off guard. Similarly, the pressures to use or lose may contribute to inadvertent escalation as the fear of suffering a disarming or degrading first strike presses leaders to utilize all available munitions. More generally, escalation dynamics should be expected fairly early under most conceivable conflict scenarios once targets on the Chinese mainland are struck. Whether this more "maximalist" approach is necessary to deter China and reassure US allies remains debatable. A more realistic approach would focus on the ability of the United States to maintain the requisite offensive capabilities that could be used in flexible, prompt, and responsive ways to deter China from aggression against Taiwan in the event of a cross-strait crisis.
Given the nature of the threat created by expansion of China's missile forces, active (and passive) defensive options are relatively limited because of the likely costs. Therefore, the focus on potential programmatic responses logically shifts to enhancing US conventional capabilities to deter Chinese operations by decreasing expected benefits and raising costs of a potential preventive strike in the event of a diplomatic crisis.
Despite the constraints of the INF Treaty, the United States remains capable of deploying robust conventional capabilities in the East Asian region to bolster its current force posture if necessary. In considering current assets available to US planners, the Ohio-class, or "Tactical Trident," SSGN (nuclear-powered guided missile submarine) would seem to address several important challenges. 
43
SSGNs, which were converted from nuclear-armed SSBNs in the 1990s for approximately $400 million each. The USS Ohio and USS Michigan are deployed in the Pacific, while the USS Florida and USS Georgia are deployed in the Atlantic. In the event of a crisis, the movement of these four submarines to the Western Pacific would send a strong signal of US resolve and significantly bolster US capabilities in the region. In June 2010 this type of signal was sent when three of the four SSGNs arrived in strategically important ports: the USS Michigan in Pusan, South Korea; the USS Ohio in Subic Bay, Philippines; and the USS Florida in Diego Garcia. 
44
In the short term, investments can be made to sustain and enhance the standoff capability of the B-1 and B-52 forces with improvements of air-launched cruise missiles that can be fired from outside the range of Chinese antiair and fighter capabilities. While an updated variant of the joint air-to-surface standoff missile (JASSM) has been procured to achieve longer ranges, it is unclear that even with a maximum range of 500 nautical miles (805 km) the JASSM-ER (extended range) is sufficient for a Taiwan crisis scenario. A B-1 can carry 21 of these missiles but would currently have to approach contested airspace to deliver them on targets.
In considering other programs that could enhance offensive capabilities and thus improve the US capacity to deter Chinese aggression, one candidate would be the resurrection of the "arsenal ship" concept which was considered in the mid 1990s but ultimately rejected. 
45
46
four to six of these vessels would greatly enhance the US conventional firepower capability in the region and would have the added benefit of presenting Chinese planners with a number of additional targets to address, creating significant complications to targeting packages. 
47
48
49
50
Concerns about the ability of US tactical aircraft to respond from forward bases given the threat of Chinese missiles is seemingly made more acute by the perceived decrease in US long-range strike capabilities due to the small size of the B-2 force, the limited capabilities of the B-1 bomber, and the age of the B-52 force. 
51
52
53
Over the longer term, a focus on "smarter" munitions, which could potentially linger for some time over a battlespace and be rapidly retargeted may actually be a less costly and more effective solution to the challenge of China's mobile missiles-the anti-TEL mission-than fixed IRBMs. The question of maintaining C4ISR under combat conditions is likely to remain critical, but with a successful track record, US research and development in unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) technology is likely to continue to provide applications that could contribute to effective execution of this type of mission over time. 
54
The improvement of active and passive defenses and the protection from hardening surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities to maintain early warning and avoid suffering a disarming first strike would contribute to the mitigation of China's missile threat. The US Navy's Aegis system has proven effective in addressing limited missile attacks under test conditions. 
55
including Japanese missile defense capabilities, it is highly unlikely that the United States will ever be able to bring enough missile defenses to the region to be decisive in a conflict. At some point, they are likely to be overwhelmed. Nonetheless, they contribute to US posture by complicating China's cost-benefit and risk assessments.
Similarly, passive defenses further undermine China's planning by allowing US bases to absorb and recover from a strike. 
56
57
The threat to US interests created by China's missile expansion is a serious one. However, it is not clear that the development and deployment Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013 David W. Kearn Jr.
[ 112 ] of land-based intermediate-range conventional missiles-currently constrained under the INF Treaty-by the United States would represent the optimal means of addressing that threat. While a Pershing III IRBM would enhance the conventional capabilities available to US forces in a conflict, it would be costly and significantly less effective because of the critical issue of basing. Alternative programs may provide similar capabilities while proving more cost effective and operationally flexible.
A new land-based conventional IRBM will improve US offensive capabilities in the Western Pacific and thus could contribute to a more robust capacity to deter China from future aggression. However, a US theater missile is unlikely to prove useful in effectively targeting Chinese mobile missiles, and while it could contribute to striking important fixed targets, other munitions and platforms may be capable of executing this mission. More importantly, it is unclear that the deployment of new US missiles in the theater would have any greater effect of deterring China than existing US platforms that can be moved into the region in the event of a crisis. Nor is it obvious that land-based conventional IRBMs would be less escalatory than central US systems. Thus, the deterrent benefit of new US theater missiles should be considered side-by-side with the potential destabilizing and escalatory dynamics they may create under crisis conditions. Since the United States is unlikely to gain access to bases in the region beyond its territories like Guam, we should expect the program costs to be significant while potential military benefits of a large-scale, diverse deployment concept are absent. The deployment of these missiles would likely have significant implications for the US-China relationship by significantly increasing China's perception of a US threat, potentially spurring an arms race that could ultimately leave the United States in a worse position, and decreasing crisis stability. On balance, a Pershing III land-based, intermediate-range conventional ballistic missile would likely be costly and only make a limited military contribution, while the larger implications of its deployment are worrisome.
A final point worth considering centers on the concept of competitive strategies: the implementation of policies that encourage an adversary to engage in self-defeating behavior. 
58
Given the global interests of the United States, the development of a new generation of theater missiles in response to China's missile threat seems short-sighted and premature. To devote resources during a period of constrained defense budgets to a capability that is likely to be truly relevant in only one region-albeit an important one-seems to place a major proportion of America's eggs in one basket. As the discussion above makes clear, there are several feasible, cost-effective alternative programs that could enhance US offensive capabilities in the Western Pacific and also support national security interests in any other region on the planet. Conventional theater missiles would seem to be an expensive and highly limited solution to a single pressing challenge. In political and diplomatic terms, this military solution seems almost completely divorced from the current political realities of the East Asian region. Barring an emergence of a Cold War relationship with China, the deployment of theater missiles to the region seems disproportionate to the perceived threat and highly provocative on the part of the United States. Even without considering the potentially dramatic diplomatic and political-military implications of a withdrawal from the INF Treaty, it is difficult to envision the expected military benefits of a new generation of US conventional IRBMs outweighing the costs.

Current conventional wisdom seems to hold that US options for deterring Chinese aggression in East Asia range from ineffectual to irresponsible. Some assert China's surging theater military capabilities herald the eventual impossibility of securing deterrence through a credible conventional defense of US East Asian allies. This invokes a need to switch to deterrence derived from a latent threat of "mutually assured economic destruction" and/or punishing long-range conventional strikes against the Chinese mainland.

To understand how conventional deterrence theory can best be applied within this context, one must first review its core elements and prerequisites then assess their immediate implications for US military strategy and operational concept development, particularly in light of publicly available apparent Chinese military doctrine tenets. This article also assesses the implications for a coercive blockading strategy, which is a prime alternative China might employ for aggression or the United States for retaliation. It explores the importance of reassuring an opponent that visible implementation of a deterrence policy reflects defensive and not aggressive aims, as well as the potential utility of Sino-US militarycentric confidence-building measures (CBM) toward those ends. The inseparability of nuclear deterrence from the deterrence of great-power conventional war is examined to identify some of the specific dangers that might characterize notional Sino-US confrontations and observe how they might either strengthen or weaken overall deterrence. After dissecting the nature of the East Asian security dilemma and alliance dynamics, the article proposes how a viable and credible US conventional deterrence policy might be configured.
Dating back to the late Cold War, there has been a general consensus among deterrence theorists that conventional deterrence does not necessarily require convincing a potential adversary that any military aggression it might embark upon would be handily repulsed. Though such defensive capacity represents an ideal, defenders can obtain conventional deterrence by denial if an opportunistic antagonist is convinced that the defender possesses conventional forces of sufficient capability, quantity, readiness, and proximity to the contested area to ensure any conceivable conventional offensive by the antagonist stands an unacceptable chance of degenerating into a costly, risky, protracted, and indecisive conflict. The core element of conventional deterrence credibility stems from the prospective aggressor's perceptions of the defender's resiliency in the face of a withering conventional first strike across multiple warfare domains. The defending force must not only be able to absorb this attack, but also quickly reconstitute itself so that it stands a reasonable chance of neutralizing or destroying enough of the aggressor's forces and supporting military infrastructure, even at a potentially painful cost in
troops and materiel, to slow the aggressor's offensive progress and deny it relatively easy, cheap attainment of its political objectives. The defender's posture is predicated on permanently deploying adequate forces within the contested theater, as the prospective aggressor's calculus takes into account the likelihood that reinforcements from outside the theater, not to mention the defender's overall national military-economic potential, cannot be sufficiently mobilized in mass and time-even if it recognized and rapidly acted upon strategic warning of war (a historical rarity)to prevent the aggressor's first moves from securing either a formidable operational advantage or a fait accompli decision.

Conventional deterrence theory, however, includes several significant caveats. A denial-centric policy may prove insufficient against desperate political leaders who fear their comprehensive power is facing permanent and inevitable decline relative to the defender and that the passage of time is irrevocably diluting any chance of retaining the grand strategic benefits or perceived margin of security granted by the current balance. 
5
[ 120 ] operational plans, and capabilities can negate the defender's deterrent; do not accurately dissect the defender's interests and thereby fail to appreciate the stakes and associated degree of commitment; or believe the defender is feckless and will not resist for long or otherwise escalate if attacked.

9
The strong implication is that the core role of long-range conventional strikes in Air-Sea Battle would be to help suppress or destroy theaterlevel maritime denial capabilities as well as pressure intratheater lines of communication (LOC). 
10
from the main contested area could certainly help support but would not be capable of achieving on their own. Electronic warfare (EW) and cyberspace operations would almost certainly augment conventional strikes in attaining these campaign objectives and, under some circumstances, might even be more appropriate and effective for that end. 
11
12
Whether and where any US conventional or cyber-electronic warfare counterforce attacks would fall in a notional conflict would depend on US political objectives. It cannot be overemphasized that a central consideration shaping those objectives would be the precedential nature and scope of the aggressor's actions that triggered the US response, especially in how deeply those actions incited the passions of the American and allied publics. In the event of a People's Liberation Army (PLA) conventional first strike against US military forces and resources stationed on regional territories, for example, there is reasonable likelihood the afflicted nations would popularly view the attacks as defense treatyinvoking acts of war. This would be even more likely if US and allied forces were comingled such that it would be incredibly difficult, if not impossible, for the PLA to attack one nation's assets without also damaging the other's. PLA conventional strikes against US forces in Guam, Hawaii, or even at sea would certainly constitute direct attacks against
[ 122 ] sovereign US territory. 
13
This makes it highly unlikely that notional long-range strike operations as conceived by Air-Sea Battle would be automatically preemptive vice reactive. 
14
15
Regrettably, potential US adversaries often chauvinistically confuse the American people's decreasing resolve over time during the Vietnam, Afghan, and Iraq conflicts-along with the various 1980s and 1990s interventions-as a cultural "casualty squeamishness" that fails to account for their demonstrated passions, willingness to sacrifice, and political demands for decisive retribution following the Pearl Harbor and 11 September 2001 attacks. 
16
In fact, while publicly available PLA doctrine seems to recognize that the military means employed in a contingency must be configured such that they do not generate excessively escalatory and provocative effects that in turn endanger Chinese political objectives, it does not seem to thoroughly dissect the contradiction between careful escalation management and its operational-strategic goal of decisively seizing the initiative. 17
A first strike is not the only gateway to a conventional fait accompli. A coercive blockade against a geographically or politically isolated country, once implemented, can be extremely difficult to dislodge quickly without either escalation or concession. As demonstrated by the US naval "quarantine" during the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, this is especially true when the blockade is limited to embargoing only a limited set of items or is targeted against an easily isolated country located close to the blockader's homeland.
Blockades can be attractive from an escalation management perspective, as they can elevate the sense of danger, inflict tangible yet measured and largely reversible pain, and provide time and space for the involved parties to continue diplomatic negotiations. However, a blockade's probability of success is likely to be much less certain than that of a traditional military offensive. After all, a blockade cannot achieve its political objectives if the defender maintains strong popular and thus political resolve. This is especially likely if there are sufficient resources within or transportable by third parties into the blockaded area to support prolonged resistance through rationing. The blockader also may not be able to fully surround the defender due to geographic constraints such as border terrain that is difficult to physically control indefinitely, longthus porous-maritime borders, or adjacent third-party countries that refuse to formally honor the blockade. A defender may also find readily available substitutes for embargoed resources and may even be willing to tolerate extensive deprivations. Most significantly, a blockade does not necessarily place the defender in a situation where it either must fire the precedent-setting "first shot" and gamble on war or otherwise concede to the blockader's terms. The defender can easily maneuver the blockader into a situation where the latter must choose between firing that precedential shot or compromising the blockade's integrity.
[ 124 ]
Consider, for example, the issues discussed by Pres. John F. Kennedy and his advisors during the Cuban missile crisis. Kennedy noted the US Navy might have to fire at Soviet cargo ships to force them to stop, perhaps even sinking them. He also noted the possibility that US Navy crews might need to use deadly force when boarding and inspecting these ships. As the crisis wore on, Kennedy and his advisors went to great lengths to defer the first boarding until "the last possible moment" to avoid the risk of a firing incident, in general, as well as to ensure if one were necessary, it would involve Soviet forces located in Cuba as opposed to merchantmen at sea. Kennedy correctly chose to maximize flexibility on blockade implementation to provide time and space for (coercive) diplomacy. 
18
Any one or more of the above pressures may force the blockader to limit the embargo's scale and scope such that its only chance at successfully coercing concessions is if it can be protracted to the extent that cumulative pain compensates for its relative inability to inflict severe immediate pain. A blockade's duration therefore can become increasingly counterproductive in that maintaining enforcers on station is materially expensive and lack of coercive progress in turn can quickly become politically expensive. This is amplified by the immense diplomatic-economic problems of blockade enforcement. If the defender is a major trade partner for neutral countries, the blockader risks damaging the economies of and relations with those countries. The same problem applies if much of the defender's trade is conveyed using neutral-flagged vessels and the blockader is determined not to grant any exceptions from interdiction. These circumstances may force the blockader to make extensive grand strategic accommodations to ensure affected third party countries remain fully neutral at minimum throughout a protracted embargo or conflict. Further, if a neutral vessel refuses to halt, the blockader must decide whether to forcibly interdict it and thereby risk horizontal escalation. Lastly, if the defender can maintain cross-border overland trade flows with a third party country whose airports and harbors can absorb its rerouted external trade, the blockader must decide whether to horizontally escalate by extending the embargo against the third party country or risk the blockade's abject failure. Neutrals in a blockade present a Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013
[ 125 ] critical strategic issue and if mismanaged threaten to complicate a coercive campaign or war effort, much as the British embargo on US trade with Napoleonic France was one of the prime causes of the War of 1812.
These considerations provide the defender a wide set of countermeasures. Although a blockade is internationally recognized as an act of war, the defender may use diplomatic, economic, and information warfare to politically subvert the cordon, much as Iraq did during the 1990s and early 2000s. 
19
A risk-tolerant defender may attempt to maneuver the blockader into a position where the latter must attack a blockade runner (and/or its military escort) and thereby risk triggering an "ill-controlled" escalation. The defender may even employ asymmetric blockade-running methods the blockader cannot easily counter. The 1948-49 Berlin airlift's mass movement of supplies over a ground blockade while daring Soviet inflight interdiction exemplifies the combination of these tactics.
A blockade's final weakness is that it conveys unambiguous warning of war to the defender, thereby triggering mobilization and making it far less likely a later "surprise" conventional first strike could achieve decisive effects. Bottom line, just as the possibility of becoming bogged down in a prolonged war may make an aggressor unwilling to hazard a limited conventional offensive, the possibility that a blockade might take considerable time to achieve its desired coercive effects or that it might risk a broader and protracted war may work as a deterrent. The defender's ability to field forces that can neutralize a blockade's coercive effectiveness while preserving latent options for escalation consequently enhances conventional deterrence.
This logic is a double-edged sword. Just as it applies to scenarios in which China might seek to coercively blockade US allies or partners in East Asia, it also applies to any conceptual US or allied deterrence policy that rests primarily on threatening China with a maritime blockade should it intimidate its neighbors. 
20
[ 126 ] This is not to say such a blockade would not be strategically desirable, useful, or necessary in a notional Sino-US crisis or conflict. It is quite possible that a distant blockade paired with increasing the readiness of in-theater defensive forces might be the most strategically effective and least short-term escalatory military response to a Chinese maritime blockade against a US ally or partner, or perhaps to Chinese seizure of an isolated and unpopulated remote territory, if the PLA does not also directly attack the ally's (or forward-deployed US) forces and bases. Note that if such measures became necessary, the threat of a US blockade as a deterrent would have failed, while the major campaign-fighting credibility of in-theater US and allied forces would still be critical for deterring further Chinese escalation. A peripheral blockading campaign in a protracted major war likewise might meaningfully contribute toward pressuring China's war economy, but rolling back any PLA forces bombarding or occupying allied territories would inherently require conventional sequential campaigns. It therefore is difficult to envision how blockading could ever meet its advocates' claims of a credible core for deterrence, let alone a strategic panacea.
One of the greatest challenges for any deterrent is that it can be interpreted as equally useful for aggressive as for defensive operations. An aggressor may interpret reinforcement of a deterrent as proof a conflict is diplomatically irreconcilable. 
21
22
23
A deterrent can appear quite provocative from Western perspectives without triggering further instability during peacetime or even escalation within a war. If a deterrence policy is deemed excessively provocative by political leaders, opinion elites, or the general public within the
defender's or allied states, this may affect its political viability or sustainability; however, the only perspectives that matter are those of the opponent's leadership. 
24
The continuous crafting and updating of a deterrence policy inherently demands the deterrent's military credibility and manipulation of the opponent's risk tolerances be balanced with reassuring the opponent that it will not be used to support offensive purposes. The defender must identify key opponent strategic decision makers and understand their calculus sufficiently well to calibrate the deterrence policy. This requires attaining a deep and reasonably confident understanding of their unique geostrategic and domestic-political circumstances, including how they define their national and their personal interests and objectives, and likewise how they perceive the defender's interests and objectives.

argument against China's claims that East Asian and US strategic hedging actions conducted to date are in fact unjustifiable and malicious.
Despite their potential utility for reassurance, CBMs are unlikely to do much to help a conventional deterrence policy restrain an extremely desperate, anxious, or overconfident opponent. Nor is conventional deterrence alone sufficient against a potential adversary that implies its nuclear arsenal may shield its homeland-based military apparatus from conventional and cyber-electronic counterattacks even as it freely uses that apparatus to execute or support conventional strikes against US and allied defensive forces or territory.

38
None of this should be interpreted as asserting Beijing would inevitably, let alone deliberately, escalate a Sino-US war to the nuclear threshold. There is an English-language scholarly consensus at present that "no first use" remains strongly ingrained in Chinese strategic culture and nuclear policy. circumstances. These observations do signify, though, that the specifics of a notional future confrontation at a certain point in time could shape their nuclear calculus in ways that are inherently unpredictable at present. Although national strategic culture and political traditions will heavily guide any leader's approach to dealing with a given situation, their evolving perceptions of situational stakes-and the crisis-psychological factors acting upon them or their immediate subordinates-may be just as, if not more, influential on their decision making.
It follows that China's political objectives in a notional war and the degree of commitment its leaders cumulatively incur to achieve them are central. Even if both sides absorb significant cumulative attrition of their conventional military potential, including assets located within their respective homelands, it is entirely possible that their objectives and commitments might remain sufficiently limited for mutual nuclear deterrence to prevail indefinitely. In actuality, so long as neither side becomes existentially endangered by the conflict, this limited conventional war could continue until they become sufficiently exhausted to seek a political settlement, whether temporary or permanent.
Even if one coldly chooses to discount the probable catastrophic human and economic costs of a purely conventional great-power clash, the nuclear risk alone makes it unwise for either side to blindly assume that its counterpart does not presently view a specific political objective or issue as existential, that this interest prioritization would be static and not dynamic amid prolonged direct hostilities, and that an initially limited conventional campaign could therefore be indefinitely kept limited.
This genuine risk of extreme danger, though, can reinforce deterrence. Deterrence credibility does not depend on a state explicitly threatening that it will "go nuclear" if it cannot conventionally hold the line in a given scenario. As deterrence theorist Thomas Schelling observed during the Cold War, credibility is instead established by convincing the other side that fog and friction inherent in direct conflict might inadvertently lead-via iterative reactive rational decisions on both sides-to either side making the first nuclear release at whatever scale and that the other side would assuredly feel compelled to match this action. While their respective nuclear policies and doctrines as well as conventional actions might affect the escalatory characteristics and flow, there would be no way to guarantee neither side would ever perceive itself as being pressed to make a nuclear choice. The first release could conceivably be
a preemptive response based on the initiator becoming convinced that the other side imminently intended a nuclear first strike, or it could be a theater-level action based on fear that the other side's conventional progress would soon cause irrevocable harm to the initiator's survival interests. The fact that both sides deeply want to avoid crossing into nuclear warfare at each iteration of this decision-making sequence would be immaterial, as the ill-controlled process the original attacker initiated would risk carrying them against their strategic-and personal-preferences into the abyss.

A similar cycle might occur following a large-scale Chinese cyberelectronic attack against US theater-level command, control, and communications (C3) systems and networks-and almost certainly would if either side's C3 strategic systems and networks came under intentional attack or incidental disruption. Indeed, targeting errors and unpredictable second-or third-order effects in any warfare domain can serve as potent catalysts for a rapid, vicious escalatory cycle. Alternatively, a vicious cycle might spiral far more slowly-perhaps imperceptibly until too late-as the conventional fight either degenerated into an incremental tit-for-tat competition in escalation or US and/or allied conventional
progress-induced Chinese leaders to explore signaling actions or even battlefield intervention using nuclear forces.

44
This danger is amplified by historical evidence that Chinese strategic culture encourages manipulation of crisis instability without due appreciation of a given situation. In the nearly five decades since China joined the nuclear club, only in the 1969 Sino-Soviet border crisis were Chinese leaders pressured by the combination of opposing forces in very close proximity, a heightened threat of catastrophic national damage, and great-power prestige stakes. The crisis began with a Chinese smallunit ambush of a Soviet border patrol in March 1969 and descended over the following months into a series of periodic tit-for-tat skirmishes by both sides. There is evidence, though, that by the summer of 1969 the Soviet force redeployments to the region, diplomatic messages to other global parties, and increasingly strident rhetoric had convinced Chinese leaders that continued skirmishing might eventually grant the Soviets an excuse to initiate a preventive war, that Beijing's overwhelming inferiority in strategic nuclear forces meant the Soviets could easily devastate China with impunity, and that Chinese diplomatic conciliation was therefore necessary. 
45
mediate, compressed decision-making time lines. Both sides recognized China's then lack of long-range strike capabilities meant its leaders had no incentives to unleash massive and crippling conventional-let alone nuclear-preemption. Though Chinese leaders may have been concerned that on-scene PLA commanders might inadvertently act or react in ways that provided the Soviets a justification for preventive war, this is not quite the same as the problem of maintaining confident political control over military forces in a fast-moving crisis when both sides have preemption incentives. Even at a peak point in the crisis, Chinese leadership deliberately shut down its primary means of direct communication with its Soviet counterparts. This may have been intended to heighten uncertainty and risk as a means of coercion but also may have had the deliberate or unintentional secondary effect of humiliating Soviet leadership. Either way, it was an unforced mistake that may have fed the Soviet escalation that ultimately coerced Chinese agreements to foreswear border provocations and to resume negotiations. 
46
47
It follows that multitrack diplomacy with China should convey US concerns that even limited direct conventional aggression against an East Asian ally would gravely risk unleashing ill-controlled escalatory processes. These channels must make clear that the United States is striving to establish a mutual understanding and appreciation of how such a process risk is an inherent condition of nuclear-age conflict management and that it in no way represents US policy. Messaging would need to emphasize the fundamental and historically proven difficulty of precisely tailoring and controlling uses of national power at all levels of contact with the opponent in a crisis or direct conflict such that those actions and behaviors are not misinterpreted by the opponent, do not have unforeseen and destabilizing effects, and do not ultimately place either side in a situation where escalation becomes perceived as the "least bad option."

over time in response to ever-changing domestic and international political environments, successful deterrence of great-power conventional war requires mutually reinforcing conventional and nuclear deterrence to cover the spectrum of conceivable contingencies. It follows that the true "last clear chance" to avoid a cataclysmic outcome-from which neither side can hope to emerge with a "better" domestic or geostrategic situation than if there had been no war-belongs to the side contemplating conventional aggression in the first place.
Nevertheless, Chinese leaders may erroneously believe their US counterparts are the ones facing the "last clear chance" by virtue of the decision Washington would face on whether to intervene in a contingency. They might also consider themselves, and not the United States, as the guardian of the status quo regarding a specific regional issue. 
54
Notwithstanding these discussions of theory, to what extent do US political leaders really have reason to fear and therefore strive to deter even a limited Chinese conventional offensive against one or more US East Asian ally in the intermediate future? After all, China has successfully wielded "civilian" activists, coast guard-like forces, and economic influence in recent years to achieve significant strategic revisions in contested western Pacific waters without resorting to blunt military force. Its financial and industrial clout have proved just as effective in incentivizing greater Taiwanese economic integration with the mainland as well as restraining direct moves by Taipei toward formal independence.
While these observations are accurate, they implicitly overlook the fact that the US forward-deployed conventional deterrent in East Asia has contributed in no small way over the past six decades to Chinese leaders pursuing primarily negative political objectives in the region, namely preventing formal Taiwanese moves toward independence as well as major changes in the Korean peninsula status quo. In contrast, China's pursuit of positive political objectives-for now mostly limited to contesting the sovereignty of water space and peripheral territories in the East Asian maritime-has increased over the past decade in rough proportion to its perceptions of an increasingly favorable balance of intheater military power. Indeed, even though Chinese political objectives during the 1995-96 Taiwan Strait crisis may have been limited to deterring Taipei's continuation of a pro-independence diplomacy campaign and to influencing Taiwanese elections, the fact that Chinese leaders executed an aggressive military coercion campaign in spite of China's dependence on trade with the United States and its East Asian allies for domestic economic growth indicates the shortcomings of economic integration as a deterrent. US conventional-deterrence posture shifts during the March 1996 portion of the crisis were ultimately necessary to convey to Chinese leaders the inherent risks of further escalating or prolonging their direct coercion.
It is not clear, though, how much longer the variables that have enabled this relative peace can remain balanced. The flammable combination within China of decelerating sustainable economic growth, simmering domestic political pressures, growing political as well as popular confidence in the PLA's ability to wage modern war, perceptions of repeatedly stung national pride in the face of international pushback against certain domestic and foreign policies, and latent nationalist desires for regional revisionism gives added meaning to the investor maxim that "past performance should not be considered indicative of future returns."
[ 138 ]
Until very recently, active Chinese coercion in the East and South China Sea maritime disputes did not directly escalate to involve PLA units. 
55
These risks are exacerbated by pressures placed on the US defense budget by continuing fiscal imbalances. The United States will face increasing difficulty in maintaining the force structure needed to simultaneously sustain conventional deterrence credibility in multiple theaters, thereby forcing Washington to make difficult strategic tradeoffs regarding its risk tolerances. This credibility may suffer further over the next two decades as greater portions of the joint force's capital-intensive equipment approach the end of their programmed lifecycles without one-for-one replacement. Electronics can be periodically upgraded to provide expanded platform capabilities, networking can enhance individual platforms as well as total force capabilities, and routine intensive maintenance, including periodic overhauls, can preserve materiel readiness across decades. Nonetheless, advanced electronic suites and force networking cannot indefinitely compensate for the fact that individual platforms can only physically sustain so many years of high operational tempo before the cost of the maintenance needed to sustain readiness, if not forestall obsolescence, becomes untenable-even more so in a constrained budgetary environment. A single platform, regardless of the force networking resources available to it, is only able to physically cover or influence one area at a time. With the possible exception of heavy ground forces, current US grand strategy all but guarantees that its high military operational tempos over the past decade will not be decreasing anytime soon. Any grand strategy that assumes the United States can quickly fill any gaps in forward-deployed deterrent forces by repeating the late 1930s experience of initiating a timely rearmament effort upon recognized political warning of war ignores the fact that modern armaments are far more complex and the US defense industry's production capacities far less able to rapidly expand than was the case eight decades ago. US political willingness to continue investing in defense at levels that sustain if not improve in-theater conventional force capabilities, quantities, and readiness may be regarded by allies, partners, and potential adversaries alike as a leading indicator of a political resolve over the near-term, and the annual budget's resultant effects on programmed force structure cannot help but imply what US political resolve might be in the intermediate and long terms.
Formal US alliances can partially mitigate any force structure shortfalls in East Asia, but only on a case-by-case basis. Although armaments technology cooperation, coordinated development of doctrine and contingency plans, and routine combined force exercises are excellent methods for improving US-allied interoperability, they do not change the likelihood that over at least the intermediate term, it will remain politically impossible to establish an automated mechanism similar to the North Atlantic Treaty that politically draws all of America's most militarily capable Asia-Pacific allies into any East Asian security crisis. 
56
[ 140 ]
Given that the burden of maintaining a credible conventional deterrent in East Asia will largely fall upon the United States, and given the fiscal pressure that deeply limits the resources available to support defense investment, the United States will need to focus its declining resources over the next decade on developing the force-level capabilities, postures, and doctrinal precepts that deterrence theory suggests are most likely to be effective. 
57
The force-shaping military tasks derived from this policy relate to the regional geographic nature and the need to forestall Chinese attainment of predictable political objectives in notional contingencies. Joint and combined forces will need to be structured for and possess war-gamed and field exercise-tested doctrine supporting decentralized, mutually supporting, and potentially simultaneous execution of tasks such as localized maritime area control and denial; defense against airborne/amphibious assault upon friendly territory, including agile prehostilities defensive force insertion or reinforcement in isolated forward areas; forcible reentry of adversary-occupied friendly territory; logistical support of forward forces while under opposition; and transoceanic/ intratheater mass air-and sealift under opposition. Complicating matters further, all of these tasks will need to be performed within contested cyber-electromagnetic environments.
Concepts of operations for executing these tasks will likely need to increase emphasis on countertargeting and force-level damage mitigation through agile dispersal, not only in terms of where units and groups operate from during contingencies, but also the formations and tactics they employ and correspondingly address the force coordination and logistics challenges generated by dispersal. Austere dispersed forward bases on land, in fact, have great potential for supporting joint and combined operations in contested maritime areas. 
58
59
60
New technologies and evolved material solutions will be necessary to execute these tasks. They will include expanded layered theater air and missile defenses that use active as well as passive measures, resilient information and communications system/network architectures that enable "fighting through" debilitating cyber and electronic attacks, enhanced offensive and defensive EW capabilities with emphasis on systems that can support deception and concealment, and cyber-attack capabilities that can manipulate or disrupt nonstrategic C3 and logistics systems. These will also include distributed undersea warfare sensors and weapons (including increased attention to defensive as well as offensive mine warfare), persistent wide-area surveillance and reconnaissance systems that can support targeting, increased technical capabilities for forward area rearmament and refueling of maritime forces, and expanded fire support as well as long-range conventional strike capabilities against targets at sea and ashore. All of these must be supported by improved joint and combined C3 interoperability at the theater and tactical levels. Individual service tactical data networks that enable a firing unit to launch and guide weapons against targets using sensor data provided either initially or solely by separate units, such as the US Navy's Cooperative Engagement Capability, will likewise need to become more interoperable with other services' and allies' equivalent networks.
As alluded in the earlier examination of Air-Sea Battle, long-range conventional strike systems in particular might play a disproportionate role in reinforcing deterrence credibility by making Chinese leaders much less certain about the utility of a PLA conventional first strike. This is because first-strike logic hinges not only on whether it can inflict a massive and painful blow against the defender's forces and C3 systems, but also on whether the attacker can quickly capitalize operationally on that blow. In other words, even if the attacker incapacitates a significant portion of the victim's forces in a conventional first strike, if it cannot take advantage of this window of opportunity to achieve critical offensive objectives before the victim's surviving forces rally to reestablish a grinding defense, then the first strike would have only served to ignite a more protracted conflict.
Long-range conventional strike systems could fill two roles very early in a conflict to blunt notional Chinese post-first-strike operations. First, they could partially compensate for suppressed or destroyed friendly in-theater forces by conducting strikes or mine laying against the PLA expeditionary and naval forces performing offensive operations within the contested zone, not to mention the logistical forces supporting those operations. These attacks could either be conducted in direct support of surviving in-theater forces or on an opportunistic basis. 
61
[ 143 ]
for their strategic forces); and the theater air and missile defenses that protect the above or otherwise screen PLA forces participating in the offensive. 
62
Although execution of these roles would not enable long-range conventional strike systems to singlehandedly defeat a PLA offensive, they and complementary cyber-electronic operations would likely help suppress its tempo. Additionally, they would be pivotal in providing combined arms support to relatively more vulnerable friendly forces operating in and near the contested zone, thereby helping create the conditions in theater necessary for defensive resiliency. All these contributions might grant the United States and its allies reasonable chances for denying a Chinese fait accompli and ensuring any conflict would be neither quick nor cheap. Even if a conflict opened without China conducting a first strike, as discussed earlier a latent US long-range conventional strike capability could still be quite useful at minimum for intrawar deterrence.
The question of what types of current or new-technology long-range conventional strike systems might best fill the above roles should be resolved by war gaming and other campaign-level analysis. It seems reasonable, however, to assert that there would need to be a mix of systems fielded to balance between responsiveness, survivability, payload deliverability, and the ability to mitigate inadvertent escalation as well as crisis instability risks within the overall capability portfolio.

[ 144 ] municating political and military credibility, as the frequency, methods, and apparent realism of training are all either directly observable or can be selectively disclosed. 
66
All this must be balanced, however, with disciplined efforts to identify and limit overt demonstration of certain capabilities, doctrine, tactics, and planning details that would simplify China's job of "designing around the deterrent." 67 This is hardly a new risk management task facing US military leaders and planners, and the only differences from current exercise and system test procedures might be to more closely integrate their planning with deterrence policy planning. The more challenging risk management task will be continuously assessing demonstration plans against the East Asian geopolitical environment and the evolving US understanding of Chinese leaders, as it might be just as unduly provocative to conduct a given exercise or force movement in a given location under some circumstances as it would be to cancel a previously announced exercise or implicitly rule out certain widely anticipated force movements in that same location under others. This is not to say the more readily observed and measured force attributes of proximity, quantities, and readiness are not just as, if not more, important to deterrence credibility than displays of capabilities and doctrine. Although unlikely, it is possible that no amount of capability and doctrine demonstrations will communicate a deterrent's credibility to a potential adversary unable or unwilling to interpret the messages as the defender intends. The potential adversary may not fully comprehend the defender's way of war, may not fully appreciate the range of capabilities of a given system or force organization within a combined arms context, or may possess excessive confidence in its own. In contrast, major aspects of force readiness posture can be observed remotely, the raw distances between force concentration areas and contested zones can be compared against known or readily estimable platform performance attributes, and sheer quantities of units present in theater can make an impression-provided the potential adversary appreciates the most basic capabilities of those units when comparing them to its own force structure and weapons inventories. Perhaps most importantly, it must be un-
derstood that independent of all other forms of deterrence messaging, an opponent may interpret the defender's force proximity, quantities, and readiness attributes as the clearest indicators-whether intentional and accurate or otherwise-of political resolve.

China's achievements at Scarborough Shoal against the Philippines in spring 2012 demonstrate it does not take many Chinese constabulary personnel, or alternatively "civilian activists," to take de facto control of a small, isolated, and contested island, atoll, or reef-particularly when they are implicitly supported by PLA forces serving as an "over-the-horizon" anti-intervention deterrent. 
70
Low-end dynamic conventional deterrence within the East Asian maritime is predicated on US allies deploying sufficient, sustainable quantities of constabulary forces to contested areas over long periods to protect isolated territories, water-space usage rights, and freedom of navigation as defined by international laws and norms.

Concern for future East Asian peace boils down to a central dilemma: when one state applies persistent, incremental power to bring a contested object under its political control, the other state(s) must choose whether to concede and risk inviting future coercion directed against other valued objects and interests or confront and thereby increase the risk of war. Notwithstanding their own needs to answer domestic demands for national pride and prestige, US East Asian allies presently have no basis for confidently believing Chinese regional ambitions are limited to currently contested objects. The absence of a reciprocated CBM regime and the omnipresent danger of any and all parties misperceiving intentions certainly amplify this problem, but the core factor driving the risk of war is and will continue to be the lack of a foundational political consensus between China and its neighbors on regional security principles. Indeed, China and its East Asian neighbors may very well be viewing the region's security dilemmas from mutually exclusive philosophical and ideological standpoints. If this is the case, it does not bode well for accommodation on these issues, let alone for grand strategic reassurance. Such a philosophical-ideological divide likely indicates a heightened risk for grand strategic confrontation and a lowered likelihood for regional security cooperation through at least the intermediate term. 
75
[ 147 ] Furthermore, it is an analytical mistake to grant current and future Chinese leaders credit for military-strategic decision-making procedural coherency-let alone wisdom-not yet demonstrated in a rapidly unfolding, dynamic, and chaotic regional crisis with major domestic and international political implications. It is intellectually reckless to rationalize away why they would not commit seemingly irrational, destabilizing, and precedent-setting escalatory acts under such circumstances. Chinese strategic culture's lack of experience navigating fast-moving crises and waging modern war combines with the limited open-source information on PLA doctrine to generate a concern that Chinese leaders may be overconfident in their abilities to positively control forces and events during heightened tensions. Should Chinese leaders additionally underrate how Clausewitzian popular passions may influence their competitors' military-strategic decision making, Sino-US crisis stability will face an even greater danger.
Deterrence cannot be obtained cheaply. The difference between what is defensively optimal and what is fiscally affordable generates a credibility risk that US political leaders must address within their deterrence policy and overall grand strategy. It bears repeating that the opponent's perceptions are the critical variables in estimating a deterrence policy's chances for success. US political leaders and opinion elites may consider a given deterrence policy to be elegant and enlightened, but if it does not impact a potential adversary's calculations in the intended way, it invites disaster. Beyond considerations related to US communications of resolve through nonmilitary means, theory only makes clear that deterrence credibility in East Asia depends upon in-theater stationing and preemption-resistant configuration of sufficient US forces and materiel to cause Chinese leaders to question the chances that any notional PLA offensive will secure a rapid, low-cost, and decisive victory. Theory alone cannot indicate whether a marginal dollar allocated toward specific improvements in capabilities, quantities, positioning, or readiness will improve credibility more than if allocated toward any one of the others. All four of these attributes are central to conventional deterrence, and shortcomings in one or more of them in terms of defensive efficacy or implied political resolve can at best only be partially compensated for by the others.
Choosing which tradeoffs to accept requires a cyclical, adaptive process built around continuous detailed net assessments of the Sino-US strategic balance, the ever-evolving understanding of Chinese objectives and perceptions discussed earlier, and disciplined war gaming and experimentation. 
76
77
US leaders must ultimately decide whether the interests in East Asia they wish to uphold justify the cost of deterrence, and if not, accept the strategic consequences of commitment redefinition or extrication. These consequences, however distasteful, remain vastly preferable to having a relatively unambiguous US deterrent threat revealed by a crisis to be a bluff. Similarly, a deterrence policy must be but one element of a coherent US grand strategy that applies all elements of national power to address relations with China, the security of allies, and East Asian stability; it cannot substitute for such a strategy.

4. George and Smoke, Deterrence in American Foreign Policy, 532. 7. For the purposes of this article, punishment is defined as the use of one or more forms of national power to inflict damage upon a transgressor who violates the defender's deterrence threshold. This damage can be against fielded military forces and their infrastructure, industrial infrastructure supporting military production, civil and economic infrastructure, governmental institutions and authorities (potentially including leaders themselves), and/or civil populations. The duration can range from a one-time blow to a series of blows or pressure over a protracted period. Deterrence by punishment therefore is geared around the latent threat of inflicting a degree of damage that a potential adversary deems unacceptable, which in turn restrains that potential adversary from taking the proscribed action.
8. See Gerson, "Conventional Deterrence in the Second Nuclear Age," 38; and Rhodes, "Conventional Deterrence," 225, 248. This would not seem to bode well for successful deterrence using the concept of "mutually assured economic destruction" if opposition leaders judge the probable costs of inaction, or the value of a desired political object, to exceed the estimated costs of incurred economic damage. 9. The most authoritative of these include Gen Norton A. Additionally, the term long-range conventional strike as used herein covers any capability that can deliver a conventional strike weapon against a target at a distance exceeding roughly 1,000 nautical miles (nm). The rationale for this range is the approximate effective distance a notional future contested zone may extend from China's coast. Deep strike systems obviously would be capable of maximum ranges well in excess of this threshold, but the likelihood that these systems will be more expensive than theater-range systems suggests there will probably be a larger inventory of the latter. Strike timeliness-particularly a system's ability to execute a mission fast enough to hit a fleeting target or provide tactically meaningful response times when supporting other friendly forces-also suggests that the strike systems' relative proximity to the fight will be an important campaign-level consideration. Consequently, theater-range systems require a range of at least 1,000 nm if they are to strike contested inner sections if not an adversary's homeland bases and military infrastructure located close behind its borders. Current long-range conventional strike systems include penetrating bombers armed with short-range ordnance, standoff bombers armed with cruise missiles, and submarines armed with cruise missiles. Future systems might include strike fighters armed with longer-range versions of current standoff weapons, submarines armed with theater-range ballistic or hypersonic missiles, standoff bombers armed with hypersonic missiles, or even land-based transoceanic hypersonic missiles. For an examination of current development, potential employment, and escalation risk considerations, as well as arms control treaty issues involving these future systems, see James Acton, Silver Bullet: Asking the Right Questions About Conventional Prompt Global Strike (Washington: Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 2013). Regarding the operational capability and crisis stability tradeoffs among legacy and potential future strike systems, see Forrest E. Morgan, Crisis Stability and Long-Range Strike: A Comparative Analysis of Fighters, Bombers, and Missiles (Santa Monica: RAND, 2013). It is also important to note that the 1987 Soviet-US Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty prohibits the production of ground-launched ballistic missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers, meaning that any US theater-range missile developed for conventional strike that would follow a ballistic trajectory for most of its flight path would need to be sea-based so long as the treaty remains in effect. See " 12. There is some historical evidence Chinese political leaders limited the PLA's use of force when they were concerned about escalatory risks. Of particular interest are the cases where use of PLA aerospace power was restricted, perhaps in part to avoid setting escalatory precedents. That said, these historical restraints occurred under different geostrategic circumstances, involved a different generation of Chinese leaders with different political objectives, and involved a much-less-capable PLA, so it is difficult to assert their applicability to current and future cases. See Forrest E. Morgan et al., Dangerous Thresholds: Managing Escalation in the 21st Century (Santa Monica: RAND, 2008), 188-94. As Clausewitz might have predicted, the scope, scale, and forms of force Chinese leaders would be willing to authorize in a given contingency would no doubt be derived from how they valued their political objectives at that time. This, combined with historical evidence of Chinese self-restraint, generates some hope that multitrack diplomatic outreach well prior to any potential crisis might help Chinese leaders appreciate the extreme escalatory dangers and probable consequences if the PLA were ever directed to implement Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013
[ 153 ] nuclear forces. Nevertheless, they seem to agree that the internal Chinese debate surrounding "no first use" means the standing absolutist interpretation of the policy might not be permanent. It is important to observe that nuclear escalation does not necessarily mean the actual launching of nuclear weapons; the deliberate manipulation of nuclear force postures and positioning for coercive purposes can also be considered a form of escalation. 42. For other possible actions that could initiate a vicious escalatory cycle, see Christensen, "Meaning of the Nuclear Evolution," 468-72, 479-80, 482-83. For an excellent discussion of how decision makers under severe psychological strain in a crisis may interpret the opposing side's behaviors as inherently hostile and not consider less-menacing alternative explanations, see Jervis, Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution, 152-57. Note, though, that a "tit for tat" escalatory approach-combined with firm but flexible diplomatic outreach to the adversary-actually may offer the best chance for ultimately deterring the adversary from further escalation. Tit-for-tat signifies that any escalation by the adversary would be matched by equivalent escalation. The complementary diplomatic approach would involve offering the adversary "off-ramps" that allow the defender to achieve its vital political objectives and the adversary to save face. See Huth, Extended Deterrence, 74-84. The adversary's perceived value of their political objectives, of course, would dictate the point at which they might evaluate the costs and risks of further escalation as too great to merit continuation, and therefore might begin searching for off-ramps.
43. Morgan et al., Dangerous Thresholds, 25-26. War gaming could play a major role in shaping US talking points and agenda items for such a dialogue by identifying previously unrecognized or underappreciated inadvertent (and perhaps even accidental) escalation risks.
44. For context on Chinese C3 architectural goals, see Cortez A. Cooper, "Joint Anti-Access Operations: China's System of Systems Approach," Testimony Presented before the U.S. China Economic and Security Review Commission, 27 January 2011, 6-7. It is not clear from this and the few other Englishlanguage open-source analyses on this topic whether Chinese political leaders understand the real-world capabilities and limitations of advanced C3 or whether they mirror-image C3 doctrine and capabilities as providing US political leaders with a degree of direct situational awareness and control over US forces similar to what they apparently seek to attain over PLA forces. 45. To understand how US leaders contemporaneously viewed the geopolitical motives of both sides in the crisis, see "Intelligence Note: Peking's Tactics and Intentions along the Sino-Soviet Border," US State Department, Bureau of Intelligence and Research, 13 June 1969, http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv /NSAEBB/NSAEBB49/sino.sov.6.pdf. For a summary of the crisis itself, as well as the Chinese decision for conciliation, see "Sino-Soviet Border Talks: Problems and Prospects," Office of Current Intelligence, US Central Intelligence Agency, 10 November 1969, 7-10, http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB /NSAEBB49/sino.sov.26.pdf. A fantastic collection of official Chinese documents tracing the trajectory of Chinese thinking during the crisis is found in Chen Jian and David L. Wilson, eds., " 'All under Heaven is in Great Chaos': Beijing, the Sino-Soviet Border Clashes, and the Turn towards Sino-American Rap-  12, 76. This Chinese decision to avoid direct communication with the other side in an escalating crisis and instead employ diplomatic ambiguity and other measures intended to increase crisis instability for coercive purposes and/or enhance operational-tactical military impact in a war's opening moves is consistent with their actions immediately prior to several of their historical direct military conflicts. Unlike apparent Chinese operational plans during the Sino-Soviet crisis as described within the Zhou report to Mao and several other documents in Jian and Wilson, though, many of these conflicts involved a Chinese conventional offensive first move in mass. See Shulsky, 55- 48. For talking points US diplomats could use to overcome any Chinese reluctance toward establishing such a dialogue, see Christensen, "Meaning of the Nuclear Evolution," 483-84. Tying this into far broader Sino-US discussions encompassing the conventional balance of power, space and cyber warfare, respective force doctrine, and military-to-military management (not resolution) of specific regional security issues may also increase the likelihood of success. See James Acton, "The Dragon Dance: U.S.-China Security Cooperation," Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 29 November 2012, http://carnegieendowment.org /globalten/?fa=50148.

This message was perhaps most famously conveyed in Nikita Khrushchev's "Letter to Kennedy, October 26, 1962," in Laurence Change and Peter Kornbluh, eds., The Cuban Missile Crisis, 1962 (New York: New Press, 1998), 198. It was also conveyed following lesser incidents, such as false warnings of nuclear attacks, to highlight the implications of C3 system fallibility not only with respect to preventing accidental war when tensions were relatively low, but also with respect to situational awareness and positive control over forces in an actual crisis. For example, see "Message from Brezhnev to President on Nuclear Attack False Alarm," US Department of State, 14 November 1979, http://www2.gwu .edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb371/docs/doc%202%2011-14-79.PDF.
50. Huth, Extended Deterrence, 206-7. It is important to note that while this condition may exist, as posited by the "stability-instability paradox," it may not always be the case. Glenn Snyder, an early articulator of the paradox, points out that the interplays between context, specific circumstances, and chance are the keys to its real-world application. In his view, a Soviet conventional offensive against NATO or Japan would have had vastly greater ramifications to US interests and prestige, and therefore more risk of unleashing inadvertent escalatory processes, than one against countries in which US interests were peripheral. Robert Jervis agreed, noting that Schelling's ill-controlled escalatory process meant nuclear equilibrium hardly created any margin of safety for major conventional provocations or wars. See Snyder, Deterrence and Defense, 225-26; Glenn Snyder, "The Balance of Power and the Balance of Terror," in Balance of Power, ed. Paul Seabury (San Francisco: Chandler Publishing Co., 1965), 199; and Jervis, Meaning of the Nuclear Revolution, 21-22, 105. Nevertheless, it is the defender's inability to confidently know whether the stability-instability paradox will work for or against deterrence efforts at a given point in time that drives the need for a conventional hedging force capable of denying the opponent's potential fait accompli attempts.

52. Huth, Extended Deterrence, 206-7. 53. Snyder, "Balance of Power and the Balance of Terror," 194, 199. Snyder points out, however, that just as nuclear stability may not necessarily breed conventional instability, conventional stability can breed nuclear instability. This is because an adversary may interpret the defender's efforts to establish conventional equilibrium as an attempt to create an alternative to having to "go nuclear" first to implement its deterrent threats. The adversary may therefore become more willing to challenge the defender Strategic Studies Quarterly ♦ Winter 2013
[ 155 ] conventionally based on the perception that the latter's resolve was shaky. While this logic is sound, it seems likely that if the adversary recognizes Schelling's ill-controlled-process logic as a real danger and accepts Snyder's and Jervis's other arguments regarding the stability-instability paradox, Snyder's initial observation regarding conventional equilibrium contributing to nuclear stability would be more likely to prevail.
54. As such, they might perceive that they are reacting to revisionist attempts by the United States and its allies, and that therefore the United States is the one risking initiation of the ill-controlled process. See Christensen, "Meaning of the Nuclear Evolution," 452, 463-66, 472-75, 481-82.

56. Part of this is due to East Asia's twentieth-century history, namely the legacy of the Japanese Empire prior to 1945. Geography and military-strategic circumstances, though, also play major roles. The size of West European states meant that a Soviet ground thrust into West Germany would inherently imperil its neighbors through rapid follow-on military conquest or eventual coerced political "Finlandization." This threat was self-evident to Western Europe's politicians and peoples of the late 1940s. As the Second World War had also devastated their economies, militaries, and civil infrastructure, standing alone could not provide a viable deterrent.
These geographic and military-strategic circumstances do not apply in today's East Asia. It is hard to politically envision East Asian states seeking a binding collective security architecture absent a Chinese military threat to their sovereignties that is so ominous it overcomes the Japanese imperial legacy issue for some and nonalignment preferences of others. It should be noted that the imperial legacy issue includes Japan's own need for constitutional amendments to make participation in a collective security architecture possible.
The critical piece, however, would come down to how Japanese and South Korean political leaders evaluate their dependencies on the rest of East Asia for trade and security. They are likely to remain satisfied with their respective bilateral defense treaties with the United States so long as they do not individually perceive their security has become critically dependent upon that of other East Asian states. Should Japan and South Korea perceive their respective interests would be gravely jeopardized if other East Asian states were to fall within China's orbit via coercion or conquest, though, they would likely become the chief advocates of a formal architecture that commits the United States to collective security.
57. The relative probable efficacy of a deterrence policy option should be evaluated based on whether there is sufficiently rigorous analytical evidence that it provides "the most promising means by which an adversary's decision calculus is moved toward deterrence and away from coercive action or attack." See Deterrence Operations Joint Operating Concept, 52-53.  58. This is a central point of the new US Navy and Marine Corps "Single Naval Battle" concept. See Maj Gen Kenneth McKenzie Jr., USMC, "Naval Power and the Future of Assured Access," Armed Forces Journal, January-February 2013, http://armedforcesjournal.com/2013/01/12842317. That said, US and allied preparation and use of dispersed forward operating bases (FOB) on land-however austere, remote, and transient-may generate domestic political challenges for the host nation during peacetime as well as war. Sites that a host nation is willing to allow the United States to use in contingencies involving its direct defense might not be politically available in those that do not. Though peacetime diplomacy can establish the terms of US access to potential FOBs on a given nation's soil, these terms can easily change based on political circumstances. Doctrine developers and operational planners must take these risks into consideration. 62. The PLA's fielding of robust integrated air defenses in support of these kinds of bases and sensor sites, not to mention these systems' extensibility for supporting offensive operations near China's borders, strongly suggests Chinese leaders deem all of these target types as legitimate for US conventional strikes in a major conflict. See Colby, "Don't Sweat AirSea Battle." 63. Standoff bombers and strike fighters could attack relatively fixed and not heavily hardened PLA targets whose neutralization would slow down, if not significantly weaken, a Chinese offensive campaign. Standoff strike aircraft could also "open the door" for strikes by penetrating aircraft. Penetrating bombers and strike fighters would be necessary to attack more-hardened PLA targets, as well as for general follow-on strikes once standoff-range weapons inventories were inevitably depleted. The high combat potency of strike aircraft, though, suggests most would normally need to be based outside the contested zone to mitigate crisis instability risks and also provide expanded escalation management options; bombers would obviously be based much further away than fighters. The greater an aircraft's basing distance from the contested zone, though, the less it would be able to respond quickly to fleeting tactical needs or opportunities. In contrast, submarines' high survivability within a contested zone means they would not be vulnerable to preemptive attack and that this forward positioning could compensate somewhat for the strike aircraft basing-distance problem. Strike missile-armed surface combatants may contribute as well, albeit from the outer areas of the contested zone. It follows that sea-launched cruise (or future theater-range ballistic) missiles could be quite useful against the same target types as standoff aircraft, which in turn suggests their potential role as the leading edge of an assured conventional second strike and similar time-critical follow-on strikes. Their limited potency and the time-consuming (and currently vulnerable) logistics of reloading their launchers, however, means these missiles must still be complemented within the portfolio by strike aircraft. Dispersed FOBs for strike fighters within the contested zone (if available) and aircraft carriers operating from the periphery (as possible) can help in this regard. For analysis supporting these assertions, see Morgan, "Crisis Stability," 31-32, 38-50, 99-123.  64. Solomon, "Maritime Deception and Concealment," 94-96. Though the logic expressed in that article is specifically applied to the launch of a standoff-range strike against maritime forces, it is just as extensible to any attacker-defender dyad. Also see Acton, "Silver Bullet," 83-84, 88, 100, 146.

Note that exercises do not necessarily need to demonstrate the actual approach US and allied forces would follow in a war. An exercise's core military purpose is to help participating forces become more proficient in executing doctrine and tactics. Beyond this objective, exercises can be-and historically were-designed to shape a potential adversary's perceptions of how US and allied forces would fight. Typically, this involves selectively disclosing certain capabilities deemed likely to impress the potential adversary. Another application might be to "prove" to the opponent something it already believes is true about US and allied forces, plans, or strategy. Exercises designed with these secondary purposes in mind can be particularly useful for reinforcing deterrent credibility. Doctrine, tactics, and capabilities deemed too war-critical to risk peacetime exposure to the opponent can be exercised using unit-level and force-level synthetic training systems. See Solomon, "Maritime Deception and Concealment," 103, 105-7; and Christopher A. Ford and David A. Rosenberg, The Admirals' Advantage: U.S. Navy Operational Intelligence in the Second World War and Cold War (Annapolis, MD: Naval Institute Press, 2005), 97. 67. Rhodes, "Conventional Deterrence," 228, 235. 68. In this light, it is important to note that the much-referenced 2012 Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) study on US Asia-Pacific force structure options primarily examined the geopolitical, domestic-political, material, and fiscal feasibility of each option. The unclassified, publicly released main body of the study did not seem to examine the operational-tactical war-fighting efficacy of each option within the operational-strategic context of a direct Sino-US conflict. Nor did it examine those options within the context of deterring a Chinese attempt to militarily achieve a fait accompli. It is not clear whether the judgments on force structure sufficiency were in part informed by war gaming the options within these contexts using known and anticipated Chinese capabilities, doctrine, and force structure as well as US and allied doctrines and peacetime postures in the near and intermediate-terms as Lambeth's latest book does not downplay the spectacular ground advance to Baghdad or claim "victory through airpower." Instead, he presents a carefully constructed and balanced thesis demonstrating that the major combat phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom "was a true joint and combined campaign by American, British, and Australian air, land, and maritime forces to bring about a decisive end to Hussein's regime." The author's analysis of events in context, deftly balancing breadth and depth, makes this clear, accurate, and valuable book the most comprehensive analysis of the campaign to date.
Lambeth puts his assessment of the air-land offensive in proper context through a framework in which the first chapter sets the political-military stage ("The Road to War"), while the last chapter looks "Toward a New Era of Warfare." The reader gains knowledge of the behind-the-scenes planning that took place in the White House, the Pentagon, and various military headquarters in the months and weeks prior to combat, including GEN Tommy Franks' "lines and slices matrix." The concluding chapter then places the results of the campaign into a wider perspective, including thoughts on the problems that surfaced as soon as the United States sought to turn a decisive military victory into a nation-building process-an effort that remains unfinished 10 years after the collapse of the Baath regime and the capture of Saddam Hussein.

The breadth of the study stems from Lambeth's comparison of the air-land offensive with previous wars, with particular attention paid to Operations Desert Storm and Enduring Freedom. Lambeth examines the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war, demonstrating the utility of kinetic and nonkinetic airpower. In the process, he both describes key achievements well beyond "sorties flown and bombs dropped" and identifies where airpower fell "short of expectations." He points out strengths and shortcomings for the full spectrum of missions: control of the air; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); maneuver (transportation and airlift); and strike. Although Operation Iraqi Freedom was a US-led operation, the author highlights key British and Australian contributions, not only in the political sphere but also in terms of military leadership and overall combat performance.
The depth of the book lies in the detailed treatment of concepts, technology, and leadership, all key elements of the Airman's profession. Unlike Operation Desert Storm, the initial phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom involved concurrent and synergistic, rather than sequential, actions by land and air forces. Lambeth takes readers through the three weeks of high-intensity combat, discussing the operational concept, which was based on functional effects rather than on destruction or attrition. He examines the logistical challenges, discusses the importance of intelligence as an integral part to the operational plan, and highlights the unprecedented level of coordination among air, maritime, and ground components.
The technological aspect is tremendously important in helping readers understand how the war was fought. This study shows just how technologically complex, time-sensitive, interdependent, and interoperable warfare has become. The author avoids the trap of focusing on targeting alone despite its obvious importance when planning, leading, and executing a campaign of this size and scope. The powerful coming together of concepts and technology is illustrated in the notion of "parallel operations": airpower can operate against virtually all of the centers of gravity directly related to military-strategic objectives, regardless of their location, and in a very compressed period of time.
The study also provides considerable insight into the operational command and leadership of Lt Gen Michael "Buzz" Moseley, emphasizing the importance of personal relations when conducting joint and combined operations with other services and other countries and reminding readers of the need for trust and respect at all levels of the chain of command. This is an important book, providing a solid counterpoint to the groundcentric literature of major combat operations and detailing significant lessons on the application of modern warfare. Lambeth's critical analysis combines the big picture with necessary specifics on achievements and deficiencies. The book also delivers a useful reminder that if a campaign's overarching goal is to supplant an existing regime, then plans for stabilization, nation building, and defense and security sector reform must receive as much attention as the campaign plan for major combat operations-or even more. Lambeth teaches the sobering lesson that "every war must end" and that exit strategies and transition plans should be in place prior to military engagement. Replacing an existing regime with a functioning and accountable authority in line with Western principles of democracy, individual liberty, rule of law, and human rights requires a focus that extends well beyond the battlefield.

Book Review In a few short decades, China has risen from poverty to the world's secondlargest economy and is likely to overtake the United States for the top spot by 2016. This economic growth has funded significant investments in new weapons and capabilities for the People's Liberation Army that threaten the ability of the United States to deploy forces to intervene in conflicts in the Western Pacific. The future seems bright for China to retake its traditional role as East Asian hegemon and a leading global power.
In The Rise of China vs. the Logic of Strategy, Edward Luttwak, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, offers a more measured view of China's future. Approaching the problem "as a strategist and not as a sinologist," Luttwak applies what he calls the "universal logic of strategy" to the rise of China.
While taking pains to deny that he is a realist, Luttwak makes essentially a realist argument. The growth of the Chinese economy, its military, and its global influence will inevitably produce balancing behavior from other states. The rise of Chinese power, as Luttwak and many realists predict, would provoke this reaction even if China were a democracy or a state that maintained amicable relations with its neighbors. Recent Chinese foreign policy behavior, however, has only served to exacerbate the threat felt by other states in the Asia-Pacific region. While for decades Chinese leaders sought a "peaceful rise" and settled most of their outstanding territorial disputes with their continental neighbors, over the last decade China has taken a more aggressive approach, particularly regarding its maritime claims in the East and South China Seas. Luttwak offers a comprehensive catalog of instances of China's "premature assertiveness" and the backlash it has produced among its neighbors.
Luttwak attributes this assertiveness to pathologies in Chinese strategic culture, the exploration of which is the most valuable portion of the book. The main driver is "great power autism," Luttwak's term for a tendency of national leaders to focus their attention on domestic problems and give short shrift to foreign policy and the sensitivities of other nations. While such "autism" is also a feature of US and Russian foreign policy, the scale of the domestic demands placed on China's leaders and the influence of Chinese imperial history make China a far more difficult case. In its traditional role as regional hegemon, Luttwak suggests, China was isolated from peer states, and its foreign policy limited the receipt of tribute from smaller states and the management of barbarians, leaving current Chinese leaders less capable of navigating the modern Westphalian international system.
History has misshaped Chinese strategic culture in other ways. Ancient military thinkers such as Sun Tzu have had a lasting influence on how Chinese leaders conduct foreign policy. The insights of these classical strategists, while successful in the context of China's distant past, translate poorly into the contemporary international environment. Classical Chinese strategy recommends the betrayal of allies and the frequent changing of sides in a conflict to prevent another state from becoming too powerful, provokes crises to force other states to the negotiating table to resolve disputes, and relies heavily on deception and surprise. While these methods were perhaps more viable in China's Warring States period, this behavior is likely to breed suspicion and distrust among neighbors in the contemporary context. Despite the often inappropriate lessons of China's classical strategists, these ideas are embedded deeply in the minds of the Chinese elite, which Luttwak contends prevents China from developing a strategic culture that would be less threatening to its neighbors.
Luttwak's treatment of Chinese strategic culture is, if somewhat cursory, delightfully provocative. One wishes that he had further developed his insights about the "strategic unwisdom of the ancients" with a greater exploration of Chinese history and strategic thought along the lines of his Grand Strategy of the Byzantine Empire.
In response to China's increasingly aggressive foreign policy, other states in the Asia-Pacific have begun to rebuild old security ties, develop new alliances, and invest more heavily in their militaries. Luttwak rightly suggests that a purely military effort would prove to be both an inadequate and unwise strategy in the long term given China's unfettered economic growth. He suggests a geoeconomic strategy that would contain Chinese growth, and in turn its military potential and global influence, by restricting its access to resources and foreign markets. While Luttwak detects the stirrings of such a reaction in the form of restrictions on Chinese land purchases in Latin America and on government purchases of Chinese goods in the United States, he does not provide a clear picture of what form a deliberate geo-economic strategy would take. A more expansive treatment of this subject would provide a useful guide for policymakers grappling with the rise of China.
The Rise of China is a worthwhile read for anyone concerned with the challenge of China's rise. Luttwak offers a provocative take on Chinese strategic culture and the weaknesses of China's classical military thinkers as well as a thorough assessment of recent Chinese foreign policy. The weaknesses in the book derive from its brevity. While Luttwak offers a number of interesting ideas about the nature of Chinese decision making and strategies for coping with China's rise, the breadth of the topic he addresses in a relatively short book does not allow the space to develop them as fully as needed. One hopes, and expects, Luttwak will return to the problem of China and continue to explore these ideas in the future.
