How and why has Russia disputed innocent passages by Western warships in the Black Sea since the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) in 1982, and how has the West justified the conduct of these passages?
My thesis will focus on the historical, geopolitical, military, and legal context surrounding four instances of innocent passage conducted by USS Yorktown and USS Caron (1986 and   1988, respectively), HMS Dragon (2020), and HMS Defender (2021) within 12 nautical miles of Crimea, in order to explain the broader implications that these innocent passages have for operations in the disputed waters of the Black Sea and the South China Sea.
Whereas the 1986 innocent passage was met with Soviet naval interference and diplomatic protests, the 1988 innocent passage resulted in an infamous shouldering or "bumping incident"-the most dangerous encounter between U.S. and Soviet warships in the Black Sea during the Cold War, and the last significant hostile interaction between U.S. and Russian surface warships until 2014. 1
A similar pattern of escalation took place after Russia's 2014 annexation of Crimea.
After the Cold War, the West continued to operate in the Black Sea, but those operations did not result in any newsworthy confrontations until Russia's annexation of Crimea. Since 2014, Russia has aggressively confronted Western warships operating in international waters in the Black Sea. In late 2020, HMS Dragon conducted the first newsworthy innocent passage of a Western warship within 12 nautical miles of Crimea since the Cold War with little controversy. Conversely, the subsequent 2021 innocent passage by HMS Defender drew a much more aggressive Russian response. This thesis provides a historical context for these innocent passages and explores the U.S. and UK rationale for their conduct, as well as Russia's objections.
This thesis will help policy makers and strategists in the United States and its allies and partners better understand how to address the Russian threat in disputed waters. In the current geopolitical environment, a conflict between the United States, the United Kingdom, and Russia in the Black Sea would be costly, could escalate dramatically, and would distract the United States and the United Kingdom from the "pivot" to East Asia at time when they are positioning themselves to counterbalance the rising Chinese military threat. The United States and the United Kingdom, therefore, must have a coherent policy and strategy that efficiently deters the Russian maritime threat. Through examination of how and why military interactions in the Black Sea have evolved, this thesis aims to provide insight for future policy makers and strategists so they can better craft maritime policy and strategy to address the Russian threat in the Black Sea, the Arctic, and the Sea of Japan.
Furthermore, military interactions in the Black Sea between the West and USSR/ Russia can set crucial precedents and lessons learned for the Chinese projection of military power in East Asia. According to Lieutenant General (Retired) Charles Hooper, "the PLA [People's Liberation Army] are careful and meticulous students of modern warfare," and the West should assume that China will adapt its approach to Taiwan based on Russia's successes and failures in Ukraine.

Scholars generally agree that Crimea and the warm waters of the Black Sea have long been strategically crucial objects for Russia's great power ambitions. Since Russia first annexed Crimea in 1783, the peninsula has remained important to Russia's foreign policy and security, giving Russia access to the Mediterranean via the Turkish Straits.

Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Navy from 1956-1985 and one of the most transformative leaders in Russian naval history, stressed the importance of Crimea and the Black Sea to Russia, writing that Russia's defeat at the hands of the English and French in the Crimean War in the 1850s was an "exceptionally important turning-point" for Russia and resulted in a "humiliating ban" on Russian naval forces in the Black Sea that lasted until 1871. 8 Martin Malia concurs with Gorshkov's assessment that the Crimean War represented a turning-point for Russia, writing that the war was the beginning of a "losing streak" for pre-Soviet 
Russia. 9

This outlook persists to this day. A 2020 RAND report sums up the contemporary importance of the Black Sea region to Russia, calling it "an intersection of several core
Russian concerns and a critical nexus for defending the Russian homeland, maintaining a sphere of influence, shaping the future of Europe, and projecting power into the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East."

During the Cold War, the Black Sea remained crucial to Soviet security-so much so that after adopting the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III), the USSR took the extreme measure of creating a domestic law in 1983 8 Gorshkov, The Sea Power of the State, 81.

These incidents also had significant implications for both bilateral and international norms governing conduct and relations in the maritime realm. In 1989, the U.S. and USSR signed a joint statement detailing their shared understanding of the rules governing innocent passage.

The postures and naval interaction between Russia and the West in the Black Sea can also be analyzed from the standpoint of theories of international relations and crises.
Graham Allison offers three models to describe and assess government actions in crisis situations: (1) the Rational Actor Model;
(2) the Organizational Behavior Model; and (3)
the Governmental Politics Model. 
53
54
The Governmental Politics Model can also accommodate Beth Fischer's argument that Reagan's Secretary of Defense, Caspar Weinberger, desired tensions between the USSR and United States to remain high to justify his historically large defense budget. 
56
57
Because of the distinct geopolitics of the Black Sea, the innocent passage incidents there also necessarily involve many allies of the parties involved, as well as third parties. To understand this aspect, certain insights from the works on alliance theory are useful.

Through the application of these theoretical perspectives on the Black Sea innocent passage operations, my thesis will test the following hypotheses:
1.
The initial decision to conduct innocent passage operations in the 1980s and 2020s is consistent with Allison's Rational Actor Model, whereby the United States and its allies carried out these operations in an effort to contain the USSR/Russia. But follow-on innocent passage operations in those time periods became standard operating procedures, and therefore align better with Allison's Organizational Behavior Model.
Soviet/Russian challenges to Black Sea innocent passages can be described by Allison's Rational Actor and Governmental Politics Models-as response to threats of foreign encroachment in the region, and as efforts to boost the regime's domestic legitimacy by seeming to guard against this threat.
The evolution of Soviet/Russian response between the 1980s and the 2020s is best explained by changes in both Russia's governmental politics and the organizational structure of Russian military and its doctrine. In particular, while the USSR relied on physical contact as a deterrent in the 1980s, Russia's response to the more recent incidents involved a much wider array of methods, to include an aggressive media campaign to dominate the domestic narrative.
General periods following major crises and tension between the West and USSR/Russia led to more frequent-and more serious-innocent passage incidents in the Black Sea as the United States and its allies undertook such operations to demonstrate commitment to its allies and partners in the region, and the USSR/Russia felt compelled to push back against such encroachments.
This thesis examines the above hypotheses using process tracing to develop a stepby-step analysis of specific incidents and to isolate the key causal factors that determined how they unfolded. To analyze the patterns and evolution of these interactions, the thesis relies on academic studies, policy analyses, international legal documents, speeches and public releases by government officials, and media reports on Soviet/Russian interactions with the West in the maritime domain. It uses the lessons learned from the Black Sea incidents to examine similar disputes between China and the West in the South China Sea.
Chapter II includes a review of the history of Soviet-U.S. The second part of the thesis focuses on controversial innocent passages conducted by the West in the past decade and their broader implications. For context, Chapter IV 
Throughout the twentieth century, the Black Sea was of strategic economic importance for Russia and the Soviet Union. Not only did the sea facilitate trade along its own coast, it gave the Soviet Union direct access to the Mediterranean. Important rivers, like the Danube, Dnieper, and Don (via the Sea of Azov), allowed the USSR to carry goods from the Black Sea deep into the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact countries. Furthermore, via the Suez Canal, the Black Sea provided the Soviet Union with a relatively short maritime route to project power into the Persian Gulf-cutting the transit nearly in half. 
64
From a military perspective, the Black Sea allowed the Soviet Union to extend its defenses. The Soviet Navy's Black Sea Fleet had the potential to quickly sortie into the Mediterranean to monitor and harass NATO warships or project Soviet power abroad. The Turkish Straits, in turn, acted as a drawbridge for the Black Sea-allowing foreign warships only one avenue of approach. In peacetime, that strategic accessway facilitated the Soviets' ability to monitor NATO warships operating in the Black Sea. Black Sea unimpeded (provided the Soviets did not mine the waters north of Istanbul). 
65
Since the USSR did not control the Turkish Straits, the next best place from which to secure a commanding position in the Black Sea has been Crimea. The peninsula is centrally located in the Black Sea, giving the Soviets an unsinkable aircraft carrier, which they could use to protect their fleet in Sevastopol and deny much of the Black Sea to NATO. Dimitry Gorenburg says that from Sevastopol, a navy "can pretty much control all approaches and dominate the region vis-a-vis Turkey." 
66
In order to limit foreign access to the Black Sea and guarantee Russian passage through the Turkish Straits, Russia agreed to the 1936 Montreux Convention, which has been a double-edged sword ever since. On one hand, non-Black Sea navies must announce their passage 15 days prior to transiting into the Black Sea, spend no more than 21 consecutive days in the Black Sea, and abide by strict limits on ship size and class. 
67
68
As the Soviet surface navy grew in the 1960s, incidents at sea between U.S. and Soviet warships became more frequent-notably, in 1967, USS Walker and Soviet warship Besslednyy collided in the Sea of Japan.

But despite its primary purpose to ensure freedom of navigation, UNCLOS III limits the activities in which a warship can engage during an innocent passage transit.

The coastal State may, where necessary having regard to the safety of navigation, require foreign ships exercising the right of innocent passage through its territorial sea to use such sea lanes and traffic separation schemes as it may designate or prescribe for the regulation of the passage of ships. In 1983, the U.S. Navy held FleetEx-83, the largest maritime exercise in the Pacific since WWII.

As Gorbachev dealt with these challenges, a West German teenager publicly exposed the vulnerability of Soviet air defenses. 
The Reagan administration used the Freedom of Navigation (FON) program to sail U.S. warships in and around Soviet territorial waters in the 1980s, thereby increasing tensions between the two superpowers.

In addition, strong evidence in support of Allison's Governmental Politics Model comes from a conversation between U.S. Vice Admiral Mustin and Soviet Admiral Makarov in the wake of the 1988 bumping incident. Winkler writes that Makarov said to Mustin, "I'm getting calls from the commissars and politicians saying that we spend hundreds of millions of rubles on the Soviet Navy so that the Soviet Navy can protect us from the U.S. Navy and you can't protect us!" 130 Admiral Makarov continued, predicting that the Soviet officials were "going to cut his budget," writes Winker. 
131
A CIA analysis, written the day after the bumping, largely concurs the Ivanovich's claims. The assessment notes that the decision to bump was probably "decided at the highest political level." 
132
133
134
One important calculation in the bumping decision was the disparity in displacement between the U.S. and Soviet warships in the 1988 bumping incident-the Soviets chose to ram with relatively small ships, thereby mitigating the damage they did to the U.S. warships. The Soviet Krivak I-class frigate Bezzaventnyy displaced 3,700 tons, had a top speed of 32 knots, and rammed the Yorktown, which weighed 9,600 tons (see Figure

1988. 142
The bumping incident did not escalate into a larger conflict, but both sides realized that it could have and took steps to remedy their disagreements. The incident served as an impetus for the Agreement on the Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities (PDMA), signed in June 1989. For example, U.S. Secretary of Defense Carlucci referred to the bumping incident when advocating for the PDMA. 
143
The Soviet assent to the English translation of UNCLOS III article 22 set an important strategic precedent in favor of the United States. The Soviet domestic law limiting the innocent passage of foreign warships threatened the United States-a maritime power. If the Soviet domestic law had remained unchallenged, it is likely that other states would have eventually enacted similar laws to limit the innocent passage of foreign warships through their waters. Such a scenario would have greatly diminished the ability of the United States to operate and project its maritime power abroad.
NATO allies are conducting unscheduled, I want to underline it, unscheduled drills in the waters of the Black Sea…our Defence Ministry also proposed to hold its own unplanned exercises in the same area. But I believe this is not appropriate and there is no need to further escalate the situation there.
-Vladimir Putin, November 2021 151
In 1954, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean peninsula to Ukraine. At the time, ownership of the peninsula was somewhat trivial, given that both Russia and Ukraine were part of the Soviet Union. However, that transfer became problematic for Russia after the fall of the Soviet Union, given the strategic importance of Crimea in controlling the Black Sea region. In particular, the strategic Crimean port of Sevastopol is the home of Russia's Black Sea Fleet. For two decades, Russia maintained its base in Sevastopol via precarious lease agreements with Ukraine.

Further undermining Russia's influence, the eastward expansion of the European Union threatens Russia's economic interests. By expanding its trading bloc, the EU gains growing trading leverage over Russia and pulls Russia's neighbors out of its orbit. For example, in 2013, Ukraine rejected a trade deal from Russia and, instead, made a bid to join the EU. 170 John Mearsheimer has recognized the threatening nature of EU expansion for

The coastal State may, without discrimination in form or in fact among foreign ships, suspend temporarily in specified areas of its territorial sea the innocent passage of foreign ships if such suspension is essential for the protection of its security, including weapons exercises. Such suspension shall take effect only after having been duly published.

At the same time, the USSR had a nuanced approach to deterrence, taking care to avoid a too strong of a response that could have led to dangerous escalation. In both cases, the USSR did not bump the foreign warships the moment they entered its territorial waters-and allowed them to continue transiting through Soviet territorial waters for another hour and a half after the bumping. Also, even though the USSR had a strong navy, backed by thousands of nuclear weapons, it did not react in the same aggressive fashion when U.S. warships entered Soviet territorial waters in 1986-1987. This behavior suggests that the Soviets rationally chose to employ limited aggression to deter further foreign encroachments to preserve the legitimacy of the Soviet regime, while still avoiding dangerous standoffs.
The Russian reactions to the 2020 innocent passages, in turn, were driven more by domestic considerations and less so by geopolitical imperatives. They occurred against the backdrop of a weakened Putin regime, which feared a color revolution in Russia, and exploited the nationalist sentiments and animosity triggered by the British freedom of navigation operations as a propaganda tool to boost its domestic legitimacy. Additionally, Putin did not inflict any physical damage to the HMS Defender or impose any real cost to the British. As a result, the Russian reaction to the 2021 innocent passage appears to have served domestic political purposes more than foreign policy objectives.
In addition to the greater role of domestic politics, the evolution of Soviet/Russian response between the 1980s and the 2020s was also driven by changes and adaptations in the organizational structure of the Russian military and its doctrine, captured in hypothesis 3 of this thesis. In particular, while the USSR relied on physical contact as a deterrent in the 1980s, Russia's response to the more recent incidents involved a much wider array of methods, to include an aggressive media campaign to dominate the narrative. Turning to the U.S. rationale for conducting innocent passages in the 1980s and 2020s the initial decisions to conduct these operations are consistent with Allison's Rational Actor Model, whereby the United States and its allies carried out these operations in an effort to contain the USSR/Russia. The case studies find no evidence to support hypothesis two of the thesis, which argues that follow-on innocent passage operations become codified into standard operating procedures, following the Organizational Behavior Model. This could be a consequence of the fact that this thesis focused exclusively on controversial innocent passages-a subset of freedom of navigation operations most likely to illicit an intervention, especially when conducted against a peer or near-peer naval power. In these cases, it appears that each freedom of navigation operation is individually planned, scrutinized, and approved at the highest levels of government, and adjusted to the geopolitical context. This thesis found no evidence that the Western powers studied in this thesis allowed these higher-profile freedom of navigation operations to become routine operations of lower echelons of government.
Nevertheless, the repetitive nature of these operations has led to a development of patterns along which they are executed, allowing the Soviet/Russian adversary to predict Western behavior and become more confident and determined to challenge it.
This thesis finds little evidence that the 1980s innocent passage encounters were conducted in line with hypothesis four, which holds that periods following major crises and tension between the West and USSR/Russia led to more frequent-and more serious-such incidents in the Black Sea, as the United States and its allies undertake such operations to demonstrate commitment to its allies and partners in the region, compelling USSR/ Russia to push back against such encroachments.
In particular, this hypothesis does not explain the freedom of navigation operations in the late 1980s, when tensions between the superpowers were relatively low. Also, even though the 1986 U.S. Maritime Strategy emphasized support for "U.S. alliances and friendships," there is little evidence that the 1980s innocent passages were executed in support of NATO members, such as Turkey.

Maritime Strategy, which called for "exerting global pressure on the Soviet Union." 217
In contrast, the 2020s innocent passages, which occurred after Russia's initial invasion of Ukraine, do support hypothesis four that the United States and its allies carried out these operations to support key allies and partners. 
Some lessons from the Black Sea controversial innocent passage cases appear to be highly applicable to the current maritime competition in the South China Sea. First, freedom of navigation operations remain very relevant to international maritime law and 216 Watkins, The Maritime Strategy, 8.
217 Watkins, The Maritime Strategy, 9-10.  diplomacy in the wake of the unprecedented challenges to the current global order by resurgent China. A country which ceases to operate in waters illegally claimed by another still risks ceding those waters by setting a precedence of absence. However, in today's era of great power competition, a large portion of which occurs in the highly contested information domain, it is no longer enough to simply operate a warship in disputed waters.
The media narrative surrounding an operation is also increasingly critical to the success of these operations. For this reason, it is vital that the U.S. Navy ensure detailed and accurate audio and visual records of its freedom of navigation operations are promptly disseminated to media outlets so that an adversary's (often misleading) narrative does not prevail. This is not a secret to the U.S. Navy, which assigns naval Visual Information Personnel (VIPER) teams to ships involved in these operations to capture interactions at sea. 
218
The three perspectives derived from Allison's models that this thesis applied to assess Russian behavior in the controversial innocent passage encounters in the Black Sea also apply to the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN). The Rational Actor Model provides a useful baseline model of PRC actions, as it would explain PRC behavior without having to look inside the "black box" of PRC politics and organizational behavior.
On a more fundamental level, the domestic politics captured by the Governmental Politics Model also appear to be a persistent driver of PRC actions, although these internal political dynamics may be mostly opaque to outside observers and operational planners of freedom of navigation operations-just as they were for the Soviet Union. high seas or while exercising the right of innocent passage, transit passage, or archipelagic sea lanes passage. Next, it would categorize FONOPs based on anticipated risk and provide a menu of considerations that lower echelons can use to evaluate future operations. The appendix provides an example of the topics such a document might address. The example breaks freedom of navigation operations into three categories based on risk-low, medium, and high. Then, for each risk category, it describes the corresponding excessive maritime claimant's characteristics and the claimant's anticipated reaction to a U.S. freedom of navigation operation. Next, it offers a menu of recommended precautions ships should consider before conducting a freedom of navigation operation. Finally, there is a section for pre-planned responses that ships should prepare for prior to conducting a freedom of navigation operation. To customize this template to specific contexts, further considerations would be incorporated based on the kind of excessive maritime claim that the warship is going to challenge. For example, it may be beneficial for a warship to launch a helicopter while conducting a freedom of navigation operation on the high seas, but such an operation would be prohibited under UNCLOS III while conducting innocent passage.
Finally, this proposed navy-wide guidance would promulgate the ways that our adversaries have attempted to prevent ships from exercising their rights under UNCLOS III. Although this section would prioritize tactics used against U.S. warships, it would also include relevant tactics used against any ship. Additionally, this section would provide suggestions for countering each tactic.

In turn, the U.S. operations inside the Black Sea forced the Soviets to change their national security calculus. These actions demonstrated that the U.S. Navy was not limited to trapping the Soviet Black Sea Fleet north of the Bosphorus; instead, it could contest the waters around one of the Soviets' most important naval bases. The Soviet response, as David Winkler chronicles, led to an uptick in the incidents in the Black Sea between U.S. and Soviet naval vessels starting in 1965-indicating that the region was contested throughout much of the Cold War.

Rust says he flew to Moscow for "peace," but his unauthorized landing contributed to the Soviet decision to bump U.S. warships in 1988. The firing of Sokolov, for example, aligns with Allison's Governmental Politics Model: Soviet leaders jockeying for more power within the Soviet system would have jeopardized their positions if they had defied Gorbachev or allowed another violation of Soviet territory to go unchallenged in the wake of Sokolov's firing. The Rational Actor Model also applies, since the Soviets had clear reasons to push back against any further foreign encroachments in order to preserve the legitimacy and territoriality of the Soviet regime.

Although the U.S. Department of Defense Freedom of Navigation (FON) Program supposedly challenges "excessive maritime claims based on principle rather than identity of the coastal State asserting the claim," the resumption of U.S. challenges to Russian claims post-2014 seems to be tied to Russia's broader posture and behavior, not the principle of Russia's claim.

For its part, the Kremlin under Putin's rule not only works to discredit U.S.
FONOPs on the international stage, it uses U.S. FONOPs as opportunities to show its strength to the Russian people. Broadly speaking, the legitimacy of Russian or Soviet governments throughout history has been tied to the governments' ability to win in foreign confrontations. The Russian people questioned the legitimacy of their government after significant military losses in the Crimean War, Russo-Japanese War, WWI, and Afghanistan. Threatened by the potential for a Russian color revolution, today's Kremlin is acutely aware of Putin's domestic popularity. As Jonsson demonstrates, the media plays an important role in Russian New Generation Warfare by helping the government rally the nation against foreign challenges to perceived Russian sovereignty.

This thesis assessed two key sets of innocent passages, which Western navies conducted as freedom of navigation operations to challenge excessive Soviet/Russian maritime claims around Crimea. These cases provide unique analytic leverage to capture the long-term trends and underlying drivers of these kinds of operations, as well as the Russian responses. The theoretical framework developed in this thesis on the basis of these cases can also provide crucial insights about innocent passage and freedom of navigation operations against major power adversaries and regions, most notably China in in the South China Sea. This concluding chapter summarizes the key findings from the study of the Black Sea innocent passage, and discusses the implications for controversial freedom of navigation operations in the South China Sea. It also advocates for a consolidated Navywide guidance on freedom of navigation operations, an example of which is provided in Annex A.
A key finding of this thesis is that the case studies of Western freedom of navigation There are also notable differences between these case studies, which reveal important adaptations by the parties involved in these incidents, as well as how these operations are shaped by changing geopolitical circumstances. First, the fact that the British conducted the 2020s innocent passages instead of the U.S. Navy may shed light on the
Applying Graham Allison's theoretical perspectives to the Black Sea innocent passage operations, this thesis provides significant evidence in support of the Rational Actor and Governmental Politics Models, which explain the Soviet/Russian response to controversial innocent passages as reactions to threats of foreign encroachment in the region, as well as efforts to boost the regime's domestic legitimacy by seeming to guard against this threat.
These hypotheses seem to most accurately align with the Soviet/Russian behavior in the events studied in this thesis. First, prior to the 1988 bumping incident, the Governmental Politics Model best captures the Soviet military leaders' increasing aggressiveness towards perceived territorial violations, motivated by their desire to preserve their jobs and budgets in the wake of Gorbachev's reforms and the humiliating breach of Soviet airspace by an amateur Cessna pilot. Against this backdrop, the Soviets appear to have made a calculated decision to bump the U.S. warships with relatively small ships. The purpose of these actions was to impose costs and deter further provocations by the U.S. government, but not to inflict too much damage so as to risk sinking a U.S. warship and cause a dangerous escalation.
The 1989 Soviet incident at sea agreements with France, Great Britain, Canada, and Italy further support this interpretation and demonstrated Soviet commitment to deescalation. In the context of the Perestroika era, maritime de-escalation allowed the Soviets to decrease their unaffordable military budget and redirect money in support of Gorbachev's reforms.
Further in line with the Rational Actor Model, the empirical analysis in the thesis suggests that the Soviets bumped the USS Yorktown and USS Caron in 1988 not just because of their increased vulnerability, but also because the USSR was still a strong naval power that could challenge the United States-especially when U.S. warships entered Soviet territorial waters. Even though Gorbachev was reducing military spending and looking for ways to reduce Cold War tensions, the USSR still had thousands of nuclear challenging the PRC's excessive maritime claims are an important way for the United
States to demonstrate its commitment and support to its allies in the South China Sea.
This thesis demonstrates that U.S. and allied freedom of navigation operations against great power adversaries involve complex strategic, political, and operational considerations, which hold significant potential for escalation, and must be properly integrated in the planning and training for these operations. To facilitate this, the Navy's freedom of navigation guidance should be consolidated into a "FONOPs Bill" or navywide operational task (NWOT) for freedom of navigation operations (NWOT-FONOPs).
Such a project would compile each fleet's freedom of navigation guidance from the fleet operational orders (OPORD), assess FONOPs concept of operations (CONOPs) briefs, relevant deck logs, and freedom of navigation operations lessons learned. This document would help the entire navy train to freedom of navigation challenges. It would also complement the Navy's existing OPTASK Visual Information, which provides guidance on how to document interactions at sea.
Given the growing prominence of grey zone tactics, Navy-wide guidance must also be promulgated to share emerging threats between fleets. Currently, each fleet is a silo of FONOPs guidance, which shares information tailored to the specific needs of its area of responsibility. Before grey zone tactics reached such prominence, such an approach made sense; there were few surprising ways to counter a freedom of navigation operation. Today, however, grey zone tactics employed by the Russia in the Black Sea or Iran in the Persian Gulf, might be adapted by the China in the South China Sea. In some cases, the adoption of emerging grey zone tactics from other theaters might become a distinct possibility.
Countries like China, Iran, and Russia may be developing, implementing, and secretly sharing grey zone tactics. One way for the U.S. Navy to counter these shared adversarial tactics would be to create and periodically update a navy-wide "FONOPs Bill" or "NWOT-
The NWOT-FONOPs would begin with an overview of the FONOPs program and the UNCLOS definitions of the rights and responsibilities of warships operating on the
