One final observation is useful: the factor of time.
Even institutional intellectualism takes years and possibly decades to reap the fruit of its transformational seeds.
The Prussian reformers put sweeping sociopolitical-military changes in place between 1807 and 1812.
As a result, the Prussian army performed significantly better in the campaigns of 1814 and 1815 against Napoleon.
Yet the full return on their intellectual labor was not fully realized until the wars of 1866 and 1870, in which the Prussian army defeated Austria and France respectively and established the Prusso-German nation as the greatest power in Europe.
