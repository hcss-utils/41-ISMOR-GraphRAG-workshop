In August 2014, a concerned NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen summarized the extent of Russian involvement: "We have seen artillery firing across the border and also inside Ukraine.
We have seen Russian military buildup along the border.
Quite clearly, Russia is involved in destabilizing eastern Ukraine . . .
You see a sophisticated combination of traditional conventional warfare mixed up with information and primarily disinformation operations.
It will take more than NATO to counter such hybrid warfare effectively."
2 Russia's use of hybrid warfare in Ukraine represents a threat to state sovereignty in Eastern Europe, where, like Ukraine, many states have large Russian minority populations.
