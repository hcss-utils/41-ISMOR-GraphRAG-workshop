This chapter, and the remainder of this report, is focused on this fourth era of Russian operational concept and capability development.
However, the second and third eras remain relevant, and we will highlight the most-salient factors from these periods in the opening sections of this chapter.
We will show how Russia is in the midst of a transition away from nuclear dependence toward nonnuclear means, such as cruise and ballistic missiles, EW, counterspace, and cyber weapons, to engage targets at long range.
Russia's operational concept innovation is centered on coordinating and employing these disparate capabilities from across Russia's military districts while retaining the ability to cross the nuclear threshold with dual-use platforms.
According to leading Russian military strategists, as of 2021, Russia is still reliant on nonstrategic nuclear weapons as the primary tool for regional deterrence and warfighting.
The transition to the fourth era of operational concept development, which aspires to a unified strategic operation weighted more heavily toward nonnuclear capabilities, remains incomplete.
