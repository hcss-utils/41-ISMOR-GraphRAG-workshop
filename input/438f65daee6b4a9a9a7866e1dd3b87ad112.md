In 2013, Russia perceived itself as surrounded by enemies.
It wasn't a new thought, it's been a belief that has existed since Tsarist times, but with the disintegration of the Soviet Union, the concern had grown more acute.
Russia lost the security belt provided by the Warsaw Pact countries, with some former members, (e.g., Poland, Latvia, and Estonia) joining the European Union and NATO.
Without the belt of countries, Russia lost the zone where politically dangerous ideas could be stopped before they threatened the Russian leadership's hold on the reins of power.
Independent Ukraine, of significant importance to Russia, began looking more to the West, as well.
