Russia's strategic change is driven mostly by its concern over the NATO's expansion at the expense of former Warsaw Pact countries (Eastern Europe) and former Soviet republics (Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania).
Not surprisingly, the Lithuanian and Estonian defense ministries have expressed alarm at the increased military activity, and drawn comparisons with moves prior to the Russian invasion of Crimea.
As one analysis of Russian intents in the Baltic region put it, "Russia's frequent snap military drills near its eastern European neighbors could be part of a strategy that will open the door for a Russian offensive on the Baltic states."
