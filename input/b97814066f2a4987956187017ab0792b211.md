We find this reasoning both persuasive and instructive today.
The BUR was conducted at the beginning of the post-Cold War era, a unique uni-polar moment in which democratic capitalism seemed to be universally accepted, Russia was focused inward and not unfriendly, China had not begun its aggressive military behavior, North Korea had no nuclear weapons, Iran's nuclear ambitions were still not recognized, the 9-11 attacks had not occurred, and both East Asia and the Middle East were more stable than today.
In other words, if a force sized at the BUR levels was necessary twenty years ago, when the world was much more stable and less risky, that is powerful evidence that the substantially smaller force of today (much less the even smaller force of the future under the QDR or sequestration) is too small.
We are not suggesting that the BUR end strengths should be a straitjacket on defense planningthe Department may well conclude that a different mix of forces is preferable after conducting the kind of thorough review we recommend elsewhere in this Reportbut we believe that, given proliferating security threats, any reasonable review will conclude that the Navy and Air Force should be larger than they are today, and that the QDR's contemplated reduction in active Army end strength goes too far.
