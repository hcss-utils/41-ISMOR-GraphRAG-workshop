The Russian leadership appears to have developed a political-military strategy for the armed forces based on its security policy goals and threat perceptions.
This strategy involves the military carrying out five key tasks: strategic deterrence; regional dominance within Russia's near abroad (the non-Baltic former Soviet Union [FSU]); expeditionary operations; preparedness in case of major war; and domestic stability.
This strategy emerged, in part, out of Russia's reconsideration of its military priorities following a disappointing performance in Georgia and the related military reform effort that focused on shrinking the size of Russia's military forces and increasing their readiness.
