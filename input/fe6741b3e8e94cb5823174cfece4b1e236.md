Early US Army staffs were not as well organized and structured as their European counterparts.
The early Continental Army's staff was a representation of the Continental Army itself, composed of various officers with a wide variety of staff experience and training from different military systems.
It was not until George Washington selected the Prussian Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben to serve as the army's Inspector General that the staff became organized and efficient.
Before coming to America, Steuben served in Frederick the Great's Prussian Army, serving on various staffs during the Seven Years War.
Following that war, Steuben was one of the first officers selected for Frederick's new school to train officers on modern military theory.
