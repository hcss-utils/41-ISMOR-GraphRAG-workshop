Introduction "Air bases are a determining factor in the success of air operations. The two-legged stool of men and planes would topple over without this equally important third leg."

The current United States Air Force (USAF) overseas basing posture is a critical vulnerability that peer adversaries will exploit due to the USAF's reliance on bases to project combat power.

For the joint force, the 2016 Joint Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC) concept addresses force posture and projection with respect to a peer adversary's A2/AD environment. The JAM-GC concept informs "joint force operations so that the United States can maintain access to and maneuver through the global commons, project power, and defeat an adversary attempting to deny freedom of action to U.S. and allied forces."

The historical US basing strategy, emerging at the conclusion of the Cold War and reinforced by continual deployment over the last thirty years, established the USAF as a principal and reliable implement of national strategy. 
13
Additionally, as the USAF continues evolving technologically -investing in high capability, low quantity airframes -the US cannot afford to continuously base these assets within advanced threat environments. The USAF's early 1990s vision of global reach, coupled with expeditionary projection has potential to bridge the gap between overseas infrastructure, force posture, and national objectives. 
During the Cold War, the USAF developed a significant overseas basing network which assisted in power projection.

The 1990s represents a significant turning point in the force projection and basing strategy of the USAF, both conceptually and ideologically. It follows the shift from great power conflict to regional conflict and crises along narratives such as smaller, advanced, lethal, agile, ready, sustainable, and survivable. This transition, along with the 1990's rise of conventional airpower as "the sword arm" of the US, greatly influences the service's focus and provides historical perspective for understanding current force posture initiatives.

In the early 1990s these key characteristics, principles, and concepts -almost idealsenvisioned American airpower as a force with "ubiquity."

Even as the US reduced its OCONUS basing and the USAF transitioned into a force to "project dominating power to any point on the globe in hours," the US retained "significant forward presence to deter aggression and preserve regional stability." 28 However, these static bases and permanently assigned forces, such as the remaining USAF bases in Europe and the handful scattered in the Pacific theater (principally Korea, Japan, Guam, and Diego Garciawhose US lease expires in 2036), became expeditionary in character, able to deploy forces "wherever it might be needed."

Despite Desert Storm's demonstration of the post-Cold War USAF to project combat power to address regional conflict, two decades of continuous operations in US Central Command (USCENTCOM) affected the strategic vision for USAF overseas basing. Constant operations in a single combatant command led to the norming of operations from overseas expeditionary bases, "requiring a rotational base to support." 38
Following the attacks of September 11, 2001, the US viewed "asymmetric threats (such as A2/AD strategies, terrorism and insurgency) and catastrophic threats" posed by "rogue states or substate actors" as the greatest challenge." 39 To address these threats, the US realigned its global basing strategy through the 2004 Global Defense Posture Review (GDPR). This realignment formed to effectively prosecute the Global War on Terror in Afghanistan and Iraq while remaining flexible to respond globally. While not completely dismissing traditional state actor threats, the GDPR transformed the overseas military footprint to focus on post-9/11 threats.

The USAF bases in the Middle East, while originally expeditionary in nature and primarily reliant upon host-nation support, transitioned into quasi-permanent OCONUS USAF installations. They execute combat support functions using Air Expeditionary Wings (AEW) to host a rotational force of airmen and weapons systems which the USAF deploys to these locations for 90-to 365-day periods to "meet combatant commander demands for military capabilities." 
51
52
Bases are normally categorized as main operating bases (MOB), forward operating sites (FOS), and cooperative security locations (CSL). MOBs consist of "permanently stationed combat forces and robust infrastructure," FOSs involve "expandable 'warm facilities' maintained with a limited US military support presence" supporting rotational forces, and CSLs exist "with little or no permanent U.S. presence" providing "continency access" to areas of conflict. 
53
The security and defense literature from 2000 -on reveals a thematic overseas basing strategy focused on a realignment from Cold War-era basing in favor of flexibility and forward projection while simultaneously maintaining a global deterrence and assurance posture. It concentrates on regional threats within the narrative of global uncertainty following the collapse of the Soviet Union and later, the attacks of 9/11. The US sought to maintain presence in historical areas to deter, assure, and retain access while building the capacity to project forces and to meet all potential threats, specifically the threat of terrorism. This dual-natured strategy and concentration on a relatively short-term threat has left USAF aircraft and basing vulnerable to peer adversaries' capabilities within the European and Asia-Pacific regions.
The early focus of this period was the assumption that the US would not "face a peer competitor in the near future" but at the same time maintaining the "possibility exists that a military competitor with a formidable resource base will emerge" in the Asia region. 
54
The 2002 and 2006 NSS championed the enduring benefits of an overseas military presence -deterrence, assurance, and positioning to act decisively -while concurrently advocating for a transition away from Cold War-areas to confront the uncertainty of the global threat environment. 
55
56
Comparably, the 2001 and 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) called for a reorientation of overseas military basing from Western Europe and Northeast Asia to a more flexible, global footprint. This era of defense strategy sought to focus on "critical areas of the world" and "making long overdue adjustments to U.S. basing by moving away from a static defense in obsolete Cold War garrisons, and placing emphasis on the ability to surge quickly to trouble spots across the globe."

Despite the transition of US global basing from conventional overseas MOBs to expeditionary locations and the shift to force projection versus static defense, the permanent USAF overseas presence poses a critical vulnerability for peer adversaries to exploit. China and Russia command increasingly sophisticated long-range precision fires (missile) systems and the strategic culture to utilize them.

Consider a Pearl Harbor-like attack on Kadena Air Base, Japan, by the Chinese. Instead of a steady stream of incoming enemy aircraft, it is a salvo of precision-guided missiles launched from China at the more than eighty aircraft on the ramp, the two runways, and supporting infrastructure.

According to the US Department of Defense (DoD), "China has already achieved parity with -or even exceeded the United States" in the area of "land-based conventional ballistic and cruise missiles…"

In 2015, China elevated its People's Liberation Army (PLA) Rocket Force (PLARF) to service level, equal with the Army, Navy, and Air Force. This reorganization emphasizes the PLARF's role as a "critical component of China's deterrence strategy and efforts to counter third-party intervention in regional conflict" through its ability to conduct precision strikes with GLBMs and GLCMs. 
78
79
To achieve its goals, China must prevent the US from attaining or retaining air superiority, as it "would pose a major threat to the defense of Chinese territory in the event of conflict involving both parties…" 81 Considering its two enduring strategic goals, China's military strategy comprises the concept of "active defense," which justifies all offensive operations as defensive in nature,

Russia's regional threat to USAF basing in Europe stems from the combination of its air, sea, and ground-based missiles. These include GLBMs, GLCMs, air-launched cruise missiles (ALCMs), and sea-launched land-attack cruise missiles (LACMs). Russia places a high priority on the development of its cruise missiles and associated systems, recently fielding the Kh-101 ALCM, the ISKANDER GLBM, and the KALIBR LACM through a nine-year modernization program.

The USAF never lost sight of the vulnerability of static air bases or the requirement to ensure the survivability of airpower projecting from these bases. However, the rapid rise of China and the reemergence of Russia, and their corresponding capabilities to degrade and destroy USAF aircraft and bases, places renewed emphasis on basing and force projection concepts. The USAF recently began advancing adaptive basing (AB), distributed operations, and agile combat employment (ACE) concepts to mitigate and counter these evolving threats.
The challenges to overseas basing and force projection are not easily resolved. While the nature of war -comprising the violent interaction of politics, humanity, uncertainty, and willremains unchanging, its character continually evolves through aspects such as technology and doctrine. 
92
The advancement and proliferation of technology (e.g., precision-guided munitions, hypersonic missiles, artificial intelligence, cyber, etc.) creates a farther reaching and more dynamic and complex threat environment. It distorts the line between inside and outside forces and the traditional factors of time and distance in determining safety and security. Likewise, the Chinese and Russians, through swift and deliberate active defense and hybrid warfare, seek to purchase time and maneuver space for their own forces by quickly neutralizing or delaying US airpower. Changes in the character of war, continually compressing the elements of time and space, presents a wicked problem for the USAF as it seeks to adapt overseas basing and force projection to both current and future environments.
In 2016, the USAF envisioned the operational environment of 2030, highlighting A2/AD as most threatening to air dominance. It emphasized the requirement to "deploy and operate forces in non-permissive environments" and viewed concepts such as adaptive basing as crucial air dominance enablers. 
93
94
95
96
AB is not new despite the recent impetus for development. In addition to the USAF's strategic basing narrative of the 1990s-2010s, the Cold War provides several examples. The Swedish Air Force's Bas 90 system (Air Base System 90) "dispersed fighters throughout its territory, making it difficult for Moscow to destroy all of its fleet on the ground in a surprise attack." 
97
98
The USAF doctrinally defines the AB concept of ACE as the "proactive and reactive operational scheme of maneuver executed within threat timelines to increase survivability while generating combat power." 
99
100
101
102
While AB does provide survivability concepts for force projection within an A2/AD environment, it does not satisfactorily address the continuous, static basing of aircraft at overseas MOBs. The permanent overseas force presence includes fighter, airborne air control, special operations, airlift, and air refueling aircraft. It includes aircrew, support personnel, and associated dependent families, all stationed in high-threat A2/AD environments. AB is important to reduce the adage of "big bases, big targets;" however, while addressing the symptom of MOBs, the USAF must address the cause, i.e., force presence and projection.

The future force offers enhancements for global strike and force projection capabilities.
The B-2, a low-observable strategic bomber, can range 10,000 nautical miles with a single air refueling. 
115
116
118
Mitigating the exposure of aircraft to threats includes assessing the costs of OCONUS MOBs against alternative approaches such as force realignment and projection. Basing aircraft outside an adversary's WEZ and utilizing a rotational force approach reduces many cost aspects associated with the permanency of large MOBs, such as personnel and support. Limiting the "permanent" unit presence overseas also removes the costs and risks to families, who often accompany servicemembers overseas. However, investment and sustainment costs remain for any potential "inside" bases, FOSs and CSLs, which host rotational combat power.
Basing costs vary across installations due to factors such as location, population size, mission or assigned aircraft. The total cost of basing differentiates between fixed costs such as infrastructure and variable costs dependent on base population (e.g. utilities, permanent change of station (PCS) costs, and housing allowances). 
119
120
121
122
129
Closing overseas bases and utilizing a rotational force presence does have strategic consequences. OCONUS base closures limit options for rotational or forward deployment, jeopardizing the USAF's global reach capabilities. Force projection requires access to facilities either owned by allies and partners or utilizing US regional bases. Perhaps most important, losing the permanent overseas presence poses a significant risk to the nation's deterrence and assurance strategy. Overseas basing not only deters potential adversaries but "contributes to regional stability through capacity building and political influence…" enhancing "operational performance…interoperability…" and ensures a network of bases for US force projection. 
130
The realignment of permanent aircraft basing outside an adversary's WEZ in combination with OCONUS AB presents a long-term, cost-effective measure to counter the threats posed by peer adversaries while maintaining strategic objectives. Force protection issues remain a top concern and priority for combatant commanders. In 2020, the commander of US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) requested "$4.68 billion in fiscal 2022 and $22.69 billion over the following five years for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative [PDI]…" after acknowledging Guam is a target due to its critical defense role in the region.

"I do believe if we ever went to conflict, we would be at risk for sitting static in certain locations." 
134
The US cannot afford to statically place aircraft within advanced threat environments. The status quo of permanently stationing aircraft at overseas MOBs jeopardizes the innate ability of the service to generate combat power at the time of its choosing. Instead, it faces a potential fait accompli of destruction on the ground.
To improve survivability the USAF should realign OCONUS-based forces to CONUS MOBs and utilize a rotational, forward presence to maintain deterrence, assurance, and joint enabling missions. This force realignment renders some cost-savings and immediately eliminates Finally, the USAF must maintain effectiveness as both an inside and outside force, able to continuously project power through global reach. A2/AD environments must not prohibit American airpower's "speed, range, flexibility, precision, and lethality." 
135
136
Overseas bases are the vital Air Force elements for projecting combat power in pursuit of national objectives. Equally important are the aircraft and personnel associated with these bases.
Due to the nature of the threat environment in the reemerging era of great power competition, the static nature of basing and associated forces threatens to "topple the stool" of successful air operations.

Despite the USAF's consistent narrative of global strike and reach, it is limited by technology to project most of its combat power without the enabling of air refueling or hindered by human endurance factors. As a result, operations and basing generally take place within an adversary's weapons engagement zone (WEZ), compromising "one of airpower's greatest advantages: the ability to operate outside an adversary's reach." 106 This has been the accepted case due to the large disparity in numbers between tactical combat aircraft and long-range bombers. 
107

While the USAF's strategic aircraft have suitable range and endurance to strike as an outside force, tactical combat aircraft do not have suitable range and endurance to operate effectively, requiring bases for persistent local and regional force presence (Table
