As the Cold War was ending, the United States took its bomber force off of day-to-day alert as a part of a series of reciprocal initiatives that Russia and the United States took to reduce the size and alert levels of their nuclear forces.
Presumably, U.S. leaders understood that they were increasing the overall vulnerability of U.S. strategic forces to a surprise attack when they took these actions.
They simply made the political judgment that the risks of a surprise attack had decreased sufficiently that the costs and stress of maintaining bombers on strip alert were no longer justified.
Moreover, the climate at the time encouraged both sides to take initiatives to reduce their capability and readiness in the nuclear arena.
Thus, there is precedent for taking these kinds of actions and expecting some kind of reciprocity in a relatively benign political environment.
The real issues are how far to go and under what conditions, and how to avoid increasing the incentives to strike first.
