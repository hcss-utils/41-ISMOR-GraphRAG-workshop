Information leveling could be accomplished several ways.
One way would be through hackers.
The niche could hire any number of computer hackers to attack U.S. information networks.
These hackers could be hired at the last minute, assuring state-of-the-art competence.
They could be hired in large numbers from around the world; India and Russia, for example, have a wealth of software talent willing to work for relatively low pay.
It would be very difficult for the United States to assess the scope and direction of this campaign in advance of hostile intrusion.
