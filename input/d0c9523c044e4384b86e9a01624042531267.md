For the most part, this study seems to confirm Mazarr's suggestion that political warfare can succeed by itself only in certain circumstances.
In most of the case studies, political warfare was used to check a foreign power's influence (as was the case for Iran's use of political warfare against the United States or the U.S. use of political warfare against the Soviet Union) or achieve fairly limited objectives (as with Russia's use of political warfare against Estonia over the Bronze Statue incident).
It may achieve larger aims, such as Russia's annexation of Crimea and ISIL's dramatic takeover of territory.
These tactics may succeed when no party wishes to escalate or confront the aggressor.
This method of advancing aims is best understood as part of the spectrum of warfare.
It fills an important niche in the strategic panoply to increase one's influence and leverage while reducing an adversary's influence and leverage, but it does not replace either conventional war or more conventional forces.
