However, it seems implausible that Russian political and military leaders would concoct a similar strategy in the context of a Russia-NATO war.
Perhaps most prominently, there would be no expectation of indifference to Russian invading forces.
Additionally, we know from the case study of Syria that Russian forces can operate in a more sophisticated combined-arms manner, employing UAVs to suppress electronic signals and find and fix targets and using precision-guided munitions to destroy targets from stand-off ranges; these tactics have not been systematically employed at scale at least one month into the conflict in Ukraine.
The morale of Russian soldiers and thus their will to fight also might plausibly be different in the context of a conflict with NATO.
And it also seems plausible that Russia would have less incentive to hold portions of its more sophisticated conventional weapons in reserve in such a conflict.
Finally, Russian emphasis in the air likely would be on the defensive-denying air superiority to NATO as opposed to trying to achieve it.
