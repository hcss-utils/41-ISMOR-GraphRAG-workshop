Meanwhile, American foreign policy in the post-Cold War era continues to be defined by the presence of nuclear weapons.
New conflicts and crises occur because Washington, in following its "Russia first" approach, accepts the fact that the newly independent states in Eastern Europe remain in the Russian sphere of influence.
The US is doing this to assure that strategic partner Russia is the only nuclear counterpart which must be dealt with in this region of the world.
A firm and decisive American foreign policy is still necessary, however, a policy that would respect and support the will and national interests of East Central European states and clearly demonstrate to the Russian side that there are clear boundaries to realizing the Russian imperialist vision.
