The purpose of this monograph is to distill lessons from the history of air defense and airpower's efforts to penetrate those defenses.
It identifies six lessons from World War I, World War II, Vietnam, Desert Storm, and modern developments by Russia and China.
These six lessons inform both air and ground forces in their future efforts to conduct Suppression of Enemy Air Defense (SEAD) and penetration operations.
This monograph explores the question of how the Joint Force should approach the SEAD mission and whether or not forces in the land domain should take a more significant role in penetrating ground-based air defense systems.
