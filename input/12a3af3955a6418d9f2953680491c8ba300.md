The Soviets traditionally have feared the SSBN as a formidable threat, whereas the United States has been concerned about the SS-18.
During his State of the Union Address in January 1992, President Bush proposed to lower the number of SLBM warheads by about one-third in exchange for a ban on MIRVed ICBMs.
The United States and Russia reached a compromise in the Washington Summit, where each side decided to eliminate MIRVed ICBMs by the year 2003 in exchange for a lowering of the number of SLBM warheads by approximately one-half.
