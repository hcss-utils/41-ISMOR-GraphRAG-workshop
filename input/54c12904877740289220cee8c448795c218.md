Perhaps the most daunting scenario for U.S. war planners is the opportunity a major conflict with a near-peer state affords other states or transnational terrorist organizations to challenge sea control in areas of their local interests.
Iran, for example, has shown a savvy awareness of global politics, and has the ability to blockade the world's most important maritime chokepoint while the U.S. fleet is embroiled in a conflict with Russia.
The Strait of Hormuz collocates American naval assets and commercial interests with Iranian small boats, submarines, coastal cruise missiles, and mines, and Iran has threated to use them to close the Strait.
85 Some analysts believe the 85 Iran most recently threated to close the strait in 2012 and 2016.
For background see Kenneth Katzman, Iran's Threat To the Strait of Hormuz, CRS Report R42335 (Washington, DC: Library of Congress, January 2012), accessed 25 April 2017, https://fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/R42335.pdf.
For direct quotes on the 2016 threat see Strait of Hormuz is not under any real threat beyond words, but few could say it is exceptionally secure; the import of the situation is that the threat of a capability, even if it is not used, suffices to destabilize both the region and global markets.
