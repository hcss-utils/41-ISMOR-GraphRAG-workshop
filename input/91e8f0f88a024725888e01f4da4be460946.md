US coercive diplomacy over Russian aggression against Ukraine, which has lessons for US policy towards China, initially resembled Thomas Schelling's risk strategy of imposing significant punishment while threatening much higher costs so that submission appears the best option.
However, in the confrontation with Russia over Ukraine, President Obama, supported by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew and other senior officials, temporarily switched from compellence to deterrence, focusing on Schelling's "threat that leaves something to chance."
In this domain, the coercive demand is not to provoke escalation but to prevent it, and reflects the insight that coercion may succeed when threatened, not when sanctions or other forms of punishment are implemented
