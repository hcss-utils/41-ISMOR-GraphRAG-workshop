Globalization and interconnectedness mean that Australia is now vulnerable to security threats originating well beyond its immediate region.
The White Paper references Russia's actions in Ukraine, North Korea's proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction and the rise of ideological extremism as issues which have both directly influenced Australia's security and reflect a broader trend of nations challenging the established international system of governance in place since the Second World War.
Australia is affected by these issues but lacks the capacity to resolve them unilaterally, which increases the importance of multilateral approaches to security.
