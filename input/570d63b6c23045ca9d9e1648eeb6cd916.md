Since 1991, main organizational reforms seem to have concluded and Russian forces in the Western MD have never been more capable.
This is seen through the deliveries of new equipment, increased readiness, expanded force structure, combined-arms exercises, and enlarged and improved combat support service and logistics.
Although the defense of the homeland seems to be the primary mission, forces in the Western MD have a plethora of capabilities to engage in offensive operations in Russia's neighborhood and quickly deliver a preponderance of power to deliver a swift victory.
This, combined with the willingness to use force in order to achieve foreign policy objectives (Georgia, Ukraine, Syria) have raised concerns in NATO as to the real goals of Russian military modernization in general, and in the Western MD in particular.
This was particularly evident in the run-up to the 2017 iteration of the Zapad strategic-operational exercise.
