Russia's re-emergence on the global stage and competition in a new tri-polar world order has undergone significant analysis.
However, what has undergone even more analysis are its views on conflict and how it operates in the realist Clausewitzian mold as it being an extension of its own policy initiatives.
Russia reportedly views itself as great power from its emergence in the twelfth century to the modern era and as such undertakes to extend its influence within and without its borders.
Its actions in Chechnya, Georgia, Ukraine, the Crimea and Syria over the last decade have seemingly been in lockstep with its New Generation warfare sometimes referred to as the Gerasimov doctrine or Russian Hybrid warfare.
