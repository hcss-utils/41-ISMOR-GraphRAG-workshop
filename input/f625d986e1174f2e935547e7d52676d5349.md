The force ratio is in Russia's favor.
U.S. and NATO doctrine calls for a 3:1 force ratio for successful offensive combat, which would require up to 84 battalionlevel combined-arms task forces to counterattack if Russia deployed its available combat power from the WMD.
This would require a tremendous national effort from every NATO Member State, and that effort would have to be preemptively stationed along Russia's border.
After one week, Russia would be able to mobilize its remaining military district's forces, further upping the force ratio required from NATO.
