He stated that 40% of Russia's budget comes from oil and gas revenues, and that Putin wanted to use those revenues to modernize Russia's industrial base.
He also stated that Russia longed for its former influence over the CIS and its world power status, and that they are indeed using their oil and gas leverage to coerce their neighbors, such as Ukraine, Georgia and Belarus.
He also gave statistics showing that Germany is more reliant on Russia than Europe overall, and that they were going to use their rotation in the EU Presidency to try to influence Russia into greater economic and political interdependence with Europe by insisting they honor their contracts, etc.
However, both the Europeans and the US has been consistently outflanked by Russia in making pipeline deals, and they continue to employ their energy supplies to coerce their former satellites.
See the International Herald Tribune articles "Russia signs deal to bring natural gas pipeline through Bulgaria," "Putin's trip is next step in Gazprom's march West," "Russia signs Central Asian pipeline deal," "Russia and West compete for Central Asian gas-and Russia is winning," and "Ukraine accuses Russia of applying political pressure in gas dispute."
The Economist had several podcasts, including its 16 November 2006 Europe.view entitled "The Sorrows of Belarus," about how Russia drastically increased Belarus's gas supplies after they leaned Westward politically, as they did with Ukraine after the "Orange Revolution."
Other Economist podcasts with more information include "The fog of the 'new cold war,'" and 10 April 2008's Certain Ideas of Europe "Pipelines and pipedreams," which interviewed Alexandros Peteresen, Program Director of the Caspian Europe Center in Brussels.
Feigenbaum et al, authors of the book Pipeline Politics in the Caspian Sea, conducted a 13 February 2007 interview on the Council for Foreign Relations podcast Inside CFR Events that discussed the intense competition with Russia over control over gas and oil resources and pipelines out of the region, and their Russia and others are also using oil money against us in a more indirect way, through funding their weapons development, such as the new Topol-M Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, Su-30 fighter aircraft, and numerous other weapons projects.
These projects have coincided with resurgence in aggressive military actions as well.
