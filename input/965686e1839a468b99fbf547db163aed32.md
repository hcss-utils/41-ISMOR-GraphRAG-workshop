Russia's 2014 aggression against Ukraine, subsequent efforts to destabilize and divide Western allies, and continued military modernization prompted a marked shift in NATO's security posture.
For much of the post-Cold War period, the Alliance focused predominantly on cooperative security and crisis management operations -two of NATO's three core tasks-in and around Europe, as well as in Afghanistan and later Libya.
In the months and years following the Ukraine crisis, leaders across the Alliance acknowledged the need to strengthen NATO's third core task, deterrence and collective defense, vis-Ã -vis Russia.
