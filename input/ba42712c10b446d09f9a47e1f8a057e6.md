support traditional Air Force missions, and not anything beyond
To the Editor-In "Who Is a Member of the Military Profession?" (JFQ 62, 3 d Quarter 2011), Colonel Matthew Moten, USA, brings up some valuable points in his discussion of the professionalization of career enlisted Servicemembers, but it would be useful to know his data points. His final arguments are directed at the noncommissioned officer (NCO) corps (not petty officers), so I would like to know if his data are based on his experiences across the Services, or mainly based on his observations and study within his own branch.
Though observant of and an occasional researcher of other Services' use of their professional enlisted forces, I speak only about the modern U.S. Army NCO corps when addressing Colonel Moten's point that "their [the NCO corps] professionalization is incomplete in the areas of formal and theoretical education, accumulation of specialized expertise, and autonomous jurisdiction over a body of professional knowledge. The NCO corps is professionalizing, but not yet professional." I understand that this assertion is not the same as stating the "NCO corps is unprofessional," which one could easily and incorrectly conclude. I imagine a parallel could be drawn with the theory that an individual found not guilty of a crime is not saying he is innocent.
I would suggest that the Army began professionalizing its NCO corps in October 1975 when the Deputy Chief of Staff for Personnel started phasing in the Enlisted Professional Management System (EPMS). Before that, career programs for enlisted Soldiers were spotty at best, and most have heard the story that a Soldier's stripes resided in the regiment. If an NCO were to move, it was often at a loss of rank. Not only was EPMS a major jumpstart to professionalizing the enlisted force, but 3 years earlier, an NCO college had been created: the U.S. Army Sergeants Major Academy. I would be curious as to what length Colonel Moten went through to evaluate the current curriculum in determining the breadth and width of the sergeant major course, particularly in how it relates to his definition of "formal and theoretical education."
One would have to ask what the measure of the "attainment of specialized expertise" is, and how one would know when the Army NCO corps (or any other professional enlisted force) has achieved specialized expertise, and by whose standards. Is there an established peak or defined scale by which one measures individual or group progress, other than to say, "You are progressing"? It seems that comment would be nebulous at best considering that Colonel Moten never seems to point out anything where the Army NCO corps lacks specialized expertise. Nor does he contrast how other groups have mastered specialized expertise over the NCO corps. Army NCOs draw their skills, knowledge, and attitudes from policies that lay out their roles and responsibilities. I try to use Army Command Policy and Procedures (Army Regulation [AR] 600-20) as a guideline, which has been influenced by a successive group of Army leaders who have laid out the responsibilities of the NCO corps vis-Ã -vis the NCO Support channel. A quick look shows the current 10 functions of the NCO Support channel as: If this is what is expected from the NCO corps, one would have to measure against these tasks to determine when expertise has been achieved. Of course, if the problem is that these are not the correct 10 functions of the NCO Support channel, that is an entirely different discussion, which is not addressed in Colonel Moten's article.
I believe recent developments in the Army NCO corps have mostly negated the remainder of his argument. We recently celebrated the second year of the Institute for Noncommissioned Officer Professional Development (INCOPD), which is dedicated to the advancement of professional military education for NCOs. Additionally, the Command Sergeant Major Corps was entrusted with leading the development and education of NCOs with the appointment of an enlisted Commandant of the Sergeants Major Academy. Recent efforts-such as the INCOPD program of life-long learning, structured self-development (SSD), and career tracker-bridge "the operational and institutional domains of Army training for enlisted Soldiers. From Private to Command Sergeant Major, SSD will ensure learning is continuous and enduring."
My last point is on the concern of a lack of "autonomous jurisdiction over a body of professional knowledge." I suggest the triad of the Sergeant Major of the Army, the NCO-led Sergeants Major Academy, and INCOPD, under the direction of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's Command Sergeant Major, fills the bill for the "autonomous jurisdiction," but in a hierarchical organization such as the Army, who truly self-governs or acts independently? I suggest those three positions act autonomously as a platoon leader on patrol or a company commander maneuvering his forces.
To the Editor-I applaud Colonel Matthew Moten's effort to define who is a member of the military profession ("Who Is a Member of the Military Profession?" JFQ 62, 3 d Quarter 2011), but I am concerned that his definition is too historically based (it is probably an occupational hazard).
The future security requirements of the Nation demand a broader definition that includes civilians. For example, the intelligence field has many civilians educated at the National Defense Intelligence College who are actively participating in military operations. Is the person who identifies the target any less a part of the process than a person who pulls the trigger? Most modern enemies would not stop to differentiate as strictly as the colonel seems to want.
I remember General George Joulwan's motto for the Bosnian operations: "One Team, One Fight." Recently, civilian instructors from Fort Leavenworth demonstrated this again by deploying to U.S. Africa Command for involvement in recent contingency planning. As Colonel Moten notes, the military profession is a lifelong calling, and I would add that it is a broad-based collegial effort.
To the Editor-I write in response to William F. Owen's letter (JFQ 61, 2 d Quarter 2011) regarding my article co-authored with David Kilcullen in JFQ 60 ("An Actor-centric Theory of War: Understanding the Difference Between COIN and Counterinsurgency"). Our analysis is indeed built upon a taxonomy of warfare rather than a new theory of warfare. However, we never purported to provide the latter, but simply to open the debate on a new theory that better reflects the realities of conflict in a decidedly post-Westphalian world. (Alas, authors rarely choose the titles for their work; that is in the purview of the all-mighty Editor, so if Mr. Owen feels hard-done-by given the title of our article, that is a matter for him to take up directly with the editors of JFQ and not us!)
As for the remark that irregular warfare is solely conducted by irregular threat groups, I think SEAL Team Six, the heroes of Abbottabad, would strenuously disagree. Irregular warfare describes a type of warfare, not just a type of actor. (This is in fact recognized in the official Department of Defense Joint Operating Concept for Irregular Warfare.)
With regard to our discussion of irregular versus regular or conventional warfare, the main point was not simply to note that irregular warfare occurs three times as much as regular conflict but to illuminate what the word regular implies and how it distorts development of doctrine and planning for future capabilities. Surely, if history demonstrates conclusively-as the Correlates of War Database proves-that nations most often go to war with nonstate actors, then this reality should be reflected in not only how we think about war, but also how we prepare for it. This is far beyond semantics.
I am mystified by Mr. Owen's comment, "I am struggling to think of any useful description of warfare 'based on putative generational changes in warfare or the asymmetry of combatants' that is in common use." Really? A casual Google search for the terms fourth generation warfare and asymmetric warfare generates 126,000 and 656,000 hits, respectively (and that is without using quotation marks to limit the search). In fact, both the U.S. Army and Department of Defense have organic elements that use the phrase asymmetric warfare in their official titles.
While I too am a great admirer of the strategic master Colin Gray, he must be recognized as planted firmly in the Clausewitzian camp, a fact the good professor openly admits. All I would suggest is that since the Prussian master himself only devoted five pages of his On War to the topic of irregular warfare-and was not a great fan of it at all-his work is of most general application in the interstate arena of war and has decidedly limited use in nuanced analysis of globally motivated violent nonstate actors such as al Qaeda (not to mention nonkinetic threats such as the Muslim Brotherhood). For a modest reworking of Clausewitz's "wondrous trinity" for use in the current threat environment, Mr. Owens could refer to my piece entitled "The Age of Irregular Warfare: So What?" (JFQ 58, 3 d Quarter 2010).
Finally, General Sherman did indeed also state that "war is war." However, our analysis was not focused on civil wars (which fall under a special category all their own), but on the unique challenge posed by nonstate actors such as al Qaeda or the Taliban. That is why General Ospina's version of the phrase was chosen, given that he is recognized as dealing the death blow to the FARC of Colombia-a threat that far more resembles the numerous challenges that the United States faces today than do the forces of the Confederate South.

How General John Shalikashvili "Paid It Forward" to 500,000 Others
T he world lost a great warriordiplomat with the recent passing of General John Malchase David Shalikashvili, USA. The General will likely be most remembered for his tenures as Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS) from 1993-1997, as Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) from 1992-1993, and as Assistant to CJCS General Colin Powell from 1991-1992. Notable as well is General Shalikashvili's distinction as the first draftee, the first immigrant, and the first graduate of Officer Candidate School to rise to the position of Chairman.
Yet among his many achievements, it was Operation Provide Comfort-the first major international humanitarian crisis ever tasked to the U.S. military-that was General Shalikashvili's defining moment.
At a 1992 ceremony awarding the General his fourth star prior to being promoted to SACEUR, General Powell, CJCS at the time, told the audience that General Shalikashvili had "worked a miracle" in northern Iraq.
Indeed, a miracle was required. For it was a crisis of epic proportions that had arisen in northern Iraq in April 1991. Over 500,000 Iraqi Kurds-men, women, and children-were trapped in the inhospitable mountains along the Turkish border. They had been chased out of the Iraqi lowlands by the Iraqi military. It was payback for a failed Kurdish attempt to overthrow Saddam Hussein in the immediate aftermath of the first Gulf War. Barred from crossing the border by a fearful Turkey, and expecting that they would be shot or even gassed if they returned home, the Kurds were in dire straits. Subject to the harsh mountain elements and lacking food, water, sanitation, and shelter, the refugees were dying at a rate of about 1,000 per day.
The United States responded by launching Operation Provide Comfort. Then-Lieutenant General Shalikashvili, who was serving in Germany at the time, was tapped by SACEUR General John Galvin, USA, to head this massive rescue attempt. General Shalikashvili had a reputation as an intelligent, hardworking, and low-key officer skilled in diplomacy and logistics.
The choice was even more fitting because General Shalikashvili understood what it was like to be a refugee. He was born in Warsaw, Poland, in 1936 to refugee parents who had fled the Russian Revolution. After the violent Warsaw Uprising of 1944-which the family survived by hiding in cellars and scurrying through sewer pipes-he too became a refugee. The Shalikashvilis fled westward to Germany, their train coming under Allied air attack along the way. They settled in the Bavarian village of Pappenheim, Dr. Andrew Marble is currently writing a biography of General John Shalikashvili. A preview of the biography is available at www.shalibiography.com. where they were supported by the kindness of relatives and assistance from the International Refugee Organization. The Shalikashvilis were able to emigrate to the United States in 1952 with the help of distant relatives who provided sponsorship, a safe ocean passage, housing, jobs, and even college scholarships. These benefactors "didn't know us from beans," General Shalikashvili would later recall.
Almost four decades later, this former World War II refugee found himself at a temporary command headquarters in Incirlik, Turkey, faced with the herculean task of rescuing these 500,000 Gulf War refugees.
What a complex operation it would be. Over 35,000 soldiers from 13 countries and volunteers from over 50 nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) would be involved. How does one coordinate so many national armies or coax mutually distrustful soldiers and NGO workers to cooperate? Just imagine overseeing the largest airdrop in history, one that exceeded even the scope of the Berlin Airlift. There was also the logistical task of quickly building temporary refugee camps and way-stations, and then undertaking the delicate diplomatic mission of convincing tribal leaders to urge the Kurds to return home. Moreover, there was the challenge of keeping the Iraqi troops at bay, requiring equal parts diplomacy and displays of raw military power. Shalikashvili adroitly directed all of this-and in the critical glare of the international media spotlight.
There was no blueprint to follow for this unprecedented operation. It could have turned out to be a nightmare, but somehow General Shalikashvili jerry-rigged a miracle, bringing an end to the suffering and death and persuading 500,000 Kurds to willingly return to their homes in Iraq in an astonishingly short 90 days. No wonder Chief of Staff of the Army General Gordon Sullivan would later liken General Shalikashvili to the great jazz improvisational artist Dave Brubeck: highly trained in the classical approach but able to operate successfully, almost magically, in new conceptual territory.
What deep motivations might have inspired General Shalikashvili to such a virtuoso performance of leadership?
At the ceremony where General Shalikashvili received his fourth star, General Powell had also lauded him for being "not only a gifted leader but a sensitive human being," one who "understood what it was to be a refugee."
And indeed, many times during the operation, General Shalikashvili would visit the Kurdish camps. As he strolled among the makeshift tents, he would seek out the refugee children, particularly the orphans. They would chat together-and laugh. Asked once about those visits to the camps, the General replied, "When you see youngsters who are muddy and dirty and near death, and then see them a few weeks later cleaned up and playing and feeling like kids again-if you walk away from that without your heart beating fast, then you are made out of something different than I am."
David Halberstam fittingly wrote that General Shalikashvili had "an immigrant's special appreciation for America and a belief that this country, not just in the eyes of its own citizens, but in the eyes of much of the world, was the place the least fortunate turned to as the court of last resort." When the crisis in the Iraqi mountains occurred, the General thus willingly answered the call. All his leadership gifts were called into play, but it was with a heart attuned to the refugee plight, a sense of indebtedness to past benefactors, and the desire to pay it forward to 500,000 others that General Shalikashvili "worked a miracle" in northern Iraq. JFQ General Shalikashvili jerry-rigged a miracle, bringing an end to the suffering and death U.S. Air Force (Andy Dunasway)
General Shalikashvili monitors progress of humanitarian airlift to Goma, Zaire, 1994 J oint Force Quarterly has succeeded over the years due in no small part to the mentoring of its publisher, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This issue is the last produced under the leadership of Admiral Mike Mullen, who has been a constant source of support for our work and that of our contributors. JFQ will remain, as he and each of his predecessors intended, a forum for open and frank discussion of those issues that matter to the joint force. We wish Admiral Mullen fair winds and following seas.
We open this issue by noting the passing of the 13 th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General John Shalikashvili, USA. His family has approved an in-depth article on his service that we will publish in a future issue. Every Chairman since General Colin Powell has championed the mission of JFQ and joint professional military education (JPME). General Shalikashvili supported General Powell's vision for 15 issues of JFQ (nos. 2-16), helping to cement the journal's place as a platform for discussion of matters of substance for the joint force. In his first column, General Shalikashvili had these thoughts:
There are no boundaries on who should be writing for this journal. Napoleon was a young and relatively unseasoned officer when his brain was forming the electrifying ideas that would revolutionize warfare and overpower nearly every army in Europe. A little over a century later, a young, medically discharged captain named Liddell-Hart was struggling to get Britain's senior military leaders to hear his controversial views on warfare. Unfortunately, his own military wouldn't listen, but its future enemy did. When it comes to good ideas, neither rank nor age confers a monopoly. JFQ is intended to stay at the vanguard, to raise and air controversies, to tell us what we don't understand. Since World War II, we have moved a long way toward jointness. It has been a prolonged march, punctuated by occasional disagreements, but ushered by a recognition that unity is dangerous as a battlefield advantage over disunited opponents. But jointness is not a science, it is surely not static, and the march is by no means over. We need this journal, we need it to be open-minded, and above all it must be accessible. When you think back to General Billy Mitchell's frustrating crusade to educate the Armed Forces about the dawn of airpower, General George Marshall's tireless efforts to form a unified military establishment, or the more recent efforts by our own Congress-in the face of considerable military stubbornness-to formulate and pass the Goldwater-Nichols Act, it only emphasizes why we need JFQ. There is always room for improvement and there is a ceaseless challenge to adjust to new developments.
In the past four years alone, our Armed Forces participated in 29 major joint operations. Each and every one has been different. They have ranged from a large-scale conventional war in the Gulf through the embargo pressures we are even now applying against the dictators holding Haiti in their grip. Withal there are countless new lessons and observations which impact on the future of jointness. At the same time, literally hundreds of possible reforms, criticisms, and suggestions are percolating inside the think tanks that ring Washington, within our own Congress, and between ourselves. They need to be explored, their strengths assessed, and their warts exposed. We have to distinguish between those worth embracing and those that are dysfunctional or risky.
In his last column, General Shalikashvili discussed the results of the recently published inaugural Quadrennial Defense Review Report, which was featured in that edition. The Chairman gave support to continuing to work on the issues of the day, as the report signaled the need for serious reform within the Department of Defense (DOD). His closing words in the column were just as powerful then as they are today and serve as a reminder of what JFQ supports as we go forward: "To achieve the goal of a trained and ready force today and tomorrow, everyone-in Congress, the Department of Defense, and the Active, Reserve, and civilian components-has a key role to play. Only by working together in a spirit of cooperation can we realize the greatness the Nation expects and deserves in the new century." As General Shali would have expected, JFQ will continue to support contributors who seek to explore ideas for the future of the joint force and the world in which it operates. This issue's Forum debuts a series of interviews with the Joint Chiefs by talking with General Norton Schwartz, U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff. General Schwartz has logged more joint time than any of his fellow chiefs and has a unique perspective on the Air Force and on the joint force of today and tomorrow.
In addition, the Forum presents five articles by authors with different views on the future of national security, force structure, and defense strategy. First, RAND researchers Paul Davis and Peter Wilson discuss the nearterm crisis in defense planning and stress "the need for vigorous and competitive exploration and competition of ideas." Next, Douglas Macgregor offers an insightful concept that he believes would meet most of the constraints Davis and Wilson discuss: the fielding of a force design "structured and equipped for dispersed, mobile warfare inside an integrated maneuver-strike-intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance (ISR)-sustainment complex that combines the Nation's ground maneuver forces with strike, ISR, and sustainment capabilities from all of the Services." Built with joint command and control as a basis, this design is seen by Colonel Macgregor as best able to adapt rapidly to the range of potential engagements our joint and coalition forces will encounter across the spectrum of warfare.

Two members of the Air Staff's Studies and Analyses, Assessments, and Lessons Learned Division, Mark Gallagher and Kent Taylor, suggest a new method to evaluate alignment of the DOD budget with combatant command operational requirements. Gallagher and Taylor provide insights on how their proposal could be implemented while identifying the advantages and risks in doing so.
Next, two 2011 National War College graduates, Commander Peter Phillips, USN, and Colonel Charles Corcoran, USAF, provide a new approach to the U.S. national security structure that seeks to solve the continuing problem of achieving an efficient and effective coordinated executive branch response to a national crisis. The final Forum article, by recent Naval War College graduate Colonel Sean Larkin, USAF, takes on the issue of "tailored deterrence," arguing that this concept and our current joint doctrine are out of step with the canon of existing deterrence theory.
The Special Feature addresses the growing number of issues associated with cyber warfare. The first of three offerings is from HÃ¤ly Laasme, who provides a look into Estonia's role in the development, adequacy, and implementation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization cyber defense policy. The next two articles tackle the Stuxnet virus attack on Iran last year. Lukas Milevski, a doctoral student under the mentorship of Professor Colin Grey, suggests the features of the Stuxnet attack mirror a special operation in cyberspace. Finally, Colonel Gary Brown, USA, assesses Iran's view of last year's cyber attack.
As always, we are pleased to present the three winning essays from the 2011 Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Essay Contests. The Secretary of Defense Essay Contest winner, Colonel Justin Davey, USAF, provides an in-depth look at one of the strategic ingredients of our national security: permanent magnets. The winners of both categories in the Chairman's contest capitalized on a theme prevalent among this year's entrants. Steve Coonen, of the Office of the Secretary of Defense, assesses China as less of a concern to our security than many would have us believe, and Colonel Daniel Larsen, USA, tells us that we should not demonize China but keep monitoring their progress in all aspects, not just military capability, while continuing to be engaged at all levels of their society and maintain the traditional balance of power in the region.
The Commentary section has a pair of interesting works that should add to our reflection of the impact of operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. University of Chicago doctoral student Alexs Thompson, who is currently working for the Army's Directed Studies Office, provides a good look at how to address the religious portion of relating to Afghan culture. Brent Bankus and James Kievit of the U.S Army War College have developed a useful assessment of the last 8-plus years in Iraq using the lens of the U.S. experience in Vietnam.
In the Features section, we lead off with a "keeper" from Admiral James Stavridis, a National War College class of 1992 graduate, who offered the incoming National Defense University students his keys to successful strategic leadership. Continuing on the strategic leadership theme, we offer three JPME-related articles and one piece that focuses on how to go forward in the area of strategic airlift. On the JPME front, Captain Doug Waters, U.S. Navy faculty member at the U.S. Army War College, presents how war colleges should develop strategic thinkers, a critical requirement that has come under some fire of late. Mark McGuire from the Industrial College of the Armed Forces provides his college's approach to the same problem. Commander Scott Carpenter suggests that DOD identify and implement a specific career management plan for joint professionals, a plan he sees as necessary to strengthen our joint organizations. The reader can be the judge of the merits of each case, and in future editions, we look forward to continuing and expanding this discussion on JPME. Finally, Lieutenant Colonel Michael Grismer, USAF, offers an article on how best to increase our airlift with more creative and cost-effective use of the Civil Reserve Air Fleet.
The Recall section is back, offering an interesting recent history article on Afghanistan by Colonel R.D. Hooker, USA (Ret.), of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization Defense College, who details his experiences in and evaluates the impact of Combined Joint Task Force-82. Rounding out this issue are four engaging book reviews along with J7's joint doctrine update and an important discussion on doctrine from Lieutenant Colonel Mark Wastila, USMCR, who presents a well-reasoned approach of how to improve joint fires support to special operations. We are planning to offer more book reviews on the NDU Press Web site to keep readers up to date on new publications in a timelier fashion than a quarterly journal can allow.
At Joint Force Quarterly, we continue to work hard at bringing you the best ideas for and from the joint force for your consideration and discussion. We also congratulate the 2011 Secretary of Defense and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Essay Contest winners and hope to see great things develop from their work. Each author has readily demonstrated that we can count on your support in continuing to meet the Chairman's intent of an energetic discussion of the matters that are important to the joint force. We look forward to hearing from you. JFQ -William T. Eliason, Editor 
General Schwartz: I think there are essentially four things that I would describe as enduring qualities of our Air Force-things that are relevant now and will be relevant in the future.
One is what I would call domain control, and that applies both in the air and in space, and to some degree, in cyberspace as well. That is securing some part of these domains so that the other members of the joint team can accomplish their missions without the threat of attack from above by an adversary. It is fundamental to the way we operate as a joint team, and it is clear that this will be an enduring capability for the Air Force going forward.
Second is intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance [ISR], and clearly that's been an ascendant capability in the last 10 years as we have transitioned from general purpose force/major force engagement scenarios to what I would characterize as the more manhunting kind of role that we currently have. We also now apply our ISR capabilities more often in direct support to small units on the battlefield, so that when these small units go around the corner, through a window, or over a wall, they're not surprised by what's on the other side. So ISR in all of its dimensionsoverhead, air-breathing, multiple sensors, et cetera-and, more importantly, the capacity to digest that data stream and turn that [intelligence] product into useful information are enduring capabilities.
The third area clearly is lift-the capacity to get shooters to the fight, and to extend the range of those platforms that do the airlift mission and the platforms that conduct strike missions as well. So the lift part of this, as well as the air refueling piece, is a key part of what we do for the joint team.
Finally, global strike is something that is almost unique to the Air Force, and it manifests itself in a number of different ways. Fundamentally, this is about being able to reach out to put targets at risk, wherever they may be on the planet. That has both deterrent effects and clearly warfighting implications as well.
There's also another capability important to this, and that is how we command and control those four enduring features of our Air Force. We have the capacity to command and control the tools that we have at our disposal on a scale that is something others don't approach. So that too is an important feature.
Again, I would say command and control, ISR, lift, domain control, and global strike are the features of an Air Force like ours, and which are required now in the kinds of irregular warfare fights that we've been in during the last 10 years or so, and will be required in other fights that we might see in the future.
JFQ: For several years, the Air Force has been operating closely with its joint teammates in Iraq and Afghanistan. However, the Air Force's role has not always been front and center. What can you tell our readers about the Service's involvement in these conflicts, and how have they influenced your thinking about future operations? General Schwartz: This isn't about who gets the credit, and it's clear that the campaigns that we've been in, at least in Iraq and Afghanistan, have been largely groundfocused. It shouldn't be a surprise that the Army and Marine Corps are predominantly the ones that have gained the most attention as these conflicts have unfolded-although both the Navy and Air Force have made notinconsequential contributions to battlefield activity, to be sure.
However, the Libya scenario is a different one. Here's a case where it's a much more air-centric campaign, and we naturally gain more attention there than does the Army or Marine Corps-although we're certainly grateful that in the early days, the Marine Corps helped rescue one of our aviators. But it's a team sport. It's all about trust and confidence and keeping promises. As a team, we have come to rely upon one another to a greater degree than ever before. Regardless of Service, there is a level of confidence that, if someone promises he will be there to deliver an effect that's essential for another member of the team to accomplish his mission, it will happen or we'll die trying. That continues to be our ethic, and it certainly will continue to be so in the future.
General Schwartz: The Air Force and Navy have had, over the course of time, periods of more intense collaboration than at other times. It's been what I would characterize as ad hoc-certainly positive-but not at a consistent level. So one of the things that [Admiral] Gary Roughead [Chief of Naval Operations], [General James] Conway [Commandant of the Marine Corps] at the time, [General James] Amos [Commandant of the Marine Corps] now, and I decided to do, recognizing that the Navy and Air Force are the two Services with global perspective, was to cooperate routinely in the global commons. Access to the global commons is vital to the country for both strategic and national security reasons, but also economic reasons, so we concluded we needed to collaborate at a different level.
AirSea Battle really came about in three dimensions. One is the institutional dimension to normalize this collaboration-make it not an episodic thing but something that is much more routine between Marines, Sailors, and Airmen at the headquarters level on down. The second dimension was at the operational level. Clearly, the antiaccess/ area-denial environment is intensifying, and this is an issue again for the Services on which the country depends a great deal for power projection. So how do we at the operational level maximize our collective power projection capability in a more systematic way? We General Schwartz speaks with Airmen about national defense and force management U.S. Air Force (Charles Larkin, Sr.)
have gone about this in a manner that I think is much more thoughtful. This is not so much about new systems as it is really about how we better employ what we have at our collective disposal for maximum effect.
While this may be a bit far-fetched, here is an example that gives you an idea of what we're thinking about. There are fundamentally two stealth platforms in the DOD [Department of Defense] portfolio. Clearly, the Air Force has one of them with the B-2. Clearly, the Navy has one of them with their fleet of submarines. It's something that I quite frankly had never thought much about and that we haven't collectively given much thought to in the past: Is there a way for those two stealth capabilities in the defense portfolio to better reinforce one another? Maybe there's not, but this kind of thinking has potential to make better use of the resources we do have at our disposal and to moderate those capabilities out there that have the potential of making power projection a higher risk proposition for our country.
Finally, the third piece of how we are approaching AirSea Battle is on the acquisition side. I would argue that a good example is Global Hawk for the Air Force and the BAMS [Broad Area Maritime Surveillance] program for the Navy. We're using essentially the same platform; the only difference really is the sensor: one for an environment largely maritime-focused, and one for us largely overland-focused. But why should the Navy and Air Force have two different depots? Why should the Navy and Air Force even have different training pipelines or base such similar systems at different locations? So part of AirSea Battle is to make sure that, in those areas where we are clearly in the same space, we are making the best use of our resourcescommon ground stations, common training, common basing, common logistics supply chain, et cetera, to the extent possible.
None of this is rocket science, but this is a level of institutional commitment that I don't think has existed before. It will make a difference in preserving one of America's strong suits: power projection. JFQ: JFQ recently featured an article that suggested the need for better integration of cyber operations into the joint force commander's command and control. What is your assessment of the way ahead for cyber operations for the joint force? General Schwartz: This is an immature area, and one in which there's still a great deal of uncertainty in terms of what our capacities are, what our legal authorities are, and how we operate in peacetime versus wartime. Cyberspace is another one of those areas where traditional geographic boundaries don't apply. There are probably still more questions than answers here, but it is absolutely clear that we depend on our cyber capabilities to orchestrate the tools of warfare and that cyber capabilities themselves have the potential of performing military missions. So this is why we now have a U.S. Cyber Command-to bring this nascent capability, for which we don't yet have an end-to-end understanding, to its full potential. That is the vision for Cyber Command.
Within the Air Force, we see this in two contexts. One, naturally, is defending our network, and that's not a trivial job. We're certainly focused on that. Second, there are places for us to apply cyber in a more offensive context, but only in support of traditional Air Force missions. For example, you could take down an air defense capability kinetically. We do that with F-16 CJs. We've done that recently in Libya. However, you might instead choose, for good reasons, to disrupt an air defense capability with electrons. It will depend on the circumstances and the commander's intent, but there is a place for that. The Air Force is focusing on things that JFQ: After a long period of decline marked by a number of incidents, the Air Force took steps to restore the nuclear enterprise. Can you give us a sense of where the Service's contribution to nuclear forces stands today? General Schwartz: The Air Force has two of the three legs of the triad, and it is true that we went through a period when people questioned our competence in this important mission area. So we went about repairing that by standing up Air Force Global Strike Command on the operations side and establishing the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center for the sustainment of the nuclear enterprise. But I think apart from the organizational pieces, which were not unimportant, this is also a human capital question. Over time, for reasons that are understandable-I'm not saying justified, but understandable-the focus on the people who did this work diminished. It is very demanding work. This is an area where zero defects-perfection-is the standard. These people are under the microscope all the time. That's what the American people expect. So we're making sure that we have the right people-the critical mass of human capital-in order to do this job well.
We're ensuring we manage this pool as a key resource of our Air Force, and that those who work in this area know that this is a profoundly important mission involving the Nation's most lethal weapons and which requires a level of professionalism that leads the force in many respects. We're making sure these folks know that we as an institution value that commitment and that we will reward that commitment. That's why sustaining the nuclear enterprise is our number-one priority-we cannot back off of that. Again, I think this is a whole lot less about force structure. What it is really about is reassuring people who do this demanding work that it's worthy work, that it's valued, and that it's essential to the Nation's security.
process to squeeze overhead and look for excess, overlaps, duplication, and so on in order to move about $33 billion from support to mission-critical activities. Now we have additional targets. The trend lines are clear. The collective view of the Service chiefs is that we are not going to allow a return to the period when the Armed Forces actually went hollow. We're not going back there. You've heard the Secretary of Defense say that we may be a smaller force, but we're going to continue to be a superb force. That is the bottom line on this, but we will probably have to get smaller.
We will not reduce manpower first, however. We tried to do that some years ago and discovered that it really didn't save that much money. We went from about 355,000 to 320,000, and it didn't save a nickel because the cost of personnel continued to escalate. We have a ceiling right now of about 332,000, and we will squeeze force structure before we squeeze manpower. There are negotiations under way both for debt ceiling considerations and future OMB [Office of Management and Budget] numbers for the DOD, and we'll see what they turn out to be. It is clear, as the Secretary of Defense stated, that Defense is not off the table, and while we can become more efficient, there are certainly ways to save on the costs of operations. I do think that reductions will be significant and will probably require us to get a bit smaller. We're prepared to make those choices. I think the key thing is that we're going to need the help of our partners in Congress. As we make adjustments, some places will lose force structure and others may gain. One hopes that it's possible for us to reach consensus with the various delegations on how to go about this.
Chiefs? With such a wealth of experience to draw on, what is your assessment of where jointness is today and to go in the future? General Schwartz: You know, it's better to be lucky than good. I have had a range of experiences, and I think that having been a prior combatant commander has made me a better Service chief. You understand the demand side of the equation. You are part of a network that the Service chiefs are not, given the division of labor in the Goldwater-Nichols Act. Being selected as Air Force chief of staff was unexpected, but it has proven to be very valuable to have migrated through the COCOM [combatant commander] ranks to become a Service chief.
Additionally, I was lucky enough to establish relationships and credibility with a range of teammates over the years, and that certainly has proven valuable and helpful to the Air Force in making the case that we're all in and that the Air Force will do whatever's necessary while people are dying in the current conflicts. There is a level of trust that I think started out in the captain years, with Doug Brown, Pete Schoomaker, Eric Olson, and lots of other people who are now doing important things for the country as well. We should all be proud of who we are and where we come from, but a reality is that as you become more senior, you have to be able to be bigger than where you came from. The joint experiences I've been fortunate enough to be exposed to have enabled me to be bigger than where I came from, and have hopefully allowed me to be an asset to the Air Force and to my fellow Service chiefs. Everything has its time, but I do think that having a broad base matters in a job like this. I was fortunate to have opportunities along the way, and to have people take chances with me.
We came to this job unexpectedly, of course, but having that larger network of folks has benefits, and it sure made it easier when we joined the Joint Chiefs in 2008. My wife Suzie and I have been longtime friends with George and Sheila Casey, as well as with Jim and Annette Conway. Gary Roughead and I had the opportunity in the past to work with one another. These relationships go back decades, and that is not trivial. I think it's something that strengthens our Armed Forces and is a reason for staying the course in this area. If we think back to the late 1990s, we are light years better than in those days. You can see the difference; this is roughly 30 years of joint business, and it has made a huge difference. It does not mean that the Services aren't vital-they clearly are-but it also has created a generation of military leaders who are bigger than where they came from.

The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has been one of Africa's most brutal militia forces for over two decades, having spread from northern Uganda to cover an expansive area that is outside the day-to-day control of regional governments. In this paper, Andre Le Sage examines the LRA in depth, including its historical development, inability of past offensives to succeed against it, and the current force disposition of the group. Dr. Le Sage then examines current U.S. and international thinking on how expanded efforts to counter the LRA could work best in the field. He also highlights how U.S. strategy makes a range of assumptions that must be met in order for counter-LRA operations to succeed. He concludes that-in the absence of greater, direct U.S. military engagementthe United States must be willing to make significant investments in support of regional and peacekeeping partners to defeat the LRA. A period of discontinuity in defense planning looms because of a "perfect storm"that is, the confluence of technology diffusion, geostrategic changes, and the range of increasingly well-armed adversaries (states and networked nonstate actors). These are leading to the United States having to deal with a demanding mix of counterinsurgency (COIN) and counterterrorism on the one hand, and traditional challenges on the other; the likelihood of major difficulties in projecting forces in some important circumstances; related block obsolescence of U.S. forces and concepts of operations; and the need for a new grand strategy in the Asia-Pacific region. 
1
To make things worse, obstacles exist to taking on these challenges-notably, the demands of current wars, military complacency due to decades of military overmatch, and severe national fiscal constraints. Incremental changes will not suffice, but no consensus is yet emerging about options for the way ahead. Taken together, the problems pose a once-in-a-century challenge. All of this is summarized in figure

For decades, the U.S. military has enjoyed technological overmatch in domains from sophisticated communications through precision weapons and space systems. This is changing, as indicated in table 1, which lists classes of military technology that are now or can soon be available to some U.S. adversaries-even some lesser states and nonstate military organizations. Some of the related items are inexpensive, such as cell phones or other devices using the Global Positioning System (GPS). Precision weapons are available today to nonstate actors, as illustrated by Hizballah's use of guided missiles and other tactics in the 2006 Lebanon War.

To put matters into perspective, it is useful to conceptualize changes occurring in the 21 st century in terms of four 20 th -century revolutions in military affairs (RMAs). The strategy of industrial warfare emerged conspicuously from 1917 onward with mass production of self-propelled vehicles of all types. It matured in World War II, and its influence  
6
RMA III, the strategy of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and strategic bombardment, began in World War II with nuclear weapons and long-range means of bombarding the adversary's homeland (primarily with bombers, but also with Germany's first-generation long-range ballistic and cruise missiles). Since then, nuclear weapons have proliferated and might continue to do so, perhaps even to nonstate actors. Other forms of WMD, especially biological weapons, are also a concern.
RMA IV, the strategy of information technology, became increasingly visible in the late 1980s. It was marked by precisionguided weapons, information technology, and the use of space, as in network-centric warfare. It has been the central feature of military transformation since the 1990s. 
7
A common impression is that a given RMA occurs within a nominal date range and is subsequently replaced by the next one. In contrast, we see RMAs as having started at nominal times but continuing thereafter in a measure-countermeasure dynamic with competition among all four of them (see figure

The geostrategic changes in recent decades are many and varied. China is now a major power with impressive, highmomentum military developments

Other geostrategic realities include, of course, the continuing struggle with violent radical extremists, notably al Qaeda and a network of loosely affiliated jihadist organizations worldwide. No end is in sight for that struggle-even if U.S. withdrawal from Iraq occurs on schedule without civil war, and even if progress continues slowly in Afghanistan, which is even more uncertain-especially given linkages to the troubles within Pakistan. Osama bin Laden's death has not changed this. Nor have the upheavals of the Arab Spring, the long-term implications of which are not yet clear.
Another new geostrategic reality is the advent of new wartime theaters of operation: space and cyberspace. The U.S. military is extremely dependent on both and experiences many serious vulnerabilities as other nations improve their own capabilities in both, and as some nations, such as China, do so zealously precisely because of the U.S. dependence.
Finally, nuclear proliferation continues, despite years of unsuccessful effort and dubious rhetoric about preventing it. In some instances (North Korea and Iran among them), a major purpose of developing nuclear capability is to deter attacks by the United States. At some point, countries such as South Korea and Taiwan may come to doubt the credibility of U.S. extended conventional deterrence-especially if conventional force projection itself becomes substantially more dicey for the United States.
Against this background, we see the obsolescing of U.S. force structure and concepts of operations with respect both to a peer competitor and to lesser adversaries that combine methods of insurgency with modern technology. Problems exist across the board, but table 2 illustrates them for force projection. To be sure, our assessments are subjective, and uncertainties have less to do with technology trends, which are observable, than with whether in fact potential adversaries exploit them as we project.
Some key points underlie these conclusions relating to traditional forces and traditional operational concepts: 
13
â  â  Aircraft are potentially quite vulnerable to precision weapons if based within the countries of operations or relatively close to shore. If based at long range to improve survivability, these aircraft will be unable to maintain high sortie rates over contested areas, whether for purposes of achieving air superiority or for suppression of air defenses and support of ground operations. â  â  These vulnerabilities would be exacerbated if the adversary used area munitions, such as the cluster weapons that the United States has used for decades, or fuel-air explosives, such as those developed by the United States, Russia, Great Britain, and China. Such weapons have been used recently by Libya against rebels. worsen. Arguably, the two premier forms of theater-wide forcible entry, the mass airborne and amphibious operation mechanisms, are already obsolete for many environments. Brigade-level airborne drops have long been more of a theoretical option than something anticipated; large-scale over-the-shore amphibious assault will be seen as both risky and potentially costly given the threat from improved coastal intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, mines, and direct and indirect precision weapons. Maneuver from the sea using longer range vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, such as the V-22, will remain limited in scope because of range-payload issues and vulnerability to air defenses. Heavy amphibious forces such as the recently canceled armored expeditionary fighting vehicle will be vulnerable to direct fire guided munitions. Even seabases could be vulnerable to precision missile fires at significant ranges offshore.
Against this background of sobering diagnosis, we have attempted to sketch the outlines of a way ahead. That outline involves new military capabilities, concepts of operation, and grand strategy.
We focused largely on issues of force projection. Since traditional concepts of operation are losing viability, we sketched three illustrative possibilities for new ones to sharpen discussion of capability needs. They stem from asking how force projection could proceed given a lethal environment (sometimes discussed as an antiaccess environment).
Make Deliberate, Phased Entry with Defense. This concept would be, in some respects, a modernized version of the classic concept. However, significant suppression of adversary capabilities would be accomplished with long-range strike platforms (and cyberwar), after which the ground and air forces deployed into the country ï® = feasibility is in question ï® = feasible but with high risk ï® = risky or difficult ï® = feasible with acceptable risk (perhaps from seabasing) would have reliable defenses against missile and drone attacks from short, medium, and long ranges. The defenses would be accompanied by the ability to quickly detect and attack the launch sites of any attacks (by analogy with the Army's current counterbattery fire). Furthermore, there would be the need to support Army and Marine ground maneuver forces by longrange airlift flying from protected land-or seabases. Multibrigade ground forces could perhaps be supported by airlift with the new technology of precision airdrop, although that would be challenging for some classes of supply such as fuel and ammunition. Airlifters would overfly low-altitude air defenses and would not need to use forward airfields under threat from long-range precision fires. The concept of the defended seabase also appears attractive. Recently, the Navy has developed a new at-sea connector, the mobile land platform, that has conceptual promise to provide at-sea support to a multibrigadesize Marine and Army expeditionary force, although budget pressures might preclude related investments. Surveil, Strike, Punish from Afar, and Insert Small, Networked Ground Forces. An alternative approach would be to eschew insertion of large ground forces and instead depend on sustainable strike capabilities guided by persistent surveillance from survivable platforms. Special forces and unconventional warfare operations pivoting around indigenous allied forces could also play a major role. Thus, the concept could include large numbers of small, dispersed, networked ground forces. 
14
Make Rapid Entry. A third example would emphasize prior surveillance by survivable and possibly covert means; first strikes or preemptions in the form of sudden, decisive strikes with long-range missiles and aircraft, cyberattacks, and specialized ground forces; and followup actions by larger numbers of ground forces, both those of the country being assisted and external projection forces. Such attacks might be especially relevant to dealing with terror networks that cannot be deterred in the ordinary sense.
These possibilities are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive (for example, they do not include space-based weapons that could be used both for offensive purposes and to suppress or destroy enemy defenses), but they illustrate a range of different thrusts-each with its own severe shortcomings.
At this stage, it is not clear which or which combination of these concepts will be viable. This suggests priorities on certain types of capabilities if they can in fact be achieved at tolerable cost. The following list is itself less remarkable than recognizing how challenging the related technical requirements are (and by noting differences from current de facto priorities, such as modernization of current platform types): â  â  high-confidence defenses at tactical and operational levels ranging from history continues to show the need for substantial "boots on the ground" to control territory We see likely cross-cutting stratagems as involving dispersion, networking, and swarm tactics; major efforts to ensure network security while hedging in not-yet-identified ways against predictable network failures or penetration; and massive use of robotics and remote control systems. For each military Service, the crucial questions seem to be these: â  â  What are the appropriate new-era building block units (for example, analogues to older units, such as brigades or squadrons, but often with a more joint character)? Again, the generic questions are less remarkable than the specifics. Should ground force projection deemphasize large, traditional units in favor of small, networked unit (swarming) tactics? What kind of seabasing makes sense, and for what distances? What is the future role of short-range tactical air forces? How will long-distance strike capability be sustained in the event of a large and lengthy conflict? And, in the realm of complex operations, what capabilities are needed to accomplish the missions with much reduced numbers of U.S. ground forces?
The other crucial element of the way ahead will be a new grand strategy. The most obvious need is to rethink grand strategy for the Asia-Pacific super region. We conclude: â  â  Given the extent of China's developments, it is no longer appropriate to assess the adequacy of U.S. force structure by playing through simulated wars over the Taiwan Strait. The focus must change to broader conceptions of the power balance that include the arc from the Middle East through the Indian Ocean to Northeast Asia. â  â  Imperatives in the new conception will include deterrence and crisis stability; deterring small and limited aggression, as well as larger scale aggression; and ensuring that, in periods of tension, the combination of the sides' lethality and vulnerability does not create perceived imperatives for preemptive action. Avoiding errors that might cause war will be crucial for the great powers and important regional powers. A major issue is how deterrence can be made stronger than it has been in the past. â  â  Challenges of deterrence and, especially, extended conventional deterrence will be exacerbated by proliferation of nuclear weapons. The military component of strategy will seek to maintain conventional warfighting and war-winning capabilities where feasible but will include more deterrence-oriented capability, such as the ability to inflict serious pain with conventional strikes, devastate infrastructure with conventional strikes, and maintain supremacy at sea-if not in major powers' littoral waters, then certainly on a larger regional and global scale that includes the sea lines of communication to the Middle East and Africa.
The United States has a major decision to make regarding the degree to which it should prepare for manpower-intensive operations, such as COIN and stabilization. It is not obvious that such operations should be the primary basis for force planning, despite events of the past decade. If they are, then the economic consequences will be acute because they would come in addition to the demands of evolving balance of power and force projection issues that are themselves demanding.
Although arms control should also be an element of grand strategy, it is unlikely that it will substantially alleviate the major U.S. national security challenges identified.
Because the way ahead militarily is unclear, we see the need for vigorous and competitive exploration and competition of ideas. The past decade's experiences have not been encouraging: Visions have sometimes gotten far ahead of technology; reason, criticism, and competition have not been sufficiently valued; and joint experimentation has been neither sufficiently ambitious nor rigorous. Ironically, at a time when U.S. Joint Forces Command is arguably needed most, a decade's disappointments caused former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates to call for the command's dissolution. 
15
Finally, in some respects (the primary difference being the unavoidable long struggle with international violent religious extremism that threatens the United States and its worldwide interests), the Nation is in a situation reminiscent of that of the Eisenhower administration as it considered grand strategy. It seems likely that, in broad terms, grand strategy will need to evolve with an emphasis on rejuvenating and sustaining the country's economic vitality while relying increasingly on credible forms of deterrence (rather than clear-cut superiority) in certain balance of power issues; and on alliances, improvement of allied capabilities, and use of international organizations. What is needed, arguably, is a national security strategy of comprehensive balancing rather than just a rebalancing of military capabilities. JFQ

The trendlines are unambiguous: military establishments that integrate functions and capabilities across Service lines, and, in the allied context, across national lines, while simultaneously eliminating unneeded overhead not only are less expensive to operate and maintain, 
4
At the heart of all national military strategy is the desire to increase the state's capacity for independent action. Independent people and organizations enjoy greater latitude for action at a time and place of their choosing. The same is true for the United States and its allies. However, to craft a force development strategy to achieve this goal, America's political and military leaders must understand what is changing in military affairs.
First, military power is no longer based on the mass mobilization of the manpower and resources of the entire state. Conscript armed forces, the norm in the 19 th and 20 th centuries, are gradually being replaced with professional military establishments inundated with technology.
Second, precision effects (kinetic and nonkinetic) using a vast array of strike U.S. Air Force (Marc I. Lane)
Airmen prepare B-1B Lancer for mission in support of NATO operations over Libya MACGREGOR forces enabled by the rapid and timely dissemination of information through networked ISR capabilities point the way to a fundamental paradigm shift in the character of warfare. For example, a military contest on the model of Kursk in July 1943-a battle that involved nearly 940,000 attacking German forces and 1.5 million defending Soviet forces in a geographical area the size of England-would result in catastrophic losses for the defending side. Today, any ground combat force that immobilizes itself in prepared defenses on this World War II model would be identified, targeted, and annihilated from a distance.
Third, integrative command structures and new organizations for combat are essential features of this shift. Aircraft and ships involved in strike operations, both manned and unmanned, have excellent sensors that can be linked to other elements of the fighting force to support the translation of collected information into actionable intelligence. As a result, ISR and strike are mission areas that cut across all domains (land, sea, air, and space). In addition, ISR and strike capabilities now have the capacity to influence not only tactical strike and maneuver operations, but also the operational and strategic conduct of warfighting operations.
Fourth, the conditions shaping dispersed mobile warfare do not eliminate the close fight in ground combat operations whether these operations involve interstate or subnational conflicts. Nor do they eliminate uncertainty, surprise, or confusion from warfare. Regardless of how well new technologies are networked, they cannot provide perfect situational awareness or perfect information. Soldiers, Sailors, and Airmen will never know everything that happens inside their battlespace, and what they do learn will often be of fleeting value. Commanders must still think and act on short notice with incomplete information within the framework of a known operational intent.
Mines, rocket-propelled grenades, machineguns, mortars, chemical agents, barbed wire, and air defense systems are still effective against ground forces, even in this era of precision strikes. Mobile armored firepower inside the ground maneuver force will be more important than ever given the speed with which information must be assimilated, synthesized, and delivered in time to be exploited. A ground force that cannot take hits and keep fighting will collapse quickly.
Networked information systems cannot replace killing power or organic survivability in the form of armored forces, especially in close combat. Ground maneuver forces (light, medium, or heavy) that cannot rapidly disperse to avoid presenting lucrative targets to the opposing force risk destruction.
Fifth, surprise in warfare is still attainable. Countermeasures in many forms including cyber warfare ensure the fog of war will persist. Many nation-states are acutely sensitive to these trends, and they are preparing to fight under these conditions in the future.

Form defines warfare more than numbers or technology. The interaction of technology with organizational paradigms creates powerful new military capabilities. Embracing new technology is important, but it should not be done indiscriminately, out of fear of being left behind. Technology should be chosen for integration on the basis of what it can do today, as well as its potential for future development. It is therefore vital to establish the form that warfare will take, then, to determine the right joint operational concept and the appropriate force design to exploit technology.
Ubiquitous strike capabilities and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD), nuclear or nonnuclear, now make the concentration of large land, naval, or air forces dangerous. As a result, dispersed mobile warfare-a condition that elevates tactical dispersion to the operational level of war-is replacing warfare on the World War II model of defined continuous fronts as the dominant form of combat. Moreover, in dis-persed mobile warfare, integrated "all-arms" warfare is the overarching joint operational concept for warfighting operations.
All-arms operations integrate the functional capabilities of maneuver, strike, ISR, and sustainment across Service lines inside a seamless unified command and control (C 2 ) operational framework. In fact, success in contemporary and future warfare on land, at sea, or in the air demands the ability to maneuver from a dispersed configuration, concentrating effects and, for brief periods, ground combat forces at decisive points in time and space when conditions demand it.
Clearly, the most favorable conditions on land exist when ground forces operate within the framework of an integrated network of maneuver-strike-ISR-sustainment functions, hereafter referred to as the complex. Within the complex, attacking ground forces compel opposing enemy To effectively and economically defend U.S. and allied interests in the 21 st century, forces should be organized to operate inside this complex to ensure responsive and accelerated decision cycles at all levels. Precision strikes from the air and sea can incapacitate enemy command and control, but the confusion and paralysis thus engendered are always temporary. Without the experience of warfare, people (including those in uniform) forget that the enemy is a reactive system.
Future adversaries, regardless of national identity, will work hard and rapidly to restore communication connections. They will also seek other ways to communicate that are less vulnerable to strikes and discover ways to preserve operational coherence without being detected. Over time, future nation-state and nonstate opponents should be expected to recover from the initial disruption that strikes cause.
It is essential, then, to destroy the opponent before recovery, which is why ground combat forces with tactical mobility, devastating firepower, and effective armored protection must be tightly integrated within the complex. Achieving this outcome requires the establishment of an integrated military command structure designed to employ dispersed and distributed combat elements as capability-based forces from all of the Services inside the complex.
Because the simplest tasks in war are difficult, complex command arrangements involving fragmented authority must be avoided. How information is used during conflict or crisis reflects the structures of the information flow, as well as the thinking and mentality of the people who use the information. The two influence one another and are inextricably intertwined.
World War II battles in which the Soviet Union was involved were generally decided in favor of the Soviet Union in part because its leadership organized and employed its armed forces under a unified military command structure that compelled integration of core service capabilities under a single operational commander. But the Soviet leadership was able to maximize combat power (land, sea, and air) where it was needed and economize where it was not needed. The branches of the Soviet armed forces were thoroughly subor-dinated to the Stavka (General Headquarters) and its subordinate command echelonsfront and army-ensuring uncontested unity of action on the strategic and operational levels of war. 
9
In the West, neither the Germans nor Western Allies created similar arrangements. For the Americans and British, Sir Winston Churchill's complaint that the "chiefs of staff system leads to weak or faltering decisionsor rather indecision" 10 went unheeded. In the United States, the Service chiefs together with policymakers in Washington set out to institutionalize the way that the United States fought World War II in the 1947 National Security Act. Subsequent legislative attempts to reduce the excessive bureaucratic power of the separate Services to fund and equip themselves independently, as well as the influence of single-Service warfare doctrine and organizations, have been limited in terms of how operations are conducted, as well as in terms of staggering American defense costs. 
11
In the United States, Armed Forces operational decisionmaking in otherthan-ground-maneuver headquarters was generally focused on supporting operations, not on determining their course. 
12
On land, simply breaking existing corps and divisional structures into smaller pieces will not change the industrial age warfighting paradigm, reduce or eliminate echelons of unneeded C 2 , or advance integrative, seamless jointness on the operational level. Geographically dispersed land-, air-, and sea-based forces require a high level of command coherence through technologically and intellectually shared battlespace awareness. This condition dictates the requirement for integrative command structures on the operational level that magnify the larger fighting power of the integrated joint force.
The proliferation of WMD and related strike weapons now compels the transfer and integration of capabilities once found only at the Army division and Marine Corps/ Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF) levels, or only in the naval and air forces down to lower command echelons (see figure). These new command echelons must also be tightly integrated with the war-winning ISR and strike capabilities found in all of the Services. In this sense, ISR must be viewed as the key integrating function for warfighting and operational design, planning, and execution. U.S. forces are in a position to integrate current Marine Corps/MEF and division C 2 into a joint C 2 structure such as the notional joint task force (JTF) command. This operational-level headquarters is designed to orchestrate the effects that will compel the internal collapse of an opponent through maneuver and strike without reliance on destructive time-and resource-consuming attrition warfare or mass armies.
Combining strike and maneuver into a single joint operation inside a JTF command is the core of operational art. Striking the enemy throughout the entire depth of operational deployment simultaneously and, at the same time, introducing rapid, mobile, mutually supporting air and ground forces through the disrupted force to fight a series of actions for which the enemy is not prepared is the essence of this form of warfare. These without the experience of warfare, people forget that the enemy is a reactive system FORUM | Thoughts on Force Design conditions are no less applicable to the defeat of loosely organized guerrilla forces operating in complex or urban terrain. 
13
Battlefields have been emptying for the last 50 years in response to new and more lethal weapons technologies. Supporting these dispersed forces will not be easy. For these reasons, a two-star flag officer focused exclusively on sustainment functions is a deputy commander for sustainment inside the JTF command structure.
With the expansion of strike and information assets, it is critical to supply the JTF commander with deputies and staffs committed to employ the full complement of ground, air, electronic, and information operations capabilities. The emergence of a deputy commander for ISR marks a shift from the World War II/Cold War mindset that treats ISR as a supporting function to a new understanding that, in the 21 st century, ISR integrated with strike and maneuver operations can be both operationally and strategically decisive. 
14
Another major general or rear admiral (upper half) commands strike operations. With the emergence of U.S. and allied strike complexes inside the regional unified commands, the links from deputy commander for strike to ground combat formations, as well as to the strike assets in all the Services, are pivotal. 
15
16
In addition to these JTF "force employment" headquarters, two sets of future resource pooling or management headquarters could be formed to provide capabilities across the various theaters of operations to the combatant commanders, as well as to the JTF commands. These functionally based commands would include: 
Two sets of these resource management headquarters would be capable of managing the force and asset management tasks on a global basis.
These JTF commands would exist in sufficient quantity to command and employ U.S. and allied forces on land, at sea, or in the air. All forces would be designed as mission capability packages organized for employment under one-star commanders. American air and naval forces routinely assemble forces organized around ISR, strike, sustainment, and maneuver tailored to specific missions. Sometimes these are composite wings or surface action groups. However, ground forces have only recently begun to think in terms of mission-focused capability packages. Movement toward harmonization-and away from Cold War notions of C 2 synchronization-has been critical to this outcome. Increasingly, the sort of intelligence that Soldiers and Marines need is fleeting, and traditional Army and Marine command structures that cannot jump on this intelligence and exploit it have been compelled to change thinking and behavior. 
17
18
19
The CMG combines the command element, fighting power, and support element into a stand-alone, mission-focused capability package. The CMG is commanded by a brigadier general with a robust staff, including a deputy commander and a chief of staff, both of whom are colonels.
The CMG drives the joint command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C 4 ISR) plugs to lower levels, compressing the tactical and operational levels to the point where maneuver and strike are integrated at a much lower level than is currently possible. Maneuver, strike, ISR and sustainment formations become clusters of joint combat power that have the capacity for operations on land reminiscent of the way ships operate at sea. Translated into terms that Soldiers and Marines understand, the new force design must offer the following features: In the new C 2 organization modeled on the JTF command structure, there is a Strike Coordinator. These coordinators supplant existing fire support officers in the ground forces and become specialists in all the Services with joint training to qualify them to direct strike operations on behalf of ground combat groups or similar mission-focused capability packages from the air and sea. They are designed to be an extension of the strike structure into every land, naval, or air formation. 
20
Transforming all Service forces into mission-focused force packages that can be assembled into larger joint operational forces is essential if maneuver, strike, ISR, and sustainment capabilities are to be effectively integrated to pose more complex threats to new enemies. In practice, this scheme for military power depends on evolving integrated, joint systems and a technical architecture (a set of building codes) for successful aggregation.
There are many benefits to this approach. Eliminating some of the career gates on the Service ladder changes career patterns, allowing more time for lieutenant colonels and colonels (as well as naval equivalent ranks) to become educated and qualified for joint operations-something current Service career patterns obstruct. Reorganizing ground maneuver forces into 5,000-to 6,000man combat formations under brigadier generals provides a larger, ready, deployable, joint combat force of Soldiers.
Another benefit is the appointment of a brigadier general to command on the tactical level. Here, the historical record is illuminating. Accompanying the first infantrymen ashore on June 6, 1944, was Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, the only American general officer who arrived with the first wave of troops on D-Day. When Roosevelt realized that the initial assault force had landed 2,000 yards south of where they should have on Utah Beach, Roosevelt adjusted the plan, telling the company commanders precisely where they were and directed their movement inland along new routes. The result was rapid penetration, in a few hours, by American infantry several miles inland that Army intelligence analysts predicted would take several days.
On Omaha Beach, where there was no general officer present, the situation was far more confused and more costly in terms of American dead. The proposed model for Force Employment within the New Operational Concept will similarly improve the effectiveness of American tactical operations and their efficient integration into operations designed to support national strategic objectives.
The compression of reduced C 2 overhead while combining existing single-Service echelons into a flatter, multi-Service integrative C 2 structure will definitely contribute to long-term cost savings. The point is to reduce the bloated C 2 overhead, a legacy of the Cold War, while maximizing ready and deployable combat power. Combining the implementation of the integrative command resource management structures inside the regional maneuver-strike-ISR-sustainment complexes with the compression of today's six regional unified commands (U.S. European, Central, Pacific, Southern, Northern, and Africa Commands) into four (potentially U.S. Pacific, Atlantic, Northern, and Southern Commands) would accomplish both objectives: increasing capability while achieving annualized savings in current defense spending of at least $100 billion.
Implementing the Navy's rotational readiness model across American (and potentially allied) forces would also result in additional efficiencies, while simultaneously improving unity of effort and rationalizing the training, modernization, deployment, and reconstitution of U.S. and allied forces. Rotating U.S. forces through four readiness training, deployment, recovery, and reconstitution phases of 6 to 9 months each guarantees a larger portion of the current U.S. joint force is ready to fight on short notice than is the case today. The importance of making routine deployments more predictable, ensuring regular periods of rest for American troops, cannot be overstated.
The cost savings involved in reducing unneeded wear and tear on equipment and people should now be self-evident, but these savings do not entirely address the probable savings in manpower and equipment. For instance, sea control is no longer a mission that demands a large surface fleet on the World War II model. America's nuclear submarine fleet augmented with fewer surface combatants employing long-range sensors, manned and unmanned aircraft, communications, and missiles can dominate the world's oceans, ensuring the United States and its allies control access to the maritime domain that supports 91 percent of the world's commerce.
Annualized savings resulting from change associated with the maneuver-strike-ISR-sustainment complexes in the various regional unified commands would also run into the tens of billions of dollars as combatant commanders and Service chiefs restructure the conduct of overseas presence missions and determine those overseas facilities they no longer deem operationally useful. The method used to identify and capture these savings is a detailed blueprint for change in a Force Design Roadmap. For every capability gap identified, selected equipment sets and supporting jobs will be identified for elimination to liberate resources for investment to close those gaps.
To leverage uncertainty and judiciously select from the warfighting concepts and technologies of the present to field new innovative organizations and capabilities for the future within the fiscal constraints imposed by economic stringency, the United States should chart a new course into the future. As implied at the beginning of this article, change in military affairs is inevitable. Bill Gates stated it best, warning that when waves of change appear, "You can duck under the wave, stand fast against the wave or, better yet, surf the wave." Put another way, the faster you can accurately assess a situation, make "good enough" decisions on what to do about it, and act decisively to deal with it, the more competitive you become. 
21
The time has come to begin reorganizing the manpower and capabilities inside the Nation's Armed Forces within an integrated, joint operational framework to provide a larger pool of ready, deployable fighting forces on rotational readiness. Building maneuverstrike-ISR-sustainment complexes inside the regional unified commands is a way to create the foundation for enduring American military power on a global level at a time when the Nation's public debt-if honestly calculated to include $7 trillion of additional deficit spending through 2015-will approach $18 trillion.

In this article, we review the establishment of the COCOMs per the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, briefly discuss the current DOD resource allocation process, and then propose a construct to evaluate the extent to which the DOD budget is aligned with COCOM operational requirements. We also discuss how to implement this proposal along with advantages and potential concerns based on implementation of this proposal.
Worth noting is the scope of this proposal. Specifically, it is not our intent to create an algorithm whereby a bunch of budget numbers and COCOM priorities are smashed together and the output is declared to be the DOD budget. This analytical approach is intended to inform DOD decisionmakers, not to make their decisions for them-that is, we do not intend to turn the DOD budget into an engineering problem. Furthermore, we are not proposing any changes to current authorities; we are simply proposing quantifiable and tractable measures of how well military department budgets align with COCOM priorities.
On July 15, 1985, President Ronald Reagan signed Executive Order 12526 and created the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense, chaired by David Packard. 
2
The primary objective of the Commission shall be to study defense management policies and procedures, including the budget process, the procurement system, legislative oversight, and the organizational and operational arrangements, both formal and informal, among the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Organization of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Unified and Specified Command System, the Military Departments, and the Congress.
The Packard Commission presented findings and recommendations organized around four topics in their interim report as submitted to the President on February 28, 1986: Though DOD was faced with an increasing demand for joint planning and 
to Commander Priorities Linkin GALLAGHER and TAYLOR operations across the domains, the commission found that the Services were planning and conducting operations as independent, often competing organizations with little collaboration and cooperation. Similarly, the commission found that each Service advocated and acquired systems to accomplish their assigned roles and missions independently-as though each Service was the primary, if not sole, producer and consumer of its materiel. In rare instances when they did work together, the Services typically closed ranks as a last resort so as to frustrate attempts by the Secretary of Defense to impose top-down direction that would otherwise impede the status quo for the Services.
Packard Commission recommendations were primarily implemented in two ways. First, National Security Decision Directive 219, dated April 1, 1986, implemented virtually all of the commission recommendations that did not require legislative action. Second, the remaining recommendations were addressed via congressional legislation that was introduced on November 24, 1985, as H.R. 3622, "Joint Chiefs of Staff Reorganization Act of 1985." Congress enacted it as the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, and President Reagan signed the legislation into law on October 1, 1986 (Public Law 99-433).

While COCOMs should focus on warfighting rather than organizing and equipping units, they should be able to influence the types of units available. In an analogy to professional sports, the net effect of Â§164 and Â§166 is akin to a coach having full control of the team on the practice field and full control during actual games, but having very little say over who is actually on the team. Ideally, all levels of the sports franchise-ownership, coaches, players, and support staff-are working together when it comes to decisions on personnel, individual training, team practices, game tactics, and so forth.
Three interrelated DOD decision support systems must be synchronized in order for COCOMs to have the general purpose forces they need to accomplish their assigned missions. The interrelationship of these three decision support systems is depicted in the accompanying figure, along with brief descriptions of each decision support system as posted on the Defense Acquisition University portal.

The Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) leads the annual Planning, Programming, Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) process and builds the DOD budget. The Army, Navy (which includes the Marines), and Air Force begin the PPBE process by submitting their proposed budgets, called Program Objective Memorandums (POMs), to OSD. OSD then leads the Program and Budget Review (PBR), which adjusts the Service proposals with inputs across DOD, including the COCOMs. The PBR product, through the Office of Management and Budget, becomes the DOD portion of the President's annual budget. In turn, Congress reviews and revises the President's budget and sends approved legislation back to the President, who signs it into law. Each Service budget authorization includes funding requests to enable it to fulfill its Title 10 responsibility to organize, train, and equip forces. Consequently, the Services control the vast majority of the DOD budget.
Of the five appropriation categories in the DOD budget, three are germane to our discussion of how materiel is acquired by the The current DOD budgeting process has perceived problems of inefficiencies. A common complaint is that the Services are somewhat parochial (and arguably myopic) in constructing their budgets by advocating and funding new systems that are typically Service-or domain-centric as though the Services were living in a pre-Goldwater-Nichols time warp. When they advocate and fund parochial systems, they often do so at the expense of funding the acquisition and O&M for materiel that would provide the COCOMs with joint capabilities (that is, across Services). Service-centric budgeting is not a new condition; in fact, it was a problem described by General Maxwell Taylor in his 1960 book The Uncertain Trumpet. In this book, General Taylor describes the budget and strategy obstacles he faced in the Pentagon during the mid-and late 1950s.
Regarding the parochialism in the Services' approach to budgeting, he wrote, "We look at our forces horizontally when we think of combat functions, but we view them vertically in developing the defense budget." 
5
We propose a prioritized rating schema so that the Services' budget alignment with each COCOM's needs could be evaluated throughout the DOD budgeting process. In particular, we propose that the COCOMs score budget proposals using prioritized ratings to quantify the relative contribution of specific budget programs to the accomplishment of each COCOM's assigned military missions. These priority ratings would serve as quantitative evaluation criteria to be included during the PPBE process and would incentivize the Services to account for COCOM priorities in the annual Service budget submissions and deliberations.
Using the President's budget submission to Congress from the previous fiscal year as a baseline, each COCOM would provide COCOM-weighted priority ratings for the Service's RDT&E, PROC, and O&M. Anyone-in a Service, OSD, the Joint Staff, or Congress-could apply COCOM prioritized ratings to proposals in the next fiscal year's budget and assess the impact of individual or collective changes. For the sake of simplicity, RDT&E and PROC will be considered together as a composite category for acquisition (ACQ). ACQ scores are intended to give long-term preferences across years that are in a common complaint is that the Services are somewhat parochial (and arguably myopic) in constructing their budgets FORUM | Linking Budgets to Commander Priorities both the baseline budget and the budget being evaluated. Using ACQ as the sum of RDT&E and PROC better indicates the extent of the acquisition, and it allows the Service budget to adjust within years to account for cost, schedule, or performance issues. We contend that O&M gives a short-term evaluation, so we recommend limiting it to just the next fiscal year. We recommend using the exact same years in evaluating these measures in the baseline and new budget to avoid the impacts of production programs starting in the first year or terminating in the last year of the Future Years Development Program (FYDP). We also contend that evaluating these budget categories of acquisition (ACQ = RDT&E plus PROC) and O&M will highlight the linkages and disconnects between Service budgets with the programs (that is, forces or capabilities) required by the COCOMs to accomplish their assigned military missions. The other appropriation categories, including military personnel and military construction, will follow O&M and ACQ to align without requiring direct COCOM ratings.
In table 
1
This illustrates several points. First, each COCOM has a unique military mission assigned to it. Therefore, each of the COCOMs will prioritize Service programs differently according to their assigned military missions and perception of the likelihood and severity of future operations. The various priority ratings reflect their COCOM commanders' subjective assessments of the relative contribution of that Service's programs in accomplishing their current and future missions in either their assigned geographic area or functional responsibilities. A priority rating of zero indicates that the given Service's program does not contribute to that COCOM's mission. Hence, Service funding of unrated programs could change or even be eliminated without changing the COCOM's overall score. In this example, ships do not contribute to the first two COCOMs, and tanks do not contribute to the third COCOM. COCOMs would not be expected to score programs that indirectly support their mission, such as professional military education.
An intended consequence of this proposal is that the Services would be incentivized to reduce their indirect costs to an extent that did not affect the quality, and hence the ratings, of their operational units. The Services could burden the operational units with some indirect costs; however, these additional costs would make their operational units appear less efficient. Priority ratings of the same value indicate that programs support that COCOM equally; hence, funding could be moved between these programs without affecting that COCOM's overall score. Funds could be transferred between tank units and plane squadrons without changing the first or second COCOM overall score. Thus, COCOM priority ratings that do not vary much across the programs have little impact on the total scores when the Service budgets are modified. The third COCOM rated funding ships twice as valuable as plane squadrons, so every additional dollar to fund ships has twice the impact on the overall score as the same additional dollar allocated to plane squadrons. The more COCOM ratings vary across the programs, the more sensitive the overall score is to adjustments in the funding.
Let us examine how these priority ratings would be useful in evaluating a proposed alternative in the next budget cycle. Continuing the previous example, consider the alternative funding depicted in table 2. In this instance, a proposal to increase the funding for tank units from $2 billion to $4 billion changes the first COCOM's corresponding product to $4 billion times the priority rating of 1 for a score of 4, which is a 100 percent increase over the baseline score of 2. The decrease in funding for airplanes from $3 billion to $2 billion, with the first COCOM priority weight of 1, causes the product to decrease from the baseline of 3 to a value of 2. This proposed measure enables anyone knowing the COCOM's priority rating to calculate the resulting scores of either funding increases or decreases. The sum of both these funding changes for the first COCOM is an increase to a total score of 6, which is a 20 percent increase over the baseline value of 5. Similarly, the combined changes result in a total score increase of 20 percent for the second COCOM and a 23 percent decrease for the third COCOM.
The relative values, rather than the absolute values, of a particular COCOM's priority ratings are what matter. If the ratings are multiplied by a factor, the sum product is also multiplied by the same factor; however, the percentage change is not affected. In the first example depicted in table 1, the priority ratings of the second COCOM are simply a factor 0.5 times the first COCOM's ratings. Hence, the percent changes are the same, so if the evaluations are not concerned with the relative differences of support to different COCOMs, the the more COCOM ratings vary across the programs, the more sensitive the overall score is to adjustments in the funding GALLAGHER and TAYLOR total magnitude of the individual COCOM's ratings does not matter.
In a further refinement, OSD or the Joint Staff could implement this proposal to reflect specified preferences for the various COCOMs by requiring each COCOM's overall total score, the sum of the weighted funding, not to exceed an assigned limit. A lower limit would result in some combination of reduced individual ratings or reduced number of programs with an assigned weight; the result would be less assessed impact of Service budget changes. The Secretary of Defense could assign each COCOM its total prioritized dollar sum as an indication of a relative importance of that COCOM mission. For example, a geographic COCOM may be given a limit of twice the summed weighted program funding of a functional COCOM. Prescribed limits for the COCOMs' values would facilitate combining scores across COCOMs.
Decisionmakers in the PPBE process may determine that the aggregate impact to the third COCOM is too severe in the proposal in table 2. A revised funding alternative proposal is shown in table 
3

OSD or the Joint Staff could direct COCOMs to provide scores as proposed. However, the approach could also be implemented partially in at least three ways: â  â  Any Service could request the COCOMs to provide scores as part of the Service's internal POM preparations. OSD or the Joint Staff could also direct one of these partial implementations to test the value of this approach and work out the implementation details.
This budget scoring proposal has three intended main advantages: â  â  The proposal is simple, quantitative, fiscally constrained, and transparent; anyone throughout the budget process-including a Service developing its POM, OSD evaluating PBR alternatives, or Congress debating final law-may apply the approach and use the measures to evaluate a budget decision. First, this proposal is not complicated to understand, implement, or evaluate-the COCOM prioritized rating schema provides a clear, transparent, indisputable, quantitative indication of each COCOM's unique priorities over the vast range of Service programs. Since the COCOM ratings are confined to a baseline, such as the previous President's budget, the resulting measures are realistic. Given COCOM priorities, anyone may evaluate a proposed Service budget change and assess its impact to each of the COCOMs; these measures may influence decisions in the Services preparing their budget submissions, in PBR discussions among the Services, COCOMs, Joint Staff, and OSD, and in congressional debates and votes. The score may be evaluated for changes from a single program to many changes throughout the budget. These COCOM priority weightings would be useful in evaluating Service budget options throughout the PPBE and budget enactment processes.
Whereas current COCOM requirements (for example, as reflected in the COCOM IPLs) can reflect unconstrained or unrealistic demands, this proposal produces achievable indicators of demand since the COCOMs are bound within the collective Service budgets in the baseline. Funding exactly the baseline budget again would result in each COCOM achieving a 100 percent weighted score. Restricting the COCOM ratings within a DOD budget baseline, such as the President's budget submission, enforces that the rationale in the process at the expense of new and emerging joint military requirements cannot be indicated within this approach. Like the analogy to the marketplace, customers can only purchase what is for sale; however, producers are concerned about responding to customer demands to maintain future business.
Second, this budget scoring proposal would change the incentives and behavior among and within the Services. Within the Services, there are different communities (for example, major commands) that often compete for a larger portion of their Service's budget. This scoring system would likely shift the funding allocation toward programs that the various COCOMs rated as high priority. Program managers and unit commanders who want to maintain their funding would want to convince the COCOMs to rate their systems high. Presumably, the best way to advocate for COCOM support would be to deliver desired joint military capabilities. Hence, an expected benefit is increased dialogue between the Services and COCOMs regarding what the COCOMs really require and how the Services can meet these needs. Thus, the Services would be incentivized to add value as perceived by the COCOMs.
Moreover, this proposal would provide incentive to reduce indirect costs to the extent that they do not contribute to adding value to the COCOMs. The COCOM would not generally perceive value in indirect costs that the Services encounter to provide capabilities. Hence, a COCOM would be unlikely to give a priority rating to any indirect program. For example, we would not expect a COCOM to score professional military education or academic education. The Service would still want to continue education to the extent that it provides a perceived quality of its units to the COCOMs. The Services would have two choices: either fund these indirect costs separately, realizing that education is not going GALLAGHER and TAYLOR to be scored by the COCOMs, or add the "burden" for these costs into their operational units. However, as the costs and budgets of the operational units and programs increase, the COCOMs could perceive a decrease in the benefit relative to the cost and would likely reduce the priority ratings. Thus, whether the Services leave the indirect costs separate or incorporated into their budgets for operational units, they would be incentivized to minimize indirect costs that do not reflect in the quality, and hence, in COCOM priority ratings. Like corporations, Services would be motivated to control their indirect costs. Third, Services, not the COCOMs, retain acquisition responsibility and authority, so the Services' Title 10 responsibilities to organize, train, and equip remain intact. The Services maintain flexibility to address issues, such as program cost, schedule, and performance tradeoffs. The COCOMs retain their focus on accomplishing their assigned missions without getting involved in detailed acquisition programmatic issues.
There are three potential concerns regarding this budget scoring proposal: â  â  level of effort required for implementation â  â  ability for combatant commands to game the system â  â  ability of Services to game the system. First, this proposal requires a relatively small amount of overhead for either the COCOM or Services. Unlike their roles in developing IPLs or participating in the CPM process, the COCOMs do not have to identify or evaluate programmatic challenges. With JCIDS, IPLs, and CPMs, the COCOMs are already evaluating Service programs. This proposal would provide them a means, with little additional effort, to provide quantitative assessments. The ease of application and quantitative nature would likely make these inputs have more impact on PPBE and ACQ than the IPLs.
An additional aspect of this first concern is that, from inception, the COCOMs traditionally had a short-term focus on operations. Hence, the commanders and their staffs were not readily able to address or prioritize future acquisitions. With the increased role of COCOMs in the JCIDS requirement process, the COCOMs have created the equivalent of a J8 office to address future acquisition issues. Hence, while the COCOMs of the late 1980s would have difficulty implementing this approach, the COCOMs of today have offices that are already involved in decisions regarding future acquisition programs.
Second, COCOMs could attempt to game the program scores-for example, a COCOM commander could inject parochial bias into providing high priority weights for programs proposed by his own Service. Two aspects of transparency and impact mitigate this risk. First, these commanders would have to withstand scrutiny from OSD, the Joint Staff, and Congress. Their priority ratings should match their request for forces. After a few years of implementation, a significant departure from a predecessor's ratings would result in a call for justification. If scores lack credibility, they could be discounted with a default of returning to the current process. Second, high or low scores do not directly affect the Service programs. Favoring a particular group of programs with high scores does not necessarily increase those programs' funding. High scores from a COCOM would make the Service have to justify reduced funding; hence, the Services lose some flexibility from high scores. While low or zero scores allow programming flexibility, they would undermine any attempt to object about those programs being reduced. This double-edged sword of high ratings with operational support versus low ratings with budgeting flexibility would tend to enforce honest ratings.
Third, the Services could attempt to game this scoring system in a couple of ways. First, they could maintain acquisition scores by delaying programmatic funding to the out years of the FYDP. However, the unrealistic budget profiles for RDT&E or procurement profiles would be apparent to anyone reviewing the approach. Second, the Services could inflate their budget values; however, the COCOMs would likely reduce ratings on programs with apparent increased costs because they would not provide proportionally more benefits for the associated resources. A limit on total COCOM scores would further inhibit high scores for programs with inflated funding. The transparency and nonbinding approach of this proposed process result in little risk of testing this scheme.
Goldwater-Nichols legislation established the roles of the Services as materiel providers and COCOMs as materiel customers. Subsequent legislation provided COCOMs with direct input to the development of operational requirements. This proposal extends those legislative actions by providing a simple approach for the combatant commands to provide priority weights and quantitative scores to Service budgets. The net result would be the creation of a "market" where programs (vis-Ã -vis operational units) compete to initiate and maintain funding. The Services, COCOMs, Joint Staff, OSD, and Congress could use the COCOM program scores to validate RDT&E, PROC, and O&M funding and to evaluate potential changes in the development of the next budget. The COCOMs would be fiscally limited to recommend priorities within the existing Service budgets to ensure realistic requests. The Services, including their internal fiefdoms, would be incentivized to deliver capabilities that the COCOMs highly valued through scores to maintain their funding. The approach is compatible with all existing budget processes. The approach may be implemented, at least on a partial scale, by any COCOM, Service, the Joint Staff, or OSD. JFQ N O T E S 
uccessfully contending with the challenges of the 21 st -century environment requires an extensive overhaul of America's national security bureaucracy. In the executive branch, nearly every department has a strategy document citing the need for greater interagency cooperation, but little is being done to facilitate such efforts. Current authority, funding, and oversight structures reward independent stovepiped action rather than interdependent, whole-of-government approaches to national security issues. As a result, cooperation among executive agencies is generally a reactive phenomenon, resulting from a cobbled-together response to crisis, rather than a proactive application of all instruments of national power in a concerted effort to shape the environment in favor of U.S. interests. This article proposes a solution. Specifically, it provides a blueprint for an integrated, agile national security apparatus with the necessary authority, resources, and oversight to shape the environment and conduct efficient and effective crisis response operations.
Despite some minor adjustments, the core organizations and structure of the U.S. national security bureaucracy have remained largely unchanged since their establishment with the signing of the National Security Act of 1947. The system was designed to advance America's national interests, which are gener-ally defined as physical security, economic prosperity, value preservation at home, and value projection abroad. 
1
Today, while U.S. interests have not changed, the concept of security has evolved. According to a study from the Project on National Security Reform: HARNESSING AMERICA'S 
National security is the capacity of the United States to define, defend, and advance its position in a world characterized by turbulent forces of change. The objectives of national security include-(i) security from aggression against the nation by means of a national capacity to shape the strategic environment; to anticipate and prevent threats; to respond to attacks by defeating enemies; to recover from the effects of attack; and to sustain the costs of defense; (ii) security against massive societal disruption as a result of natural forces, including pandemics, natural disasters and climate change, and serious challenges to our national economic and financial systems; and (iii) security against the failure of major national infrastructure systems by means of building robust systems, defending them, and maintaining the capacity for recovering from damage. 
2
Although changes in the security landscape are often attributed to the transition from a bipolar to a multipolar world, it is perhaps more appropriate to associate today's challenges with the transition from the industrial to the information age. Stated another way, if the Soviet Union had not collapsed, America would likely still be dealing with the issues it faces as a direct result of globalization. Access to information has led to the erosion of borders and empowerment of individuals and nonstate organizations, including terrorists, organized criminals, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and multinational corporations. Competi-tion in an increasingly open global market has translated directly into rivalry for scarce energy resources and worldwide reliance on a fragile and vulnerable system of currency and capital flows. Numerous countries are facing demographic challenges, whether from aging populations with long-term care issues or bulging youth populations with limited employment opportunities. In addition, many governments in the developing world struggle to provide the most basic needs, such as food and water, to their citizens. Simply stated, today's environment is exponentially more complex than it was even 10 years ago-and the trend is likely to continue. The most important actors in this complex environment are human beings. Humans make unpredictable choices and as such are the greatest variable in any system. In the bipolar, industrial age world of 1947, there were far fewer human actors operating at the strategic level than there are in today's multipolar, information age world where nearly any individual with Internet access can spur an instant global crisis with the push of a button. Given this diverse array of challenges, it could be argued that America's "greatest vulnerability by far is linked to the legitimacy of our leadership" as we attempt to steward the international community through this new array of nontraditional security threats. 
3
Legitimate leadership requires smart application of all elements of national power. For many years, the acronym DIME (diplomatic, informational, military, and economic) has been used to describe the instruments of power. The names of the instruments point directly to the major executive branch actors in power application: State and DOD, as well as the Department of Commerce and intelligence agencies. It is now clear that "the day is past when a single government agency or organization-even one as large as the DOD-can manage a key foreign policy issue." 
4
One of the most important additions to this new acronym is the letter L. Americans take great pride that their nation is governed by the rule of law: "Our past, and the past of every other nation, tells us that law and war were opposites, two means to resolve differences, one guided by commonly agreed-upon standards of justice, the other resolved by the calculus of power." 
5
6
Another important addition to this acronym is the D for development. The U.S. Agency for International Development has played an integral role in advancing America's soft power image since its foundation in 1961. Despite the agency's numerous contributions to furthering U.S. interests, until recently it was rarely included in U.S. foreign policy dialogue. However, in the past year, the Secretaries of State and Defense have both renewed the U.S. commitment to the role of development by making it part of their 3D (diplomacy, development, and defense) approach to foreign policy. If American leaders wish to shape today's environment, then development is, without question, a key instrument of national security power.
Despite the desire for a proactive, wholeof-government approach to U.S. national security policy, the bureaucracy continues to operate in a reactive, responsive mode. As David Rothkopf noted:
Despite the best efforts of many national security advisors, efforts to establish strategic planning sections within the NSC [National Security Council] have typically faltered. The result is that the general state of mind within this critical institution is one of constant, frenzied reaction. Planning seems not only a luxury, but almost a dereliction of duty given the pressures of the moment. This would be dangerous under any circumstances but it is worse in the absence of basic marching orders of the sort that existed during the Cold War. Leaders must make a commitment to breaking this cycle.

Authority. In the current system, there are two entities in the bureaucracy with the authority to direct interagency efforts: the Chief of Mission (COM) and the Assistant to the President for National Security, more commonly referred to as the National Security Advisor (NSA). Per the Foreign Service Act of 1980, the COM is defined as the "principal officer in charge of a diplomatic mission of the United States or of a United States office abroad which is designated by the Secretary of State as diplomatic in nature, including any individual assigned under section 502(c) to be temporarily in charge of such a mission or office."

There is one executive department that has the all-important middle or operational level of both planning and implementation resources built into its structure: DOD. Organized around regional combatant commands, it is uniquely suited to deal with many of these issues. In U.S. Africa Command's 2010 Posture Statement, General William Ward did an excellent job stating the case for this missing regional link in the U.S. national security bureaucracy:
Regional cooperation is critical, whether it be neighboring countries working together against mutual threats, or region-wide efforts to establish common security networks, such as the [African Union's] cooperative security architecture. Our approach focuses on mutual interests, fostering interoperability and common situational awareness, regionally-oriented capacity building, and enhancing relationships built on trust and cooperation. The more the countries of Africa work together, the greater the likelihood that the continent will achieve lasting stability.

We have seen a trend toward using the DOD's Regional Combatant Commands as platforms for coordinating regional activities of not only the U.S. military but U.S. civilian agencies. This trend is most apparent in the cases of U.S. Southern Command and the new U.S. Africa Command. Both Commands are envisioned as having a "shaping" rather than warfighting mission. Their goal is to lead U.S. government efforts in ameliorating the sources of conflict and instability in their regions.

Funding. Competition among various executive agencies for an increasingly limited slice of the budget pie fosters independent, rather than integrated, approaches to solving national security challenges. In "Turning Ideas into Action," the Project on National Security Reform clearly defined the problem: "In the current system, funding is distributed program by program, department by department. In theory, this is designed to produce desired mission outcomes. In practice, however, the process focuses on means rather than ends and relies on policy entrepreneurs within the interagency space to work around the bureaucratic impediments to achieve successful mission outcomes."

appropriate for Cold War policies, it is not an effective way to confront 21 st -century issues, and it is certainly not conducive to a whole-ofgovernment, environment-shaping approach to national security policy.

To solve this issue, the incentives must change: "According to budgeting experts, the effective allocation of resources is the single greatest determinant of successful policy execution."

Oversight. Every executive department and agency that receives congressional funding must also answer to Congress. Unfortunately, the current committee structures in the legislative branch foster a stovepiped approach to business in the executive. Each department and agency answers to a different committee or committees, reporting on individual actions and use of allocated resources. No single committee in either the House or Senate has a holistic view of U.S. national security aims. As a result, "little deliberate and regular assessment of policy outcomes occurs, making it difficult to achieve the feedback required to alter flawed strategies, remedy resource shortfalls or build on initial successes. This situation also makes it difficult to hold people accountable for failures or to reward superior performance."

subcommittees-a number that has grown in the past seven years, despite the 9/11 Commission's recommendation to consolidate those tangled lines of authority." 
33
By examining the weaknesses and strengths in the current system, we can develop a sound model for reform. Weaknesses include the lack of an authorized interagency leader between the COM and NSA levels, and a stovepiped approach to funding and oversight that promotes individual agency successes rather than overall national security goals. Strength lies in unity of effort and command at the strategic level with the regional combatant command approach to engagement and partnership-building.
Meanwhile, today's environment demands collective regional and multilateral approaches to solve the major security challenges faced by the community of nations. The sum of this analysis lends itself to the following conclusion: the United States must develop a civilian-led interagency structure with the authority, funding, and oversight to act at the regional level.
Regional, civilian-led (Presidential appointees confirmed by the Senate), interagency bureaus charged with applying all U.S. instruments of power, including military, within their geographic area would solve many of the problems with the current system. First, the bureaus would free up the NSA and NSC to focus on national-level strategy. In the current system, the NSA and NSC must coordinate day-to-day interagency operations for everything above the COM level. Regional interagency bureaus could handle most if not all of these duties, including normal shaping and engagement as well as crisis response. Cross-region issues may still require arbitration at the national level, but it would be arbitration with a few highlevel commanders rather than numerous agencies. Second, regional bureaus would require a new method of budgeting. Each region chief would submit a national security budget for his area of responsibility, outlining a holistic view of regional resource application to implement the overall national security strategy. This system would also provide an improved opportunity for congressional insight on the overall execution of national security strategy.
Implementing this proposal ensures execution of NSC-level decisions through a unified interagency regional command, providing the foundation for unity of effort and a whole-of-government approach on all issues. Simply establishing such a common organizational structure familiar to all participating agencies would likely yield a more efficient process-one in which success would become more dependent on sound policy than the ability of select individuals to overcome institutional parochialism while navigating a maze of bureaucracies.
Specific proposals include that Congress should: â  â  mandate alignment of foreign policy actors under regional bureaus (grant regional bureaus authority to execute, as directed by the President, all foreign policy actions within geographic boundaries; and direct agencies to assume force provider functions for regional bureaus) â  â  streamline funding of foreign policy by moving execution funding from individual agencies under various authorities to regional bureaus under a single authority for each region â  â  mandate OMB-NSC collaboration to ensure continuity of resource-policy discussions from administration to administration 34 â  â  reorganize congressional committee structures to ensure proper funding and oversight of regional national security bureaus â  â  mandate professional interagency education and interagency career paths as milestones/promotion requisites for both military and civilian personnel. Also, the President should: â  â  direct the NSC to develop a staffing plan for each regional bureau. Every region, with the exception of North America, should have the same organizational structure. The structure for the North American region requires unique features due to homeland legal issues.
â  â  direct executive departments to dissolve all regional planning and implementation staffs and work with regional bureaus to integrate former department-level functions in the newly established interagency regional bureaus â  â  direct NSC to focus on national grand strategy and the regional bureaus to conduct day-to-day implementation of strategy and crisis response within regions â  â  establish permanent OMB-NSC coordination office on NSC staff responsible for oversight of funding for regional interagency commands.
Critics of such drastic reform would likely point to several areas of concern, including increased size of the bureaucracy, diluted authority for COMs, blurring of the military chain of command, and unsuitability of this model to the homeland security mission. Each of these criticisms deserves further explanation. First, this initiative would decrease the overall size of the bureaucracy and make it more integrated and agile. The proposal combines the regional bureaus at the Department of State, DOD, and regional combatant commands, as well as the regional staffs at the NSC. Other agencies or departments, such as some of the military Services, could shed regional staffs as well. Placing regional staffs from disparate agencies in the same room and on the same team will decrease duplication of effort and free up resources.
Critics contend this initiative would dilute the authority of the COM. On the contrary, that authority would not change. The COM would remain the President's representative on the scene and maintain the authority for all interagency activities within the appointed area. No longer will the COM need to report to a regional bureau at the State Department, coordinate interagency issues with various Washington-based agencies, or appeal to the NSC for arbitration of conflicts. Instead, the COM can handle those issues with one phone call to the respective regional interagency chief.
The potential to blur the military chain of command is another concern with this reform. The current chain of command flows placing regional staffs from disparate agencies in the same room and on the same team will decrease duplication of effort and free up resources
from the President to the Secretary of Defense to the regional combatant commander. This reform advocates a chain of command from the President to the regional interagency chief to the regional combatant commander, a linkage that maintains civilian control of the military and does not unnecessarily lengthen the chain of command. The Secretary of Defense would still advise the President. Additionally, this structure would likely increase the chance of success because the interagency chief in charge of U.S. strategy for the region would direct the application of military force. For example, such ownership would likely increase interagency involvement in postconflict planning and improve its quality. Finally, some may argue this model is not adaptable to the U.S. Northern Command region and homeland security mission. This criticism fails to recognize the connection between national security and homeland security, which are, in the age of globalized terror, one and the same. Unique legal aspects and coordination issues of homeland defense must be addressed, but those cannot be impediments to implementing the overall regional interagency system proposed in this article.
This article offers a proposal to restructure the U.S. national security bureaucracy to achieve the tasks our nation has so eloquently outlined on paper but has yet to implement. In the current system, the "basic deficiency is that parochial departmental and agency interests, reinforced by Congress, paralyze the interagency cooperation even as the variety, speed, and complexity of emerging security issues prevent the White House from effectively controlling the system."

interests. The only real choice is clear: the United States must transform the national security bureaucracy to confront today's security challenges.
Change in any organization is difficult, but it is even more so in the politically charged environment of Washington, DC. Reform requires a bipartisan effort as well as congressional and executive leadership. According to the 2010 U.S. National Security Strategy, "Our long-term security will come not from our ability to instill fear in other peoples, but through our capacity to speak to their hopes."

eterrence is back. Although the Cold War concept lost its centrality in security policy for many years, the United States embraced a modified version of it in its 2006 and 2010 National Security Strategies.

FORUM | The Limits of Tailored Deterrence operations concepts. Consequently, tailored deterrence neglects some of the most important elements of contemporary deterrence theory, including the uncertainty and cognitive biases inherent both to intelligence assessments and to international relations.
While deterrence remains relevant, the U.S. objective to "decisively influence the adversary's decision-making calculus" 2 overstates tailored deterrence's potential and does not adequately acknowledge its shortfalls. The U.S. approach to tailored deterrence is flawed because of its reliance on two erroneous assumptions: that the Nation can reliably assess an adversary's decision calculus, and that it can decisively influence an adversary's choices. The United States must recognize that deterrence is a blunt instrument, not a scalpel, and modify its deterrence strategies accordingly.
The persistent popularity of deterrence can largely be attributed to its apparent simplicity. It is not difficult to understand the concept of intimidating or otherwise convincing an adversary not to take an action. DOD defines deterrence as "prevention from action by fear of the consequences. Deterrence is a state of mind brought about by the existence of a credible threat of unacceptable counteraction."

Empirical analysis, most famously Alexander George and Robert Smoke's 1974 Deterrence in American Foreign Policy, found that the history of conventional deterrence failures did not support the predictions of second-wave theory. Even when the theoretical conditions for success (that is, commitment, communication, and a credible threat) were met, deterrence often failed in the real world.

Deterrence theory continued to evolve in concept and application as theorists and strategists reframed their views to reflect significant world events. The end of the Cold War shifted attention from the Soviet Union to deterring rogue states; the 9/11 attacks stimulated more discussion of deterring nonstate actors and their sponsors. Ultimately, the United States sought an approach that would apply to the entire spectrum of challenges.
President George W. Bush's administration introduced the term tailored deterrence into U.S. national policy documents in 2006 with the release of the administration's second National Security Strategy (NSS) and Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). These documents represented a major shift in national security policy, as President Bush's 2002 NSS had downplayed the effectiveness of deterrence and advocated preventive war to remove threats from rogue states. 
29
30
The Obama administration appears to have continued the Bush-era tailored deterrence policy unaltered. The 2010 NSS and QDR discuss tailored deterrence in much the same terms as their 2006 predecessors. 
31
Such tailoring requires an in-depth understanding of the capabilities, values, intent, and decision making of potential adversaries, whether they are individuals, networks, or states. Deterrence also depends on integrating all aspects of national power."

What Theory Drives the Practice? The DO-JOC approach to tailored deterrence-"credibly threatening to deny benefits and/or impose costs while encouraging restraint" 
42
43
Nevertheless, tailored deterrence largely ignores some of the most important elements of third-wave theory. The DO-JOC pays little attention to psychological factors that undermine deterrence, including cognitive barriers to perception and decisionmaking. The DO-JOC acknowledges and discusses several areas of uncertainty, but presents these ambiguities as solvable problems rather than inescapable fog and friction. The DO-JOC's language indicates that tailored deterrence owes more to the deterministic concepts of effects-based operations than it does to the more Clausewitzian cautions of third-wave deterrence theory.
Although effects-based operations concepts were never fully incorporated into joint doctrine, two elements that were absorbed-effects and systems perspective-had a profound impact on tailored deterrence. First, the DO-JOC states that deterrence planning must include identifying what effects the United States desires to have on an adversary's decision calculus.

49
Tailored deterrence requires that the United States understand each adversary's decision calculus with a high level of certainty in order to design deterrent actions that will achieve decisive influence over adversaries' choices. However, tailored deterrence's assumptions oversimplify the basis on which people make decisions. People make choices based in part on their perceptions of expected utility, but they are also influenced by other factors, including their personal perspectives and cognitive biases. Many of these factors are enigmatic even to the actors themselves, making the decision calculus exceptionally difficult to assess and leaving adversaries' choices largely unpredictable.
History provides many examples of deterrence failures in which the defender misunderstood the adversary's decision calculus and was therefore surprised by an "irrational" action. Keith Payne cites the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, China's entry into the Korean War, and the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba as examples in which U.S. estimates of the adversary decision calculus predicted the opposite outcome. 
50
51
However, the deterrence failures listed above cannot be attributed to irrationality. As Keith Payne observed, there is an often unappreciated difference between rational and reasonable decisionmaking. 
52
53
The Adversary's Perspective. Opposing leaders frequently see the world uniquely because of the large differences in the leaders' individual expectations and beliefs. Cognitive psychology shows that all people develop unique belief systems, or schemata, based on their experiences, to help organize and interpret information. These schemata are necessary to functioning in a complex world, but they also "constrain and condition how and what leaders perceive."

67
The U.S. assumption that it can decisively influence an adversary's choices is the second flaw in tailored deterrence. This assumption is erroneous for three reasons. First, misperceptions and biases limit an actor's ability to send effective deterrent messages. Second, adversaries are similarly LARKIN constrained in their understanding of such signals. Third, tailored deterrence campaigns are limited by a lack of interagency unity of effort and inescapable friction in execution. These limitations suggest that only the most overt, overwhelming, and credible deterrent threats have utility, while attempts to deter gradually via precise messages are often misguided.
Challenge of Sending Effective Deterrent Messages. In addition to difficulties in understanding an adversary's decision calculus, a deterring actor is constrained by biases that accompany attempts to influence others. The egocentric bias leads people to overestimate their influence over others and to see cause-and-effect linkages that do not exist. This tendency can cause policymakers to perceive an adversary's behavior as targeted toward them or to presume that the adversary's behavior was caused by the policymaker's previous actions.

Since adversaries' beliefs are resistant to change, it follows that adversaries' perceptions of credibility and interests are dominant factors in deterrence outcomes. First, deterrence signals cannot create credibility that does not exist in the mind of the adversary. Unambiguous scenarios where survival interests are at stake, such as the superpowers' defense of their homelands during the Cold War, provide clarity that reduces the chance of misperception. 
80
Second, carefully crafted deterrence messages cannot balance an inherent asymmetry of interests. The United States and South Korea have apparently deterred a second North Korean invasion since 1953, but have been unable to deter Pyongyang from building nuclear weapons or conducting deadly attacks on South Korean forces. Despite the substantial U.S. commitment to preventing all three scenarios, North Korea clearly possessed a much greater interest in acquiring a nuclear deterrent and in manufacturing crises.
Limitations of the Whole-of-Government Approach. Even when making a clear and credible commitment, tailored deterrence requires a coherent effort that integrates all elements of national power to implement a national deterrence strategy. In 2009, thencommander of USSTRATCOM, General Kevin Chilton, called for an innovative process "to consider and include interagency deterrence courses of action, to make wholeof-government decisions on what courses of action to implement, and to coordinate their execution upon selection." 81 Yet the U.S. Government's structure and bureaucratic friction ensure that the DO-JOC's vision of day-to-day, interagency deterrence campaigns will go largely unrealized. Only the highest priority issues and crises will garner a robust interagency response.
For example, the State Department would play a vital role in any interagency deterrence effort, given its primacy in diplomacy and the DOD objective of influencing adversaries' political decisions. Yet the State Department does not appear to share the military's view of tailored deterrence. State Department officials are more likely to view deterrence as intrinsic to the broad and to change a person's attitude, new information must overcome many layers of subconscious defenses
The Limits of Tailored Deterrence continuous process of diplomatic engagement rather than as an isolated campaign. The Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review (QDDR) does not discuss tailored deterrence, and the State Department's other public statements on deterrence focus on narrower issues such as nuclear proliferation and arms control. 
82
84
85
After reaching an interagency compromise on a deterrence course of action, the United States will also encounter friction in execution. Orders to perform specific deterrence actions may be misunderstood by subordinates or executed differently than expected, garbling the intended deterrence signals. 
86
Tailored deterrence is flawed because of its erroneous assumptions that the United States can reliably assess an adversary's decision calculus and decisively influence adversary choices. Nevertheless, deterrence remains an indispensable tool of U.S. national security policy since not all potential threats can or should be preempted. The United States should modify tailored deterrence to reflect third-wave theory in order to provide policymakers with realistic deterrence options instead of panaceas. These modifications should include accepting ambiguity, recognizing the importance of an adversary's interests, and replacing hubris with humility.
Third-wave deterrence theory and innumerable case studies demonstrate that an adversary's decision calculus will remain largely opaque regardless of the extent of the intelligence collection effort. Ubiquitous cognitive biases frequently frustrate accurate assessments and also shape adversary perceptions of their environment in idiosyncratic and often unknowable ways. Tailored deterrence should accept this irreducible uncertainty as a limitation rather than assuming that ambiguity can be removed from the equation. This intrinsic ambiguity could be tamed to a certain extent through such methods as red teaming, psychological profiling of adversary leaders, developing multiple decision calculus models, and analyzing many potential courses of adversary action. Yet the Nation should not be overly surprised when an adversary fails to follow the script. Tailored deterrence's deterministic and effects-based foundation implies that deterrence applies in nearly all situations. However, the U.S. approach should accept that large asymmetries of interests are common in international relations and that such disparities can render deterrence irrelevant. Schelling's "threat that leaves something to chance"-the fear of nuclear escalation that overshadowed Cold War confrontations-is not credible when an adversary's actions are on the low end of the conflict spectrum and U.S. survival interests are not at stake. American attempts to sway adversaries from pursuing their interests are only credible when the United States has a commensurate interest in the status quo and when the situation is unambiguous.
Deterrent strategies have the most utility when an adversary's pondered action is an unambiguous and attributable affront to vital U.S. interests rather than an action on the margins. In such unambiguous scenarios, threats to deny benefits and impose costs should be simple, overt, and overwhelming. Deterrence by subtlety is vulnerable to misperception and betrays an egocentric bias and overconfidence that the adversary is both able and willing to decode and respond to the faintest U.S. signals.
Finally, tailored deterrence and its practitioners require humility rather than hubris. A more realistic approach would acknowledge that adversaries cannot be imagined as inert, closed systems vulnerable to decisive influence. Instead, deterrence campaigns will be based on a vague understanding of an adversary's decisionmaking process and motives. Given these uncertainties, deterrent actions will be blunt instruments that are subject to friction and misperception, and their true influence on an adversary's choices will normally remain unknown. Such a recalibrated approach reflects the reality that the United States can influence world events, but cannot dictate them. JFQ N O T E S NATO must accelerate efforts to respond to the danger of cyber attacks by protecting its own communications and command systems, helping Allies to improve their ability to prevent and recover from attacks, and developing an array of cyber defence capabilities aimed at effective detection and deterrence.

Almost everything in this tiny nation, which gave birth to Skype, is done over computer networks and by use of mobile devices.

Unfortunately, this ubiquitous Internet dependence has brought not only technological freedom but also various defense and security risks. The national security of Estonia was threatened in April 2007 when a near-catastrophic botnet struck almost the entire electronic infrastructure of Estonia. Never before had an entire country been a digital target and the government forced to defend its population and commerce in cyber war. All that Estonian information technology (IT) managers could do was block the international connections to the servers, which was akin to a modern blockade of a country without the concomitant deployment of any conventional weapons.
Coincidentally, during the same time, three world-renowned IT experts were visiting Estonia, and they assisted the Estonian Computer Emergency Response Team with defenses against ping attacks, botnets, and hackers.

The cyber incident with Estonia was a wake-up call for the Alliance. After an all-inclusive evaluation of its cyber defense capabilities, in May 2008 Estonia, Italy, Spain, Slovakia, Germany, Lithuania, Latvia, and the Allied Command Transformation signed a memorandum of understanding for the establishment of a Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in the Estonian capital, Tallinn.

Since its establishment, the CCDCOE has worked vigorously to educate its members on cyber security issues and has already organized several cyber defense conferences. In June 2009, it sponsored the first international Conference on Cyber Warfare, where speakers from 13 countries delivered 29 cyber warfare presentations. During the 3-day event, besides various other subjects, participants received analysis on China's intelligence collection network, GhostNet, which had infiltrated high-level computers in more than 100 countries, including an unclassified Estonian president meets with Secretary-General at NATO Headquarters NATO SPECIAL FEATURE | Cyber Window into the Future of NATO computer at NATO headquarters;

Various security problems can be solved and offensive strategies created by hiring capable and seasoned programmers. In 2007, Estonia was extremely lucky in finding three highly experienced IT talents in country who were ready to apply their efforts on Estonia's behalf, but in reality many companies and countries do not have such experts sitting around to protect their servers. Therefore, security issues have to be tackled long before they become dangerous, and explicit procedures for dealing with consequences must be defined. In brief, we need an internationally accepted body of principles and rules to govern cyber affairs and conflicts-cyberspace's very own ex ante and ex post regulations. Global policies and laws are lagging decades behind the fast-advancing technologies. As the director of the CCDCOE, Colonel Ilmar Tamm, has noted, "Even if some means to secure the cyber domain are technologically feasible, we are limited by laws and policies."

32
For NATO, it does not matter if the theater of operations is cyberspace or conventional terrain; the success of operations still depends on the asymmetry of information. Meanwhile, preservation of international security in the nonvirtual world sometimes necessitates offensive strategies for avoiding extensive collateral damage in the long run; on the other hand, achieving security in the cyber world often entails more defense strategies because presently tracking down the dynamic IP addresses and retaliating appropriately are more complicated processes than well-prepared cyber deterrence. To advance members' cyber defense capabilities, in May 2010, the CCDCOE, together with the NCIRC, organized the 13 th NATO Cyber Defence Workshop and in October 2010, it co-hosted with Allied Command Transformation a workshop called NATO in the Cyber Commons, which was strictly aimed at identifying the Alliance's vulnerabilities and developing relevant capabilities. 
33
The CCDCOE emphasizes the need for collaboration in research between various military and civilian entities. On November 3, 2009, the Centre signed a 3-year research cooperation agreement with one of Northern Europe's leading financial groups, SEB (Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken), to explore the best practices of information-securing in the private sector,

Almost everything in our electronic infrastructure is a dual-use technology that has applications for military operations as well as for civilian tasks like operating systems, security software, and networking protocols. Many commercial applications and interfaces were originally developed under defense research, including the Internet. It is cost-effective and profitable to develop dual-use technologies because demand in the military market is much smaller than in the commercial market.
In cyberspace, the most imperative dual-use technologies are products based on cryptography. It has become increasingly obvious that the protection of critical infrastructures necessitates strong encryption capabilities.

weaknesses of special operations. Although Stuxnet may be judged a tactical success but a strategic failure, it serves a pioneering purpose and holds the door open for the serious consideration of cyber attack as an instrument of strategy and policy.
Cyberpower has been steadily growing in prominence over the past decade, but for the most part it seemed to offer only a limited toolset to strategists. Danny Steed in a recent article suggests that it can be used as a tool or otherwise elicit effects in five different ways. First, it can be a potent tool of intelligence, affecting the scope of and speed with which information can be gathered. Second, it greatly optimizes the use of one's own hard power-the foundation of Western military prowess. Conversely, the third use of cyberpower can disrupt the network that underpins the enemy's hard power. Fourth is a greatly expanded conception of the third use: direct cyber attack on national infrastructure, as seen in Estonia in 2007 and Georgia a year later. Finally, it may have significant impact on morale, particularly on the home front, as casualties and accidents are typically made known, either by the media or the government, with a celerity that far outstrips the achievement of tactical success, let alone strategic success. However, there are two important military applications that the Steed analysis claims that cyberpower cannot do. First, it cannot directly cause corporeal harm, either to human beings or to their physical creations. Second, it cannot occupy actual terrain. Ultimately, the analysis concludes that "cyberpower will never coerce in the way that sheer physical force can do."

Its physical effect was significant: 1,000 centrifuges were destroyed, out of a total of 9,000 at Natanz, but Iran has been estimated to have only stockpiled the material to build 12,000 to 15,000 centrifuges. Nine thousand are deployed at Natanz, and 2,000 are broken either through routine operation or by Stuxnet-and with no easy chance for Iran to avoid international economic sanctions.

Special operations expert James Kiras has explored the relationship between special operations and strategy, arguing that "the root of strategically effective special operations is an appreciation for how special operations forces perform in extended campaigns by inflicting moral and material attrition in conjunction with conventional forces." He goes on to define special operations as "unconventional actions against enemy vulnerabilities in a sustained campaign, undertaken by specially designated units, to enable conventional operations and/or resolve economically politico-military problems at the operational or strategic level that are difficult or impossible to accomplish with conventional forces alone." As one of his concluding thoughts, he suggests ultimately that "at the strategic level, however, special operations are less about an epic Homeric raid than they are about the combined effects of disparate unorthodox activities in the ebb and flow of a campaign or series of campaigns."

SPECIAL FEATURE | Stuxnet and Strategy core capabilities and tradecraft, including the use of multiple zero-day exploits, render it more of a Frankenstein patchwork of existing tradecraft, code, and best practices drawn from the global cyber-crime community than the likely product of a dedicated, autonomous, advanced research programme or 'skunk works.'" 
7
The essential requirement of special operations, however, is that they augment other, more conventional efforts. Special operations acting entirely on their own rarely achieve a significant level of effect if their target can devote all his resources to countering and mitigating the results of any given special operation. However, working alongside conventional military operations is not the only context in which special operations could have considerable effect; conditions suitable for special operations can be manufactured. Writing about the Arab Revolt of World War I, T.E. Lawrence suggested that "the death of a Turkish bridge or train, machine or gun or charge of high explosive, was more profitable to us than the death of a Turk."

In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1929 to adopt a fourth round of sanctions against Iran and the toughest multilateral sanctions yet designed to inhibit the development of the Iranian nuclear program. Beyond this, the United States and the European Union have also imposed further unilateral sanctions. Despite the nay-saying of the Russians, the sanctions are slowly having an effect, both on the Iranian nuclear program and Iranian society at large, although neither is at the breaking point. Resolution 1929 represents the culmination of a long-term sanctioning campaign against Iran, a campaign that has steadily decreased Iran's options for the procurement of necessary materials for its nuclear program and that has also, to varying extents, cut into Iran's ability to function economically, both internally and externally, with other states. For example, IranAir is losing gasoline contracts and finding itself unable to refuel in certain countries, and ships belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines are unwelcome in many ports. It is difficult for Iran to acquire either more uranium or more materials required for its current generation of centrifuges. The major hub of Iranian smuggling is currently Asia, but many of Asia's major ports belong to American allies, adding to Iranian difficulties. As already noted, the Iranians are estimated to have the materials for only about 12,000-15,000 of their IR-1 centrifuges. Eleven thousand have been deployed, of which 2,000 have been broken through routine use or by Stuxnet. Iran's cushion against accident or hostile action is becoming increasingly thin as a result of its inability to procure materials for more IR-1 centrifuges. It is currently developing next-generation centrifuges, the IR-2 and IR-4, the latter of which requires additional material, but these have yet to be deployed beyond limited testing. These new generations are expected to increase enrichment efficiency significantly, allowing for fewer centrifuges to achieve the same enrichment rates as the many thousands Iran currently has deployed. For any actor concerned with delaying the Iranian nuclear program and feeling that sanctions were not taking effect quickly enough, the time to strike covertly had to be before the new centrifuges were introduced en masse.
Conventional means are clearly inadequate against the Iranian nuclear program. The dispersal of existing plants, their locations within mountains and other difficult terrain, and secrecy surrounding planned facilities all prevent an easy military response such as the Israeli attacks on Osirak and the alleged Syrian reactor in 2007. Sanctions have not yet had sufficient effect to dissuade the Iranians, and quite plausibly will not, as long as the Iranian political calculus remains steadfast and finds sufficient attraction to and utility in its chosen course. The Iranians view diplomacy as a method of keeping the international community at bay rather than a way to resolve the situation in an agreeably Western manner. A special operations strike of some sort was clearly necessary if one's goal was the delay of the nuclear program, but the very character of that program also precludes easy destruction by a limited number of operatives. A cyberstrike must have been much more compelling as an option. Stuxnet's abilities to self-replicate, quickly proliferate across systems, and disguise its presence until activated all indicate that it was specifically Computer circuit board newjestic.com MILEVSKI designed to counter the security measures put in place to prevent a conventional or unconventional attack on the Iranian nuclear program. All three characteristics were necessary to approach and infect the relevant computers and damage a portion of the centrifuges at Natanz. There could have been no other sure way for Stuxnet to have jumped the air gap between the wider Internet and computers at Iranian nuclear facilities without self-replicating and proliferating wildly across computers and onto USB sticks and other portable data transfer devices, and hiding its presence until it reached precisely the computers it had been coded to infect and control.
Martin Libicki, an expert on cyberpower, argues that cyber war is ultimately about confidence, particularly confidence in the systems being attacked. He suggests that any cyber attack must of necessity have two fundamental bases: "(1) the exposure of target systems to the rest of the world, coupled with (2) flaws in such systems which are then exploited." 
9
The vulnerabilities that attacks like Stuxnet exploit are one of the major factors that distinguish them from more conventional cyber attacks such as the sustained distributed denial-of-service assault on Estonian cyber infrastructure in 2007. Kiras warns that special operations forces "conduct missions of strategic importance, yet exist in finite quantities, and must therefore be used wisely." 
10
11
Ultimately, the question of when to exploit a cyber vulnerability is answered by human judgment. Judgment is also required concerning when to protect against a known flaw. Other cyber actors may detect one while fixing a previously unknown flaw and decide quickly to exploit the defect before the patch proliferates and destroys their chances of capitalizing on it. A defender may be so confident in his defenses-such as an air gap-that he neglects basic security on the machines behind that gap, with the result that already known and fixed vulnerabilities may yet be available for exploitation. Software firms may also be lazy or duplicitous about addressing vulnerabilities in their own software.
An inability to find the flaw allowing cyber attacks or to perceive that a cyber attack is actually under way-as with Stuxnet, which took control of the feedback systems to inform those monitoring the centrifuges that everything was normal even as it was tearing 1,000 of them apart-also allows vulnerabilities to last longer than in ideal theoretical conditions. Some known vulnerabilities have persisted for years, across multiple generations of software, without being addressed. Others are exterminated immediately upon discovery. The individual organizational or communal culture frequently determines the alacrity with which flaws are fixed.
One of the major fears that has yet to be borne out from the Stuxnet attack is the possibility that it could serve as a blueprint for others for their own cyber attacks, potentially including those hostile to the West. This seems unlikely if Stuxnet really is the digital equivalent of a special operation, for special operations are immensely context-dependent. As Colin Gray notes, "Findings on the conditions for the success or failure of special operations cannot sensibly be presented as a formula, a kind of strategist's cookbook." 
12
Special forces are "military assets designed and trained to conduct tactical actions delivering strategic outcome out of proportion with their size and that if conducted by conventional units may have disproportionate negative impact on policy." 
13
The disproportionate effect is simultaneously both confirmed and doubtful. Stuxnet destroyed 1,000 centrifuges, but it could not remove from operation the remaining 8,000 at the Natanz facility. For a program, however malicious, ultimately to achieve that level of physical destruction of infrastructure, even if only as a second-order effect, is disproportionate considering how inexpensive such an attack is compared to other, less attractive policy options. Importantly, however, Iranian production of lightly enriched uranium did not drop; it actually increased somewhat during the period it was affected by Stuxnet as the Iranian nuclear facilities improved their efficiency-although clearly it did not increase as much as it could have, had the damage not been done. Furthermore, Iran was able to replace the lost centrifuges, and it still maintains a buffer of materials remaining to build additional IR-1 centrifuges as necessary. This remainder may be sufficient for only 1,000 more, or possibly up to 4,000 more, and Iranian smuggling efforts may increase these numbers. It is unknown whether those responsible for Stuxnet are heartened by their success, or are frustrated by having failed to destroy more, but either reaction may motivate further attacks. Regardless of motive, further attacks would be necessary to affect the Iranian nuclear program significantly; as long as they can replace centrifuges, lost centrifuges only represent relatively minor time lost to the Iranians. Another cyber attack, however, will undoubtedly be expected, and the Iranians are on guard. Surprise, the best ally of special operations, is now missing.
The Stuxnet malware, in the context of international sanctions, ultimately has not affected Iranian political will to a sovereign nuclear program or Iranian capabilities sufficiently that their goal cannot be pursued regardless of intent. What would a strategically successful Stuxnet look like? That sort of attack would have to be destructive enough to at least leave a permanent mark on Iranian capabilities by overwhelming the material redundancy available to their nuclear programs. It would also have to be able to overcome increased Iranian nuclear efficiencies.
Such success may be possible, since malware such as Stuxnet has one significant advantage over physical special operations: unlike actual people, a program can be in multiple places at once-hundreds of thousands, millions, or more-if necessary. It should be possible to attack multiple specified targets with a single virus exploiting a set of vulnerabilities common to all targets-that is, compress a special operations campaign in time to orchestrate a massive attack in parallel, rather than a sequence of missions. Stuxnet may even have been designed to achieve this, too. Iran has admitted that Stuxnet found its way into their Bushehr nuclear power plant and, in early 2011, nearly 170 fuel rods had to be removed from the reactor soon after inserting them-an occurrence not unheard of elsewhere in the world, but hardly frequent. Some have speculated on the existence of a link between Stuxnet's infiltration of the Bushehr facility and its recent troubles. Whether or not Stuxnet had an effect on Bushehr is irrelevant: the potential for attacks in parallel has already been noted.
Yet not having achieved the necessary level of success at Natanz is not surprising. Any sort of friction could have intruded upon Stuxnet's infection and control of Natanz enrichment facilities, and solitary special operations rarely have such decisive effect on their own, although "solitary" may not gel well in possible future cases of a massively parallel assault on multiple facilities. Nonetheless, as the first special operation in the cyber dimension of war, and with the purpose of causing physical damage, Stuxnet was operating entirely in unknown territory. Now, the right lessons need to be learned. JFQ To casual observers, it probably elicited little more than a yawn. After all, there seems to be a new "cyber threat" reported every day. The detection of new computer viruses is announced routinely. In most cases, by the time the event is publicized, the major antivirus manufacturers have already developed a patch to address whatever software flaw the malware was designed to exploit.
To more experienced cyber players, however, this July 2010 event was far from routine. "Stuxnet," as the virus came to be known, was far more complex than run-ofthe-mill hacker tools. The complicated and powerful code was a self-replicating worm that targeted programmable logic controllers (PLCs), the simple computers used to perform automated tasks in many industrial processes. PLCs are part of industrial control systems, most commonly referred to as Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems. SCADA systems are critical to the modern industrial world, controlling such things as water plants, auto manufacturing, and electrical powergrids.
Stuxnet could not spread directly through SCADA systems. It propagated over computers running the Windows operating system. From there, it searched for a certain computer-to-SCADA interface system. If the interface was present, Stuxnet was programmed to determine if it could target a PLC-but not just any PLC. Stuxnet singled out PLCs made by Siemens.

Before Stuxnet, the most notable actions in cyber were probably the events in the BROWN Republic of Georgia and in Estonia. Neither rose to the level of a cyber attack. In Georgia, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) assaults on government Web pages began in about mid-July 2008. Three weeks later, the assaults significantly increased and were accompanied by the Russian military crossing the border into South Ossetia, a Georgian province. 
6
The situation in Estonia in 2007 was different in that it was not accompanied by a kinetic event. After the Estonian government relocated a World War II-era Soviet statue from the center of Tallinn to a military cemetery, Russian "hacktivists" (hackers motivated by patriotism or ideology) began to launch denial-of-service and DDoS actions against Estonian Web sites. Ultimately, the activity resulted in making government, banking, and many other commercial Web sites unavailable to Estonians. 
7
The Estonian experience led to the conclusion that NATO simply does not consider cyber action worthy of being called an attack. For NATO, an attack would trigger a potential self-defense response by the Alliance. "Not a single NATO defence minister would define cyber-attack as a clear military action at present." 8 However, NATO's position on aggressive cyber activities may be changing. 
9
Although there is no formally agreedupon definition of cyber attack, most scholars would define it in a manner similar to a more traditional, physical attack. A common definition of cyber attack is "a cyber operation which is reasonably expected to cause death or injury to persons or damage or destruction to objects."
The Stuxnet event was as clearly a cyber attack as any publicly announced event to date. Intentionally designed malware directed against a nation-state resulted in the physical destruction of state-owned equipment.

Iran's "non-position" on the Stuxnet event has been frustrating to practitioners in the field of cyberspace operations. Finally, there was a well-documented, unambiguous cyber attack to dissect! And yet there was little official discussion of the issue because Iran passed up its opportunity to complain of an unjustified attack.
It is unusual that a nation would be attacked and not be willing to state as much. The community of nations (for example, the United Nations, the Arab League, or some other international organization) may be reluctant to tell a nation it has been attacked when it apparently feels otherwise. After all, if a nation does not feel it has been wronged, it is not really within the purview of the international community to try and convince it otherwise. This unusual situation is perhaps unique to cyber. It is difficult to interpret artillery bombardments or invasions by troops as anything other than attacks. However, in the cyber arena, there is a danger to the international community in this benign neglect.
The problem with turning a blind eye to the event is that, not only was Stuxnet an attack, it also was quite possibly an illegal attack under international law. In addition to violating the general prohibition against a use of force against another nation, this event arguably violated the law of war. The law of war requires that attacks be discriminatory, meaning they must be directed against military objectives only. Stuxnet was a selfreplicating worm. It contained certain controls, but demonstrably not enough to prevent it from inserting itself into civilian systems around the world.
What would motivate Iran not to just admit it was attacked? As the victim of an attack, it could possibly have gained support from the international community. At a minimum, it might have hoped for statements of condemnation to dissuade future similar attacks against it.
Discussed below are several reasons Iran might have chosen not to declare Stuxnet an attack. Although I have no insight into why Iran chose this course of action, I discuss the possibilities basically in order of probability, starting with the most probable.
Embarrassment. It is possible Tehran is simply ashamed that it lost a significant portion of its hard-obtained ability to create nuclear weapons material to a computer bug, especially when it portrays itself as having a significant cyber capability of its own. 
13
A video screened at the retirement party for the head of the Israel Defense Forces indicated at least some level of involvement by Israel in the cyber attack on Iran's nuclear program: "The video of Lieutenant General Gabi Ashkenazi's operational successes included references to Stuxnet, a computer virus that disrupted the Natanz nuclear enrichment site [in 2010]."

Preserving Future Options. Iran cannot hope to compete in the traditional military sphere with the West, so it is apparently attempting to level the playing field by developing a nuclear capacity. Similarly, it may be hoping to develop an asymmetric cyber attack ability for the same reason. There are reports this is the case.
General Ali Fazli, acting commander of the Basij, was quoted by Iran's state-owned newspaper as saying Iran's cyber army is made up of university teachers, students, and clerics. He said its attacks were retaliation for similar attacks on Iran, according to the semi-official Mehr news agency. There were no further details about the possible targets or the time of the attacks:
Iranian hackers working for the powerful Revolutionary Guard's paramilitary Basij group have launched attacks on websites of the "enemies," a state-owned newspaper reported Monday in a rare acknowledgment from Iran that it's involved in cyber warfare. . . . "As there are cyber attacks on us, so is our cyber army of the Basij, which includes university instructors and students, as well as clerics, attacking websites of the enemy," Fazli said. "Without resorting to the power of the Basij, we would not have been able to monitor and confront our enemies." 
17
18
Belief the Action Was Legal. Although most legal experts would conclude that an offensive cyber action resulting in the physical destruction of property is an attack, there is no definitive evidence on the topic. We have little insight into what Iran believes is the state of play on cyber legality. From the inaction of the community of nations, we can infer there are no international restrictions on purely cyber activities. Moreover, other than the legally unchallenged Stuxnet, there is no indication that it is lawful to actually destroy things in another country-even if the destruction is caused by a purely cyber event.
Difficulty of Attribution. It is the nature of cyberspace and the Internet that makes it challenging to find out who is responsible for any given action. Appropriated computers, intermediate hop points, and many other techniques make it tough to know the origin of an activity, much less the originating actor.
In this case, although Iran may feel there are some obvious suspects, they may not be able to prove who was behind Stuxnet. One example of how the Internet has created new challenges in attribution is the rise of independent actors on many levels. Cyber techniques now allow anonymous coordination between actors, so action can be more effective and devastating, but the risk of discovery is smaller.
Of particular note are the hacktivists, who began to garner notice in 2007 with events in Estonia, followed by other significant activity in Lithuania and Georgia the following year. In a wonderful example of blurring the line between state policy and independent criminal actors, a group known as StopGeorgia facilitated the cyber assault on Georgia. This group of nationalistic hackers provided DDoS kits to novice hackers, along with lists of Georgian targets. They also offered more sophisticated malware, complete with instructions on how to employ it. These services were available to anyone who went to the group's Web site. 
19
20
The activity reported to have been taken by Anonymous hacktivists did not result in physical damage to computers. Even if it had, however, it may not have made sense to treat the action as a cyber "attack" because the perpetrators were individual civilians, acting only under suggestion from a higher organization. Because it is often impossible to know the individuals behind a nefarious cyber action, at least in real time, some countries are more comfortable treating all cyber events as criminal cases rather than potential acts of war. This may be how Estonia viewed the action against it in 2007: "It was clear to the Estonian this event arguably violated the law of war 
authorities that the cyber attacks could-and should-be treated as cyber crime." 
21
In addition to the rationales discussed above, there are several that do not seem to apply to Iran's motivation in this case. Even if they are not relevant in the case of Stuxnet, however, they are interesting in the larger sense of cyber operations.
Fear. In theory, a country could be afraid of the reaction of the adversary to being called out. A cyber adversary might suddenly decide more aggressive options were in order if they were caught in the act. However, the circumstances here make it unlikely that fear played a role in Iran's decision.
Deception. It is possible the victim of a cyber attack may want to keep its detection of the attack a secret. The offended nation may want to gather intelligence on adversary tactics, for example. This constraint would probably disappear once the attack becomes public, however.
Overcome by Events. If a cyber attack occurs in the context of kinetic activities, it may not merit mention. This is similar to the situation that occurred in Georgia. With bombs falling and tanks rolling, cyber disruption did not merit much attention-although that case did not rise to the level of cyber attack. This is also what happened when Israel reportedly used cyber techniques to take down air defenses in Syria before an air raid that destroyed a military construction site in 2007. 
22
In the end, it probably does not matter in this specific case that Iran did not officially declare it had been attacked. Although there are reasons as detailed above to conclude that Israel was behind Stuxnet, it is doubtful the international community would have found enough evidence to establish conclusively that Israel was responsible. Even if it had, no effective action was likely to survive contact with the United Nations Security Council.
It is unfortunate that the clearest example of cyber attack appears to have passed by without a conclusive determination, which could have been driven by a statement from the victim country. Stuxnet may now fade into the sunset like so many other offensive actions that were famous in their day-Titan Rain, Moonlight Maze, Operation Aurora. 
23
So far, the customary practice of nations in cyberspace seems to be, "Do unto others whatever you can get away with." Sadly, until a major player like the United States suffers a catastrophic cyber event, it appears likely to stay that way. JFQ
The 5 th annual competition in 2011 was intended to stimulate new approaches to coordinated civilian and military action from a broad spectrum of civilian and military students. Essays were to address U.S. Government structure, policies, capabilities, resources, and/or practices and to provide creative, feasible ideas on how best to orchestrate the core competencies of our national security institutions. The NDU Foundation awarded the first place winner a generous gift certificate from Amazon.com. 
Twenty-two senior faculty members from the 15 participating PME institutions took time out of their busy schedules to serve as judges. Their personal dedication and professional excellence ensured a strong and credible competition. he United States is the world's preeminent military power, due in large part to its technological superiority. This lead in innovative technology supporting national security also includes advances in new and "green" energy applications. A common ingredient enabling the production of many of these applications is a group of minerals known as rare earth elements (REEs). Two REEs in particular, the refined metals neodymium and samarium, are key components in the manufacture of miniature high-temperature-resistant permanent magnets. These magnets are essential to wind turbines, hybrid car engines, and computer hard drives. Moreover, they are critical for military applications including precision-guided munitions, tank navigation systems, and electronic countermeasures equipment.
The demand for REEs is steadily increasing in the world. Simultaneously, the supply of REEs is shrinking-or rather China, which annually produces 97 percent of the rare earth minerals on the world market and controls some 37 percent of the planet's known reserves, 1 is steadily reducing its exports. China dramatically restricted its exports by 72 percent in the last 6 months of 2010 to satisfy its rapidly expanding national appetite for REEs.

3
In order to break the pattern of dependence on China, the United States should reconfigure its National Defense Stockpile (NDS) to provide a buffer supply of REEs to meet defense needs for 5 years, while providing government incentives such as tax breaks or loan guarantees to aid resurgent domestic REE mining and refining firms. It is critical the government also be on guard against further sale and export of such U.S. companies to China. Simultaneously, the United States should continue funding research into permanent magnets using alternative materials that could balance the demand for REEs.
REEs have been described as "vitamins of modern industry" because of their necessity and wide application across the fields of energy, defense, and computer technology.

The term rare in REEs is not accurate. It persists due to a combination of misunderstanding and indifference that characterizes public perception. REEs are actually relatively abundant throughout the Earth's crust, about the same as some major industrial metals (copper, zinc, and chrome) and even greater than several precious metals (gold, silver, and platinum). 
7
8
Rare earth elements are vital to an ever-increasing number of industries. According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), "These uses range from mundane (lighter flints, glass polishing) to hightech (phosphors, lasers, magnets, batteries, magnetic refrigeration) to futuristic (high-temperature superconductivity, safe storage and transport of hydrogen for a post-hydrocarbon economy)."

12
Neodymium and samarium make up only a portion of the REE market, which is an even smaller part of the global metals market, but these two metals have a disproportionate influence on all hightech businesses, especially the defense industry. They combine with other elements (specifically iron, boron, and cobalt) to make exceptional permanent magnets. Samarium-cobalt (SmCo) magnets have the highest known resistance to demagnetization. 
13
14
15
NdFeB and SmCo magnets are ingrained in the commercial high-tech, automotive, and energy markets of the United States. For instance, miniaturized multigigabyte disk and DVD drives, a mainstay in portable computers, are not possible without such magnets. 
16
17
Map shows locations of rare earth deposits in United States
Miniature high-temperature-resistant permanent magnets are a key factor in developing state-of-the-art military technology. They pervade the equipment and function of all Service branches, starting with commercial computer hard drives containing NdFeB magnets that sit on nearly every Department of Defense (DOD) employee's desk. Precision-guided munitions depend on SmCo magnets as part of the motors that manipulate their flight control surfaces. Without these advanced tiny magnets, the motors in "smart bombs" like the Joint Direct Attack Munition (JDAM) would require a hydraulic system that is more expensive and three times as large. The generators that produce power for aircraft electrical systems also rely on samarium-cobalt magnets, as does the stealth technology used to mask the sound of helicopter rotor blades by generating white-noise concealment.
Other permanent magnet applications include "jet engines and other aircraft components, electronic countermeasures, underwater mine detection, antimissile defense, range finding, and space-based satellite power and communications systems," according to USGS. 
18
The global economy currently consumes an estimated 134,000 tons of REEs each year. However, worldwide annual mining production is only 124,000 tons. For the time being, the delta is bridged using materials stockpiled at various commercial mines around the world. This will not suffice for long. In 1998, by comparison, total annual consumption was about 50,000 tons, and there was no future availability concern. 
19
20
China is the world's principal provider of REEs. Its propensity to use this position as a diplomatic "stick" and element of economic power, combined with a growing domestic appetite for these elements, threatens to exacerbate the anticipated global shortage. In early 2010, following the disclosure of a multibillion-dollar arms deal with Taiwan, several Chinese military news sources and Web sites urged the government to completely ban the sale of REEs to U.S. companies as a means of retaliation. 
21
22
23
Neodymium and samarium are critical to the strength of the U.S. national defense industry, but the current supply of these metals is entirely external to the country. Moreover, demand for permanent magnets is expected to increase 10 to 16 percent per year through 2012. 
24
25
26
China is credited with holding 37 to 43 percent of the world's known REE reserves, but the United States is not without its own REEs. America is estimated to have 13 percent of known rare earth reserves. However, American mining operations essentially ceased in 2002 with the closure of California's Mountain Pass mine because of environmental concerns and declining profitability as a result of low Chinese prices in the previous decade.

The method of separating neodymium and samarium oxides from mined raw ore, then reducing those oxides to a usable metallic element, is difficult. The industrial complex required to house thousands of stainless steel tanks, complicated arrays of chemical baths, extracting agents, and equipment needed for the process covers an area the size of a football field. 
35
36
Nonetheless, Molycorp is working to modernize and expand its Mountain Pass processing facility. Under the firm's "mine-to-magnets" strategy, it has a goal of generating 20,000 tons of rare earth oxides by 2012 and reestablishing its domestic magnet manufacturing business.

39
There is little distinction in China between private industry and the government, making it increasingly difficult for U.S. firms to compete on an equal footing and remain profitable. An insightful student of China's maneuverings observed, "The Unocal [purchase attempt] involved the provision of a soft loan from the Chinese government to the company [CNOOC]. This is not like a commercial loan. The Chinese government protects its state companies at home and supports them financially overseas. But these companies are essentially expected to be an arm of national foreign policy in their foreign investment, rather than to create value." 
40
41
China is methodically acquiring U.S. companies that produce rare earth magnets, transferring that production technology to China, and then shutting down the plants in America. This was the fate of GA Powders, Environmental Laboratory, and Magnequench. 
42
China is "trying to replicate the capabilities the U.S. has." 
43
44
In order to stem the tide of dependence on China for permanent magnets, the United States should pursue several options: secure REE sources outside of China (preferably within its own borders), establish an NDS to meet military needs for permanent magnets, develop suitable substitute materials, and employ DOD acquisition policies to improve the REE market for domestic suppliers.
Non-Chinese Sources. Prior to 1990, the United States was largely self-sufficient in meeting its REE and permanent magnet requirements. Mountain Pass was the dominant source and the only large ore deposit mined just for its REE content, having reserves of 20 million tons. 
45
46
Other nations that have REE reserves include Australia (5 percent), India (3 percent), and several other countries with a combined total of 22 percent of the Earth's known reserves.

National Defense Stockpile. The United States has no REEs in its NDS. All such minerals were sold by 1998, and they were never classified as strategic minerals. 
54
55
56
It would be wise to follow the Defense National Stockpile Center's recommendation to reconfigure the NDS into an expanded and more capable SMSP. However, this action will likely require some reworking of the Nation's procurement bureaucracy to establish the necessary interaction of all affected government departments. Such a consolidation of purchasing priorities for REEs promises the greatest long-term leverage of finances, but the system will take time to establish. At present, Congress should classify neodymium and samarium as strategic minerals for the next 5 to 10 years, adding them to the NDS, while the domestic supply chain for permanent magnets is reestablished.
Alternative Materials. According to George Hadjipanayis, co-inventor of the NdFeB magnet, "It's been 28 years since the discovery of neodymium-iron-boron, and we have not yet found a better magnet." 
57
58
60
61
The immediate focus for the United States should be on reestablishing its domestic REE supply and permanent magnet production capabilities, but not to the exclusion of pursuing better technology. This requires a delicate balance because it increases the financial risk that companies are taking to reestablish cradleto-grave REE magnet manufacturing in America. Funding should be appropriated for research into alternative materials. However, the government must then be careful not to mandate the use of a resulting product only for the sake of justifying its investment. The principles of freemarket capitalism must be honored in harmony with the need for national security. Moreover, this manner of government support must be pursued collaboratively between private enterprise (having experience with the most efficient ways to pursue production) and DOD (knowing best what the requirements are to support national security).
Department of Defense Policy. DOD already has a regulatory framework established to initiate government action to preserve domestic industrial capabilities vital to national security. DOD Instruction 5000.60 provides guidance for verifying the warfighting utility of the industry in question, that the specific capability is unique and at risk, that there are no feasible alternatives, and that the intended action is the most mission-effective and costeffective. 
62
The United States is clearly dependent on REE permanent magnets to satisfy its demand for consumer electronics, fuel its automotive and energy industries, and most important, to maintain its lead in state-of-the-art military technology. Although America used to provide for its own permanent magnet requirements, this independence eroded over the past two decades and is now primarily gone. There are no active domestic REE mining operations or permanent magnet production lines fully in the country. The United States is entirely dependent on external sources, which essentially means dependence on its largest economic competitor and fastestgrowing military challenger, China.
"There is oil in the Middle East; there is rare earth in China," stated Deng Xiaoping, who ruled China from 1978 to 1997 and inaugurated China's systematic campaign to dominate the world's supply of REEs. 
63
Changing the trend of U.S. reliance on REE imports will be costly and timeconsuming, but is incomparable to the price of crippling national security. The probability that America will lose all of its access to permanent magnets is relatively low, but the consequences of such a situation would be catastrophic. Fortunately, the limited supply of REEs resulting from China's increased consumption and reduction of exports has made mining and refining operations potentially profitable again.
There are several firms stepping up to reestablish their place in the market. However, these endeavors will take time and require great investment of capital. Molycorp's recent efforts to revive its domestic magnet manufacturing process and restart mining operations at Mountain Pass, California, are encouraging. Similarly, there is potential for mining operations in six other states and established ventures in Canada and South Africa that promise to open new sources of neodymium and samarium in the next 5 years. This is a tenuous time, as the possibility of Chinese maneuverings to flood the market (as it did in the 1990s) and drive prices down threatens to swamp the reemerging competition. U.S. Government interposition to ensure that the reemerging industry is not squelched by Chinese government-funded competitors will help hedge against these possible schemes. Continued exploration of alternative materials and technologies will also balance America's dependence on rare earth elements.
While the permanent magnet cornerstone of the U.S. defense and energy industries is at risk, recovery is not insurmountable. Realizing the existence and scope of the threat, and applying the same creative thought and persistent action that once put America at the forefront of this technology, will ultimately return the Nation to its preeminent place in this field. JFQ changing the trend of U.S. reliance on REE imports will be costly and time-consuming, but is incomparable to the price of crippling national security T here is a potentially dangerous obsession in America regarding China. The Middle Kingdom's awe-inspiring climb from a state of backwardness and abject poverty to a thriving economy, second only to the United States, in just over 30 years has not merely inspired justifiable pride within the People's Republic; it has also provoked anxiety and fear in the West.
According to many, the "Chinese model" now serves as an enlightened beacon to other developing states, while the liberal free-market model languishes in disrepair along with its decrepit and lethargic American makers. China's overseas investment strategy in energy, minerals, and other resources is portrayed as parasitic in nature-ravaging the Earth of all that is useful in a competitive quest for domination, while its menacing purchase of America's debt-gone-wild is allegedly making American leaders increasingly beholden to their Chinese debt-masters' political manipulations. Meanwhile, China's rapidly expanding manufacturing base is moving beyond lead-based painted toys, poisoned pet food, and toxic drywall to supersonic stealthy fighters, high-speed rail, clean energy, and the world's fastest supercomputer.

China's economic prowess almost obliges one to wonder where the United States derailed to have permitted China to climb to such heights, as though America can control China's destiny but not its own. However, despite the outpouring of declarations claiming China's unstoppable ascent and its menacing nature, reality depicts something quite different. China is confronted with a number of significant economic and noneconomic challenges that will inevitably retard its continued growth. Yet China's troubles are no reason for America to rejoice; it is hardly in U.S. interests that China, or any state, fails to develop economically. Wealth tends to engender peace, stability, and, some contend, democratic reforms in autocratic societies.

Prior to delving into China's numerous problems, one should address those misleading assertions that depict Sino-American economic relations in a less than positive light or project them forward on a confrontational trajectory. Alarmist indictments taint America's perspective with negative biases and an adversarial mindset. If not understood, instead of responding with appropriate policies to address China's very real and growing problems, the United States risks focusing on falsehoods or flawed understandings of Sino-American trade relations, the market, and America's appropriate leadership role. These fears and fallacies need to be addressed and dismissed before moving on to China's more pressing challenges.
The list of imaginary economic perils that China poses to the United States is as lengthy as it is troubling. However, the bases for the alleged threats are laden with logical fallacies. The most significant misunderstanding surrounds the notion that if China is growing-winning-economically, the United States is somehow losing. Many are drawn to the misconception that the United States is in a zero-sum economic competition with China, overlooking the simple fact that companies compete, states do not. 
5
This assumption ignores that wealth can be created and that trade can be mutually beneficial. These economic truths help to explain how the global economy grew from $22.8 trillion to $53.3 trillion between 1990 and 2007, or that there are "no examples of countries that have risen in the ranks of global living standards while being less open to trade and capital in the 1990s than in the 1960s." 
6
Similarly, opinions about China's foreign direct investments (FDI) have taken on a troublesome tone in America. The misperceptions characterize Chinese FDI as a competition-a race for resources-that compels an equivalent U.S. response, or at minimum a dirigiste strategy, before the Chinese assume ownership and control of all the world's resources.
This anxiety demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding concerning the nature of commodities. Commodities, such as oil, iron, and wheat, are fungible and are generally purchased on the world's commodity spot markets at prices that the markets bear. If China is able to assist states in the exploitation of natural resources through its overseas investments, then those who consume the commodities will likewise benefit from increased global supplies.
Nowhere has the misnomer of competition for resources been more pronounced than in the panic-stricken assertions of China's alleged attempt to corner the energy market. It is somehow imagined that Chinese national oil companies (NOCs), operating under Chinese Communist Party (CCP) direction, are gobbling up foreign energy assets and hoarding their output, flowing from the wells into Chinese tankers (which nowhere has the misnomer of competition for resources been more pronounced than in the panic-stricken assertions of China's alleged attempt to corner the energy market

China's economic revival came on the heels of Mao Zedong's reform failures and could scarcely have started at a lower point. The Great Leap Forward was marked by economic regression and the deaths of tens of millions. A few years later, the Cultural Revolution again brought economic growth and education to a standstill and ensured a decade of political violence that set China back even further. It is out of this chaos that 
China could only improve, and it helps in understanding its sizable initial successes.

As less productive rural labor migrated to a dynamic urban manufacturing base, wages and living standards rose rapidly. China's record in reducing poverty was impressive. It is difficult to imagine that as recently as 1996, China had the largest number of poor people in the world. Remarkably, in 2007, the World Bank claimed that "extreme poverty, in the sense of not being able to meet the most elementary food and clothing needs, has almost been eliminated [in China]." 
21
Shift Away from Market Economy. The uneasiness of relying on something invisible must be unsettling to leaders of despotic regimes. Moreover, why should autocratic leaders trust it? Regarding the recent demise of the advanced Western democracies and their so-called free-market model, authoritarianism as a reasonable economic model seems to have rebounded with China's rise. Many in the West have become enamored with the mystique of Confucianism and apparent superiority of the Beijing Consensus. Or, if not infatuated with the model, they despairingly describe its ascendancy as preordained.

Internationally, the CCP's underhandedness and further movement away from previous liberalizing reforms through the championing of huge SOEs are affecting the perceptions and bottom lines of foreign firms. For example, foreign car makers see Beijing's push for joint ventures as nothing more than a "technology shakedown" to gain the capability and eventually become rivals. The actions of the CCP risk choking off future foreign investment and technologies that are necessary for China's continued growth. "There is still a lot of optimism, but there are industry leaders talking about the challenges of doing business in China in a way they would not have 10 years ago." 
27
What could possibly have caused CCP leaders to depart from reforms that permitted the party to lead their people out of poverty, regain national pride, and reestablish China as a regional and potential global power? Why would they move backward to a more centrally controlled economy that has no historic longterm precedents of success, but only misery and failure? The answer lies in the party's top priority: to remain in power. The party leadership needs to maintain social stability; leaving continued economic growth to the whims of the market is a risk that the CCP is apparently unwilling to take. Nowhere is this reversal better reflected than in the state's increased role in the allocation of resources through state-owned financial institutions.

banks to further open their already wasteful lending spigots. Banks lent nearly 50 percent more in 6 months than they had in all of 2008. However, the incestuous relationships that SOEs had with their financial confreres through their party affiliations helped them soak up a vast majority of the funds, leaving household consumers and private enterprises with just 15 percent. 
30
In 2009, Derek Scissors of the Heritage Foundation speculated that the CCP's obsession with growth might overheat the economy. Over the previous 4 years, the CCP directed the lending of trillions of dollars through its banks, primarily to SOEs. With today's inflationary pressure in China and probable increase of nonperforming loans that were extended to unprofitable SOEs, Scissors may be getting an answer to the rhetorical question he raised 2 years ago: whether state-directed investment can increase by 25 to 30 percent every year without "crippling waste and a warped, fragile economy."
This waste is often translated into increased corruption along with its associated bedfellows of feeble government regulatory enforcement and substandard quality. These conditions also contribute to China's questionable economic condition and point to serious systemic shortfalls in governance.
Corruption, Substandard Quality, and Slack Regulatory Enforcement. "Made in China" has an automatic, yet justifiable, negative connotation. The poor life expectancy of Chinese products is attributed to shoddy craftsmanship, dismal quality control, or poor regulatory oversight. Not only are the well-noted phenomena of recalls and poor performance having a negative economic impact on companies and individuals that market and purchase Chinese goods; there are also health and safety risks. Corruption feeds these bad practices in production as manufacturers bribe local officials to turn a blind eye on otherwise well-established guidelines and standards.
In 2007 alone, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued recalls or warnings on pet food, toothpaste, and farm-raised seafood-all from China. More serious health issues occurred in 2008: poorly manufactured heparin (an anticoagulant) resulted in 246 deaths between January 2007 and May 2008, and contaminated infant formula required the recall of products containing milk imported from China.

The United States welcomes China's rise as a strong, prosperous and successful member of the community of nations. Indeed, China's success has brought with it economic benefits for our people as well as yours, and our cooperation on a range of issues has helped advance stability in the Asia Pacific and in the world.

ESSAY WINNERS | The Empire's Newest New Clothes: Overrating China is patient" and simply bide time while adhering to and encouraging the very broad principles that define America: liberal democracy and free markets. McGregor intimates potential fissures in the CCP's continued grip on power as its ability to transform with rapid change fails to keep pace with the demands of an upwardly mobile and divergent society. Bilateral efforts should focus on the constructive: using tools of statecraft to encourage positive behavior and judiciously using public condemnations, which do little to change undesirable behavior or advance cooperation. The United States should thus seek cooperative policies that would encourage China's leaders to return to the liberalizing reform efforts of the past as the best path for continued economic growth. This recommendation does not dismiss the numerous imbalances in Sino-American trade and finance arenas that require reconciliation: currency, capital exchange, and trade distortions associated with an undervalued yuan; and legitimate complaints by U.S. manufacturers regarding their trade relations with Chinese firms or government officials, including intellectual property rights protections, China's discriminatory practices, industrial policies to subsidize and protect domestic firms from foreign competition, and health and safety concerns associated with Chinese products.
But these challenges require scalpellike redress as opposed to cutlass-like generalizations waved about willy-nilly, creating hostile domestic political environments in the United States and China. A negatively charged atmosphere limits maneuverability for those striving to resolve problems while emboldening nationalistic entrenchment on both sides of the Pacific. As such, the United States should pursue adjudication processes available through the WTO or other fora.
Not only does this assist in resolving issues in a relatively nonconfrontational manner, but it also further exposes and impresses upon China the good order obtained through international rule of law.
The U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue initiated under the George W. Bush administration and continued by President Obama is an excellent example of a useful forum to discuss and advance the bilateral economic issues and challenges listed above. Used appropriately, the dialogue can grow into a meaningful dispute resolution mechanism short of bringing cases before the WTO, or to advance cooperative programs and policies that would facilitate mutually beneficial trade relations between private U.S. and Chinese firms.
It seems that whenever the United States slips economically, a new chorus of pundits forms, chanting its fall. During the economic downturns of the 1950s, it was the Soviets who were about to "crush" America. During the cyclical declines of the 1990s, a neo-axis of powers was aligned to overtake the United States in the name of Japan and Germany. Today, with chances of a robust recovery encumbered by historically high debt levels, China is proclaimed as the new emerging threat and dominant global power while the United States goes into its proverbial tailspin, taking the liberal market along with it. Alarmists assert myths and halftruths about Chinese economic perils to the West and propose harsh recommendations that would chart a collision course for Sino-American relations.
Yet the United States continues to grow economically and demographically. It continues to provide its citizens with significant wealth, freedoms, and security. In short, one finds the country on an upward, albeit flattening, trajectory. At the same time, China is confronted by a growing list of economic challenges. To make matters worse, China's leaders, bolstered by three decades of success and perceived Western decline, are moving further away from the free-market reforms that guided China's reemergence in the first place. The CCP is unwittingly jeopardizing continued growth and, as a consequence, the very stability that it so desperately desires to retain power. A Chinese society that enriches itself in a stable economic environment is more likely to transition toward peaceful democratic political reforms rather than ones borne out of chaos. America should thus seek solutions and policies to the mutual benefit of its economic partners, of which China is arguably the most important. The philosophical basis for such an approach is not established on some elusive notion of American benevolence, but rather on the free-market liberal economic concepts and principles that have been the economic and foreign policy bedrock of the United States for generations. It would be unfortunate to depart from these principles because of unfounded fears or negative emotions. The United States has been down that road before, and it should be leery of policy proposals that repeat past mistakes, do not address the real issues of the day, or make a mildly antagonistic Sino-American relationship worse. JFQ N O T E S A t a recent Canadian defense conference, a speaker from the U.S. Naval War College demonized China and concluded with a phrase often attributed to Leon Trotsky: "You may not be interested in war, but war is interested in you." This unbalanced and unsophisticated approach is a hallmark of conflict theorists who maintain there simply has to be a fight between the United States and China.
Led by the offensive realism of John Mearsheimer, the "let's fight" approach conflicts with stated U.S. positions, which seek a "positive, constructive, and comprehensive relationship with China."

In the end, China is tougher to predict than most-almost everything except its economy is virtual, future, and opaque. Economically, it is already a global power. Militarily, it is a mainland Asia and regional Asia-Pacific power, but it is doubtful China will become a global military power. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) is untested, "constrained largely by the lack of robust strategic lift capabilities," 12 needs modernization, and is not on par with the U.S. military. Technological discrepancies between the U.S. and Chinese militaries will require that China spend more to catch up or leap ahead. To correct perceived discrepancies, the PLA has focused on new capabilities such as area denial, blue-water naval forces, and limited power projection. 
13
In the meantime, the United States cannot hedge its bets toward the optimistic side. If China arrives in mid-century as a "modernized, medium-level developed country," it will only be medium level using fuzzy per capita math. Its military will be significantly more powerful than a mediumlevel country. Therefore, we must continue to "monitor China's military modernization program and prepare accordingly to ensure President Obama talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao after bilateral meeting at G20 Summit White House (Pete Souza)

The Chinese will not get President Nixon's third observation regarding what China wants-the United States out of Asiabecause the United States is also a Pacific nation. Although always preparing for the possibility of conflict, the United States needs to identify choices that will engage the Chinese, establish confidence, and enhance security, while binding China to the international system. The adversarial tenets and predictions by conflict theorists are to be closely interrogated, albeit not wholly ignored. We need to educate our future senior military leaders, not with a diet of hyperbolic enemy images, but instead with a broad base in international relations and a realistic understanding of China's potential role, power, and challenges. We must avoid a narrow focus on offensive realism and power transition theories, joined by the wrongheaded belief that war is inevitably interested in us. As Robert Jervis so wisely notes, "Expectations of peace close off important routes to war."

nteraction with religious leaders and institutions in Afghanistan has been inconsistently addressed by foreign military, diplomatic, and development officials. Recent efforts to correct that trend in southern Afghanistan make it clear that a sustained, consistent, well-thought-out religious leader engagement program supports and advances the traditional components of counterinsurgency (security, development, and governance). Systematic engagement of religious leaders at the provincial, district, village, and farm levels created another line of communication whereby the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) promoted its mission of stability and Afghans voiced their needs and commitment to a stable future.
Navy Muslim chaplain meets with leaders to promote cultural and religious understanding between ISAF and residents of Naw-Abad, Afghanistan
One of the most pressing observations made about U.S. military efforts in the 21 st century has been the need to leverage culturally specific factors in support of counterinsurgency (COIN) efforts. One of the most important-and underemphasized-aspects of Afghan society is the importance of religious leaders in countering anti-Afghan rhetoric. 
1
Religious leaders and institutions play a significant role in how the legitimate GIRoA describes itself; the same is true for the enemies of Afghanistan.

As a starting point for engaging religious leaders, it is prudent to envision a future Afghanistan where religious institutions and leaders are promoted as essential aspects of the social fabric-not eliminated or begrudgingly accepted. Even those religious leaders who currently support the enemies of Afghanistan find themselves seeking reconciliation with GIRoA from time to time, and pursue full participation in the political process.

In support of his observations, Carroll and Asfura-Heim began a project to reintegrate religious leaders in their provincial religious organizations such as the Helmand Ulema Council and the office of the Helmand Director of Hajj. Carroll and Asfura-Heim found that religious leaders in southern Afghanistan were open to direct engagement and had specific grievances that could be addressed through greater integration of religious leaders. Primary among the concerns of these religious leaders was that they had been marginalized by the central government and had been sidelined in community discussions that did not directly address religious issues.

In addition to calling for a systematic engagement plan with religious leaders, Nicholson offered a paradigm for understanding that their target audience was "little 't' Taliban." "Little 't' Taliban" were those who were lured into the Taliban with promises of power, money, and stability-for financial and social, not religious, reasons. If, Pelikan offered, local Afghan religious leaders could explain the ways that ISAF and GIRoA were working to bring stability and clarify the opportunities for local Afghans to participate in those programs, then it would be possible that Taliban rhetoric would be undermined. If U.S. military chaplains, and Muslim chaplains in particular, could engage with religious leaders, then those religious leaders could act as trusted partners for participation in legitimate political, commercial, and religious institutions. 
12
The introduction of a Muslim chaplain served as an "icebreaker" for many religious leaders in southern Afghanistan and fostered trust between ISAF and the tens of Afghans who traveled from remote villages for the engagements. 
13
14
Rajiv Chandrasekaran, who reported on these events for the Washington Post, noted that IIMEB was one of just a few units in Afghanistan that made a concerted attempt to engage religious leaders as part of its campaign plan. Such a feat by the Marines stands as a testament to the religious and nonreligious impact of mullahs and other religious leaders in small, remote villages in southern Afghanistan. Chandrasekaran pointed out the impact of bringing one of only a few Muslim chaplains to southern Afghanistan: "At his [the Muslim chaplain's] first session with religious leaders in Helmand, the participants initially thought the clean-shaven [chaplain] was an impostor. Then he led the group in noontime prayers. By the end, everyone wanted to take a picture with him." 
15
The U.S. contingent in Helmand was not the only group to consider the role of religious leader engagements, however. The United Kingdom (UK) delegation at the Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team also constructed a religious leader engagement program in late 2009 that was intended to undermine Taliban propaganda by having religious leaders act as reliable mediators between ISAF and the Afghan people. As part of their efforts, the UK delegation invited a group of Afghan religious leaders to Great Britain; in response to their visit, one mullah said, "The Taliban tell everyone that Britain is an infidel nation hostile to Muslims, but the mullahs were able to see for themselves that in fact Britain is a tolerant country in which Muslims can build mosques and practice their religion peacefully." 
16
By engaging religious leaders at every level, UK and U.S. representatives were able to disseminate the message of Afghan stability to the farthest reaches of their areas of responsibility with the face and voice of Afghans. For example, while visiting Bakwa District, Farah Province, the religious leader engagement team was approached by a mullah who wore the mark of the Taliban-a crescent moon and star tattooed on the right hand-who was deeply moved by the presence of Afghans and Americans praying together: "He told us that he was a Taliban Mawlawi [religious scholar] who taught in a Madrasa . . . just outside Bakwa. So tremendously impressed by our message, he stated, 'Before today I just thought that all Westerners were infidels and I was against you. But today I saw something that I'd never seen before. And I have changed my mind about Americans. I will work with you from now on.'" 
17
The involvement of chaplains was central to the success of the religious leader engagement program in southern Afghanistan, but the historic and doctrinal role of chaplains presents certain challenges for how these types of programs can be expanded. Chaplains have traditionally been charged with providing for the morale and spiritual well-being of their troops. As military operations have evolved in the 21 st century, so have the responsibilities and expectations of chaplains; whether by personal abilities or requests from various partners, chaplains have been regularly involved in stability operations through engagement and support of local populations. Chaplains may represent an ideal nexus for religious leader engagement programs because of their intimate knowledge of religious matters: "In the general conduct of counterinsurgency operations the religious aspect is often either overlooked or is simply thought of as something to shy away from because many people feel unqualified to discuss religion. We chaplains, however, are never ashamed to talk about religion. And our experience in this operation proved that the direct approach with the Afghan religious leaders was the right one."

23
Religious leaders and religious institutions play an undeniably important role in Afghan society, and it is in the best interest of the U.S. military to design, implement, and effectively sustain engagements with those leaders. Religious leader engagement programs in southern Afghanistan demonstrate that well-thought-out plans of action can have tremendous impact on GIRoA's intent to counter anti-Afghanistan propaganda and address the legitimate needs of the Afghan people. In short, ISAF is a short-term solution to a long-term set of complex issues that can only be addressed by Afghans and the individuals they identify as legitimate powerbrokers. Ultimately, no amount of foreign savvy can account for the credibility and sustainability of driving the religious leader engagement process through legitimate GIRoA-affiliated individuals and institutions.
To ensure the continued integration of religious leaders at every level of Afghan society, religious leader engagement programs should be routed through official GIRoA channels to ensure that the process can be sustained once GIRoA takes full control of its affairs. In Helmand, for example, the director of Hajj and Religious Affairs, Sayed "Mullah" Mukhtar Ahmad Haqqani, was a key partner in the fight to discredit Taliban ideology because "he was a dynamic and engaging man who immediately grasped our plan and intentions and took [Salam and Pelikan] 'under his wing' as we circulated throughout the province together." 
24
From the perspective of ISAF and the U.S. Government, it should be kept in mind that religious leader engagement is a distinct type of engagement that has benefits and limitations that differ from other types. Engagement with religious leaders should rest on a long-term, sustainable plan that specifically considers the role that religious leaders play in village-level to national-level operations. U.S. military
Army chaplain meets with deputy minister of education and his interpreter at Camp Kiwi, Bamyan Province, Afghanistan 101 THOMPSON chaplains are key to the creation and sustainment of religious leader engagements, but their role does not need to be constant and should respect their status as noncombatants. There is reason to believe that the doctrinal elements of chaplain responsibilities ought to be reconsidered and adjusted to meet the rapidly changing needs of military operations in the 21 st century. One of the most beneficial aspects of religious leader engagement in southern Afghanistan was the involvement of a Muslim chaplain; his presence broke down barriers between local religious leaders and allowed for more honest discussions about stability operations.
One of the difficulties associated with the religious leader engagement programs was the availability of U.S. military Muslim chaplains. The U.S. military may wish to consider reaching out to nonmilitary chaplains (at hospitals, universities, and prisons, for example) who would be willing to support religious leader engagements around the world. A robust chaplaincy that can minister to U.S. troops as well as host nationals will boost U.S. military stability operations around the world. In fact, sustained religious leader engagement programs need not be confined to conflict zones; American foreign policy, in general, can benefit from recognizing the role of religion in societies throughout the world.
The enemies both of GIRoA and of stability in Afghanistan have waged a war based primarily on violent ideology shrouded in religious language that cannot be bombed into submission. The most effective method of dealing with ideology is to provide viable rhetorical alternatives. Active, sustained, and consistent engagement with religious leaders cultivates meaningful relationships and empowers local leaders to articulate ISAF and GIRoA commitment to stability. The primary effect of religious leader engagement has been to bring greater legitimacy to GIRoA. By connecting local religious leaders with their district political and religious leaders, district officials with provincial officials, and provincial officials with national leaders, ISAF was able to undermine some of the most frequent causes of instability: political alienation, religious extremism separated from mainstream society, knowledgeable religious leaders operating outside legitimate institutions, and the allure of violent narratives.

Beyond that perhaps "blinding flash of the obvious" (even if, for many, it unfortunately is not), all who would attempt whatever the time and place, warfare is complex 
The major objective in any counterinsurgency or unconventional type of war is gaining and then maintaining the support of the population and not simply attriting the enemy's armed forces. Furthermore, it is of course true that it is difficult to gain and maintain support of a population unless you can guarantee a reasonable degree of security against hostile acts. Equally true is that determining and creating the proper balance among security-focused activities and population-support activities are no easier in Southwest Asia today than they were in Southeast Asia in the 20 th century; nor are they likely to be easy in any future conflict irrespective of locale. The conduct of war will remain an art, not a science.
There are other similarities between former operations in Vietnam and presentday operations in Iraq. The original U.S. strategy for each included a focus on eliminating "incorrect ideologists" within the existing indigenous armed forces as a mechanism to help build reliable and effective armed forces for the U.S.-supported national government. In Vietnam, the first step taken by the United States to create more reliable armed forces for the South Vietnamese government was to insist upon the demobilization of 25 percent of the existing regular army.

The initial U.S. response to this action by the enemy, in Vietnam in the 20 th century and in Iraq in the 21 st , was conducting traditional kinetic operations with U.S. forces as the principal way to neutralize the insurgents. In Vietnam, General William Westmoreland (U.S. ground commander, 1964-1968) initiated a "big unit" strategy of attrition. These "body count" or "search and destroy" U.S. military operations were expected to establish a secure environment while simultaneously protecting the fledgling South Vietnamese armed forces and allowing them time to develop.

administration had deceived the public. The resultant domestic political turmoil undermined the ability to capitalize on the enemy's weakened state.
Nonetheless, as General Creighton Abrams (Vice Chief of Staff of the Army and deputy to General Westmoreland) took command later in 1968, positive steps toward greater success began to be taken. Fully cognizant of the importance of a supportive population for the South Vietnam government, Abrams aggressively implemented an increasingly effective security sector reform campaign in the hamlets and villages. This campaign's principal-but not exclusive-focus was on building security sector capacity in local forces to defend areas against residual Viet Cong elements or small unit actions of the North Vietnamese Army (NVA).
Furthermore, in order to create a more effective and coordinated wholeof-government approach, the military's security sector reform and civilian development programs were combined under one command, called the Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) program. The CORDS concept was instigated by National Security Advisor Robert Komer; upon its adoption he was assigned as a deputy to Abrams specifically to implement the program, to help ensure military and civilian unity of effort during execution.

While no two wars are ever the same (rather, each is unique-and certainly this is the case of Vietnam and Iraq), three important insights are readily discernible from the preceding brief comparison.
First, every conflict requires both military operations aimed at eliminating hostile threats and also whole-of-government activities aimed at establishing or restoring essential foundations (physical, psychological, cultural, and moral, among others) of good governance and civil stability. While it may be possible-even required-to prioritize between those two lines of effort, there is no choice between doing one and doing the other-both always must be accomplished. This is because in any operation, whether socalled traditional combat operations or any of the many various types of stability operations, security and protection are always important to the population at risk. A safe environment is an essential precursor to reconstruction of an affected area. If security is not achieved early and then sustained in any operation, the second-and third-level effects are usually disastrous. At the same time, no peaceful interregnum between conflicts will last long unless the operations that eliminate direct hostile actions also are accompanied by activities that address existing or potential underlying catalysts of future conflict.
Second, and in a similar vein, outside military advisory and assistance efforts cannot focus solely on preparing indigenous armed forces for counterinsurgency activities on the one hand, or for conventional largescale combat operations on the other. Armed forces must possess both those capabilities if they are to successfully protect modern nation-states in the 21 st -century national security environment, just as was required in the 19 th and 20 th centuries. An army that can do counterinsurgency but not multi-echelon combined arms maneuver, or vice versa, will almost certainly discover that its opponent always chooses to fight the fight for which that army and that nation are unprepared.
Third, despite perceptions to the contrary arising from the difficulties of counterinsurgency operations, it takes a longer time and a greater effort for an army to be prepared to fight on the multi-echeloned, combined arms maneuver battlefield. This is because the security operations of the counterinsurgency conflict are largely prepared and executed by battalions and companies, and the synchronization of military activities to conduct those operations frequently can be accomplished by headquarters operating from fixed facilities with assets also prepositioned within the theater. Successful company commanders can be educated and trained in a few years at most, and battalion commanders in less than a decade during actual operations. Multiechelon, combined arms maneuver operations, on the other hand, demand preparation and execution by multiple brigade-, division-, and even corps-level commanders, synchronizing the repositioning and application of diverse elements of combat power being brought to bear dynamically on the move, often while the headquarters themselves are moving to address or avoid specific threats. Company and battalion commanders still can be developed and made ready for this type of combat within relatively short timeframes, but the skills and abilities required at the higher (brigade, division, corps) echelons that success at multi-echelon combined arms maneuver demands take far longer to develop through actual experience or experiential education.
Thus, the United States was instrumental in helping the ARVN become a successful counterinsurgency force; it even managed to develop multi-echelon combined arms fighting capabilities within selected ARVN battalions and brigades, some of which fought very effectively during the final offensive of the Vietnam War in 1975. What the assistance effort in Vietnam could not do was develop Airman patrols outskirts of Joint Base Balad, Iraq U.S. Air Force (Quinton Russ)
truly effective division and corps commanders-only extensive education and experiential learning over time regarding the specific problems associated with multi-echelon, combined arms maneuver can do that. The U.S. withdrawal in Vietnam came too early for the ARVN to be fully ready to take on the defense against a large-scale conventional multiechelon combined arms attack. The fate of the South Vietnamese army in 1975 provides ample evidence that courageous, battle-tested, and well-led battalions and companies cannot overcome the inability of brigade, division, and corps commanders to visualize and then synchronize the necessary actions of their dispersed commands across a fluid and dynamic kinetic battlespace.
Today, it appears that the United States has had reasonable success in Iraq in organizing, educating, and training indigenous security forces to undertake counterinsurgency and stability operations. This perception is encouraging discussion of a rapid withdrawal of all U.S. forces. But while it seems unlikely that Iraq's potential enemies will pose a multiechelon combined arms maneuver threat in the immediate future, the same cannot be said for the longer term. Therefore, withdrawing U.S. advisors, support, and the possibility of U.S. intervention with combat capabilities, until at least another decade has passed, potentially invites a repetition of the "real" lesson of Vietnam in Southwest Asia.
Similarly, any failure on the part of the U.S. military to maintain professional military institutions that can and do focus their educational and experiential activities on both counterinsurgency and conventional combat operations-particularly for seniorlevel leaders-would make the risk a global one. JFQ T wenty years ago, on a hot August day in 1991, I arrived, like you, to begin a year at the National War College. I met striking and impressive classmates such as William "Fox" Fallon and Carrol "Howie" Chandler, future four-stars who radiated leadership. No one could know it then, but there would be several flag and general officers from our class. Everyone looked selfassured, and everyone-this may surprise you-was a lot taller than me and had far more executive hair than I did.
My daughters were very young. We lived in a little townhouse in Alexandria, Virginia, and I had just finished up a sea tour in an Aegis cruiser and many years at sea. I knew what I was good at and what I knew well: driving a destroyer or a cruiser, navigating through tight waters, leading a boarding party up a swinging ladder, planning an air defense campaign, leading Sailors on the deck plates of a rolling ship. But I also sensed what I did not know or understand well: global politics and grand strategy, the importance of the "logistics nation," how the interagency community worked, what the levers of power and practice were in the world-in essence, how everything fits together in producing security for the United States and our partners.
In the year ahead, I hoped to close that gap, and I did. You will, too.
I want to give you a sense of what worked for us in the class of 1992 in the hopes that it will illuminate the voyage ahead for the class of 2012.
The first thing I want to emphasize is the gift you have been given-namely, the gift of time. To be given essentially a year in the middle of your career, far away from the grind of combat and the endless churn of staff work, is priceless. You have to decide how to spend it.
In three words: read, think, write.
The quintessential skill of an officer is to bring order out of chaos. You have to be calm, smart, and willing to do the brain work; in the end, 21 st -century security is about brainon-brain warfare. We will succeed not only because we have more resources, or because our values are the best, or because we have the best demographics or geographic advantages-all of those things matter, of course. But in today's turbulent security environment, we will succeed and defeat our enemies by out-thinking them. To do that, and to be successful senior officers, you need to read, think, and write.
Let me start with reading. You will get plenty of assigned reading, which-as we used to say in the class of 1992-is only a lot of reading if you do it! Of course, I certainly Can I offer a couple of titles from my recent reading? Try Matterhorn, a novel of Vietnam by Karl Marlantes. You will be pulled into combat in a real and visceral way, and you will be able to reflect on how far we have come in logistics, medicine, tactics, air support, and a thousand other things. Pick up Colonel Roosevelt by Edmund Morris, which concludes a trilogy of superb and highly readable books about perhaps our most energetic and brilliant President in the final, sad decade of his life when the country was politically polarized and the world order was changing day by day. Want to get a view into Afghanistan? Try Flashman, the first of the extraordinary series of historical fiction by George MacDonald Fraser, which throws Pashtun culture into vivid light, providing a view of one of the worst acts of generalship in history: Elphinstone's disastrous 1842 retreat from Kabul during which the British lost 30,000 souls in 2 weeks.
Reading is the rock upon which you will build the rest of your career. Here is your chance to create real intellectual capital from which you will earn interest, draw dividends, and make withdrawals in the two decades to come. In this way, I share Teddy Roosevelt's mindset when he stated, "I am a part of everything I have read."
Let us now turn to thinking. When President Obama was on campus in March of 2009 to dedicate Abraham Lincoln Hall, he commented, "Here at National Defense University, men and women come together to think, to learn, and to seek new strategies to defend our union, while pursuing the goal of a just and lasting peace."
We stand here today at Fort Lesley J. McNair. It was built more than 200 years ago to protect a fledgling capital against forces that wished to do it harm. Its defenses were traditional-basic training, stockpiles of weapons, and fortifications-and the battlefields were traditional as well. Fast forward two centuries, and Fort McNair is still responsible for defending this nation, but the "battlefields" have dramatically changed, and the world today requires more from us all.
In this world, we must think our way to success in incredibly complex scenarios: â  â  a Westphalian system under attack with nation-states fighting in unconventional settings with unfamiliar tool sets â  â  attacks by organizations bent on ideological domination â  â  aging demographics throughout Europe and many developed regions â  â  a globalizing economy with perceived (and actual) winners and losers exacerbated by the challenges of austerity â  â  the exponential rise of environmental concerns directly linked to globalization â  â  miniaturizing technologies producing powerful effects and dangers to security â  â  transnational and transregional criminal organizations, trafficking in weapons, narcotics, people, money, and intellectual capital â  â  diffusion of weapons of mass destruction-including biological and chemical weapons â  â  the "cyber sea, " enabling global communication at potentially everyone's fingertips-a "speed of thought" dialogue that occurs in a virtual and real 24/7 news cycle â  â  all of this taking place within the competitive "marketplace of ideas, " which is ultimately at the root of conflicts, requiring sophisticated strategic communication to influence in both directions.
You must think your way through all of these new challenges. Few of them will be solved solely by combat operations, and thus tend to lurk in our intellectual seams and find our bureaucratic and cultural blind spots.
Next, let me share some thoughts about writing. Because after you read, and think, I would argue you must write. Writing is easy for some and hard for others, but it is essential in communicating what we have learned, as well as allowing others to challenge our views and thus make them stronger. You will write plenty here for the faculty. But I would strongly encourage you to set a goal of publishing an article somewhere as a result of the work you have done here.
Share your ideas in print-a scholarly journal, a military magazine, a literary journal, or even a blog post. Get out there with your ideas. Nail your whispers to the wall. Conclude the trilogy of read, think, and write-and try to publish. Is there "career risk" in publishing? I suppose. It hasn't hurt me too badly over the years. What matters more is testing your ideas on the field of intellectual battle, so to speak.
We need to challenge our staffs, friends, shipmates, allies-the dedicated professionals who work with us every day. We need to constantly seek new relationships and forge new partnerships. With all that said, let me give you more food for thought.
We have too many walls in the world of security-we need more bridges. Our self-imposed legal, political, moral, and conceptual boundaries defining what constitutes combat versus criminal activity, domestic versus international jurisdiction, and governmental versus private interest all provide operational space for potentially lethal opponents with no such boundaries to respect.
As we stand here in the shadow of a building that bears his great name, I am reminded of one of my favorite quotations of Lincoln: "The dusty dogmas of the past are insufficient to confront our stormy present. As our world is new, we must think anew." We must address the challenge of effectively employing our military across these boundaries without undermining the core values and freedoms that underpin our society.
Here, you will look to expand our understanding of conflict and security beyond only lethal means and reexamine all our operations, including peacetime engagement and training activities, in order to leverage the vast knowledge-the "corporate knowledge," quite literally-of the private sector as part of a single national and multinational strategic framework.
In the course of your thinking, you must focus on the value of understanding different languages and study one yourself; understand different cultures; study determined adversaries; and seek new ways to develop cooperation and collaboration. This approach reflects another giant for whom one of your academic buildings is named, General reading is the rock upon which you will build the rest of your career Let me say a word to our international students and the interagency partners. You have a special and important role here as teachers to help internationalize the thinking of military students and teach them how the international and interagency communities work. Each person who passes through this university will play a different role in our collective security-some will wear a uniform, whether here in the United States or abroad in our partner nations' armed forces; some will be diplomats; some will eventually work in the private sector. In the end, you will be the sum of what you teach each other.
Optimism is a force multiplier, as Colin Powell always said. As you think about the 21 st -century security environment, beware of endless pessimism: the past is not all bad; neither is the present nor future all challenges and threats.
Indeed, there has been what I call "hopeful progress" over the past decades in places such as Peru, Colombia, and the Balkans, and in dealing significant blows to al Qaeda and transnational criminal organizations and cartels. We have also developed new and stunning technologies in everything from facial recognition to missile defense. Our advances in Special Forces are incredible.
Of course, the men and women in all our militaries-all volunteers here and increasingly so across the world-show us daily their courage, honor, and commitment. Our Special Forces have been through the cycle of triumph and tragedy in the last few months, from killing Osama bin Laden to losing so many of their own. Yet they stand and deliver, determined and proud, each day.
There is also promise in geopolitics as rising democratic nations such as India, Brazil, Turkey, Poland, and Indonesia flourish-all of which are taking increasing roles of leadership and importance in their respective regions. We are fortunate in the United States to have positive relations with these nations and others, and many of those relations started in groups in educational settings, like what I see before me.
Europe is still vitally important, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is a foundational element of global security. At NATO and U.S. European Command, our specific challenges run the gamut from Afghanistan and Libya to the more nuanced situations such as illicit trafficking, terrorism, piracy, cyber security, and even strategic communication. In these different missions, we find that successfully meeting and then overcoming them require what we call the comprehensive approach-bringing together and synergizing the talents and abilities of military and civilian, foreign and domestic, public and private sectors. Afghanistan is an example: we are teaching literacy to the Afghan army (well over 100,000 today read) and partnering in telecommunications and other sectors.
We need to continue doing this collaboratively: within and across governments and their agencies; within and between public and private enterprises; throughout academic institutions; and, most importantly, within our shared homes. Security requires complex and coordinated responses that move at the speed of thought.
Diversity of capabilities, capacities, and responses to any challenge should be seen as a strength, not a weakness, but only if the actions and tools can be used synergistically. This can only happen when all the interested parties adopt a common vision for security built on the foundation of trust and confidence and achieved through coordination, cooperation, and partnering.
Again, in today's security environment, progress and success will result not from building walls, but from building bridges. We need to do this with speed. We will prevail if we think about innovation, if we think about how to take the next step, if we recognize that opportunities exist in real time and have a limited shelf life. We need to be prepared to move quickly in response to emergent opportunities. This is brain-on-brain warfare and that is how we will win in the end-by outthinking our opponents.
I'd like to close with an example from something that most of you are probably familiar with and use every day-I know I do-Wikipedia. The vision statement of Wikimedia Foundation, Wikipedia's parent company, is "A world in which every human being can freely share in the sum of ALL [emphasis added] knowledge." The sum of all human knowledge-all of us thinking together are smarter than any one of us thinking alone.
As I look out across this wonderful group, I cannot wait to see and learn what you will contribute to that sum. You will be partan important part-of the sum of all security.
I am full of the happiest of memories as I stand with you today. I remember my children when they were small. I remember the incredible luxury of time to read, think, and write. I remember the friendships of my classmates that now stretch across two decades. All that is ahead of you in this next year, and I envy you the voyage.
Godspeed and open water to each of you, Class of 2012. JFQ in today's security environment, progress and success will result not from building walls, but from building bridges
National Defense University (Katherine Lewis)
T he U.S. Army War College (USAWC) begins the academic year with a dedicated Strategic Thinking course, the first of six core courses that, along with electives, comprise the 10-month resident curriculum. The primary mission of the USAWC is to prepare students for the challenges of leadership at the strategic level, so it is appropriate to start the year with a course on the cognitive skills required for success at that level. However, for many newly arriving students, strategic thinking is a new and somewhat perplexing concept. They have been highly successful in their military careers to date, but most of their experience is at the tactical level of war. Success at the strategic level requires additional competencies and skills in order to navigate the volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous landscape characteristic of the strategic environment. 
1
Both public strategy documents from recent administrations and actual American strategic behavior suggest that U.S. political and military leaders have been increasingly inclined to equate strategy with listing desirable goals, as opposed to figuring out how to achieve them. As a practical matter, strategy is about making insightful choices of courses of action likely to achieve one's ultimate goals despite resource constraints, political considerations, bureaucratic resistance, the adversary's opposing efforts, and the intractable uncertainties as to how a chosen strategy may ultimately work out.

While review of the strategic management literature identifies a clear consensus on the importance of strategic thinking, there is a wide variance of thought and opinion on how to conduct it (more on this below). Articles that contain a succinct discussion of strategic thinking and provide a coherent framework that might help budding national security professionals to understand what constitutes strategic thinking and how to go about improving it, both individually and within an organization, are difficult to find. This article attempts to address this vacuum by synthesizing the major schools of thought within a strategic thinking framework developed to help USAWC students better understand and employ this critical competency. The article begins with a brief discussion of the historical development behind the differing approaches to strategic thinking and a definition of strategic thinking. It then discusses the USAWC approach to teaching strategic thinking, to include the framework, within the curriculum.
Authors from within the military and national security literature deal extensively with the theory of war, strategy development, and strategic execution (for example, Clausewitz, Jomini, B.H. Liddell Hart, Edward Luttwak). These materials clearly provide insights about strategic thinking in the broadest sense, but most authors do not delve into specific discussions of strategic thinking and its conduct. For that, one has to turn to the business literature where strategic thinking has received extensive coverage.
While strategic thinking is a wellestablished concept within the strategic management literature, there is not a consensus definition of it. The fact that there are many definitions does not indicate a debate about the validity or effectiveness of strategic thinking per se but is primarily due to the differing approaches in how to conduct strategic thinking within an organizational setting. Many schools of strategy-making have emerged over the years; indeed, Henry Mintzberg, an internationally renowned strategic management academic and author, has categorized 10 distinct strategy formulation schools.

USAWC has traditionally taught this balanced approach to strategic thinking. However, while stressing that strategic thinking involves both analytic and creative thinking processes, these processes were generally given equal weight as to their importance to the strategic thinker. This author believes that both are indeed important but that creativity and the ability to use systems thinking to holistically assess all aspects of an organization's internal and external key factors are what truly empower effective strategic thinking. Critical thinking is perhaps the most important attribute for a military officer at all levels of the organization, but for the strategic thinker, it is in and of itself insufficient. Creativity and a systems approach, augmented by critical thinking, are the true province of strategic thinking. It is therefore fair to say that while the author recommends a balanced approach to strategic thinking, there is a subtle bias toward the importance of art in the execution. In a 1959 address to the Naval War College, the eminent strategist Bernard Brodie captured this nuance quite well: let us remember that scientific method is useful and is being used in exploring alternative choices but not in making the final choice. The latter depends ultimately on good judgment, which is to say on the informed intuition of a person or of a group of persons who have been brought up in a particular indoctrination and whose approach to their work is fundamentally that of the artist, not of the scientist. 
12
Strategic thinking is an intentdriven activity. 
13
14
There are specific skills required to be a successful strategic thinker. Over the first 2 weeks of the academic year, USAWC students are presented with 10 discrete lessons that introduce these thinking skills as well as critical competencies such as self-awareness, openness to dialogue, and awareness of cultural influences that are necessary to be an effective strategic thinker (see table).
Focus Description 
Examination of a complex "wicked problem" (Israel-Palestine) using all thinking skills per the Strategic Thinking Framework in order to achieve a higher level of understanding of the issue Note: To locate the faculty papers on critical and creative thinking by Dr. Steve Gerras and Chuck Allen, respectively, go to the USAWC DCLM Web site at <www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/dclm/facultyPublications.cfm>. Ethics clearly can have a moral or emotional basis that would tend to defy an analytical label. However, USAWC teaches ethical reasoning skills that leverage an analytical methodology to inform and aid strategic thinking. It is on this basis that it is classified as a variant of critical thinking.
The Strategic Thinking Framework (see figure ) shows how these various skills and competencies interrelate. It depicts the strategic thinking process and demonstrates the relationship between the past (history), present, and desired future direction (or vision) for the organization. True strategic thinking always involves thinking in time, as it seeks to answer the question: "Having seen the future that we want to create, what must we keep from our past, lose from the past, and create in our present, to get there?" 
15
16
During a recent visit to the USAWC, a senior Army leader who also has extensive strategic leadership experience in the commercial sector offered that there is a central issue that all senior leaders (in both military and commercial domains) are always thinking about: Do I have my strategies right, and are they executable? 
17
18
19
Systems thinking is also central to the strategic thinking process and, like creative thinking, is a fundamentally different means of thinking than that used in traditional analytical processes. Russell Ackoff described this difference in his book Creating the Corporate Future: Analysis looks into things; synthesis looks out of things. Machine-Age thinking was concerned only with the interactions of the parts of the thing to be explained; systems thinking is similarly concerned, but it is additionally occupied with the interactions of that thing with other things in its environment and with its environment itself. 
20
This iterative synthesis of insights, ideas, and identified key factors is used to develop improved judgment, which is a critical output of the strategic thinking process. This improved judgment will in turn inform the development of strategies within the organization's traditional strategic planning processes that align the organizational vision with the future environment, thus making the organization more competitive and successful in that future environment. These strategies then become the current strategy, and the cycle continues.
The feedback loop is a critically important piece of the Strategic Thinking Framework. Mintzberg has described strategy-making as both deliberate and emergent in nature; in other words, "strategies can form as well as be formulated." 
21
22
This feedback loop is more than just noting lessons learned. To be true strategic thinkers and to enable organizational learning, the insights generated from implementation of deliberate strategies and the success or failure of emergent strategies must be leveraged through a higher level learning process within the organization. Professor Loizos Heracleous addressed this critical point when he outlined differing viewpoints on the nature of strategic thinking and its relationship to different levels of learning by examining the contributions of four prominent academics. 
23
24
The Strategic Thinking Framework may appear to suggest a sequential process, but this is not the author's intent, nor is it the case FEATURES | Strategic Thinking and Thinkers in practice. For example, the decisionmaking procedure used by President George W. Bush to develop the "surge" in Iraq shows how nonlinear and untidy these processes can be. President Bush gradually came to the realization that he needed to change his thinking on the conduct of the war after considering intelligence reports, the analysis of top aides and Cabinet members, and his theater and field commanders' assessments of the declining situation in Iraq. He began a deliberate process to develop a new strategy that would turn things around. His vision or strategic intent was unwavering, as what he termed as "victory" in Iraq was the goal. The President sought out new ideas from wherever he could get them, including going outside of traditional sources. Strategic reviews were conducted throughout the national security arena, including at think tanks, the National Security Council, and the Pentagon. Conflicting data, analysis, ideas, and recommendations came to the President and his staff through reports and formal meetings. Ultimately, after weighing all the evidence, the President made the decision to order the development of a counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq and increase force levels to adequately resource the strategy. Application of critical, creative, and systems thinking concepts was in evidence throughout. Nonetheless, strong points of view underpinned by unexamined assumptions and cognitive biases were also present and served to complicate strategic thinking regarding the issue. 
25
26
There are clear parallels between strategic thinking and the emerging concept of design within Army problem-solving processes. However, strategic thinking and design are not synonymous. Strategic leaders at the institutional level of the Services and Department of Defense (DOD) are focused on strategic decisions impacting the budget, major acquisition programs, and policy issues that shape and impact the enterprise as a whole. Design, as currently implemented within the Army, and especially as described in joint doctrine, has a narrower application focused at the operational and theater strategic levels of war, where it is used to apply critical and creative thinking to understand, visualize, and describe complex, ill-structured problems and develop approaches to solve them. 
27
28
Strategic thinking is a critical competency for senior leaders and their staffs. It is a purposeful, deliberate activity that seeks to generate innovative strategies and approaches to posture organizations for success in the complex and ambiguous strategic environment. The concept of strategic thinking was explained by presenting its history within the strategic management literature, and identifying three primary points of view organized across the strategy as art versus strategy as science debate. While both of these diametrically opposed viewpoints bring valid insights to the essence of strategic thinking, neither is sufficient in itself. The sound strategic thinker approaches the complex issues of the 21 st century in a balanced manner, bringing both analysis and creative/intuitive processes to self-awareness is necessary to ensure decisions are not biased by cognitive "blind spots" established due to a failure to examine all relevant points of view on an issue WATERS bear. USAWC's Strategic Thinking curriculum was outlined, and serves as a means to develop strategic thinking skills that will continue to be honed throughout the academic year. The Strategic Thinking Framework further explains the components of strategic thinking and provides an approach to inform senior leader judgment. The goal is to develop strategies that align an organization's future direction (or vision) with the future environment to gain competitive advantage.

In this article, Liedtka provides five elements of strategic thinking that demonstrate both analytical and creative processes: strategic thinking incorporates a systems perspective; it is intent-focused; involves thinking in time; is hypothesis-driven; and is intelligently opportunistic.

The primary objective of the ICAF curriculum is to prepare students for work at the strategic leader level. This objective implies that students need to understand what strategic thinking is as well as develop those thinking skills required at the strategic leader level. While the entire ICAF curriculum is designed to enhance strategic thinking skills, the Strategic Leadership (SL) Department has particularly embraced this undertaking, as evidenced by the department mission statement: "to educate and develop leaders to bring strategic thinking skills and innovative approaches to the challenges of transforming organizations, and formulating and resourcing our future national security strategy." 
1
The types of strategic leader skills discussed in the SL course can be categorized as conceptual, interpersonal, and technical. 
3
For example, consensus-building can be considered part of the interpersonal skill set. Strategic leaders using this skill have an enhanced requirement to deal with leaders outside of their chain of command-peers across other organizations, agencies, and nations. The increase in the requirement to use consensus-building skills coincides with a decrease in the degree of authoritarian power over the people whose cooperation is needed to solve problems and make decisions. Examples of strategic leaders who invested a great deal of their time building consensus include Generals Dwight Eisenhower as the Supreme Allied Commander and David Petraeus as the Multi-National Force-Iraq Commander. Some strategic leadership authors emphasize one set of strategic leader skills more than others. For example, two authors suggest that the critical individual difference variable in leader effectiveness is the conceptual competence to do the required work.

What makes strategic leaders different than leaders at other levels? SST provides a general overview of the difference in the nature of leader tasks and work among direct, operational, and strategic leadership positions. This theory was developed based on initial research of an industrial age organization in the United Kingdom in the 1960s and tested via interviews in a study with Army three-and four-star flag officers.

Several authors have proffered a definition of strategic thinking, three of which are outlined here. Gregory Foster states that strategic thinking is the "very essence of strategic leadership" and is an expected quality of leaders at the upper echelons of organizations, institutions, or states that claim superpower status. He defines strategic thinking as having "far less to do with substantive content of what one thinks about than with the process of how one goes about thinking." 
12
13
Another definition of strategic thinking proposed by Mark Grandstaff and Georgia Sorenson is that it: focuses more on long term problems and processes from a systems perspective rather than short term crises, and deals with more tenuous situations that are not susceptible to easy answers. ST [strategic thinking] includes different lenses and thought processes that are useful in any endeavor, but they are critical for senior leaders in a time of accelerating change that brings both threats and opportunities. In short, ST deals with problems that are much wider in scope, more intertwined with other problems, laden with ethical dilemmas, and that sometimes must be managed rather than solved. 
14
15
16
In addition to the aforementioned qualities of strategic thinking, the SL course addresses several specific types of skills that are important components of strategic thinking (see table ). While students certainly used these thinking processes and exercised these skills in their previous leadership experiences, the scope and quality (power) of the mental models used in employing these skills at the strategic leadership level are what set them apart.
The SL course also introduces students to the concept of the mental model, or the decisionmaker's dynamic representation of the decision space with which he or she must deal. It can be considered a mini-decision support system as it reveals cause and effect linkages if it is accurate and comprehensive.

While conceptual capacity and strategic leader experience are essential for becoming a strategic thinker, mastery in the art of strategic thinking is achieved by understanding when and how to exercise the strategic thinking skills listed in the table. A proposed description or definition of the mastery involved in being a strategic thinker is one who possesses the conceptual understanding of the increasing levels of sophistication in the breadth and complexity of the variables in the strategic environment. The strategic thinker is conscious of the limita-tions of her/his mental models and understands how to compensate for them. She/ he uses multiple frames of reference (her/ his own and that of her/his executive team) and a multidimensional systems perspective to solve complex wicked problems. She/he reframes the problem as more information/ evidence from the environment is acquired and continuously considers the long-term, multiple-order consequences of her/his projected decisions.
ICAF provides a valuable transformational opportunity for students to develop their strategic thinking skills. While the curriculum cannot provide direct, handson strategic level experience, it is designed to enhance student conceptual capacity as well as to provide vicarious strategic-level experience through its seminar discussions, readings, and exposure to strategic leaders across the military, government, and private sector via the guest speaker program. According to Forsythe and Barber, "It is not enough simply to expose students to a large amount of information; they must be challenged to organize the information into meaningful categories and to form interconnections among elements."

Each of the ICAF courses tasks students via exercises, paper requirements, and discussions to develop their conceptual capacity by analyzing, evaluating, and synthesizing the knowledge they acquire. And while ICAF pushes them through its curriculum, it will be up to each student to make sense of these complex global and national security issues. For those students willing to apply themselves to the readings, papers, and exercises and, more important, to reflect upon, discuss, and challenge their current mental models of the many global and national security issues, then they will see a remarkable growth in their conceptual capacity by graduation. While this year cannot provide students the requisite experience of a strategic leader, it will serve as a catalyst to enhance student conceptual capacity, which is essential as the foundation for becoming a strategic thinker. JFQ CARPENTER I n 1986, Congress passed the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense (DOD) Reorganization Act to improve Service effectiveness in executing joint operations. Title IV of the act called for the establishment of a Joint Specialty Officer (JSO) designation to identify those officers particularly educated and experienced in joint matters. 
1
Despite overwhelming efforts to strengthen joint professional military education, little has occurred to exploit the experiential skills and competencies derived from joint assignments. Because of its failure to designate career paths and implement a career management plan for joint officers, DOD is losing valuable expert knowledge. This article explores the DOD Joint Officer Development (JOD) approach and highlights the effects of career management methodologies on joint officers. It recommends that DOD identify and implement a specific career management plan for joint professionals, including designated career paths, which will improve the performance and effectiveness of joint organizations.
Goldwater-Nichols instituted comprehensive changes in the organizational structure and functional authority of DOD. Prior to the act's passage, a congressional report characterized the overall performance of officers assigned to joint duty as follows: The authors of Goldwater-Nichols believed DOD needed to develop a joint organization perspective for how military forces should operate. Men mean more than guns in the rating of a ship. To ensure the proper career development of officers assigned to joint organizations, Goldwater-Nichols tasked the Secretary of Defense to establish career guidelines, including types of duty assignments, for officers designated as joint specialists. Clearly, Congress intended for JSOs to serve a unique purpose in the joint organization-to provide comprehensive, inherently joint strategic advice to senior military commanders and top civilian officials. Likewise, Congress also directed the purposeful career development of JSOs to serve as the mechanism to generate and retain joint expertise, thereby transforming the military into a cohesive joint organization.
In 1989, Representative Ike Skelton (D-MO) led a House Armed Services Committee Panel on Professional Military Education to review DOD implementation of key Goldwater-Nichols's provisions. In conducting its review, the Skelton Panel found it essential to fully understand the meaning and purpose of a joint specialist: "Parenthetically, the panel is convinced that defining the JSO is the crux of the problem posed for DOD by all of the Title IV joint officer personnel policies."

The Skelton Panel also recognized the need to select theoretical strategists and strategic advisors from among those officers skilled in the application of strategy.

Categorizing jobs as either developing or using jobs is one methodology used to articulate the functional description that various positions serve in an organization. 
8
Using jobs, on the other hand, are ones in which the officer, based on accumulated competencies, proficiencies, and/or experiences, is expected to perform key functions on behalf of the organization. Within the organization, using jobs usually demand a high degree of accountability and stability and are often critical to the success of the organization. 
9
In general terms, individuals pass through developmental assignments as they rise in an organization. Since developmental opportunities are often limited, the organization needs an assignment management plan to move individuals systematically through a sequence of positions that develops particular competencies valuable to the organization and makes the individual competitive for a using job at the higher level. A rational sequence of developing jobs can be described as a professional career path. These identifiable job patterns suggest that accumulated experience is not serendipitous; therefore, career management is vital to the success of the organization.

In 2005, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff published his vision for Joint Officer Development. The JOD concept is based on the guiding principle that joint officers are derived from Service officers. 
12
13
The JOD concept as outlined by the Chairman is not a complete solution. Familiarity with joint operations from a Service perspective does not transform into joint competency. The results of the Navy's Fiscal Year 2012 Major Command Board reflect the haphazard and nonbinding approach to joint officer development. The board, which convened in November 2010, selected 41 Surface Warfare Officers to serve in O-6 command positions. The Surface Warfare Community considers selectees to be its top officers, those with potential to serve as flag officers. Of the 41 officers selected, just 13 (31.7 percent) have completed Joint Professional Military Education (JPME) Phase II, and only 11 (26.8 percent) are joint qualified. More alarming is the fact that two of the officers selected have not yet completed familiarity with joint operations from a Service perspective does not transform into joint competency CARPENTER JPME Phase I. 
14
From the individual officer's perspective, why serve in a joint assignment when more than three times the officers being selected to serve in a flag officer milestone assignment have no joint experience? 
15
16
The DOD plan for Joint Officer Management (JOM) is designed to develop officers progressively in joint matters throughout their careers. It includes alternate ways that are currently being missed to recognize and award officers with joint experience credit, as long as the position and/or context of work are relevant to joint matters. 
17
18
19
Goldwater-Nichols sanctioned the joint specialist as a professional of the joint community. Establishment of joint officer career paths and career management guidelines consisting of developing jobs, advanced education opportunities, and using jobs at the upper levels of our national and military organizations would better support JOD. To move forward, DOD should ask specific questions regarding the value and demand for joint officers, principally: What is the relative importance of joint officer experience? How does it relate to joint organizational outcomes? What career paths and management policies will sustain its development?
In congressional testimony in 2009, Lieutenant General David Barno, USA (Ret.), observed that our current officer management system paradoxically identifies expert tacticians for promotion and then expects them to magically recreate themselves as strategic leaders. His testimony highlighted the fact that the Services' management policies are almost exclusively biased toward the tactical level and command, and that those who pursue specialization, even in areas as vitally important as national security and military strategy formulation, risk upward mobility because Service policies do not value this kind of expertise. 
20
Joint expertise comes from increasingly challenging and reinforcing joint assignments. However, there are no definitive, qualifying measures of effectiveness regarding joint officer proficiency or joint expertise. Observations by various joint staff officers and senior leaders indicate that on average, joint staff officers experience a 7-to 12-month learning curve. 
21
22

The selection of an appropriate career development model largely depends on whose perspective is being considered: the individual officer, the joint organization, or the officer's Service organization. 
23
24
An Interagency Assignment Officer Career Management study conducted by RAND in 1999 offers examples for how DOD could manage a cadre of joint specialists. The authors described the career model being used for managing combat arms officers as managing the "generalist." 
25
The RAND study also considered various career models applicable to managing a specialized group of officers, such as a cadre of joint officers. These career models can be described as: â  â  managing leader succession: joint officers are managed in a manner to identify those qualified to fill the top Service positions (higher promotion rates, shorter tour lengths) â  â  managing competencies: emphasis is on developing intensely experienced officers in joint matters through longer and repeated joint assignments â  â  managing skills: used to distribute joint experience throughout the officer corps 
26
Tables 2, 3, and 4 capture characteristics associated with officers and the career model.
In 2009, RAND completed an analysis that compared the managing leader succession, managing competencies, and managing skills career models. Table 
5
27
First, it is important to note that when considering the managing skills model, there is no relative difference for promotion between those combat arms officers who have joint experience and those who do not. This can be attributed to the fact that average officers promote and retain equally. Second, the analysis of using the managing competencies model for joint officers, which results in a slightly less than average promotion rate to O-6 compared to average non-joint qualified combat arms officers, is more indicative of completing an O-5 command assignment (keep in mind those officers who become part of a cadre of joint officers will serve in multiple joint assignments instead of command assignments, which make them relatively less competitive for promotion to O-6). It is also important to consider that if DOD only prescribes a small number of O-6 jobs and no GO/FO jobs for joint officers managed by the competency model, promotion opportunities beyond O-5 will be extremely limited; therefore, the majority of joint officers will not remain in the military beyond that level.
The relatively shorter joint assignment in the managing leader succession model is consistent with a pattern of developing leaders. This model presumes that only higher quality officers would be sent to joint assignments but would not remain in those jobs for long, and only a minimal number would serve a second joint assignment prior to promotion to GO/FO.

DOD must revisit the original idea of the joint specialist, the creation of which was intended to improve the performance and effectiveness of joint organizations. Because the Services are responsible for managing officer assignments, the Service perspective takes priority over the joint perspective when it comes to developing officers. Hence, joint qualification resembles a time-share approach where officers serve in a joint billet for a brief interlude before returning to their primary career path.

To organize and staff this cadre of joint professionals, DOD could implement a lateral entry process similar to that shown below.

Joint specialists aspiring to the most demanding joint billets should know what kind of joint expertise is needed to do the job.

The United States remains the only nation able to project and sustain large-scale military operations over extended distances. We maintain superior capabilities to deter and defeat adaptive enemies and to ensure the credibility of security partnerships that are fundamental to regional and global security. In this way, our military continues to underpin our national security and global leadership, and when we use it appropriately, our security and leadership is reinforced. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM), a supporting unified command providing joint mobility forces to geographic combatant commanders and also serving as the Defense Distribution Process Owner. The mission of USTRANSCOM is to get the warfighters to the fight, sustain them during the fight, support rapid force maneuver and patient movement, and finally, bring the warfighters home.

USTRANSCOM's timely delivery of forces and cargo would not be possible without the CRAF. The quid pro quo relationship between DOD and CRAF commercial airline partners provides DOD airlift in time of national emergency, in exchange for the opportunity to bid on DOD peacetime business. Today, CRAF participation and annual DOD payments to CRAF carriers for airlift services are at an all-time high, nearly $3.4 billion. 
4
5
USTRANSCOM's current challenge is to find innovative ways to leverage CRAF capability to gain speed, efficiency, and capacity for the warfighter. USTRANSCOM Commander General Duncan J. McNabb recently testified to Congress that "rapid global mobility is critical to USTRANSCOM's quick reaction capability to meet the needs of the joint forces and we need to continue recapitalizing our air mobility force."

The CRAF experiment was born out of the U.S. experience in World War II when President Franklin D. Roosevelt granted authority to take possession of any commercial aircraft required by the war effort.

While just over half of current CRAF capacity is required to meet DOD worst-case scenarios, the entire CRAF fleet is vulnerable to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) policy, limiting employment capability. DOD could realize full CRAF capability if partner airlines received relief from FAA operating restrictions while flying DOD missions. Since CRAF partners are required to be U.S. flagged carriers, they must operate under FAA Part 121 or 135 rules (commercial or commuter airlines) that regulate activities even while flying DOD missions. Depending on the mission, these restrictions can limit capability and efficiency of CRAF operations when compared to similar organic DOD missions that are not encumbered by FAA restrictions. One example of an FAA restriction is Special Federal Aviation Regulation No. 77, which prohibits operations in Iraqi airspace. 
21
22
Another operational limitation to CRAF capability is restricting carriers from operating in designated high threat areas, where many of USTRANSCOM's customers require airlift. In several cases, the restriction is due to CRAF aircraft lacking costly defensive systems designed to counter Man Portable Air Defense Systems (MANPADS) threats common to many of the nonpermissive airfields U.S. forces use today. MANPADS are portable shoulder-launched surface-toair missiles that pose the greatest threat to aircraft during takeoff and landing phases. Future threats may also limit CRAF aircraft from operating in a chemical or biological contamination area. These restrictions typically force CRAF aircraft to land short of a destination and transload cargo to an AMC aircraft with defensive systems. Another operational workaround is to schedule CRAF aircraft on strategic missions outside of the threat area, preserving the organic fleet for the threat areas. To illustrate, prior to 9/11, CRAF flew 24 percent of DOD channel cargo missions, the regularly scheduled timesensitive resupply missions delivered directly to the user at DOD installations with major air cargo hubs. 
23
24
Mitigating the MANPADS threat will allow the CRAF fleet to operate without restriction in more locations and bring more capability to the warfighter. Regrettably, aircraft mounted defensive systems like Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures (LAIRCM) are cost prohibitive to install on the CRAF. Another cost-effective option to allow access to high threat airfields is to install counter-MANPADS technology to protect specific airfields. One such ground-based system called the Counter Man-Portable Air Defense System (CMAPS) detects multiple threats, tracks them, and destroys the targets using directed energy, similar to LAIRCM protocol. 
25
Because CRAF leverages existing commercial airline capabilities, the DOD focus has always been on strategic airlift. A new contractor capability to investigate is the civilian air tanker, which is gaining momentum as enterprising companies seek to meet expanding military aerial refueling requirements around the world. Additionally, there are two new multirole tanker/transport aircraft. The Boeing KC-46A and the EADS KC-45 are mobility platforms with CRAF potential.
The idea of paying a premium to CRAF carriers for new capability began during the 1980s, when the U.S. Air Force paid more than $600 million to modify 24 commercial CRAF airplanes to accommodate outsize equipment. 
26
27
28
29
The 2010 DOD Mobility Capabilities and Requirements Study highlights the Air Force tanker shortfall. This 2-year study examined three representative scenarios that would employ mobility assets. The Air Force tanker fleet came up 93 aircraft short of meeting requirements in the 2 most constrained cases.

In today's global economy, innovative options are needed to bring foreign capability to the CRAF. USTRANSCOM is required to first award airlift contracts to U.S. flag carriers that are part of the CRAF. However, when CRAF does not have capability, partners are allowed to subcontract to approved foreign flag carriers that meet the requirement. 
37
38

Exploring options to capture foreign capability for the CRAF should also include options for offering excess CRAF capacity to international partners at a reasonable reimbursement rate. The opportunity to strengthen international partnerships and build new ones using commercial resources that already operate globally offers efficiency and effectiveness. Additionally, building these global partnerships can be beneficial to DOD by taking advantage of commercial expertise operating outside of the continental United States and providing competitive bid pricing. By way of example, USTRANSCOM recently awarded 12 contracts worth $2.4 billion for vertical lift technology and for short takeoff and vertical landing (STOVL) capability in Afghanistan. 
43
44
45
46
USTRANSCOM and CRAF partners share many common interests, making future lift technologies beneficial to both. As DOD begins research, development, and testing on the next generation of mobility aircraft, it is beneficial to dialogue with CRAF partners to determine if there is a business case for a civilian variant. Future purchases of military aircraft will be more cost effective in both production and sustainment if they can be tied to a commercial production line. One such future technology with mutually beneficial opportunity is the heavy lift hybrid airship. With payload estimates in the 1,000-ton category, advocates believe this future platform will fill voids between sea lift ships and cargo aircraft.

With participation and DOD payments to CRAF carriers at the highest level in history, future capacity appears assured. Organic fleet sizes and contingency planning factors have been adjusted to take full advantage of CRAF capacity. In 2008, former USTRANSCOM commander and now Air Force Chief General Norton Schwartz testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that limiting Air Force C-17 purchases to 205 airplanes was needed because the DOD organic fleet competes in peacetime with the CRAF.

The previous arguments offer opportunities for USTRANSCOM to investigate further each of the four recommendation areas summarized below.
Enhance Current Capabilities. The first recommendation is to develop a comprehensive list of FAA operating restrictions that limit the CRAF. A possible discussion forum to gain insight from CRAF carriers is the newly created CRAF EWG. After reaching a consensus, USTRANSCOM can begin a dialogue with the FAA to determine pragmatic solutions that would afford CRAF carriers on DOD missions relief from restrictive operating regulations. Another recommendation to enhance capability by flying CRAF aircraft into airfields threatened by MANPADS is to investigate options to employ CMAPS at selected airfields. Adding this capability to the Air Force Contingency Response Wing's airfield opening and sustainment functions is a possible employment option.
New Commercial Capabilities. Implementing the second recommendation, adding commercial capability, will take further discussions between USTRANSCOM and industry. With the KC-46A still not in production and the KC-135 fleet approaching 50 years, reestablishment of the CARWG to review options with industry appears to offer an established venue. A future review by the CARWG should also include U.S. allies who have already begun taking advantage of KC-X technologies. Japan and Italy purchased the Boeing KC-767 (a similar version of the KC-46A), while Australia, Great Britain, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates bought EADS KC-45s. 
60

62
Partner with Industry on Future Technologies. Partnering with the transportation industry is one of USTRANSCOM's functions as the deployment and distribution process owner and architect of future DOD transportation systems. As USTRANSCOM moves forward in developing the next generation of mobility capabilities, opportunities exist to create a formal mechanism like the CARWG or the EWG that will partner with the commercial airline industry to leverage their innovations and efficiencies. Since CRAF carriers compete for profitability with many of the same capabilities as AMC, understanding the future commercial marketplace will prove beneficial as USTRANSCOM defines future requirements. Additionally, since future military production lines will achieve the greatest cost savings when tied to a commercial production line, early dialogue with CRAF partners and airline manufacturers offers opportunities to create sustainability and efficiency and to bring new capabilities in a fiscally responsible manner.
Today more than ever, DOD needs fiscally sound and pragmatic solutions to maximize capability, minimize cost, win the long war, and recapitalize the force. Former Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates also emphasized that future DOD budget growth must stop. Zero growth, together with the increasing cost of energy, operations, and sustainment, will disproportionately affect future procurement accounts. Additionally, with economic uncertainty and the focus on debt reduction, Congress will tighten supplemental wartime funding, forcing more capability from the DOD budget. The Congressional Budget Office calculated the cost of operations in Iraq and Afghanistan to date at $1.1 trillion, and estimates another $1.7 trillion will be spent over the next decade to complete these operations.

Like its predecessors, CJTF-82 faced numerous challenges in the course of its year-long rotation. RC(E) was responsible for an area the size of Ohio, with 14 provinces, 159 districts, and approximately 10 million inhabitants, with a 930-kilometer shared border with Pakistan (the distance from New York City to Fort Bragg, North Carolina). The Hindu Kush mountain range, a forbidding natural barrier, bisects RC(E) from east to west. Of great importance, more than 70 percent of the RC(E) population lives within 100 kilometers of the Pakistani border, mostly concentrated along the few major highways leading to Kabul and through Jalalabad to the Khyber Pass. Slightly more than 60 percent of its inhabitants are ethnic Pashtuns, historic rivals of the Tajik (19 percent) and Hazara (10 percent) tribal groupings. A special case are the famously xenophobic and fiercely independent Nuristanis, about 5 percent of the RC(E) population, who speak an entirely distinct language and live, largely isolated, in the high mountains of Nuristan. 
1
Information. In the predeployment planning phase, the commanding general identified information as "the primary line of effort and first planning consideration." The campaign plan stated the problem clearly: "We will not succeed unless the Afghan population perceives the Government of Afghanistan as legitimate and enduring. We will fail if we lose the will of our supporting populations."
Security. Early experiences in both Iraq and Afghanistan showed a clear bias for kinetic operations and coalition-only operations. Over time, this gave way to a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between security operations and other lines of operation. Partnering with host nation security forces to secure the population was recognized as key not only to building capacity with the army and police, but also to connecting with, understanding, and leveraging the local population.
Governance. International, coalition, and Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan (GIRoA) efforts support governance through programs focused from the top down, but face difficulties connecting at the local level. In areas with limited coalition presence, the enemy seeks to fill the power vacuum with "shadow" governance by establishing local sharia judicial systems and issuing land titles. The CJTF-82 challenge was to empower and enable local governance from the bottom up.
Development. Here, efforts were focused on supporting sustainable development through economic growth. Only an integrated approach partnered with GIRoA, the international community, and U.S. Government elements in RC(E) across all lines of operation can allow Afghanistan to prosper in the long run. Vital to this approach was the presence of skilled civilian development experts in large numbers, working as part of the CJTF staff and embedded in brigades and their associated PRTs, District Support Teams, and Agricultural Development Teams.
To enhance synchronized messaging, CJTF-82 created the Communications Action Group (CAG), a small but powerful command and control node chartered to integrate and coordinate the information line of operations in support of the campaign plan. Headed by an O-6, the mission of the CAG was to "develop, synchronize, and execute the RC(E) Communications Strategy to gain and maintain the initiative against the enemy and maintain the public support necessary to achieve success in Afghanistan." The enemy in Afghanistan rarely fights to take or hold ground; every operation is conducted with an information objective in mind. Always, the insurgent message characterized the coalition as "infidel occupiers"-a powerful, emotive theme that was difficult to refute. To counter this approach, RC(E) moved the information fight to center stage.
The CJTF-82 Communications Strategy was published on a single slide, organized along the four lines of operation. It provided basic messaging guidance to subordinate units, amplified for specific operations in the communications annex in CJTF orders. Operating within this general framework, units tailored broadcast and print products for their local areas and specific requirements. Importantly, all CJTF messaging was firmly grounded in the truth-good or bad. The communications strategy proved exceptionally useful in focusing different organizations along simple, broad themes that supported the campaign concept, while allowing a flexible and rapid approach to fast-moving, local situations.
CJTF-82 and its subordinate units communicated in three primary ways. The first and most important was by broadcast. Roughly 60 percent of the RC(E) population has access to television, but virtually
The MobyGroup multimedia firm in Kabul created media campaign to promote Afghan Security Forces and build stronger ties with Afghan people DOD DOD HOOKER all are avid radio listeners. Accordingly, CJTF-82 handed out hundreds of thousands of handcranked AM/FM radios, mostly in rural areas. Building on an existing network of 26 radio stations, CJTF-82 expanded it to more than 55. These offthe-shelf systems or "Radios in a Box" (RIABs) employed locally recruited Afghan announcers and script writers and operated from coalition bases throughout RC(E). Using Afghan programming obtained through commercial contracts, they enabled coalition forces to reach into all but the most mountainous areas with local news, poetry, music, and religious content, as well as public service announcements crafted in accordance with our communications strategy. Units also purchased air time from commercial radio stations where available to augment their broadcasts. Whereas higher headquarters conducted broadcast messaging nationwide, CJTF-82 focused on regional and local themes of more immediate interest to the specific local population.
CJTF-82 units supplemented broadcast messaging with print products such as posters, handbills, billboards, and leaflets designed to communicate messages visually to a largely illiterate population. As with radio and TV spots, local Afghan staff was incorporated during preparation of print products to ensure coherent and culturally authentic messages, as well as pretesting in the local community. In August 2009, in the weeks preceding the national elections, CJTF-82 disseminated one million "get out the vote" print products per week-more than the Afghan government distributed across the entire country-swamping the Taliban's effort.
While CJTF-82's Information Operations section supervised RIAB and print operations, the Public Affairs (PA) section handled all interaction with media organizations as well as traditional command information programs. Supported by a 26-soldier Mobile PA Detachment and 6-soldier PA Detachment, the PA section supported embedded media throughout RC(E), operated a media operations center at Bagram airfield, published a monthly command information magazine, and provided daily content (both text and photos) on RC(E) to national and international news organizations. CJTF-82's social messaging activities, which included a popular Web site as well as Facebook and Twitter sites, proved extremely successful and experienced a five-fold growth in subscribers in the course of the rotation. Perhaps most importantly, the RC(E) PA section built up and leveraged ongoing relationships with more than 110 local press organizations in eastern Afghanistan.
Broadcast and print media proved to be powerful communications tools, but in an oral, narrative culture like Afghanistan's, nothing can replace traditional, faceto-face communications on the ground. The CJTF Key Leader Engagement (KLE) cell focused on the Command Group 4 as a key messaging tool, supporting more than 490 engagements with senior Afghan, coalition, international, and U.S. Government and opinion leaders to tell the CJTF story. Subordinate commanders did the same, supported by International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), ISAF Joint Command (IJC), and CJTF communications guidance. While KLEs have been used for several years in Afghanistan, their conscious use as a messaging tool in support of a coherent communications strategy, synchronized and in concert with other complementary means, was an innovation that consistently produced great results.
Early on, CJTF-82 recognized that many of the skills associated with successful synchronized communications lie outside traditional military career fields. Accordingly, the task force entered into a partnership with The MobyGroup, a large multimedia commercial firm based in Kabul, to create a holistic media campaign to promote Afghan Security Forces and to build stronger ties between the Afghan people in RC(E) and local and national governance. The result was a print and broadcast campaign that leveraged commercial marketing, concept development, and production capabilities. Tailored with local ethnic differences in mind, the campaign featured posters, billboards, and TV and radio spots in both Dari and Pashto, with imagery geared to Pashtun, Tajik, or Hazara audiences as appropriate. The campaign, created by Afghans for Afghans, proved strikingly successful throughout RC(E).
These principles and concepts drove the CJTF-82 information effort-a campaign every bit as real and consequential as any kinetic operation. Some operations were phased, long-duration efforts, like Operation Jaeza (Reward), an integrated, synchronized campaign to establish community safety tiplines. Battlespace owners used their RIABs, face-to-face engagements, and print products to inform the population about the tiplines. As awareness grew, Afghans in increasing numbers began to call in the location of improvised explosive devices and weapons caches, often for cash payments under the Department of Defense Rewards Program. Units also handed out cell phones to trusted local leaders and personalities to facilitate call-ins. Over time, actionable calls rose exponentially, saving hundreds of lives. By integrating all messaging entities coherently, CJTF-82 dominated the information fight to a degree not seen in Afghanistan since the conflict began.
Civil-military cooperation has long been recognized as essential to success in COIN, but execution on the ground has often been uneven and difficult. While agency cultures and doctrinal differences are always present, truly integrated civil-military operations are clearly the way ahead. During its Operation Enduring Freedom X (OEF X) rotation in 2009-2010, CJTF-82 broke new ground with unified action-the first-ever attempt to fuse military and civilian organizations into one operational headquarters.
At the transfer of authority from the 101 st Airborne Division to the 82 d on June 4, 2009, there were three civilians posted to the headquarters. That began to change quickly. In July 2009, the U.S. Embassy in Kabul converted the Political Advisor position to that of Senior Civilian Representative (SCR) of the Ambassador. Empowered with Chief of Mission authority to "coordinate and direct all U.S. Mission-related civilian personnel and programs in RC(E) . . . [to]   broadcast and print media proved to be powerful communications tools, but nothing can replace traditional, face-to-face communications on the ground RECALL | Operation Enduring Freedom X: CJTF-82 and the Future of COIN achieve unity of civilian effort and effective implementation of an integrated civilianmilitary strategy," the SCR was directed to "serve as the U.S. civilian counterpart to the military commander in the Regional Command (RC), to senior coalition civilians and to senior local Afghan officials." In this role, the SCR cosigned, with the commanding general, the CJTF-82 campaign plan (Operation Champion Sahar) on October 17, 2009. Unified action aimed to create synergy among related functions on the CJTF staff and with similar organizations at the IJC and ISAF levels. It leveraged resident expertise on both the civilian and military sides. It also enhanced cooperation and coordination between two different worlds and cultures: a military traditionally focused on conflict and combat, and a civilian interagency process focused on diplomacy and development. This unique organization, a true civilian/military hybrid unlike any seen before, included senior military Civil Affairs officers as well as career experts from the Departments of State and Agriculture, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), and other government agencies up to Senior Executive Service rank. Drawing on the assets and capabilities of the entire CJTF staff and tying in with parallel organizations above and below, it quickly energized development and governance efforts and brought coherence and focus using resources never before available.
The civilian uplift began in earnest in early September with the arrival of eight USAID specialists in water, agriculture, governance, rule of law, program management, and economics-specialties with applications for both governance and development. At the outset, the SCR directed the staff to organize to support four major objective areas: development in selected commercially viable provinces (Nangarhar, Kunar, and Laghman); support to identified "pilot" districts (Khogyani in Nangarhar Province and Sarkani in Kunar Province); provincial transition to lead security responsibility, beginning with the stable provinces of Bamyan and Panjshir; and stabilization throughout the rest of RC(E).
While the objective teams worked to address the challenges described above, the "civilian platform" continued to grow across RC(E), expanding unified action to brigade, battalion, and even company level.

Unified action also enabled clear progress on rule of law in RC(E), supporting advancements in evidence collection, the identification and removal of corrupt officials, and the establishment of sitting supreme court judges and mobile trial judges. As one example, five district governors were removed for corruption in Nangarhar Province in the spring of 2010, and in early May a judicial commission from the Afghan supreme court charged five district line managers with corruption and opened investigations on another 13 in Paktika Province. Across RC(E), 12 corrupt Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) commanders at the district and provincial levels were removed in one 5-month period. Gains on this front will be incremental and halting but are essential in combating the corrosive corruption that threatens progress in Afghanistan.
In RC(E), unified action strove for unity of effort by synchronizing, coordinating, and integrating civilian capacities Afghan contractor and USAID representative discuss progress at hospital construction site HOOKER and expertise with military operations. This approach was driven from the top, starting with the ISAF commander and the U.S. Ambassador. Unified action has been considered theoretically for years; its conceptual framework in fact is taken directly from Army Field Manual 3-0, Operations. But it became an operational reality for the first time in RC(E) in 2009. As a new construct, it experienced many of the birthing pains that always accompany new ideas and practices. But the return has been well worth the investment. Today, a foundation has been laid for interagency cooperation in conflict areas that offers exciting opportunities and demonstrated success.
Since 9/11, U.S. and coalition forces have partnered in various ways with host nation security forces in Iraq and Afghanistan, both formally and informally. For OEF X, CJTF-82 committed to a new and different approach.

To this end, CJTF-82 replaced ETTs and PMTs with coalition maneuver units linked directly to Afghan counterparts.

Afghanistan is home to a dangerous insurgency characterized by highly organized and effective networks made up of commanders, financiers, suppliers, intelligence operatives, propagandists, and foot soldiers. To confront and defeat them, CJTF-82 refined existing joint doctrine to fit RC(E)'s unique operational environment to target insurgent networks using a full-spectrum approach. 
13
The previous rotation, with fewer troops and heavier national support element responsibilities, had delegated most targeting functions to the brigades. With more assets flowing into Afghanistan as U.S. priorities shifted from Iraq, the need to focus resources-Special Operations Forces (SOF) and conventional units, ISR, fires, aviation, information-to achieve effects against priority targets became apparent. With each operation, the CJTF adapted its processes, learning from both success and failure to improve its effects.
CJTF-82 employed two basic approaches to target anti-Afghan Forces (AAF) networks. The first called for coalition and Afghan SOF to conduct trigger-based operations against high-value individuals and key AAF leadership. 
14
Insurgent networks in Afghanistan are highly adaptive and quickly replace leaders and resupply captured materials: "Cellular networks are by their nature resilient to attacks that kill or capture single individuals, suggesting a different approach."

16
Attacking targets without analyzing network connections often resulted in tactical successes but no lasting operational effects. Expendable low-level leaders were quickly replaced. JNT analyzed the entire network-to include recruitment, training, logistical support, financing, command and control systems, leadership, and negative influencers. 17 CJTF-82 learned that "shredding" networks was possible by attacking not only key nodes in the enemy network, but also key functions simultaneously. This often took the form of major CJTFlevel operations that massed ISR and other resources for extended periods to maintain continuous pressure.
In RC(E), the CJTF found that prolonged, focused network targeting, using theater-and CJTF-level assets tasked down to the brigade level, had the largest positive impact on defeating or disrupting the insurgency across all lines of operations. Analyzing both casualties and incidents revealed marked differences. Shorter duration operations using only brigade-level assets showed no significant decrease over time, and resulted in only limited local effects. 
18
Success in COIN will not come solely from kinetic operations; much depends on successfully integrating population security with stability operations. Still, in Afghanistan, we face an implacable and deadly enemy who must be confronted when he cannot be reconciled. Joint network targeting provides insurgent networks in Afghanistan are highly adaptive and quickly replace leaders and resupply captured materials one way to strike at insurgent networks with proven effect. An intercepted insurgent radio transmission put it succinctly: "They will kill us. They will kill us all."
CJTF-82 built upon the accomplishments and lessons learned of its predecessors in RC(E) to create new structures and approaches during OEF X. Its success was made possible by many actors and agencies, both in predeployment preparation and on the ground in Afghanistan. The future of COIN clearly lies in more effective and sophisticated mastery of the information domain; in hybrid and synergistic civilmilitary teams; in fused and thoroughly integrated combined formations; and in precise and holistic network targeting. For the first time, CJTF-82 innovations and adaptations in the areas of synchronized communications, unified action, combined action, and joint network targeting translated these concepts into concrete action in an active counterinsurgency, with exciting and encouraging results. Building on a foundation of rediscovered theory and practice, as well as on hard-earned lessons from the post-9/11 era, they represent new thinking and a new counterinsurgency model for successor organizations.

Instead, Willmott and Barrett revive the worst mischaracterizations of Clausewitz and his work. They charge him with conceiving of war as exclusively the preserve of the state and its agents (p. 153). They resurrect the odd notion that Clausewitz's contention that "war is an instrument of policy" ignores civil, ethnic, religious and other "non-political" wars. They characterize Clausewitz's conception of war as "antiseptic and simplistic" (p. 4), an astounding assertion given the attention that Clausewitz devotes to intangible factors such as passion, fog, friction, and morale in books I and III of On War. They assert that Clausewitz presents a singular conception of war, an incredible misreading of a book that seeks to grapple with the many manifestations of war, from the limited wars of the ancien rÃ©gime (book VIII) to the near-total war of the Napoleonic era to the people in arms (book VI, chapter 26).
Willmott and Barrett seek to use Clausewitz as a springboard to examine factors they believe On War failed to address adequately. They aspire to provide new perspectives and to challenge conventional wisdom and periodization. Their alternative conceptions of when the modern warfare era began, their use of unusual comparisons (for example, the Civil War and the Pacific campaign of World War II), and their emphasis on wars of decolonialization rather than the Cold War examine modern war from new angles. Their analysis of conflict since the Cold War period embraces nontraditional security issues such as resource and income disparities, population growth, and globalization. They write with verve and style and provide a wealth of colorful details, reflecting the insights gained over decades of writing about naval warfare and teaching military history.
Yet even judged on these merits and ignoring its weak analysis of Clausewitz, the book falls short in three areas. First, its organization is scattered and uneven. The sections dealing with airpower, for example, devote more time to John Warden, Desert Storm, and Kosovo than to the preceding 80 years of air warfare. The portion entitled "Mahan and Corbett Reconsidered" contains absolutely no discussion of Corbett or any of his ideas. Second, the work contains a number of problematic historical interpretations, from claims that the Confederacy sought to fight a war of attrition (p. 42) to an assertion that mental rather than material factors caused the stalemate of World War I (p. 46) to the contention that Nazism played a central role in the Wehrmacht's victories of 1939-1941 (p. 58). These questionable assertions, among others, certainly merit more elaboration and source citation than they receive. This draws attention to the work's third shortcoming. The notes and citations are discursive in nature, with little effort made to substantiating the facts, figures, and details that abound throughout the book. This can be overlooked in many cases, but when the text remarks that the Taliban participated in the 1991 coalition against Saddam (p. 157) and refers to allegations that the 1993 "attack on the World Trade Center . . . was organized on the basis of C.I.A. manuals" (p. 207, n. 4), the reader has a right to know the source of these dubious insights.
Clausewitz Reconsidered is neither a theoretical critique of On War and its concepts, nor a tightly organized history of modern warfare since Napoleon. It is instead a highly idiosyncratic series of essays on modern warfare by two well-established military historians. It is thoughtprovoking but contentious, alternately insightful and wide of the mark. JFQ Reviewed by TIFFANY G. PETROS A lthough the threats facing the international community in the 21 st century (including terrorism, cyber attacks, and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction) differ from those of other periods in history, what has not changed since antiquity is the building of coalitions by foreign soldiers and statesmen in an effort to promote and maintain security. Equally longstanding have been misunderstandings and disagreements among people of different cultural backgrounds that have threatened coalition cohesiveness and jeopardized military operations.
In this important work, Gal Luft examines five historical case studies to determine the role of culture in the planning and conduct of coalition operations. He also offers introductory and concluding chapters on culture and war from a broader perspective. Fundamental to this effort, the author asks the questions, "Does culture matter?" and "If so, in what ways?" Among the cultural factors he considers are language, religion, customs, gender roles, education, ethnicity, values, and overall philosophy.
He looks at these factors from various perspectives-those of the society at large, the military as a subset of society, and the individual (that is, military commanders)-to determine how culture impacts the ability of foreign militaries to live and work with one another. The individual level of analysis is particularly relevant, since as the case studies demonstrate, commanders can promote or undermine cross-cultural cooperation in a coalition environment. Luft also correctly points out that while generalizations are necessary to discussions of culture, there is an inherent danger in oversimplifying and/ or presenting characteristics of one group as superior to another. Further, he acknowledges that the book focuses heavily on the perceptions of Western militaries toward their counterparts, giving less weight to non-Western (Asian and Muslim) perspectives. This is a noticeable drawback of the book, but one that is understandably difficult to mitigate in light of available resources.
Although scholars have long written on aspects of culture and warfare, this book is unique in both the cases selected and the author's insight derived from having served in a coalition environment. Luft, currently an executive director of the think tank Analysis of Global Security, previously served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) where he was deployed for almost 5 years in combat assignments in South Lebanon. He worked daily with Arab soldiers from the South Lebanon Army (SLA) and details that history and experience in chapter six. Dr. Luft's work also differs from that of scholars such as the late Samuel P. Huntington, who argued in The Clash of Civilizations (1996) that cultural fault lines serve as a catalyst for conflict. Luft suggests that cooperation across fault lines is just as likely to occur. The author notes that "intra-civilization" conflict has often invited foreign intervention and cites U.S. involvement in the Gulf War (1990-1991) as one such example (p. xiv). As illustrated by the Gulf War, in cases where foreign intervention is involved, mediating cultural differences becomes even more important to the success of the operation.
The book offers a variety of case studies and perspectives from which to consider culture and coalition warfare. In addition to providing valuable historical studies, the chapters highlight individual cultural challenges faced by the actors involved in the various coalitions. Chapter two describes the relationship between Germans and their Ottoman Turkish counterparts during World War I. The author notes how the two sides communicated in French-ironically, the language of their enemy. He also discusses Germany's support for Turkish jihad and its unintended consequences.
Chapter three reviews British-Japanese cooperation in the context of their World War I alliance. This chapter focuses on their joint efforts to win the Battle of Tsingtau, a frequently ignored yet important battle for control of a small German colony in China. Their success marked the first defeat of Germany in World War I. Success did not come without obstacles, however, in the coalition relationship. For example, the two sides had different views on casualties and capitulation. That said, previous cross-cultural cooperation between Britain and Japan in part contributed to the successful engagement.
Chapter four examines U.S.-Chinese relations during World War II. The chapter highlights cultural, strategic, and logistical incompatibilities that hampered productive relations, as well as illustrating the consequences of distrust between leadership. For the Chinese, "saving face" was a deeply entrenched cultural imperative that had significant consequences for the coalition in time of war. Chapter five examines U.S. and Saudi cooperation in the Persian Gulf War. Cultural issues such as religion, gender roles, and tradition complicated coalition relations as well as impacting the rights of U.S. Soldiers temporarily based on Saudi soil.
Finally, chapter six examines the relationship between the IDF and the SLA from 1985 to 2000. This chapter differs from the other cases described in the book in that cooperation extended over more than 15 years, the SLA was comprised of multiple groups-all defined as Arabs, but with differences in religion and ethnicity-and the cooperation was between a state and a nonstate actor. The chapter details successes and missteps in the long-term coalition that ultimately ended in 2000.
Overall, this book is a valuable resource for soldiers, scholars, policymakers, and civilians who want to better understand the significance of culture in planning and executing coalition operations. The lessons offered will become increasingly important as coalition operations become the norm. Since 2001, more than 45 countries have contributed to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan. In such coalitions, managing and mitigating cross-cultural tensions are key to the success of joint operations. The lessons learned can enhance not only the U.S. ability to work with partners in coalitions, but also other areas of security cooperation such as building partner institutional capacity to support and maintain coalition engagement. JFQ Dr. Tiffany G. Petros is a consultant in Washington, DC. T he concept of war within the cyber domain is no longer an esoteric topic of interest to small groups of people with unique technical skills. It is not rare to hear public discussions on the efficacy of cyber war, a malicious software exploit (most recently the Stuxnet), whether U.S. critical infrastructure is adequately defended from computer network attack, or if the notion of cyber war is over-hyped. Unfortunately, as this warfighting domain evolves, the immaturity at the strategic level of thought is being revealed: contradictory initiatives in the U.S. Air Force (which added cyberspace to its mission statement in 2005 and planned to create a cyber major command, but then changed direction and established a Numbered Air Force instead); the length of time it took the Obama administration to fill its cyber czar position; the discussion of what level of involvement the Federal Government (U.S. Cyber Command and the Department of Homeland Security) should have in protecting civilian resources.
In their books, Cyber War and Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar, Richard Clarke (with Robert Knake) and Martin Libicki offer significant contributions in filling this gap in theory and policy and bringing the discussion of cyber war to a more developed level of thought. The authors' achievements are most notable in the area of cyber deterrence, presumably with the intent to get leadership at the strategic level to listen to their warnings as organizations are formed, policies issued, and doctrine developed.
Libicki's portfolio contains a long list of cyber-oriented writings from his work at the RAND Corporation and the National Defense University. Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar is the result of a RAND study to "help clarify and focus attention on the operational realities behind the phrase 'fly and fight in cyberspace'" (p. iii). The chapter on cyber deterrence is the most impor-tant of this book. In it, Libicki highlights such important and "wicked" problems of deterrence as attribution, proportionality, escalation, effects, and the role of third-party hackers. These challenges, specifically in attribution and damage assessment from initiating a cyber attack, are the reasons why cyber deterrence is so hard, since deterrence is about sending a signal. Moreover, the worrisome problem of escalation, where cyber activities cross the line to kinetic attacks leading to a physical confrontation, is a consideration that nuclear strategists did not need to address, since they did not have to worry about conflict escalation beyond nuclear exchange. Libicki next proceeds to his most unique contribution to the discussion about warfare within the cyber domain, an issue that is also inseparable from deterrence: the motivation of the originator of cyber attacks. Four categories of motivation are considered: error, coercion, force, and other (such as feelings of invulnerability on the part of the attacker, or the desire to create damage for its own sake). Libicki thoroughly discusses motivation, with thoughtful analyses of possible scenarios.
From these important considerations about deterrence, Libicki goes on the offensive, discussing various ways to respond within the cyber domain, both strategically and operationally. Here there is much room for disagreement as Libicki gets into less familiar territory, with assertions that are somewhat less convincing and do not hold up in practice. In considering conducting a computer network attack, Libicki maintains that several obstacles reduce the incentives of such attacks. An example is his belief that cyber attacks can tip off system administrators to further attacks, thus having the effect of strengthening their defense. Later, Libicki asserts there is a diminishing return from computer network attacks-that is, that more attacks reduce the available pool of vulnerabilities. However, he places too much confidence in system administrators (and in the effectiveness of intrusion detection system networks) learning from mistakes and computer attacks and responding correctly to further strengthen their systems. Frequent reports from the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Federal Government contend that at least 80 to 90 percent of cyber attacks are preventable or could have been avoided by proper configuration, monitoring, policies, or updating of patches. Moreover, in many instances the personnel most knowledgeable about computer network defense issues such as vulnerabilities and current threats are not the system administrators and, in many cases, do not talk with those administrators. Additionally, the belief that a finite number of vulnerabilities for information systems applications exists is hard to justify, considering the complexity of computer applications, the workload of system administrators, the ingenuity of hackers, the fact that updates or enhancements to applications can add their own vulnerabilities, and in observing vendor patch release trends. Anyone using the Internet Explorer browser can attest to the relentless cycles of vulnerabilities and patches.
Libicki returns to more solid ground as he wraps up his book by discussing cyber defense, which he states is "the Air Force's most important activity within cyberspace" (p. xx). Here he highlights the defensive goals of robustness, system integrity, and confidentiality. To paraphrase Sun Tzu, with computer network defense, to know oneself is essential to adequately defend one's network. The Federally 
mandated initiative of enterprise architecture (EA) can be very effective in this regard. EA (which Libicki discussed in more detail in his 2007 work, Conquest in Cyberspace), can also contribute to the alignment of security efforts with the overall security goals derived from the cyber defense policy and risk analysis for any given entity of interest. Enterprise architecture can further address the trend of increasing complexity in information systems by facilitating the abstraction of this system complexity. EAwhich, in many cases, is already being implemented in DOD organizations-may provide an organizing discipline in which to address cyber defense.
Another important addition to the discourse on cyber war and deterrence is Richard Clarke and Robert Knake's Cyber War. Clarke possesses an impressive national security rÃ©sumÃ©, having served in the Reagan, George H.W. Bush, Clinton, and George W. Bush administrations, where he served as the special advisor on cyber security. As with Libicki, Clarke's most important contribution to the discussion on cyber war concerns cyber deterrence. The authors of both books relate their substantial knowledge of nuclear deterrence to their consideration of cyber deterrence, but they make it clear that nuclear deterrence theory cannot simply be overlaid on the cyber domain. Interestingly, the difficulties of cyber deterrence and the lack of experience with and inability to determine secondary effects of cyber attacks (as well as the fact that the United States stands to lose the most in a cyber war) lead Clarke and Libicki to downplay the strategic value of offensive cyber war (as the value of a first strike or retaliatory nuclear capability was a crucial component of nuclear deterrence), and to advocate for better and more effective cyber defenses (whereas with nuclear deterrence, a defensive capability against a nuclear strike was not an important aspect). These are two very important points the authors derive from their experience and from deterrence theory. Both authors are best here, as they methodically arrive at this conclusion with examples from the world of nuclear deterrence as well as pointing out where nuclear deterrence theory falls short within the unique parameters of the cyber domain. In other words, the authors warn, the best defense is not offense; indeed, a strong defense is an enabler of computer network attack.
A stronger cyber defense would strengthen the viability of an offensive cyber strategy by making the United States more likely to withstand an ongoing and escalatory cyber war. Clarke speculates that the United States may be self-deterred because it has the most to lose in a cyber conflict. But he also makes an important observation. With the issue of strategic nuclear war, the military did not maintain complete and secretive control over the entire debate; the academic research community and media also put light on nuclear warfighting policies and plans, resulting in rational discourse on such matters and leading to rational controls and nuclear warfighting plans. Clarke likens our present state of cyber ignorance at the national policy level to that of the European nations just prior to the outbreak of World War I; the plans and operations of military cyber units may be laying the foundation for cyber war with little public scrutiny or oversight. Clarke stresses the need for public dialogue about cyber war-a most useful suggestion to avoid a cyber General Curtis Lemay or "Dr. Strangelove" from forcing the Nation's leadership into a cyber war for which we are not ready and where we do not fully develop the situation to consider all the ramifications and potential outcomes.
Belief in the importance of public discourse and oversight of governmental cyber war activities leads the authors of these two books to divergent views about the proper level of governmental involvement in cyber defense. Clarke is an advocate of large and aggressive Federal involvement in protecting the Nation's information systems; Libicki believes that the Federal Government can only play an indirect role in protecting private information systems and that a government deterrence policy could weaken the private sector's cyber defensive posture since it would transfer the responsibility for protecting systems from private owners to the government. As with Libicki's misguided confidence in system administrators, his argument is weak here as well. The Federal Government can and does have much influence over private sector communications infrastructure, and for there to be any reasonable level of protection of our Nation's critical infrastructure, the Federal Government must become heavily engaged and involved in securing it. There are many precedents for a more active Federal role in this context, such as the National Communications System and the Communications Assistance to Law Enforcement Act.
In the end, both Cyber War and Cyberdeterrence and Cyberwar cast light on important areas of cyber warfare that must be contemplated by researchers, military staff colleges, and policymakers at the national level. Neither Clarke nor Libicki is a cheerleader for offensive cyber capabilities, offering considered analyses on the difficulties inherent in their actual use. Instead, both demonstrate why the best offense may be a strong cyber defense, an important point when leadership considers resourcing decisions. Libicki and Clarke provide a great service in identifying important starting points and considerations for a discourse on cyber topics, and helping to nudge the discussion of the cyber domain to another level of maturity. But the question will remain: Is anyone listening? JFQ

Korean Futures: Challenges to U.S.
by Ferial Ara Saeed and James J. Przystup Little attention has been paid to the strategic considerations that may shape the responses of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China, and Russia to a North Korean regime collapse. This study identifies the interests and objectives of these principal state actors with respect to the Korean Peninsula. Although regime collapse is unlikely, such an event could fundamentally alter the strategic landscape in Asia in ways that could diminish U.S. influence in the region. The study highlights the complexities and dilemmas that the United States would confront. For example, regime collapse does not mean state collapse, at least not in the short run. China will be in the most powerful position to act because it likely will be the first state to become aware of a crisis. Moreover, in an environment of clashing interests and competing priorities, there is potential for serious damage to U.S relations with China, South Korea, and Japan. 
T hough great strides have been made since joint doctrine was legislated by the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, joint fire support coordination still presents a quandary. The need for a principal advisor having responsibility for the planning and execution of joint fires echoes across military academia; however, joint doctrine is lax in addressing the matter. Nowhere is this need more apparent than at the Joint Special Operations Task Force (JSOTF), where coordination is bifurcated at best. At the JSOTF, doctrine relegates management of joint fires and air support to a component of singular purpose, lacking inclusion of all fire support elements (FSEs) as a result. Institutionalization of a Joint Force Fires Coordinator (JFFC) as part of the JSOTF headquarters (HQ) within the Operations Directorate (J3) will improve the successful integration, synchronization, and control of joint fires in support of special operations.
Revisiting accepted principles of joint fire support, joint fires are weapons systems used during the employment of forces from two or more components in coordinated action to produce desired effects in support of a common objective. Coordinated action requires the synchronization of joint fires with the maneuver force, as they are complementary functions. The concept of fires describes 157 WASTILA how the joint force applies lethal and nonlethal fires to achieve desired effects and attain the objective. 
1
Joint Force Commanders (JFCs) commonly view fire support coordination in relation to four essential tasks. First and foremost, fires must support and be responsive to forces in contact. Second, joint fires must support the JFC's concept of operations. Third, the concept of fires must integrate with the scheme of maneuver. Lastly, fires in support of the joint force must be sustainable. 
2
The JFC establishes a JSOTF to conduct special operations in hostile, denied, or politically sensitive environments to achieve diplomatic, informational, military, and/or economic objectives, activities that "may require low visibility, clandestine, or covert capabilities." 
3
4
Organization of a JSOTF HQ is consistent with that of a conventional Joint Task Force (JTF). The J3 forms a Joint Operations Center (JOC) to serve as the focal point for all operational matters to include the direction of current operations and the planning of future ones. A JSOTF may include a Future Plans Directorate (J5). If not, the J3 assumes all future planning responsibilities; if so, the J3 Future Operations Section (J35) receives approved plans in handover from the J5 for tasking and execution. Doctrine specifies only that joint fire support coordination falls under the responsibilities of the J3. The J35 directs JSOTF targeting and integrates IO into future operations.

Whether it is the Gulf War, Somalia, Afghanistan, or Iraq, the lack of a JFFC to advise the JSOTF commander on fire support usage plagues mission planning and execu-tion. The discord stems from governing joint doctrine because responsibility for the JFC's concept of fires is unspecified. 
10
11
Operation Desert Storm exemplifies the gap created when the air component drives the SOF concept of fires. During Desert Storm, SOF were relegated to secondary missions within the conventional scheme of operations or left isolated altogether, as with the JSOTF formed for the "great Scud hunt" in the western Iraqi desert.

The story of Black Hawk Down and Task Force Ranger in Somalia offers a prolific case where a small-scale raid lacking adequate fires resources turned into a rescue and spiraled into an epic debacle. Formed around staffers from the Joint Special Operations Command, the JSOTF HQ opted for a junior fire support officer. Arguably, the advice of a senior JFFC would have weighed more significantly in the the story of Black Hawk Down offers a prolific case where a small-scale raid lacking adequate fires resources turned into a rescue and spiraled into an epic debacle JOINT DOCTRINE | Improving Joint Fires for Special Operations JFC's decision to conduct operations without contingency fire planning. The debate rages as to the appropriateness of daylight use of gunships or whether AC-130s could have been allocated to the task force. 
16
The experience of Task Force Dagger, the lead JSOTF employed early in Afghanistan, offers a more recent example. This JSOTF staff "was built around a Special Forces group HQ and faced problems using joint fires at the tactical and operational levels" from the onset.

The lack of a JFE by default leaves JSOTF fire support coordination to the air compo-nent via the JACE and SOLE. Inclusion of a JFE bifurcates responsibilities for planning and execution. Complicating matters further is the fact that doctrine limits targeting and IO responsibilities to the J35. Implications with respect to unity of effort are obvious. In the absence of a bona fide JFFC acting as an honest broker, the joint fires process inevitably focuses on airpower while inadvertently ignoring surface-and sea-based assets, 
21
As conceived, the JFE is an ad hoc organization largely formed from the existing table of organization. This burdens already overtasked staffs, often creating a void during deliberate planning. 
22
effective for some crisis action, it is reactive and generally contributes to a greater loss of initiative, not unlike Black Hawk Down. In contrast, effective joint fire support coordination is proactive where integration is thorough and derived from the inclusion of all component fires elements available. JSOTFs have long "recognized need for resident expertise with their HQ to coordinate and integrate fire support." 
23
Aviation proponents seek to employ air assets in a centralized manner to maximize their effect. Indisputably, "close air support accounts for the vast majority of fire support assets provided to Special Forces." 
24
25
By contrast, JSOTF operations are not air-centric; they typically center on a supported ground maneuver element. SOF requires the concept of fires to be nimble; however, the current requisition process is clumsy and burdensome. Further, one could argue the parochial air component view contributes to a misperception that fire support platforms other than air have limited capability and/or availability. The JFACC is a component commander and is certainly not beholden to the JSOTF commander. Higher responsibilities may preclude JAOC participation in JSOTF fires deliberation and planning. In addition, the SOLE lacks the proximity, capacity, and authority to control the joint fire situation throughout an operation and participate in the planning and coordination of future operations, often concurrent tasks. In sum, "the entity responsible for [joint] fires cannot be focused on only one aspect of the fires fight"; 26 it leads to an overemphasis of prosecution by air.
A study prepared by the Joint Warfighting Center (JWFC) examined the viability of a JFFC concept from the viewpoint of the JFC. It clearly identified the fact that the J3 and JFACC worked independently to plan, coordinate, deconflict, and synchronize targeting. Although both worked toward common objectives, they lacked unity of effort. The 1997 study also documented the resulting disconnect between air operations and all elements of joint fires. The study acknowledged the J3 as the focal point for synchronization of joint fires but recognized that in practice, the JFACC retains the bulk of effort for joint fires execution planning through the development of the ATO. Further, it suggested, "the JFACC has some limitations regarding control of all the entity responsible for [joint]  JOINT DOCTRINE | Improving Joint Fires for Special Operations joint fires resources and awareness of special operations and nonlethal strategies, thus an opportunity may exist to not consider all joint fires aspects during development of the air plan." 
27
28
To improve the successful integration, synchronization, and application of fires for the JSOTF, a JFFC must be institutionalized as a permanent part of the HQ staff serving as a senior subordinate to the J3 with authorities delegated by the commander. A JFFC, being the single entity that centralizes communications and personnel for the coordination of all FSEs, obviates air component awareness and control issues. At a minimum, an FSE comprised of a junior fire support officer, air officer, naval surface fires officer, and IO officer would support the JFFC, thereby covering the totality of joint fires capabilities. The FSE remains scalable to meet the scope and needs of the JSOTF. The Service components, having requisite expertise, would source the various personnel.
The JFFC serves as the principal staff advisor to the J3 and JSOTF commander responsible for the coordination, integration, and synchronization of joint fires. 
29
To date, the JWFC study recommendation for the implementation of a JFFC has only been embraced as optional. Doctrine must capture the preceding improvements with revisions to Joint Publications 3-09, Doctrine for Joint Fire Support, and 3-05.1, Joint Special Operations Task Force Operations. However, joint doctrine in and of itself may not be enough, especially if said doctrine is only viewed as guidance. A mandate for the JFFC at the JSOTF may require a Department of Defense directive to enforce what is ultimately a change in special operations culture, particularly for the air component. JSOTF tables of organization and joint manning documents also require changes to reflect this staff enhancement. It follows that these changes must become manifest in training. It is essential that the JSOTF via the JFFC incorporate joint fire support training at the tactical and operational levels to maximize exposure and integration through education, exercises, rehearsals, and the like. Lastly, it is incumbent on U.S. Special Operations Command and/ or theater special operations commands to demand qualified individuals/augmentees when staffing JSOTFs; an insouciant approach to filling JFFC billets invites the specter of failure into the joint fire planning process.
Implementation of a JFFC within the J3 will improve the successful integration, synchronization, and control of joint fires in support of the JSOTF. The mandate for a JFFC is clearly supported given the JSOTF's lack of operational depth and resulting dependence on nonorganic fire support platforms. The JFFC provides an unbiased expert perspective that avoids the myopic shortcomings of fire planning dependent on the air component for coordination. Principal advice and well-conceived concepts of fires will preclude the JSOTF commander from having to go it alone and rely on ad hoc solutions for fire support. Institutionalization of the JFFC as the subject matter expert having the delegated authority and responsibility for planning, coordination, and execution is the required next step toward improving joint fires for special operations.

It argues that while these studies are well written and cogent in articulating many valuable innovations for the Departments of Defense and State, and other government agencies, all of them leave lingering issues that require further thinking and analysis as future U.S. national security policy evolves in a changing and dangerous world.
Disarmament, Demobilization, and Reintegration (DDR) and Security Sector Reform (SSR) have emerged in recent years as promising but poorly understood mechanisms for consolidating security and reasserting state sovereignty after conflict. Despite the considerable experience acquired by the international community, the critical relationship between DDR and SSR, and the ability to use these mechanisms with consistent success, remain less than optimally developed. The chapters in this book represent a diversity of field experience and research in DDR and SSR, which suggest that these are complex and interrelated systems with underlying political attributes. The book concludes that successful application of DDR and SSR requires the setting aside of preconceived assumptions or formulas, and should be viewed flexibly to restore the monopoly of force to the state. The People's Liberation Army Navy (PLAN) has moved to the forefront of Chinese military modernization, aided by increased budgets and improved shipbuilding capabilities. The deployments of PLAN ships to the Gulf of Aden, the PLAN's global circumnavigation, and the increased frequency of exercises with foreign navies highlight the PLAN's growing role as an instrument of national policy. Given these trends, the Institute for National Strategic Studies joined other research organizations in Taipei to discuss the Chinese navy in their 19 th annual conference on the PLA. The conference brought together many leading specialists on naval issues to discuss a range of topics related to the PLAN. This volume collects the best papers, most of which have been updated to reflect postconference developments. Topics include the history of other rising major powers in relation to their maritime capabilities, the range of China's naval modernization, the specifics of PLAN force capabilities, and how the PLAN might use its improved capabilities. As this volume indicates, Chinese naval power continues to develop, expand, and mature despite shortfalls in operational effectiveness. Given regional suspicions about China's long-term ambitions, the ultimate impact of a stronger PLAN on stability will depend on whether Chinese leaders direct their newfound naval power toward cooperative or coercive ends. PRISM explores, promotes, and debates emerging thought and best practices as civilian capacity increases in order to address challenges in stability, reconstruction, security, counterinsurgency, and irregular warfare. Published by NDU Press for the Center for Complex Operations, PRISM welcomes articles on a broad range of complex operations issues, especially civil-military integration. Manuscript submissions should be between 2,500 and 6,000 words and sent via email to prism@ndu.edu.

cies, RAND Report N-2838-AF (Washington, DC:
The terrorist group known as al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) already poses the greatest immediate threat of transnational terrorism in northwest Africa, and is now escalating its attacks against regional and Western interests. The U.S-led Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership has not been able to prevent further attacks. According to Andre Le Sage, this raises an important strategic question for the United States: what level of activity by AQIM would be a sufficient threat to U.S. national security to warrant a more aggressive political, intelligence, military, and law enforcement response? Dr. Le Sage points out a number of specific scenarios that would call for a stronger U.S. response. He concludes by laying out four elements that might constitute such a strategy: increased diplomatic pressure on regional states, an increased intelligence effort to better understand AQIM vulnerabilities, internationally supported military action, and a range of other diplomatic and peacebuilding activities in northwest Africa.

Fettweis is not the first intellectual, nor will he be the last, to proclaim the onset of perpetual peace. He is squarely in the tradition of Immanuel Kant, Herbert Spencer, and Norman Angell, to name just three. Indeed, in the book's introduction, Fettweis attempts to rehabilitate Angell's reputation for prophecy, which suffered a devastating blow when the Great War falsified his claim in The Great Illusion that economic interdependence had rendered great power war obsolete. Angell, Fettweis writes, was the first "prominent constructivist thinker of the twentieth century," and was not wrong-just ahead of his time (p. 5).
Fettweis bases his theory or vision of the obsolescence of major war on the supposed linear progress of human nature, a major tenet of 20 th -century liberalism that is rooted in the rationalist theories of the Enlightenment. "History," according to Fettweis, "seems to be unfolding as a line extending into the future-a halting, incomplete, inconsistent line perhaps, one with frequent temporary reversals, but a line nonetheless." The world is growing "more liberal and more reliant upon reason, logic, and science" (p. 217).
We have heard this all before. Human nature can be perfected. Statesmen and leaders will be guided by reason and science. Such thinking influenced the visionaries of the French Revolution and produced 25 years of war among the great powers of Europe. Similar ideas influenced President Woodrow Wilson and his intellectual supporters who endeavored at Versailles to transform the horrors of World War I into a peace that would make that conflict "the war to end all wars." What followed were disarmament conferences, an international agreement to outlaw war, the rise of expansionist powers, appeasement by the democracies, and the most destructive war in human history. Ideas, which Fettweis claims will bring about the proliferation of peace, transformed Russia, Germany, and Japan into expansionist, totalitarian powers. Those same ideas led to the Gulag, the Holocaust, and the Rape of Nanking. So much for human progress.
Fettweis knows all of this, but claims that since the end of the Cold War, the leaders and peoples of the major powers, except the United States, have accepted the idea that major war is unthinkable. His proof is that there has been no major war among the great powers for 20 years-a historical period that coincides with the American "unipolar" moment. This is very thin empirical evidence upon which to base a predictive theory of international relations.
Fettweis criticizes the realist and neorealist schools of thought, claiming that their adherents focus too narrowly on the past behavior of states in the international system. In his view, realists place too great an emphasis on power. Ideas and norms instead of power, he claims, provide structure to the international system. Classical geopolitical theorists such as Halford Mackinder, Alfred Thayer Mahan, Nicholas Spykman, and Colin Gray are dismissed by Fettweis in less than two pages, despite the fact that their analyses of great power politics and conflict have long been considered sound and frequently prescient.
Realists and classical geopoliticians have more than 2,000 years of empirical evidence to support their theories of how states and empires behave and how the international system works. Ideas are important, but power is the governing force in international politics, and geography is the most permanent factor in the analysis of power.
Fettweis makes much of the fact that the countries of Western and Central Europe, which waged war against each other repeatedly for nearly 400 years, are at peace, and claims that there is little likelihood that they will ever again wage war against each other. Even if the latter assertion turns out to be true, that does not mean that the end of major war is in sight. Throughout history, some peoples and empires that previously waged war for one reason or another became pacific without producing worldwide perpetual peace: the Mongols, Saracens, Ottomans, Dutch, Venetians, and the Spanish Empire come immediately to mind. A Europe at peace does not translate to an Asia, Africa, and Middle East at peace.
In a world in which major wars are obsolete, Fettweis believes the United States needs to adjust its grand strategy from vigorous internationalism to strategic restraint. His specific recommendations include the removal of all U.S. military forces from Europe; an end to our bilateral security guarantees to Japan and South Korea; an end to our alliance with Israel; an indifference to the balance of power on the Eurasian landmass; a law enforcement approach to terrorism; a drastic cut in military spending; a much smaller Navy; and the abolition of regional combatant commands.
What Fettweis is proposing is effectively an end to what Walter Russell Mead calls "the maritime world order" that was established by Great Britain and maintained first by the British Empire and then by the United States. It is a world order that has defeated repeated challenges by potential hegemonic powers and resulted in an unprecedented spread of prosperity and freedom. But all of that, we are assured, is in the past. China poses no threat. The United States can safely withdraw from Eurasia. The power vacuum will remain unfilled.
Fettweis needs a dose of humility. Sir Halford Mackinder, the greatest of all geopoliticians, was referring to visionaries and liberal idealists like Fettweis when he cautioned, "He would be a sanguine man . . . who would trust the future peace of the world to a change in the mentality of any nation." Most profoundly, General Douglas MacArthur, who knew a little bit more about war and international conflict than Fettweis, reminded the cadets at West Point in 1962 that "only the dead have seen the end of war." JFQ JOINT DOCTRINE | Update with OPCON generated a multidecade terminology debate on interpretation and correct usage. However, in 1986, Congress cemented the term combatant command (command authority) for commanders in chief (CINCs) through legislation.

Per the Goldwater-Nichols Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986, the Services permanently assign forces to unified combatant commands. These assigned forces are identified in the Global Force Management Implementation Guidance signed by the Defense Secretary and are commanded by a CCDR under a COCOM. Attached forces are temporarily transferred forces from one CCDR to another by the President or Secretary. Besides COCOM, CCDRs exercise OPCON or TACON over assigned and attached forces through subordinate commanders to accomplish specific missions. Subordinate commanders exercise OPCON or TACON over the forces under their command. Both OPCON and TACON are inherent to COCOM and may be delegated.
Two types of CCDRs are geographic combatant commanders (GCCs) and functional combatant commanders (FCCs). As a CCDR, a GCC exercises COCOM over assigned forces and OPCON or TACON over attached forces. For example, U.S. Central Command (USCENTCOM) comprises assigned forces from the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Air Force. If a contingency breaks out and additional non-USCENTCOM forces are needed, the Defense Secretary can authorize forces to be attached to USCENTCOM from U.S. Pacific Command (USPACOM) for a specific mission and may attach these forces under OPCON or TACON. The USCENT-COM CCDR would then have OPCON or TACON over the USPACOM forces that were attached. The USCENTCOM CCDR can organize a joint task force (JTF) and provide forces that the JTF commander may have OPCON or TACON over as directed by the USCENT-COM CCDR. The JTF commander will then have OPCON of his own Service forces and OPCON or TACON over attached forces.
Similar to and in support of GCCs, FCCs may conduct independently assigned missions with their forces and are usually global in nature. As a result, FCC forces can move in and out of GCC areas of responsibility. For example, the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM) CCDR exercises COCOM over all assigned Active Component and most mobilized Reserve Component (RC) special operations forces (SOF). In its role as an FCC, USSOCOM provides forces on a temporary basis to other CCMDs where CCDRs normally exercise OPCON of attached SOF through a subordinate commander (CDR). When directed, the USSOCOM CCDR can establish and employ a joint SOF task force as the supported CDR.
Even though GCCs exercise COCOM over assigned intratheater airlift forces, the U.S. Transportation Command CCDR, as an FCC, has COCOM over intertheater airlift forces.
Joint force commander (JFC) is used as a general term for a CCDR, subunified commander, or JTF commander authorized to exercise COCOM or OPCON over a joint force.

A JTF commander is designated by the Defense Secretary, a CCDR, a subunified commander, or an existing JTF commander.

Administrative control (ADCON) provides for the preparation of most military forces and their administration and support. Per U.S. Code (USC), the Services are responsible for the administration and support of their own forces. They fulfill their responsibilities by exercising ADCON through the CDRs of the Service component commands assigned to CCMDs and through the Services for forces not assigned to the CCMDs.
