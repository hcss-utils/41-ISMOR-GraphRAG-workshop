Gunther E. Rothenberg reports a similar occurrence during the mid-eighteenth century after Prussia's Frederick the Great compiled an impressive string of victories.
As Rothenberg writes in The&rt of Warfare in the Age of Napoleon, "it was a period of considerable ferment and agitation in military circles, yet many disputes were settled by the statement: 'Oh, but I saw it in Prussia"' (p 19).
A similar condition now exists an American military basking in the afterglow of the Desert Storm victory.
