The conflict in Syria functioned as a laboratory for the General Staff to experiment with and test new operational concepts and C2 systems.
In a March 2019 speech at the annual meeting of the Russian Academy of Military Sciences, Gerasimov characterized the Syria conflict as playing an "important role" in the development Russia's "strategy of limited action."
This strategy, he explained, relies on "self-sufficient groupings of troops" to achieve a limited set of tasks in an overseas conflict.
In his speech, Gerasimov highlighted that the Syria conflict had further tested the use of Russian forces to conduct "humanitarian operations" to protect the local civilian population.
