While building on the extensive literature on the Russian military, our report focuses on addressing two key gaps.
First, the literature focuses on Russia's current military potential by noting specific military actions that Russia is taking or could take that would be harmful to U.S. or allied interests.
While these current or hypothetical threats are important, it is also critical to prepare for future military challenges by studying the broader political, social, and economic context of Russia's military development.
