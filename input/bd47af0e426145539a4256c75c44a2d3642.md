Islamist terrorist groups have evolved yet again in Syria and Iraq in the form of the group known as the Islamic State, also identified as ISIS, ISIL or IGIL.
Some traditional American allies are already talking with Moscow about how to deal with the Islamic State in a process that is forcing the US to revisit its policies in the region.
A 2016 report from the Congressional Research Service stated, The Islamic State still controls large areas of northeastern and central Syria, from which it continues to launch assaults on forces opposed to and aligned with the government of President Bashar al Assad.
Meanwhile, fighting elsewhere pits government forces and their foreign allies against a range of anti-government insurgents, some of whom have received limited US assistance.
Russian military intervention in support of Assad poses a direct challenge to US goals in Syria, and is raising new questions about the future of the conflict and US strategy.
