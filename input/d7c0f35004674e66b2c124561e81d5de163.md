Perhaps more than any other nation Russia has reason to fear the international environment, especially considering the invasions that have washed over its lands.
There are serious problems: in the Caucasus with terrorists; in Central Asia where the stability of the new oil-rich nations is seriously in question; and in the parT iii: The ConTexTual World east where the Chinese remain silent, but increasingly powerful, on the borders of eastern Siberia.
In 2001, Russia and China agreed to demarcate the 4,300 mile border between them.
However, demographic pressures across this border are increasingly tense as ethnic Russians leave (perhaps as many as a halfmillion in the 2000-2010 time frame, or 6% of the total population) and ethnic Chinese immigrate to the region.
Estimates of the number of ethnic Chinese in Siberia range from a low of about 480,000 (or less than six percent of the population) to more than 1 million (or nearly 12%).
Russia must carefully manage this demographic transition to avoid ethnic tensions that could erupt into a cross border conflict with China.
