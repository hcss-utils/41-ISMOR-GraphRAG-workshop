Military action is often the easiest to characterize, with large troop deployments, observable naval fleet maneuvers, and even aircraft sorties.
While Russia certainly employed conventional forces in a military action as a part of its campaign to annex Crimea, Russia also subtly employed and counted on its SOF to carry out some of its more brutal actions.
A well-orchestrated Russian deception campaign, or Maskirovka, meaning mask or concealment, was key to all of Russian attempts in the seizing of Crimea which enabled Russia to confuse Ukrainian decision makers and delay the Ukrainian response.
