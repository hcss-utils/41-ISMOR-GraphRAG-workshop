Russia's recent actions in Georgia and Ukraine illuminate Russia's cyber capabilities and expose its motives.
Both Georgia and Ukraine are satellite nations with strong ties to Russia socially, ethnically, and diplomatically.
Before Russia's kinetic engagements, each nation moved toward the protection of the West to align with NATO ideals, policies, and economic benefits.
As a result, Russia and associated non-state actors, conducted cyber activities to influence these two nations.
Ultimately, Russia conducted kinetic operations against both nations.
However, the initial stages of Russia's invasions used a relatively new form of attack: cyberwarfare integrated with information warfare (INFOWAR).
