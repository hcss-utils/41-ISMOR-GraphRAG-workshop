Syria, Russia, and Iran, have signaled their interest in maintaining the status quo regime of Bashar al-Assad.
The amount of resources and level of effort expended, primarily by Russia and Iran, indicates their desire to assert control over important states and regions.
Given the residual and deeply problematic conditions that spawned Syria's now fizzling civil war, this presents the United States with an opportunity to impose costs and create problems for its adversaries.
Because Russia and Iran have stepped forward in Syria, they are now responsible for its stability and reconstruction, and have shown through prior commitments that a friendly Syria remains in their national interests.
