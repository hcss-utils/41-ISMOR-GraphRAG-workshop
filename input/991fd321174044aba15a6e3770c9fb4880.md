Though the Russians eventually reevaluated their initial operational approach to the situation in Chechnya and would go on to earn a hard won victory in Grozny, it was a tenuous victory that led to a second war five years later in 1999.
How had the Russians, having arguably the most operational experience in urban warfare of any army in the world, failed so miserably in the initial stages in the first Battle of Grozny?
Using the framework from chapter one as a lens, the answer becomes clear: a lack of any semblance of an operational approach.
The Russian leadership fell back on their doctrine of destruction to force capitulation.
Ironically, this is similar to the German approach in Stalingrad, which the Soviets proved faulty sixty-one years earlier.
