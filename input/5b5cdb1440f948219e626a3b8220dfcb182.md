Although not a case study, this paper must acknowledge how Ukraine in the current context dramatically supports how a CCMD can set a theater with a smaller footprint.
Despite only receiving $2 billion of SC and receiving 8 years of SFA from approximately 2,000 advisors, Ukraine unexpectedly frustrated the Russian military efforts to quickly oust President Zelenskyy and capture Kyiv.
Though time will tell, this Kyiv Miracle probably could not have occurred without those eight years of SFA.
In juxtaposition to Iraq and Afghanistan in which the HN's Will to Fight dissipated relatively quickly despite decades of SFA and SC, Ukraine held its own against the second most powerful military in the world with little military help besides SC from the outside world.
By increasing both credibility and capability in Ukraine, the U.S. has shaped the current conflict to be fortuitous for its mass DIME attrition strategy as it wages a diplomatic, informational, and economic war on Russia.
