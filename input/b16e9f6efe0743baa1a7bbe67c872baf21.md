Given conflicting interests between Russia and the West and uncertainty about Russia's future intentions, the development of the Russian military poses real challenges to the United States and its allies.
Russia's military appears to have improved significantly since the war in Georgia in 2008, as demonstrated by Russia's successful seizure of Crimea in February 2014, its ability to support separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, and Russia's military action to shore up Bashir al-Assad's government in Syria.
While perfectly predicting the future is, of course, impossible, understanding the potential range of the development of Russian military forces is critical for Western defense planning.
If Russia were able to dramatically modernize its forces to achieve parity with the West and could use its military strength to pursue more aggressive policies in Europe, a significant shift in Western military policy could be necessary.
If, by contrast, Russia's military collapsed under the weight of economic and demographic pressures or if there were no likelihood that Russia would use military force against the West, Russia might no longer need to be viewed as a major potential adversary.
This report analyzes the development of Russia's military capabilities over the next 20 years, with a focus on ground combat and the implications for U.S.-Russian competition.
