If the students expressed wariness of China, they were often despondent over strained relations with the United States.
Despite over four years of tense relations, few of the students expressed anger at or fear of America.
While the participants frequently rebuked America as an expansionist, aggressive power, citing its interventions in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, the perceived danger for Russia was not military attack, but rather economic, political, or cultural pressures.
Moreover, such criticism of the United States was not a prominent theme in any of the nine focus groups in 2018.
