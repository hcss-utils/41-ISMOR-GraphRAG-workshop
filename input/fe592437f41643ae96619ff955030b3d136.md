During the Berlin crisis, the U.S. was determined to maintain its presence despite the land blockade.
America wanted to settle the quarrel over Berlin in any manner other than direct confrontation.
In order to do this, the U.S. focused its political objectives on avoiding war, deterring the Russians from further aggressive action, and providing for the safety of the Germans in the Allied sectors of Berlin.
Soviet political objectives were to establish Russian dominance over Germany and to force the U.S. and its allies to discontinue their attempts to set up a western German government.
