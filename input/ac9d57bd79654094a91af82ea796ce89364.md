In addition to sustaining and perhaps expanding the existing military supply relationship, the United States and its allies could warn that renewed Russian aggression might lead to the entry of Western forces into Ukraine.
This could be signaled both in declaratory policy and visible preparations for such a move.
This approach may lack credibility, however, because Western leaders individually and NATO collectively have been clear that they will not take this step in response to Russia's 2022 invasion.
Such promises from individual NATO member-states could jeopardize the cohesion of the alliance in supporting Ukraine and present openings for Russian interference to divide NATO politically.
