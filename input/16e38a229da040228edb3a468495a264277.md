Prior to the attacks in the United States on September 11th, 2001, Russia had conflicted views of its role in the post-Cold War world.
Russia wanted to be seen as a player in world events, a peer that the international community must consult in order to secure a true consensus.
Economic struggles throughout the 1990s, multiple small conflicts in the post-Soviet space, and disagreements with the West over issues like confronting the Milosevic regime in Serbia, kept the Russians from completely integrating into European affairs when such a move might have been a possibility.
When George Bush unilaterally declared in 2001 that the nuclear arms treaties of the Cold War were outdated remnants of an animosity that had ceased to exist and that Russia and the United States would pursue a cooperative relationship, many Russian Atlanticist-liberals were pleased, but the Russian Eurasianist-conservative power establishment was fundamentally shaken.
