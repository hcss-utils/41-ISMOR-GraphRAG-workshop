How does this influence the strategy of the U.S. Army?
It means that U.S. bases in Europe are absolutely critical politically.
They assist the political and military stability that the EU needs to continue to project in attracting new countries to the East.
Just imagine what repercussions-economic, political, and military-there would be if U.S. troops were to withdraw, especially as Russia is pressing Ukraine, Moldova, and Georgia to rejoin its economic space.
The U.S. Army is not the sufficient cause of European success, but it is a likely necessary cause of continued Western unity and economic progress.
