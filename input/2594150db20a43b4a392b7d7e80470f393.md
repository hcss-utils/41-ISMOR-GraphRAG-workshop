When they say they are going to build 300 J-20s in the next five years, they will build 300 J-20s in the next five years.
The J-20 aircraft appears to share Russian technology: 61 "Experts say the fifth-generation J-20 fighter ... could have its origins in the Mikoyan 1.44 stealth jet that never made it to the production line.... Similarities between the new Chinese fighter jet and a prototype Russian plane have brought suggestions that Moscow may be quietly helping Beijing compete with the world's military powers.... Only the United States has an operational fifth-generation fighter, which is nearly impossible to track on radar.
Russia is working to start serial production of its prototype craft in the next five to six years."
62 Some observers believe that the appearance of the J-20 shows significant investment by the Chinese in stealth technology, as well as a very formidable platform to employ precision strike weapons.
It is also believed that the fighter is not expected to be operational at a "significant level until 2018, as China grapples with production hurdles, in particular engine technology."
