A conventional war with Russia is now virtually inconceivable since its military is in great disarray and represents little threat to the United States and its allies.
America is not well equipped to tackle instability or gray area phenomena inside FSU, but these are possible threats to stability.
Should the failure to reform result in a breakdown of the Russian or an East European government, the scope of a relief effort may be too large for the Western allies.
Military operations other than war (such as Bosnia) will be the most likely application of U.S. military resources.
It makes little sense to send combat divisions and air wings, but who else would do the job?
