Prelude to War: de facto Chechen Independence On 31 August 1996, Russia and Chechnya signed the Khasavyurt Treaty officially marking the end of hostilities between the two nations.
This treaty addressed four key issues in an attempt to maintain peace between the belligerents.
These four points included the implementation of a permanent ceasefire; complete withdrawal of Russian forces and disarmament of the Chechens; A five year period of autonomy during which the parties would discuss the feasibility of independence; and the establishment of a mechanism for the two governments to discuss Chechnya's status in or out of the Russian federation.
