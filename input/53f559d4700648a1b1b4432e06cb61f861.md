19 Timothy Thomas, a former research analyst at US Army's Foreign Military Studies Office (FMSO) in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, had taken note of these changes in Russian military philosophy, and contributed heavily to the wider body of US Army IO analysis.
However, his distinction of IO as either being a system-based framework versus a content-based idea further bifurcated the holistic notion of information warfare in US military establishments.
Russia's tendency to integrate and consolidate the separated information variables was merely a continuation of old Soviet practice.
See Timothy Thomas' chapter, "Russian Information Warfare Theory: The consequences of August 2008" in Stephen Blank and  Richard Weitz, eds.,
The Russian Military Today and Tomorrow: Essays in  global technologies, that, when tied to military weaponry, inevitably transforms "the way wars are fought by the world's leading military powers."
