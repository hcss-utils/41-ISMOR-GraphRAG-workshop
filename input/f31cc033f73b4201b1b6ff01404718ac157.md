75 Charles E. Kirkpatrick, An Unknown Future and Doubtful Present: Writing the Victory Plan of 1941 (Washington, DC: Center for Military History United States Army, 1992), 81.
Charles Kirkpatrick notes that General George C. Marshall realizes that the mass of lend lease equipment destined to head to Russia and Great Britain was not sufficient to turn the tide of war and a significant United States Army would be needed.
BG Albert Wedemeyer based on Marshall's guidance developed the 90 division Victory Army and even more important the framework for the Army Air Corps and the total manpower figures that the United States would have available for mobilization; between 10-14 million men.
