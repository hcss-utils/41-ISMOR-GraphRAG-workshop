Estonian SOF and the security ser vices work closely with law enforcement and the border guard in peacetime, and both the EDL and border guard are forming additional units.
The border guard cannot hope to weed out all Rus sian agents from the flood of 8,000 to 12,000 civilians coming and going each day, any more than the tiny Estonian military can hope to hold off Rus sian tanks until NATO forces arrive-espe cially given the airspace denial that Russia has achieved by moving its S-400 anti-aircraft system into Kaliningrad on the Baltic Sea.
In the worst-case scenario, if its own hardening efforts and NATO's umbrella prove an insufficient deterrent to Russian aggression, Estonia plans to mount a resistance against Rus sian occupation, using civilian resistance and unconventional warfare for which they are actively training.
