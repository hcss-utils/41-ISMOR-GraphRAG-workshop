Russia's invasion of Georgia in 2008 warned the international community that the Kremlin had started applying a new strategy.
This alert about Moscow's new strategy was followed by other indicators, including multiple exercises on its western border, which involved many capabilities, numerous troops, and different types of equipment.
Then, in 2014, Russia culminated its campaign with the invasion of Ukraine's eastern territory and the annexation of Crimea.
This illegal annexation of Crimea symbolizes "hybrid warfare," a term that has been overused for almost every state or non-state actor's action that can be complex, different, unusual, or new in relation to other actors.
This moment created lots of concerns among NATO countries from the eastern flank and forced NATO and its allies to develop an effective strategy to deter Russia.
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) responded with the Comprehensive Defense Handbook (CDH) as a possible strategy that can be implemented by small countries to resist Russian hybrid aggression and maintain their territorial integrity.
