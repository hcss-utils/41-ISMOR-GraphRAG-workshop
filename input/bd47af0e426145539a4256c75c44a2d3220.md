A key underpinning of China's rise, strategic goals, and concurrent increase in defense capabilities is the historic concept of "a century of humiliation."
The period from the Opium War of 1839-1842 to the establishment of the PRC in October of 1949 was one hundred and ten years of foreign involvement in China's internal affairs.
War and conflict with foreign powers resulted in the loss of sovereign rights, territory or prestige or face in Asian terms.
Russia was both a partner with China in some of these conflicts, but was also a perpetrator and recipient of special rights in, and control over, Chinese lands.
There are limits to this relationship no matter how much contingent events and mutual interest drive Russia and China together in this uneasy, unequal and fragile partnership.
In Asia, history matters and for Russia and China the past is filled with unhappy and unhelpful memories.
If "what's past is prologue," then there are few better regions than the Caucasus in the world to study diplomatic and military operations.
