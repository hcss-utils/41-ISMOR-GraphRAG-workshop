The Franco-Prussian War arose from Napoleon III's need to humble and weaken the Prussians and Bismarck's need to provoke a French invasion of Germany that might serve to complete the process of German unification.
Bismarck forged defense agreements with the South German states, assuring the involvement of their armies in the event of war.
This was another feat of Bismarckian politics; in a few short years, Bismarck had reversed an asymmetry favoring the French: military strength.
Enlarged by the North German Confederation plus the allied South German armies, Prussia added seven corps between 1866 and 1870 and became a million-man army.
With just 400,000 troops, France found itself exceedingly vulnerable.
Both sides now pushed for war, Napoleon III recklessly, to nip Prussian growth in the bud, Bismarck prudently, to cast Prussia as a victim of French arrogance and to complete national unification.
Once again, the French displayed alarming strategic negligence.
They knew the dangers of Prussian military organization-"the energy and speed of your movements [mean] that we're in danger of finding you in Paris one day unannounced," the French Empress Eugénie had complained to the Prussian ambassador after Königgrätz. "
I will go to sleep French and wake up Prussian."
