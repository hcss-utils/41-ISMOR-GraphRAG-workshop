Searching for meaningful examples of non-military cooperation, the students provided the paltry example of China-Russia cultural exchanges in the form of "dance troupes."
Non-trivial links with Russia were sometimes mentioned, but they were usually limited to historical examples.
For example, the students invoked Soviet aid to China in the 1950's when Soviet influence (and Marxist-Leninist culture) was seen as a strong, animating force on the world stage.
They stated: "Historically, the Soviet-Chinese relationship was special….
Russia used to be communist, and this was a basis of friendship with China" and "we used to study the USSR when it was strong."
But students also mentioned that geographic proximity between China and Russia had mixed effects on relations: "During the [late] 1920s, [Russia] invaded China, and because of that, even today, China and Russia still have issues regarding disputed territory."
The primary character attributed to Russia was strength, but strength derived from a national willingness to suffer and not give up, leading several students to describe the Russians as a "fighting race (zhandou minzu 战斗民族)."
