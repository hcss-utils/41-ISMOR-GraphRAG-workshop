Trade Public diplomacy NOTE: Political warfare consists of the intentional use of one or more of the implements of power (diplomatic, information, military, and economic) to affect the political composition or decision-making within a state.
Political warfare is often-but not necessarily-carried out covertly, but must be carried out outside the context of traditional war.
Caveat: All activities here are meant to be illustrative, rather than an exhaustive list of possible actions.
The research approach included a deeply researched historical chapter (Chapter Two) examining how the United States practiced political warfare in the past, particularly during the Cold War, followed by four case studies examining the conduct of what might be deemed modern political warfare.
Using primary sources, the research team identified the doctrinal or theoretical basis for political warfare and its dominant mea sures or means used by Russia, Iran, and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), as well as corporate practices today that might be deemed an analogous form of corporate warfare.
This research also explored the ability of nonstate actors to conduct this form of warfare.
The case studies on Russia, Iran, and ISIL all considered the tools available to those actors under the commonly employed Diplomatic, Informational, Military, and Economic (DIME) construct, with additional attention paid to such areas as cyber and intelligence ser vices insofar as they were used to carry out activities to gain influence and leverage or weaken, destabilize, subvert, or overthrow governments without resorting to war.
