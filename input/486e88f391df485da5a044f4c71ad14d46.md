This "increased interest" introduces a long list of threats that the Russian military must counter.
Many of these seem innocuous or improbable-but it must be remembered that they will be interpreted in Moscow in accordance with a Russian view of the world, which contains a hostile, irresponsible and aggressive NATO and United States.
In this context, references to "deployment of groups of forces and systems with a view to launching a military attack on Russia or its allies," "military exercises with provocative aims," and changes to "the current balance of forces near the borders of the Russian Federation" all refer, in Russian eyes, to any enhancement of U.S. cooperation with European partners.
