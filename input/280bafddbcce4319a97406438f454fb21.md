The German General Staff launched Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 assuming the eastern campaign would last only three months.
However, within six months after the initiation of hostilities the Red Army blunted the Wehrmacht's attack outside the gates of Moscow, Operation Barbarossa had failed.
Although a long standing and professional organization the German General Staff failed to achieve strategic success, despite significant success during the early stages of the campaign.
Adolf Hitler's national goal of Russian extermination exceeded the German Army's capabilities.
The war lasted nearly four years and resulted in the devastation of western Russia, millions dead and the destruction of Germany.
This thesis examines how the divergence between the Wehrmacht's capabilities and Hitler's ideological national objectives affected Operation Barbarossa.
