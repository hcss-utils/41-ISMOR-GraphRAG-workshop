When Russia annexed Crimea, it tested its ability to use non-linear warfare in the contemporary environment-true to Gerasimov's article, non-military measures were at the heart of the operation and IO were present before, during, and after Russia annexed Crimea.
The annexation was a gamble of sorts, or at least a calculated risk.
It appears that Putin bet on the fact that most NATO member states would be outraged-but would not take military action to repel the incursion because Ukraine was not worth a war with Russia; he was right.
