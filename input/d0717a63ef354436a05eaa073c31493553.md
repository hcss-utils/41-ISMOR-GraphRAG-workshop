Immediately following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the level of nuclear threat confronting the United States was significantly reduced; however, an estimated 30,000 nuclear warheads were spread among the former Soviet Republics 36 The American perspective on the Tajik civil war (1992-96) was that it was a power struggle involving clans or regional cliques, and was engineered by Russia with a view to justifying its military presence in Central Asia.
But, its reasoning was seriously flawed -that there were no Islamist elements in Afghanistan interested in a spillover into Central Asia; the Taliban was an indigenous Afghan phenomenon who did not have any regional agenda; Afghan fratricidal strife was purely about capturing power in Kabul; and that the Taliban would be ultimately a factor of regional stability.
Americans were not alone living in a different intellectual universe. "
French scholar Olivier Roy laughed off the very thought that there could be 'revolution-exporting Islamic fundamentalists in Afghanistan.'"
