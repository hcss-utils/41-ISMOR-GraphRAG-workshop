At the start of the 18 th century Germany, and Prussia in particular, began to introduce a leadership framework that would continue to influence the conduct of military operations until the present day.
This model, called Auftragstaktik 3 (which translates to mission oriented tactics or mission command), was not a doctrinal dogma, nor a tactical principle, but a cultural inspiration that would have led the German Army in chaotic and dubious circumstances, with the sole aim of maintaining its operational tempo.
