The success of NATO deterrent threats has two parts: credibility and intent.
First, the military resources balance favors NATO, so the capability to deter a hybrid aggression is there.
The question remains, however, will it be enough to deter Russia's use of hybrid warfare to expand its sphere of influence?
The second part is the intent to do what NATO threatens to do, 54 in which Russia seeks to challenge the cohesion of the 28 NATO countries and employs hybrid warfare to have its claims accepted and to undermine NATO's will to take action.
The last NATO official stance is that, despite more than two decades of efforts to develop dialogue and practical cooperation with Russia, the "cooperation [with Russia] has been suspended in response to Russia's military intervention in Ukraine, which the Allies condemn in the strongest terms; â€¦ however, the alliance does not seek confrontation and poses no threat to Russia."
