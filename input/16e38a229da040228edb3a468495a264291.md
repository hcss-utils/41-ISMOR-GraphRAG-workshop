What cannot be so easily deduced [are] the formal and institutional process by which the main opportunities of Russian strategy are identified, and the process of decision-making that sets them in motion.
Closely related to this are the organizations and organizational processes that define, organize, coordinate, and set in motion the various tactical steps in each concrete situation.
Here, too, the reason is obvious: these are matters of the utmost secrecy.
Indeed, the entire mechanism by which strategy is translated into tactics in Putin's Russia is protected by the same shield of secrecy that surrounded high tactics in the U.S.S.R. The one thing that can be asserted beyond doubt is that the process is highly centralized in Putin's own office and that he has been involved in every stage of that process.
Putin, a product of the late Soviet KGB, simply assumes that this [is] all a natural and key element of his personal leadership.
To compromise tactical secrecy would be to compromise the entire enterprise.
