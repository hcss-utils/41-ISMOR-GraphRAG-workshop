General-Major Sterlin and colleagues explained in 2019 that Russia's current operations and planning model divide Russia's deterrence forces into three areas: (1) global deterrence, which is the responsibility of nonstrategic nuclear weapons and strategic nuclear weapons; (2) regional deterrence, which is achieved by nonstrategic nuclear weapons and strategic nonnuclear deterrence forces to de-escalate and suppress major nonnuclear threats; and (3) local deterrence, which is achieved through the presence of strategic nonnuclear weapons and general-purpose forces to block local nonnuclear threats and prevent the nuclear threshold from sliding into the lower-echelon local wars and armed conflicts.
