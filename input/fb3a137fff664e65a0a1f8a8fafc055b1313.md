Hatred of Revolutionary France along with the desire to pursue traditional foreign policy objectives led to the formation of the Second Coalition in 1798 consisting of Britain, Austria, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Naples.
The war began with a powerful Austro-Russian surge that swept the French from Italy, while an Anglo-Russian expedition landed in Holland in late August 1799.
However, as Russian forces approached the French border via Switzerland, a French army defeated them in the mountains of Zurich in late September 1799.
As a result, after initial successes, the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland stalled.
Faced with early winter gales that made provisioning by sea difficult, the Allies agreed to an armistice with the French, which saw all troops re-embarked by 19 November 1799.
Earlier that month, General Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the French government.
Before year's end, he outmaneuvered his fellow conspirators to make himself dictator of France under the title of First Consul.
