Abroad, significant changes to the international system may change Iranian motives and catalyze a recalibrated military intervention approach.
The future of (1) great-power competition and how it plays out in the Middle East and (2) the regional landscape are important factors that will shape how Iran sees its military activities.
Increased Chinese and Russian military and economic presence in the region is likely to factor into Iranian calculations regarding the regional balance of power, as is the dynamic between Beijing, Moscow, and Washington.
Although a move away from a period of greater U.S. power in the region would seem to provide fewer threats and more opportunities for Iran, the relations among these key states and how they affect Iranian perceptions of the regional balance of power bear careful monitoring.
