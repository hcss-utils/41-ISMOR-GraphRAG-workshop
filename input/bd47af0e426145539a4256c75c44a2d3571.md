Tactics versus strategy -don't confuse the two.
Mr. Putin and his advisors do not and that is key.
In this case, tactics are the short term, battlefield activities used by a country.
Putin and Russia can pursue military activities in places like Syria, the Ukraine or a dozen other frozen conflicts.
It can also be economic activities like shoring up the ruble, or turning down a supply of petrol in a saturated market.
On the other hand, strategy focuses on the long term, and seeks to re-establish Russian regional hegemony, stymie perceived Western (US and NATO) containment, and grow their economic and diplomatic power.
These lines blur naturally, and it is for this reason an insistence on understanding the distinction and the importance of having a national strategy deliberately designed to advance one's own national interests.
