# Fulltext:
During the Cold War, the comparatively minor contributions of European air forces to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) were not visible to the outside world because of their incorporation within the alliance structure and strategy. The first Gulf War starkly revealed the disparity between the air power of the United States and that of any other country. Subsequent operations in the Balkans, Iraq, and Afghanistan have demanded even more timely and accurate intelligence, with swifter response and greater precision in attack.
The US accretion of all-weather precision munitions; stealth technology; netted real-time command, control, communications, and intelligence; unmanned aerial vehicles; and satellite systems has widened the gap with European air forces still further. The evolution and contribution of continental European air forces to recent operations remain largely unexplored, partly because of their limitations and partly because of Anglo-Saxon intellectual domination of air power analysis and concepts.
Christian Anrig examines the responses of four countries to the challenges of air power in the last two decades. He has selected four very different air forces: the French Air Force (FAF), German Air Force (GAF), Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF), and Swedish Air Force (SwAF). All four were influenced by the Cold War period. The GAF and RNLAF were embedded in Cold War NATO, the SwAF maintained a well-armed neutrality, and the FAF reflected the semi-independent strategic stance of post-de Gaulle France.
The author addresses four questions: how have these air forces responded to post-Cold War political uncertainties, how have they operated, how have they responded to new air power thinking, and how have they adapted to the challenges of costs and technologies? He convincingly argues that budgetary provision has not been the most important factor in generating effective air power.
He traces the different interactions of political will, procurement, and operational effectiveness among the four air forces. All are highly professional, but only France has sought to sustain a capability across all air power roles. Christian Anrig's examination is both instructive and disheartening. The United States operator and student will be enlightened xvi FOREWORD by awareness of the quality, value, and proportional scale of recent and current European air operations. Anyone who is detailed to work alongside these air forces will benefit considerably from under standing how and why they do what they do. He or she will recognise the circumstances which have precluded them from the doctrinal path of John Warden. Sadly, the author has only too clearly identified the national features which, with one or two exceptions, are likely to inhibit the creation of European air power in the foreseeable future.
The author brings deep scholarship to his study, reinforced by his national objectivity. It is a unique and indispensable contribution to international awareness of twenty-first-century air power.

Continental Europe was at the vanguard of air power in the early days of military aviation. The Italian invasion of Libya in 1911 saw the first use of aircraft in combat, and France soon seized the lead in the development of aircraft engines. By the dawn of World War I, Germany and France wielded the most potent air arms. After the cancellation of the Versailles treaty, German air power was again on the rise, with the Luftwaffe playing a crucial role in enabling the sweeping blitzkrieg campaigns.
Yet in the course of World War II, the United States and the United Kingdom emerged as the leading nations in the application of air power-particularly in strategic bombing. The dominance of American air power continued throughout the Cold War and became particularly apparent again in Desert Storm and later conflicts. Against this setting, a prominent British air power scholar and practitioner coined the term "differential air power, " referring to the transatlantic air power capability gap. 
1
Despite this transatlantic air power capability gap, Continental European air forces remain significant. Some of them have been regularly deployed to out-of-area operations in the Balkans, in Afghanistan, and elsewhere. In the shadow of the Anglo-Saxon air power debate, however, Continental European approaches to air power have largely been ignored in the academic literature. In contrast, Russian and, to a lesser degree, Chinese air power have received attention. The Quest for Relevant Air Power attempts to redress this imbalance by contributing to a more inclusive picture of Western air power. To do so, it analyses the following key question: lar country and its defence policy became more complex. This has had far-reaching implications for the application of air power. Continental European air forces no longer know where, when, with whom, and under what circumstances they are going to fight.
Devoid of its major opponent, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) main purpose shifted from deterrence to crisis management. NATO engaged in its first out-of-area combat missions in the Balkan civil wars of the 1990s. In parallel it began its ongoing enlargement process in the second half of the 1990s. Simultaneous to these NATO developments, the European Union (EU) has emerged as a global strategic player and has built its own defence structure. Although the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) is intended to be a complementary arrangement to NATO, tensions have arisen (and are likely to continue to arise): some European nations put a premium on a strong transatlantic partnership with the United States, and others on a more autonomous European defence architecture. Failures in alliance policy have led to ad hoc coalitions such as the US-led "coalition of the willing" against Iraq in 2003. Neutral and non-aligned countries have found it more and more difficult to legitimise their passive stance, particularly against the backdrop of an increase in deployed operations for humanitarian purposes.
With a few exceptions-such as airlift in humanitarian and peacekeeping operations and the participation of the French Air Force (FAF) in peripheral conflicts-Continental European air power was relegated to deterrence postures in the Cold War era. Since the end of the Cold War, however, a shift away from a deterrence posture and towards real operations has occurred. In an environment of highly unpredictable and diverse conflicts, air power was called upon to carry out missions across the spectrum of force. The post-Cold War era has seen the employment of air power in high-intensity conflicts, in "air policing" operations, and in peace support and humanitarian operations.
In the post-Cold War era, the demand for airlift in humanitarian and peace support operations has increased. In the early 1990s, Bosnia in particular called for military airlift. Under the most adverse conditions, Western air forces kept Sarajevo alive by mount-ing an air bridge. Airlift was also used for interventions and humanitarian relief operations in Africa and elsewhere.
New for Continental European air forces was the employment of air power in conventional high-intensity conflicts. In the 1990-91 Gulf War, the United Kingdom, France, and Italy contributed their combat air power. Their assistance, however, was dwarfed by the massive use of American air power. In the remainder of the 1990s, Western air power was primarily employed in intrastate conflicts. Western military interventions in the Balkans led to three major air campaigns with the aim of stopping ethnic cleansing-Operation Deny Flight over Bosnia from 1993 to 1995, Operation Deliberate Force in August and September 1995, and Operation Allied Force over Kosovo and Serbia in 1999. In each air campaign, Continental European air forces participated. Yet their employment was dependent upon American air power.
In the wake of the 1990-91 Gulf War, air policing operations were also conducted over northern and southern Iraq to check the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, who proved reluctant to comply with United Nations (UN) resolutions. France was the only Continental European combat aircraft contributor. After the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001, Continental European air forces went into air policing action over Afghanistan. Only a few of them, however, such as the Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF), contributed to stabilisation operations in Iraq.
This shift from Cold War deterrence postures to real operations across the spectrum of force has represented a major challenge for most Continental European air forces, as deployed operations require a very different organisational structure and mindset.
Whereas in the Cold War a strict distinction existed between tactical/conventional and strategic/nuclear air power, the Gulf War revealed that conventional military air power can do more than execute a supportive role for land warfare. Consequently, a new intellectualism in air power thinking and doctrine arose, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon countries.
Today's conflicts are generally complex and multilayered. Armed forces have to prepare not only for interstate conflict but also for a broad range of conflicts across the spectrum of force.
Moreover, no clear line can be drawn between the different kinds of conflict; they often merge into each other. On top of that, the unchallenged superiority of Western military technology, particularly American air power, has created a shift from symmetrical to asymmetrical warfare.
In light of these new kinds of operations, Anglo-Saxon air forces recognised early that sound doctrine and education are of utmost importance. Moreover, many officers and scholars alike started to publish their views on air power. A central question that emerged from Operation Desert Storm is whether air power is a panacea instrument in the new strategic environment. Other widely discussed topics have been the concepts of parallel warfare and effects-based operations. In contrast to serial warfare, parallel warfare-as applied in the air campaign of Desert Storm-aims to paralyse the opponent by simultaneously striking at so-called tactical, operational, and strategic targets. In the second half of the 1990s, the need to limit physical damage and to achieve limited goals led to the discussion of effects-based operations.
The intellectual mastery of air power is essential in tackling the complexities of today's conflicts and is indispensable for effective interoperability with allied air forces. This discussion therefore includes how Continental European air forces cope with a new intellectualism in air power thinking and doctrine and to what extent they have been influenced by their Anglo-Saxon counterparts.
With its clearly defined threats, the Cold War provided governments and militaries alike with a more or less reliable framework for planning, force structuring, and procurement. This certainty has ceased to exist, and European politicians have proved reluctant to keep defence spending on a Cold War level. Cashing in the peace dividend has seemed to be more popular. In parallel, costs for advanced air power technology have risen almost exponentially in the information age. Political, financial, and technological constraints have prevented most European nations from acquiring air power capabilities comparable to those of the United States.

Cooperative ventures can help to reduce costs. Multinational aircraft programmes had already been undertaken in the Cold War, such as the development of the Franco-British Jaguar or the trinational Panavia Tornado combat aircraft. Pressure for industrial cooperation has increased since then. Role specialisation offers another way to reduce costs.
To add to the complexity of procurement, the provenance and technical standard of air power assets can have far-reaching repercussions on options for participation in combined operations. Nowadays, interoperability is dependent upon complex and costly data links, sensors, armaments, and weapons platforms. In particular, interoperability with the United States Air Force (USAF) is a major challenge for Continental European air forces. Thus, defence planners and militaries alike have to think hard about how to maintain a relevant air force. Procurement in the face of declining defence budgets and soaring costs for air power hardware has become a major challenge for Continental European air forces.
The 1999 air publication British Air Power Doctrine defines air power as "the ability to project force in air or space by or from a platform or missile operating above the surface of the earth. " It further defines air platforms as "any aircraft, helicopter or unmanned air vehicle. "

The choice of the air forces required a balance between depth and breadth. The EU has 27 member states, most of which have an air force. Several non-EU member states also possess air power assets. Since it is not feasible to cover all Continental European air forces in the required depth in this study, criteria for the choice of air forces were devised. Foremost, it was decided to look at the major Continental European players, of which there were several at the outset of the post-Cold War era. In contrast to smaller European air forces-primarily relegated to defensive counterair, air policing, and airlift missions-the forces chosen offer a larger air power spectrum for examination and are more comparable to the major Anglo-Saxon players. Diversity in defence and alliance policies, real operations, and air power hardware was another selection criterion.
The air forces that best fit these criteria are the Armée de l' Air (French Air Force), Luftwaffe (German Air Force), Koninklijke Luchtmacht (Royal Netherlands Air Force), and Flygvapnet (Swedish Air Force). The study of these four air forces highlights the impact of profoundly different defence policies upon air power and compares NATO air forces with a non-aligned air force. Within the NATO air forces, this choice also provides a broad range. At one end of the scale is the Netherlands with its transatlantic orientation and its strong emphasis upon NATO as its most important security pillar. At the other end is France, which only recently reentered NATO's integrated military structure. France emphasises an independent European security and defence policy, emancipated from American leadership. The air forces selected also highlight the impact of professional and conscript armed forces on air power. While France and the Netherlands professionalized their armed forces in the 1990s, Germany has thus far retained conscript armed forces with a professional core component. In July 2011, however, Germany plans to implement "its biggest military reform in more than 50 years" and go to an all-volunteer force. The German chancellor also agreed to reduce troops from 250,000 to 185,000.

Because the end of the Cold War brought about far-reaching changes in the global strategic setting, the research is chronologi-cally confined to the post-Cold War era. Militarily, this period constitutes a transitional phase from a potential symmetric clash between East and West through intrastate conflicts to asymmetric attacks against the West and military operations in the context of the so-called war on terror. This era saw Western military forces engaged in a greater variety of operations than at any time during the Cold War. 
5
The next chapter, "Post-Cold War Challenges, " lays down the background for examining the selected air forces. Subsequent chapters examine the French, German, Royal Netherlands, and Swedish Air Forces.
Undoubtedly, the FAF is the most experienced Continental European air force when it comes to power projection beyond the borders of Europe. Apart from Operations Northern Watch, Desert Fox, and Iraqi Freedom, it participated in all major Western air campaigns during the post-Cold War era. To be an instrument of French foreign policy, the FAF is geared towards rapid intervention missions. It is capable of independently mounting medium-sized operations in Africa and elsewhere. To fulfil its missions and to prevent infringements upon the sovereign political decision making process, the FAF has strived to maintain a balanced force structure and has mainly relied upon indigenous air assets and equipment.
Due to its historical legacy, the GAF was almost exclusively bound to the defence of allied territory in NATO's central region throughout the Cold War. The question as to whether Germany should leave its emphasis upon territorial defence and shift to a more expeditionary stance has been a major bone of contention in German politics throughout the post-Cold War era. The first steps towards a more active defence policy were taken in 1995 and 1999 in the milieu of Operations Deliberate Force and Allied Force, respectively. Significant reunification costs also led to severely tight defence budgets. Nevertheless, the GAF remains one of the most important European air forces, and NATO alliance partners welcome a more active involvement of the GAF in alliance operations.
The RNLAF has participated in air operations over the Balkans since 1993, making substantial contributions out of proportion to its relatively small size. Among the leading air forces in European air power cooperation, the RNLAF has launched several initiatives for improving interoperability. Its most prominent initiative is the establishment of a European expeditionary F-16 wing. European cooperation, distinct doctrinal features, a strong transatlantic partnership, and the political will to engage in operations across the spectrum of military force have made the RNLAF one of the most effective European air forces of the post-Cold War era.
Though Sweden's economy and population are relatively small, the Swedish have pursued ambitious air power programmes. Given the country's neutral stance throughout the Cold War era, its goal was to be as independent as possible in the development and production of military assets. Therefore, Sweden is unique among the smaller European countries in the sense that its air force employs indigenously designed and manufactured aircraft. At the end of the Cold War, the Swedish Air Force (SwAF) was one of the largest Western European air forces. A RAND study published in 1991 regarded it as one of the best European air forces, particularly in the area of air defence.

The concluding chapter assesses European air power across the four guiding challenges of shifting defence and alliance policies, real operations, new intellectualism in air power thinking and doctrine, and procurement. While each air force has responded to the air power challenges of the post-Cold War era according to its context, the conclusion nevertheless attempts to identify overall characteristics of Continental European air power.  Force, 1990-2005  (Santa Monica, CA: RAND, 1991), 13, 27.   Chapter 2
Our discussion now turns to the uncertainties created by shifting defence and alliance policies and to the challenge of real operations, thereby providing the background for the air forces selected for examination. These issues closely relate as they show how air power has both been shaped by the political level and been used as a means to pursue political goals. We then consider how Anglo-Saxon (US, UK, and Australian) air forces have responded to the new intellectualism in air power thinking and doctrine and how defence planners have attempted to maintain relevant air forces in light of escalating costs. These questions are tied in that the first deals with conceptual and doctrinal aspects of air power and the second with its physical components.
With the end of the Cold War, threats and risks have become complex and multilayered, making it difficult for European states to adapt their defence policies. Simultaneously, alliance structures forged during the Cold War have evolved to respond to the changing strategic context.
The end of the Cold War marked a profound change in the inter national system as the antagonism between two opposing social and value systems ceased to be the defining criterion. Consequently, the 1990s became a period of instability, continuous change, and a quest for new structures.

Changing Paradigms for Defence Planning. Whereas the Cold War was dominated by nuclear deterrence and preparations for a symmetric large-scale war in Continental Europe, the post-Cold War era has required a different approach. Latent or future threats-so-called risks-superseded present and direct threats as key determinants of defence policy in the 1990s. With an attendant loss of predictability, a conceptual realignment of the paradigms for defence planning became necessary.

Impact upon Air Power. In the aftermath of Desert Storm, the inherent characteristics of air power such as speed, range, flexibility, precision, and lethality had a certain appeal to Western defence planners and experts, particularly in the United States. Air power seemed to many a versatile military instrument in an era of uncertainty.

In Continental Europe, on the contrary, air power has never enjoyed such a prominent role as in the United States, leading to a major transatlantic capability gap. This gap became particularly visible in the post-Cold War era, when air forces were actually employed in major air campaigns. As late as 2003, a Dutch air power expert complained that Europe was still not able to mount an operation similar in complexity to Allied Force on its own. 17
In the wake of the Cold War, NATO underwent a major transformational process, culminating in an enlargement process. Simultaneously, the European Union started to build its own defence architecture. The ESDP is commonly perceived to be a complementary arrangement to NATO. Both institutions have influenced the development of European air power.
European Security and Defence Policy. The end of the Cold War prompted the European Community member states to consider extending cooperation to the sphere of security and defence policy. With the Treaty on the European Union officially signed in Maastricht, the Netherlands, in February 1992, the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) was agreed upon. At the time, the prospect of a future common defence was held out and an explicit link to the Western European Union (WEU) as an integral part of EU security and defence matters was established.

In concert with NATO's enlargement, power projection became an increasingly important focus for the alliance. The strategic concept, adopted at the 1999 Washington summit, underlined NATO's willingness to support operations under UN authority.

European alliance frameworks have either directly or indirectly influenced cooperative ventures in the arena of air power. Cooperative ventures have taken place in the context of the ESDP, NATO, and bilateral or multilateral organisational relationships.

Since the early 1990s, Western air power has been applied across the spectrum of force. The utilization of Western air power in the geographical hotspots of the Middle East and the Balkans is examined next, followed by its operations in other areas of the world.
The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 triggered the beginning of a series of air operations in the Middle East. Besides high-intensity air campaigns as conducted in the course of Operations Desert Storm and Iraqi Freedom, Western air power was used in a constabulary role for implementing the no-fly zones (NFZ) over northern and southern Iraq.
Desert Storm. On 2 August 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait with the aim of annexing it. In the wake of this aggressive act, the United States embarked upon Operation Desert Shield. Its purpose was to deter further aggression against Saudi Arabia and to protect an allied force buildup in the region. Due to its agility, air power proved to be the most essential element in the early phase of Operation Desert Shield. Swiftly, a force consisting of fighters, fighterbombers, AWACS aircraft, and a number of combat support aircraft was assembled. By 23 August, approximately 500 allied aircraft had already been dispatched to the crisis area, forestalling any potential Iraqi thrust into Saudi Arabia. 
84
The European combat aircraft contributors to Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm were the United Kingdom, France, and Italy. In variety and scale, the UK contribution was second only to that of the United States.

Iraqi Freedom. After Afghanistan, the "war on terror" turned to Iraq. Operation Iraqi Freedom commenced on 19 March 2003 with a failed decapitation strike against Saddam and his sons by means of Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles and F-117s. To achieve surprise and to secure the Rumilyah oil fields, however, the Anglo-American ground incursion preceded the actual air campaign, with the former starting early in the morning and the latter in the evening of 21 March.

After these major combat operations had ceased, Western air power continued to play an important role in Iraq by providing air surveillance, reconnaissance, precision air strikes, and airlift. Air power was particularly applied in so-called urban joint warfare, as the battle for Fallujah in November 2004 demonstrated. 114
Immediately after Desert Storm, the Balkans emerged as the second major trouble spot for Western governments in the post-Cold War era. Unlike the case of the Gulf War in 1991, it was not easy to reach political consensus on how to tackle the situation in the Balkans throughout the 1990s. Thus, the execution of air operations was influenced by political, diplomatic, and alliance friction.
Deny Flight. Operation Deny Flight started on 12 April 1993. It was first supposed to enforce a declared NFZ over Bosnia by means of round-the-clock combat air patrols (CAP).

In 1993 a multinational force attempted to restore order in Somalia. This operation came to an abrupt halt when US transport helicopters were shot down by a warlord's faction on 3 October 1993, resulting in 18 American Soldiers killed. The Clinton administration subsequently ordered a phased withdrawal.

Outside Africa, it was primarily Haiti and East Timor that saw Western third-party intervention in the wake of internal tensions and clashes.

Air Policing and Constabulary Tasks. The events of 11 September also put an unprecedented emphasis upon aerial constabulary tasks and reemphasised the importance of national airspace protection. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks against the United States, Western air forces undertook special efforts to protect national airspace. Furthermore, though air power alone cannot fight terrorism, it is regarded as an important enabler for the other services in combating terrorism, particularly through the gathering of intelligence.
Humanitarian Relief Missions. Throughout the post-Cold War era, military airlift has played a major role in disaster relief missions. These disasters have been caused by civil wars, famine, or natural catastrophes, and they have required responsive delivery of medical supplies, food, shelter, and mobile communications. As is shown in the ensuing chapters, Continental European air forces have been heavily engaged in humanitarian relief missions by providing airlift. Yet, disaster relief missions are not relegated to airlift alone. In 1996, for instance, an RAF aerial reconnaissance detachment was dispatched to former Zaire in support of Operation Purposeful. An assessment of aerial imagery revealed the refugees' requirements. 
162
In British parlance, military doctrine is defined as a collection of fundamental principles that serve as a guideline for military operations but should not be adhered to dogmatically. 
163
164
The resurgence of intellectual air power thinking within these air forces has also been accompanied by scores of books and articles written by scholars and airmen alike. In the aftermath of Desert Storm, the literature chiefly reflected the intense debate over the effectiveness of air power. The air campaign seemed to prove the views of air power zealots, who believed in the distinct effectiveness of air power and who voiced their standpoints in a number of articles. From their point of view, the distinct employment of air power against leadership-related target sets is synonymous with the term strategic.

167
Specific topics have emerged in the post-Cold War air power debate. In the aftermath of Desert Storm, the concept of parallel warfare came to the fore, and in the second half of the 1990s, the term effects-based operations (EBO) began to dominate the doctrinal debate. Both concepts imply that achieving strategic goals is within the sphere of not only nuclear forces but also conventional air power. PGMs proved so successful in Desert Storm that they offset the need for mass attacks. Many different target sets could be attacked simultaneously versus sequentially, hence, the term parallel warfare. This approach has been thought to create paralysis within the enemy system.

The USAF released its first post-Cold War basic aerospace doctrine, Air Force Manual (AFM) 1-1, in March 1992. It superseded AFM 1-1 from 5 January 1984 and served to usher the way into a new air power era by formalizing the Gulf War air campaign lessons. As such, it highlighted aerospace power's inherent capability to rapidly or simultaneously engage objectives at any level from strategic through theatre to tactical, thereby embracing the concept of parallel warfare, though not explicitly mentioning it.

To institutionalise the doctrine development process, the Air Force Doctrine Center (AFDC), with headquarters at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, was established in February 1997. Ten years later, the AFDC was merged with the College of Aerospace Doctrine, Research, and Education into the LeMay Center for Doctrine Development and Education. The AFDC was responsible for researching, developing, and producing basic and operational doctrine and for reviewing doctrine education. Moreover, the centre participated in developing and investigating future aerospace concepts and technologies. In September 1997, the AFDC released a revised edition of Air Force Basic Doctrine.

Devoid of any national strategic air power doctrine, the RAF began to realise towards the end of the Cold War the importance of establishing a coherent and systematic doctrine to think about air power in overall and integrated campaign terms. This differed from the stand-alone roles characterising the RAF's presentation of air power since the 1957 defence review and the handover of principal responsibilities for the nuclear deterrent to the Navy.

The USAF has been at the leading edge of furthering the discussion of air power concepts. One vehicle for this dialog is the Air and Space Power Journal, first published in 1947. Through this journal, the Air Force Research Institute at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama, endeavours to promote worldwide air and space power thought. The journal is now published not only in English but also in five other languages, thereby reaching out to a vast audience. The English version is intended to foster a professional and intellectual dialogue within the USAF.

Western air campaigns of the post-Cold War era reveal a large discrepancy between American and European air power. Inadequate equipment largely accounts for this variance.
While Europe as a whole is not far behind the United States in defence spending, its military capabilities nevertheless lag significantly behind. Duplications, lack of integration, and retaining Cold War structures within Europe have all contributed to this gap.

The FAF operates four E-3 AWACS aircraft.
Besides national ventures, international cooperation has always been an important consideration in European aircraft development. For instance, Britain, Germany, and Italy joined together to develop and produce the most important European all-weather strike aircraft of the Cold War, the Tornado. This project has been followed by the currently most important European combat aircraft programme, the Eurofighter Typhoon. Planning started in the UK as early as 1979. By the mid-1980s, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain had joined the programme. The early stages of the programme were plagued by disagreements over operational requirements, and France finally ceased its participation in the multinational programme in August 1985.

Off the Shelf. An alternative to European aircraft programmes is buying American or Russian. This option, however, has serious industrial and political consequences, such as potential US market domination, which are likely to widen the transatlantic air power capability gap. Buying Russian is often incongruent with common European defence interests, and supply of spare parts might not meet Western reliability standards.

Shared Ownership. For certain excessively expensive key assets, shared ownership has long been pursued as a necessary option in the context of NATO. The prime example is the NATO Airborne Early Warning and Control Force. Through the NAEW&CF, NATO members were able to acquire an airborne early warning capability at much lower day-to-day operating costs than would have been the case if operated on an individual national basis.

The physical components of air power are essentially made up of four pillars-combat aircraft; air mobility; command, control, communications, computers, information/intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (C4ISTAR); and ground based air defence. While the first pillar has always been regarded as the backbone of air forces, the second and third pillars have gained in importance. This has to do with the increasing thrust towards deployed operations and with technological developments in the information age. The fourth pillar, ground based air defence, has also experienced an evolution, with its tasks having been extended from primarily defending against combat aircraft to defending against a panoply of airborne threats, especially theatre ballistic missiles.
Combat Aircraft. Though Western fighter designs of the 1960s and the 1970s were built to perform secondary ground-attack roles, this supposedly multirole capability did not stretch much beyond qualifying a once pure fighter to deliver air-to-ground munitions with mediocre accuracy. Complex air-to-ground missions still required dedicated all-weather strike aircraft such as the A-6, the F-111, or the Tornado. Only since the later stages of the Cold War era have true multirole aircraft designs become a viable option due to a number of remarkable technological achievements. This step was further facilitated through the introduction of PGMs because they allow even relatively small aircraft to achieve very good weapons-delivery accuracy.

Rafale flying over Afghanistan armed with armement air-sol modulaire (AASM), or modular air-to-surface armament, for precision air strikes Nowadays, many European air forces, such as the RAF, see multi role fighters as a necessity both for financial and operational reasons. Only multirole aircraft can meet the increasing demands of flexibility that have resulted from changes in the overall security environment.

The post-Cold War era has seen the emergence of various European weapons, significantly decreasing dependency upon the United States. The ubiquitous American short-range air-intercept missile AIM-9L Sidewinder, for instance, is being supplanted in many European air forces by the Infrared Imaging System-Tail/Thrust Vector-Controlled (IRIS-T) air-to-air missile (AAM). The IRIS-T is the outgrowth of a multinational European programme that began in 1997.

Heavy strategic airlift, on the other hand, was the domain of the USAF and, to a lesser extent, of the former Soviet Air Force during the Cold War. It required the development of large aircraft such as the Lockheed C-5 Galaxy or the Antonov An-124 Condor, capable of lifting nearly every bulky piece of equipment in service with the respective armed forces.

C4ISTAR. Carrying a long-range surveillance radar, the E-3 AWACS aircraft is capable of providing a comprehensive, realtime picture of air operations in a theatre. A British air power expert singled it out as the linchpin of the coalition's application of air power in Desert Shield and Desert Storm. 
300
301
Another air power innovation of the post-Cold War era is the increasing use of remotely piloted aircraft. RPAs have proved to be an efficient supplement to manned aircraft in the role of intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance (ISTAR), where persistence over the battlespace is a key requirement. Only technological quantum leaps of the 1990s, such as improvement in computing and data-link technology, made the considerable potential of RPA systems a viable option for Western air forces. RPAs offer significant advantages over manned aircraft when it comes to missions involving high risk or extreme endurance. For the primary purpose of intelligence gathering, air forces have employed basically two types of RPAs-high-altitude, long-endurance and medium-altitude, long-endurance (MALE) systems.

During WWI the French aircraft and aircraft engine industries were at the forefront in production and technical efficiency. By the last year of the war, the French air service was the second largest in the world; yet, only in 1933 did it become an independent service. However, Army officers-who dominated the high command of the armed forces-continued to provide strategic direction. This led to an inappropriate air power doctrine and contributed to France's defeat in 1940.

The ensuing shortfalls in the FAF's conventional force posture became particularly apparent during Operation Desert Storm. Hence, the FAF aspired to significantly improve its conventional capabilities and to enhance interoperability with its NATO partners. This did not imply that France would forego its particular national status in multinational air campaigns, an issue that became particularly apparent during Operation Allied Force in 1999. When French decision makers didn't consent to certain target sets, their American counterparts viewed them as non-cooperative. This led to the perception, particularly in the Anglo-Saxon world, that France had effectively hindered a more effective air campaign.

Defence and Alliance Policies?
This section first analyses France's post-Cold War defence policy and its influence on the FAF's evolution. France's alliance policies are described next, along with a view towards how they have affected its Air Force.
In the post-Cold War era, French defence policy has been articulated primarily through three key documents-the 1994 Defence White Book, published under the late presidency of François Mitterrand; Jacques Chirac's reform, A New Defence 1997-2015; and the 2008 Defence White Book published in the early presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy. While the 1994 Defence White Book represented a cautious adjustment to the post-Cold War environment, A New Defence initiated far-reaching reforms in the second half of the 1990s. The 2008 Defence White Book ushered an era of a renewed relationship between France and the transatlantic alliance.
The 1994 White Book primarily described the emerging geostrategic environment immediately after the end of the Cold War and laid out broad directions for the French defence architecture. Conspicuously, it avoided referring to critical issues such as the future composition of the nuclear forces.

• Preserve vital French interests against any form of aggression.
• Contribute to the security and defence of Europe and the Mediterranean space and build a common European defence.
• Help to strengthen peace and respect for international law.
• Support civil authorities through subsidiary missions. 17
The White Book further states that nuclear deterrence remains an indispensable pillar of French military strategy. In contrast to the Cold War, however, it is argued that a new balance between nuclear and conventional forces must be achieved. Moreover, France has to be capable of defending its interests, both autonomously and in a coalition. While conventional forces would allow France to intervene in regional conflicts, nuclear forces must be capable of permanently fulfilling two key functions: to inflict unacceptable damage upon any opponent in a second strike and to conduct limited strikes against military objectives.

The Armed Forces 2000 project was presented for the first time in June 1989, four months prior to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Two years later, the modalities to implement the Armed Forces 2000 project were laid out. Its main objective was to improve military crisis management capabilities by enhancing power projection.

To support the primary drive towards enhancing power projection, the number of AAR aircraft was to be increased. Against the projection logic, however, was the planned reduction of the airlift fleet. A reason for this cutback lies in the aging of available airframes and delays in their replacement. With power projection identified by Chirac's reform as the primary mission of conventional forces, a major goal set for the FAF has been the capability to deploy up to 100 combat aircraft in an out-of-area operation.

In the early 1990s, the Army air wing (Aviation légère de l' armée de terre) contained slightly more than 700 utility, transport, and combat helicopters as well as a couple of fixed-wing aircraft. Additionally, the Army operated more than 1,200 air defence guns as well as 345 SAM systems, including man-portable air defence systems (MANPADS) and a considerable number of Roland I/II and Hawk systems. With its organic air arm, the Navy operated 156 fixed-wing and 52 rotary-wing aircraft in the early 1990s.

With regard to the relevance of the FAF in real operations, interesting evolutions have taken place in the post-Cold War era. During the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, the FAF's mission was originally conceived to be purely defensive. As well as contributing to the defence of Saudi airspace, its main mission was to cover the action of the French Army division Daguet.

Regarding nuclear deterrence, while the maritime component with its nuclear submarines is the most powerful and survivable component, the strategic air component is considered useful for political signalling due to its visible and reversible deployment.

France's alliance policy of the post-Cold War era has been considerably marked by its Gaullist heritage. Autonomy and independence in decision making have remained cornerstones of French foreign and defence policy. Yet the end of bipolarity, which had allowed France a certain degree of freedom of manoeuvre between the two superpowers, and the new security challenges meant that France had to embark upon a path of rapprochement towards its NATO partners.
Reasons for rapprochement were manifold. A crucial one was France's active involvement in UN operations. While France's rank and status were secured by an independent nuclear force during the Cold War era, this formula was only partially valid in the post-Cold War era. Particularly in the early 1990s, France sought to secure its international status and permanent seat in the UN Security Council through a decisive role and enhanced visibility in peace support operations. As the conduct of these operations was largely shaped by NATO councils and committees, participation in the decisionmaking process was considered necessary.

Moreover, despite tensions over the Iraq crisis in 2003, France has reiterated its policy of rapprochement towards NATO and has made significant contributions to the newly set up NATO Response Force, with the logic that only a strong French commitment can contribute to the alliance becoming more European.

NATO Context. The prospect of advancing the European pillar within the Atlantic Alliance has certainly featured prominently in French calculations of its significant contributions to the NRF. But France approved the NRF concept only under certain conditions. For instance, the employment of French armed forces on behalf of the European Union must not be affected by NRF commitments.

On the continent, it has largely been the German Air Force with which the FAF has sought to deepen its ties. This basically reflects the Franco-German partnership at the grand-strategic level in promoting European defence. A few months after the creation of the FBEAG, the FAF set up an exchange system for airlift with the German Air Force. Henceforth, the system allowed each nation to utilise each other's transport aircraft. 
101
In the wake of 11 September, the FAF has mainly been pursuing European cooperation in the area of air policing. According to the view of the chief of the Air Staff, multilateral cooperation and efforts to integrate national airspaces were to be identified and air policing procedures to be harmonised.

In the wake of the Algerian War, France adopted a new military strategy to protect its remaining overseas interests. This strategy hinged upon light and rapidly deployable units as well as on theatre reception bases, which allowed for interventions on a much smaller scale but not necessarily at the lower end of the spectrum of military force. Particularly under the presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing (1974-81), French overseas interventions experienced a drastic rise against the backdrop of growing Soviet-Cuban involvement in Africa.

Desert Storm constituted a watershed for French defence policy in general and for the FAF in particular. Politically, French participation in Operation Desert Storm aroused tensions within the republic's leadership. While François Mitterrand was basically the only one to support a troop deployment from the very beginning, the minister of the interior, for instance, warned of military engagement in an American-led operation and its consequences, particularly with regard to Franco-Arab relations.

Immediately after Desert Storm, the implementation of the NFZ over northern and southern Iraq represented the first opportunities to enhance operational experience in a multinational environment. On 25 July 1991, eight Mirage F1 CR reconnaissance aircraft and a C-135FR tanker were dispatched to Incirlik Air Base in Turkey. Operation Aconit was the French contribution to Operation Provide Comfort, aimed at protecting the Kurdish population in northern Iraq. Prior to the arrival of RAF Jaguars in late September, French Mirage aircraft were the only tactical reconnaissance assets of the allied contingent. The FAF regarded Opera-tion Provide Comfort as a valuable experience in adapting to allied procedures and using English for tactical communication.

Despite the alliance frictions of 1999, the FAF was the first European air force to engage targets in Afghanistan. From 23 September 2001, a French SIGINT aircraft gathered information over Afghanistan. This effort was augmented by the deployment of two Mirage IVPs together with two tanker aircraft to the Arab Emirates to deliver important imagery intelligence. The French used a two-pronged approach in deploying combat forces. The first was dispatching French Super Etendards from the aircraft carrier Both in the air and on the ground, cooperation between the two contingents was very tight. For instance, the American fighter aircraft were air-to-air refuelled by the French tanker aircraft based in Manas.

As during the Cold War, French operations in Africa have generally been autonomous national operations. In many cases, French forces have intervened to temporarily stabilize hotspots or to evacuate Western citizens. As these operations have required quick reaction, power projection by air has proved indispensable for mission success. Besides airlift, the FAF has often provided combat aircraft, giving the lean French ground force deployments a decisive edge in firepower.
Already during the Gulf crisis in 1990-91, French troops were simultaneously involved in crisis management operations in Rwanda.

While Africa has remained a major hotspot for French stabilization and humanitarian operations since the days of the Cold War, the focus has become broader in the post-Cold War era. Cambodia and Bosnia in particular have attracted French assistance. Moreover, the FAF has assisted civil authorities in emergency situations such as floods within France itself. 165 In 1992 the FAF dispatched personnel and materiel under the UN banner to Cambodia in support of democratic elections. The deployment contained three Transall transport aircraft, air controllers, and ground personnel.

The 11 September tragedy had a major impact upon air policing in France. Immediately after the attacks, the FAF augmented the number of aircraft on high-readiness alert from two to 12, and the interception time over French territory was lowered from 30 to 10 minutes. Armed helicopters, AWACS and tanker aircraft, mobile ground radars, and GBAD supplemented these efforts.

French airmen in the interwar years had a culture of in-depth debate on air power theory, which found expression in several air power journals.

Since the end of the Cold War, there have been two failed attempts at formalising an official French air power doctrine-the first in 1998 and the second in 2003. A 2006 French study argues that these failures reveal the lack of an institutionalised doctrinal process within the FAF. 
178
The first attempt in 1998 can be related to the Concept d' emploi des forces (Concept for the Employment of the Armed Forces), published in 1997. This joint document establishes the purpose of the French armed forces according to the four strategic core functions as identified in the 1994 Defence White Book-deterrence, prevention, projection, and protection.

As regards higher education of FAF officers, the two major innovations in the post-Cold War era have been an increasing thrust towards joint and, later on, towards combined teaching. Since 1993 higher military education has been delivered at the CID. It basically replaced single-service education, which in the case of the FAF was provided by the École supérieure de guerre aérienne (ESGA), or Advanced School of Air Warfare.

In parallel with the increased publishing activities of the CID course participants, two series of air power conferences have been created within the FAF since 2004. It was primarily the CESA that stepped up its efforts to establish a broad air power debate. It organises the Ateliers de l' Armée de l' Air (Air Force conference) and the Ateliers du CESA (CESA conference). The former is an annual air power conference, which took place for the first time on 29 June 2004 at the special request of the chief of the Air Staff. These conferences are organised around several roundtables aimed at gathering industrialists, researchers, politicians, journalists, and militaries.

Research in the field of air power history and theory has also been encouraged by the highest authorities. The defence minister introduced in 2004 the Prix de l' Armée de l' Air (prize of the FAF). It honours outstanding achievements of doctoral theses or master's dissertations or the equivalent.

Right after WWII, French decision makers aspired to reestablish a potent indigenous aircraft industry. The emerging postwar FAF soon contained three components-a NATO component furnished with modern American materiel, a national component gradually being equipped by the national postwar aircraft industry, and an overseas component in Indochina that basically consisted of second-rate American materiel. From the 1960s onwards, however, the FAF has been primarily equipped with indigenous materiel. At the same time, it started to support the French industry in its thrust towards increased exports by providing training for foreign pilots. 238 Sales abroad were crucial to reduce the unit costs for the FAF's own equipment.

Unlike multinational programmes, the Rafale programme was conducted by a lean organisation, reportedly resulting in reduced costs and leading Dassault Aviation's chief executive officer to maintain that the 294 Rafales the FAF (234) and French Navy (60)  planned to acquire would cost less than Germany's 180 Eurofighters. Moreover, the FAF actively contributed to reducing costs by preventing excessively perfect solutions in areas considered less relevant in today's environment. Avionics and weapons became the focus of development efforts, while plans for a more powerful engine were put on hold. A major focus was also directed towards the use of all-European technology.

At the outset of the post-Cold War era, the FAF's principal precision-guided air-to-ground weapon was the laser-guided AS-30-L missile, widely used by French Jaguars during Desert Storm. Besides the AS-30-L, the FAF could draw upon the BGL, an indigenous LGB. The weapon was used during the conflicts in Bosnia and Kosovo but was withdrawn from service thereafter as it was more expensive than standard LGBs of US origin.

Throughout the second half of the Cold War, the C-160 Transall was the FAF's principal transport aircraft. The C-160 was the result of a joint Franco-German requirement statement issued in the late 1950s. It was conceived as a tactical transport aircraft in the same class as the C-130 Hercules. Yet, its performance fell short of that of the Hercules and remained constrained.

Shortfalls in the area of C4ISTAR proved to be serious during Operation Desert Storm. The lack of electronic C2 systems particularly constrained the FAF in its freedom of action.

A quantum leap was made at the outset of the post-Cold War era by the procurement of four Boeing E-3 AWACS aircraft. In a national scenario, they significantly complemented ground-based detectors. In an out-of-area scenario, they provided an unprece-dented early warning capability.

In line with its international status, France has continued to pursue a proactive defence policy in the post-Cold War era. Significant French commitments to operations in the former Yugoslavia, combined with lessons learned from participation in Desert Storm, made a major defence reform in the mid-1990s inevitable. Moreover, France's emphasis upon nuclear doctrine had to be reevaluated in the context of deployed multinational operations. The new strategic environment required a thorough reorganisation and modernisation programme of the FAF's conventional forces. The 1994 command structure reform allowed for a flexible use of all available air assets by streamlining the command echelons. Constant adaptation has allowed the FAF to contribute to all strategic core functions of French defence policy. The transition into a fully professional force occurred against the backdrop of an increased emphasis upon projection. Since French defence policy puts a premium upon national autarchy, the FAF has retained a coherent force structure covering a broad array of air power roles. Financial constraints, however, have forced the FAF to forego certain specialised roles such as a dedicated SEAD capability, and its RPA programmes have also suffered from several setbacks. In the context of the Armed Forces Model 2015, two aircraft types were given priority, the Rafale and the A400M, leading to a homogenous force structure. Despite the cancellation of various minor procurement programmes, major goals of the Model 2015 could not be achieved in time, and plans proved to be overambitious. President Sarkozy embarked upon a reform in 2008, reducing the force goal of modern combat aircraft to 300 for both the FAF and the French Navy together, 70 of which are planned to be simultaneously deployable.
In the domain of alliance policy, France's ambition has been to establish an autonomous European defence that it could actively shape and also take on a centre stage position. Since most European countries have proved reluctant to forego the American security umbrella, France had to seek the strengthening of the European defence pillar from within the NATO alliance. This paradoxically led to an increased engagement with NATO that culminated in France's 2009 return to NATO's integrated military command structure. In return, France received two of NATO's top military positions-the post of SACT and the command of Joint Command Lisbon-while retaining a degree of national autonomy, particularly in the domain of the country's nuclear deterrent. This reintegration into NATO did not mean, however, that France would no longer attach considerable importance to the European Union as a major actor in the domain of security.
Along with France's increasing participation in NATO and its lead role in the ESDP, the FAF has been shaped accordingly. As such, it is now capable of providing the nucleus of a larger multinational force. The FAF has played a significant role in the NRF air component and other major European cooperative ventures such as the EAG, the EATC, or the EU Air RRC. Through integration, the FAF is able both to overcome its shortcomings, such as the lack of a dedicated SEAD capability, and to gain leverage through the provision of key capabilities, such as C2 systems and deployable air bases that still represent critical bottlenecks in European air power. In short, integration has allowed the FAF to enhance its operational effectiveness and to raise its international silhouette.
Throughout the post-Cold War era, the FAF has stood up to the challenge of real operations across a broad range of military engagements, from humanitarian enterprises to high-intensity warfare. Apart from Operations Northern Watch, Desert Fox, and Iraqi Freedom, it has participated in all major Western air campaigns and has simultaneously been able to conduct smaller, autonomous operations in Africa. To remedy significant deficiencies in interoperability as experienced in Desert Storm, the FAF has consistently pursued a path towards operating in a combined mode and is nowadays able to swiftly integrate itself into a coalition or to take on a lead role in multinational operations. As regards the African theatre, the French armed forces retained their expertise in managing regional crisis quickly with lightly equipped, joint contingents. Airlift and firepower delivered by air have proven critical in these operations. The ability to rapidly deploy air assets over long distances and to operate them from bare bases was also critical in the deployment of French aircraft to Central Asia in early 2002, making the FAF the first European air force to engage targets in Afghanistan with fighter-bombers. The French contingent paved the way for a European F-16 component. Despite these achievements, Chirac's goal-to deploy up to 100 combat aircraft or the FAF's theoretical contribution of up to 80 combat aircraft with additional support aircraft to potential deployed EU operations-proved too ambitious given the shortfalls in strategic airlift or AAR. So far, the FAF has never deployed simultaneously more than 50 combat aircraft to a particular post-Cold War campaign, with Operation Allied Force witnessing the largest deployment. While the deployment to Manas in early 2002 can be considered an achievement in terms of rapid power projection, it nevertheless has to be pointed out that the detachment, including six Mirage 2000Ds, was far below the quantitative goals above.
Notwithstanding the FAF's increasing involvement in combined operations, only in 2008 did it issue an air power doctrine. Released the same year as Sarkozy's Defence White Paper, the hallmarks of the latter are clearly visible. Amongst others, it implicitly introduces the concept of parallel warfare, which supposedly produces strategic paralysis.
Prior to the 2008 air power doctrine, French air power thinking rather found expression in a bottom-up approach. This is particularly demonstrated by FAF officers expressing their views in Penser les ailes françaises and elsewhere. Moreover, through the establishment of two air power conference series in 2004-5, the FAF invited scholars, industrialists, and others to share their views on French air power, representing a significant step towards critical thinking.
Given that French military thinking was long overshadowed by nuclear doctrine, modern thinking on conventional air power is relatively young. While the reemerging French air power debate focused on historical issues and the idea of an independent mission-as exemplified by the keen interest in Douhet's and Warden's theories-the focus has turned to current challenges in joint warfare.
Before 2008 the FAF preferred to hinge upon implicit air power doctrine rather than to publish an official strategic air power doctrine. The highest echelons of the FAF considered formal doctrine as dogmatic and inhibiting flexible thinking. Yet, given France's aspirations to lead-nation status in European defence matters, the FAF was actually obliged to shape the European doctrinal landscape and, hence, to come up with its own formal air power doctrine.
Furthermore, although Joint Forces Defence College participants increasingly express their views in Penser les ailes françaises, the college syllabus appears to focus upon staff work rather than air power theory. They have not been exposed to an intense reading programme of various air power literature. On the positive side, the French were amongst the first to establish a joint staff college in the post-Cold War era, taking account of the integrated and complex nature of modern military operations.
Operation Desert Storm proved to be a watershed for the FAF in the field of force structuring, as it blatantly disclosed conventional shortfalls preventing France from making a contribution congruent with its political objectives. Given France's aspiration to lead-nation status in coalition warfare, French officials and defence planners realised that the FAF's conventional equipment had to be state of the art and fully interoperable with allied air forces. In this respect, the FAF has put a premium upon the introduction of NATO interoperable C2 systems and upon the buildup of key capabilities such as CSAR. Moreover, France's lead role in the development of the MIDS Link-16 terminal is fully in line with national strategic ambitions. Significant delays of major aircraft programmes, however, have considerably constrained the FAF's reform. Interim solutions have mitigated capability gaps; however, along with the growing maintenance costs of increasingly aging materiel, they have also diverted resources from major programmes. Gap-filling programmes such as the Mirage 2000-5 and the Mirage 2000D had to be kept at the lowest possible level. Pending introduction of the Rafale, the FAF had to rely upon a very lean fleet of conventional state-of-the art combat aircraft throughout the 1990s. A limited force of Mirage 2000D and Mirage 2000-5 aircraft arguably represented a subcritical conventional interim force in light of French ambitions. Yet, less sophisticated aircraft such as the Jaguar or the Mirage F1 proved indispensable through-out the 1990s in the African theatre and elsewhere. Also, given the rather permissive environment of Western air campaigns in the post-Cold War era, French Jaguars performed effectively in airto-ground precision strike missions.
In the Gaullist tradition, French defence planners continued to pursue a path of autarchy. Yet the unilateral Rafale programme has left the FAF little room for manoeuvre regarding the development of other capabilities. For instance, France had to bail out of a bilateral Franco-German SEAD armament programme. In the medium term, however, the combination of a versatile platform combined with sophisticated sensors and France's latest air-toground weapon, the AASM, is expected to make a dedicated SEAD capability no longer necessary. Besides the Rafale, major national programmes have been conducted in the field of computerised C2 systems as well as air-to-air and air-to-ground armament. Only in cases where a national programme would have been excessively expensive, such as in the case of AWACS, did French defence planners buy assets of American origin. Yet an escalation in costs and advanced technologies made French decision makers shift their rhetoric from national to European autonomy. As such, major programmes such as the A400M or a future remotely piloted combat aircraft are European cooperative ventures. Yet, these politico-industrial aspirations have not allowed for short-term bargains. Capability shortfalls-especially in the area of airlift-have developed pending delivery of national or European assets. It can be concluded that politico-industrial concerns have taken precedence over operational concerns. At the same time, capability shortfalls have reinforced the FAF's thrust towards closer European cooperation.
The 1990s and the early years of the twenty-first century represented for the FAF a particularly critical period, as it had to undergo a considerable transition from a force primarily geared up for nuclear war to a force that aspired to be at the forefront of conventional air power in deployed operations. As the FAF's commitment to the NRF air component or to deployed multinational operations conveys, this transition has been successful. Given significant delays in major procurement programmes, however, many of the FAF capabilities currently being introduced are overdue. 
On 6 May 1955, the Federal Republic of Germany was declared sovereign. Within two days, the ban on military forces was lifted, and Germany became a member of NATO. Since the country had missed a decade of vital experience in military aviation, the German Air Force had to be built up from scratch. At the beginning, the GAF hinged upon support from its allies, principally the United States, for training and equipment.

This section first analyses German post-Cold War defence policy and the GAF's response to it. It then analyses Germany's alliance context and its influence on the GAF.
Throughout the 1990s, German defence policy was basically articulated by two key documents, the 1992 Defence Policy Guidelines and the 1994 Defence White Book. The period was characterised by the adherence to two traditional principles: territorial defence and universal conscription. Yet, Germany's allies would have expected it to contribute to peace and stability in accordance with its political and economic weight.
In 1999 the newly elected left-wing government initiated a military reform.

Threat and Risk Perception. The 1992 Defence Policy Guidelines, published on 26 November, identified recent changes on the European continent as irreversible. The reunification of Germany, the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact, and the democratisation in Eastern Europe laid a solid basis for a process of which Germany was the main beneficiary. The country was no longer in the direct vicinity of an opposing military alliance but surrounded by allies and partners. The guidelines argued that, for the foreseeable future, Russia had neither the rationale nor the economic and military potential to wage a large-scale offensive against NATO. Provided there was the capacity for a flexible reconstitution of Western armed forces, a full-scale invasion was not conceivable without at least one year of warning time. While Central Europe could benefit from immense improvements, internal conflicts and collapsing states as well as the proliferation of WMDs at the European periphery were perceived to be serious challenges. The increased inter-dependence in the international system meant that any form of destabilization-military or non-military-was considered to have the potential of producing ripple effects that affected the West.

While Towards Expeditionary Warfare and Deployable Armed Forces. Germany's reunification, later reviewed in more detail, was preceded by the so-called 2 plus 4 negotiations, which included East and West Germany, the United States, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and France. The resulting 2 plus 4 Treaty, paving the way for reunification, foresaw amongst others the limitation of the German armed forces to 370,000 personnel.

In terms of required resources, the integration of the remaining parts of the East German Air Force cannot be accurately quantified as there were many overlying factors, such as the so-called peace dividend or overall reunification costs that led to significant reductions in defence resources at the time. As a result, the acquisition of new material had to be significantly delayed or numbers reduced. 
101
Emphasis upon Air Power. According to a 1987 RAND study, the services' shares of West Germany's procurement budget had been divided according to a rather rigid split of 50:30:20 for the Army, Air Force, and Navy, respectively.

103
In the early 1990s, prior to the unification of the German armed forces, the West German Army operated 750 helicopters, including 108 heavy CH-53G transport helicopters, and a significant amount of MANPADS and air-defence guns, including over 430 self-propelled, radar-guided Gepard systems as well as 143 Roland SAM systems. German naval aviation consisted of 104 Tor-nado combat aircraft; around 40 fixed-wing aircraft for SIGINT, maritime reconnaissance, search and rescue (SAR), and liaison purposes; and 19 Sea Lynx and 22 Sea King helicopters.

Germany's postwar armed forces were not conceived as an instrument of autonomous statecraft but as forces hinging upon allied command structures. During the Cold War, German armed forces-with the exception of a few territorial Army units-could only accomplish their mission within the NATO chain of command. Air defence forces were already during peacetime assigned to the NATO commander, Allied Air Forces Central Europe.

In line with Germany's alliance policy, the GAF has remained closely integrated into supranational military structures throughout the post-Cold War era. While it has always put a premium upon integration into NATO and a close relationship with the USAF, particularly in the field of training, the GAF also became a main driver for integrating European air power. Hence, German multilateralism on a strategic level has been carried right down to the military operational level.
ESDP Context. The 2003 Defence Policy Guidelines stated that assets reported to NATO and the EU would be available to both organisations. 
123
124
As was explained earlier, the GAF, together with the FAF, was crucial in developing the EU Air RRC. Pending implementation of the EU RRAI, lead nations of a particular EU battle group were responsible for the various force enablers. For 2007, for instance, the GAF envisaged supporting the potential deployment of a German-led battle group with four Tornados for precision ground attack, four reconnaissance Tornados, two C-160 Transalls, four UH-1D helicopters for intratheatre airlift, and two A310s-one a multirole transport (MRT) and the other an MRTT-for medical evacuation and air-to-air refuelling.

In the midst of the reunification process, German decision makers found themselves confronted with the occupation of Kuwait and its broader international consequences. For constitutional reasons, and more importantly because a German military deployment to the Gulf could have provoked the Soviet Union to put German reunification on hold, military participation in the American-led coalition was ruled out. Furthermore, more than two-thirds of the population was against any military involvement. Germany's contribution to the Gulf War finally turned out to be a significant financial support.

While the verdict of the Federal Constitutional Court did not explicitly consider a UN mandate a precondition, it was commonly assumed that a UN mandate would lay the foundation of any German military intervention, as had been the case so far. Despite this new interpretation of the German constitution, the foreign and defence ministers made it clear at the time that Germany would continue to adhere to a policy of restraint and that missions outside of Europe would remain an exception.

In the post-Cold War era, airlift missions continued to be the GAF's main contributions to out-of-area operations. In the immediate aftermath of Desert Storm, the German armed forces embarked with approximately 2,000 troops upon their most comprehensive humanitarian operation thus far in the Iranian-Turkish border area.

The Federal Republic's participation in ISAF operations put one of the highest demands upon GAF airlift capacities, revealing significant shortfalls in the GAF's airlift capacities. Ukrainian and Russian transport aircraft had to be chartered in the initial phase (as described in the section on air mobility). Nevertheless, the GAF finally managed to establish an air bridge to Kabul in early 2002. It ran from Cologne through Termez Airport in Uzbekistan to Kabul. Whereas for the first leg Airbus A310s were used, the second leg was served by C-160 Transall aircraft, which were equipped with self-protection suites. At Termez Airport in Uzbekistan, a German base was established that hosted up to seven C-160s, one of them configured as a medevac aircraft. This route became an important lifeline not only for the German but also for the entire ISAF contingent. Furthermore, from February 2003 till June 2004, the GAF was responsible for the running of Kabul Inter national Airport. What originally was supposed to be a sixmonth assignment ended as a 15-month assignment, as no other nation was prepared to take on the succession.

Since 19 November 1990, with the reestablishment of full German sovereignty, GAF fighter aircraft and tactical air control units have been assigned with air policing, requiring constantly available resources. To draw upon NATO's C2 network and sensors, air policing has been conducted in the framework of the alliance's integrated air defence. Engagement of hostile aerial vehicles, however, requires consent from German authorities.

On behalf of NATO, the GAF has also regularly contributed to air policing over the Baltic. For this particular purpose, German F-4F Phantoms were for the first time dispatched to Latvia from 30 June to 30 September 2005. Since Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia do not have adequate aircraft for this type of mission at their disposal, other NATO nations alternately provide a detachment of four fighter aircraft for a period of approximately three months.

Thinking and Doctrine?
During the second half of the Cold War, German airmen were particularly concerned with the GAF's role within the Western Alliance and especially with the strategy of flexible response. With the end of the Cold War, there was no longer a need to ponder these issues. Instead, German air power thinking had to be directed towards the new challenges of the post-Cold War era. Particularly, the recent defence reforms have given German air power thinking a new impetus.
The establishment of the Air Power Centre (Luftmachtzentrum or LMZ) represents the GAF's most significant step in tackling conceptual and doctrinal aspects in the post-Cold War era. The centre itself is a product of the adoption of Air Force Structure 6. 
225
226
During the Cold War, the GAF did not have national basic air power doctrine manuals. According to a RAND study of 1986, such documents were believed to violate the "spirit and purpose" of the GAF's integration into NATO.

The Führungsakademie (FüAk), their Armed Forces Command and Staff College, in Hamburg is the highest military educational institution of the German armed forces. Its main responsibility is the training and education of German staff officers. In the wake of the reconstitution of the West German armed forces, the FüAk was inaugurated in 1957.

The overall rather operational and technical approach to air power is also reflected in the general staff course dissertations and in other course writings. In 2005-6, dissertation topics ranged from European missile defence and intelligence gathering in the theatre of operations to multinational logistics in out-of-area operations and military use of the national airspace. Against this backdrop, topics such as effects-based operations or the challenges of modern conflicts are rather rare.

Since the mid-1980s, the FüAk has hosted annual air power seminars. The circle of participants, including the chief of the Air Staff, has been restricted to a small number of GAF officers and officers from other service branches. Topics ranged from doctrinal issues such as air attack, through the consequences of the Helsinki Headline Goals for the GAF, to logistical support for out-of-area operations.

Almost in the same vein as the old yearbook, the GAF has had an annual journal published since 2002, the so-called CPM Forum. The publication appears alternately in English and German and basically provides a comprehensive survey of the adoption of new Air Force structures as well as the GAF's new capabilities profile. But more doctrinal issues have also been dealt with recently, such as the GAF's perspective upon network-centric operations.

With the end of the Cold War and against the backdrop of Air Force Structure 4, entire aircraft systems were phased out in order to reduce costs. While the light ground-attack aircraft Alpha Jet as well as the reconnaissance aircraft RF-4E Phantom were decommissioned, the fighter aircraft F-4F Phantom and the Tornado were kept in service.

In the field of air-to-ground armament, the GAF started to implement the lessons of modern warfare relatively late. Throughout the 1990s, the GAF retained the submunitions dispenser system MW-1, designed for low-level attacks against area targets, as the main armament of its Tornado IDS fleet.

Throughout the 1990s, the only aircraft in the GAF's inventory to be used in the air-to-air refuelling role was the Tornado by means of a buddy-buddy refuelling suite. The air-refuelling capacity was, however, very limited. Hence, employment of Tornados as tanker aircraft has been primarily relegated to training, which has been essential for German participation in combined air operations. 
323
324
325
A further specialised element of air mobility is medevac, which has become one of the GAF's specialities. Since 1994 the GAF has continuously built up its medevac capability, starting with a medevac installation kit for its C-160 Transall aircraft and ending with two dedicated A310 MRT medevac Airbuses. On an international level, this capability is state of the art. 
326
In the field of C4ISTAR, the GAF has been particularly able to benefit from multilateral cooperation. In the later stages of the Cold War, the GAF became one of the most prominent contributors to NATO's Airborne Early Warning and Control Force, based on German territory. Germany has shouldered a third of the programme, and the country is also likely to bear a significant share of the NATO Alliance Ground Surveillance Core project.

343
The 2003 Defence Policy Guidelines explicitly underlines the importance of EAD in general and TBMD in particular. It emphasises the protection of deployed forces against rockets and missiles. 
344
In the medium term, the acquisition of 12 Medium Extended Air Defence System (MEADS) units was planned. Yet the necessity of this highly mobile system, configured for the PAC-3 missile and a surface-launched version of the IRIS-T, was being reassessed in the first half of 2010, particularly against the backdrop of depleted public budgets in general and of delays and cost increases to the trinational US-German-Italian project. 345
In the post-Cold War era, the GAF has evolved from a force primarily geared up to forward defence in NATO's central region and restrained by Germany's particular historical legacy to a force that is preparing itself to commensurately take on its share in the international arena.
At the outset of the post-Cold War era, German reunification required the GAF to swiftly take on the responsibility for air policing across the entire reunified territory, a task that had so far been accomplished by the USAF and RAF in Western Germany. Moreover, integration of former East German Air Force personnel presented a particular challenge that was successfully met. For the remainder of the 1990s, however, German decision makers only reluctantly transformed the German  In line with the realignment of Germany's defence policy and due to financial constraints, the GAF has undergone a continuous force transformation and significant force reductions. For instance, flying wings were reduced from 18 to seven and might drop even lower. Yet at the same time, new capabilities and assets have been or are planned to be acquired such as an autonomous air operations planning capacity, HALE and MALE RPA systems, a precision strike capability, strategic air mobility, AAR, deployable air command and control units, or a TBMD capability. With regard to intertheatre airlift, the GAF is about to emerge as an important European player, as Germany placed a significant order for A400M transport aircraft. Moreover, it has retained specific niche capabilities such as SEAD, which provide leverage against the backdrop of alliance operations, as was the case in the course of Operation Allied Force. The GAF released slightly less than a third of all HARM missiles employed.
In the field of alliance policy, it has always been a core interest of German policy to balance American and European-primarily French-interests. Consistent with this policy, the GAF has played a bridging function between the FAF and the American armed forces, be it through training establishments in the United States or through ventures such as setting up the European Air Transport Command with France. Germany's deep embedding into alliance structures also required the GAF to make meaningful contributions to cooperative ventures in the field of rapid force deployments such as the NRF or the EU Air RRC. Yet, these will require a further balancing between the shaft and the spear. Moreover, from a political point of view, a dilemma between Germany's strong emphasis upon the transatlantic partnership as the bedrock for German security and the country's reluctance to employ military force across the spectrum of military force, a prerequisite when closely operating with American forces, is likely to persist. It is to be seen whether the GAF's new operational potential will be translated into effective operational output.
In line with Germany's alliance policy, defence programmes cannot solely be judged in terms of value for money. From a German point of view, a multilateral defence programme is not only a means to an end but also an end in itself, as it deepens alliance cohesion as well as European relations. Consistently, Germany has taken a leading role in European and transatlantic defence programmes such as the NAEW&CF, the A400M, or the Eurofighter. All current major defence programmes of the GAF are multilateral. As such, they decisively shape Europe's defence landscape and further European integration as well as transatlantic cohesion. Given the requirements of deployed operations and the allies' expectation for increased German responsibility in international security matters, the GAF has gradually evolved into an increasingly balanced air force. Yet, it has to be underlined that the acquisition of a precision strike capability or AAR certainly represents an improvement, albeit from a very low starting point, and brings the GAF finally to a reach and strike standard that has, with the exception of air-launched cruise missiles, long been held by the RAF or the FAF. The GAF's AAR capacity still falls short of British or French capacity levels. This shortfall is compounded by the German armed forces' general shortcomings in the area of logistics, as is highlighted by Germany's NRF contributions. Due to logistics bottlenecks, the Army and Air Force can only make major contributions consecutively. Given these logistics and AAR shortcomings, theoretical plans to contribute up to 80 combat aircraft for potential EU operations appear too ambitious. Moreover, the GAF lacks the experience of deploying large numbers of combat aircraft to distant theatres. For Operation Allied Force, for instance, the GAF made available only 14 Tornados which could operate from well-prepared NATO air bases in Italy. Yet, a significant step in the GAF's power projection capability can be expected with the introduction of the A400M transport aircraft.
Germany and the GAF reacted to the offensive air power doctrine as demonstrated in Desert Storm with uneasiness. Only gradually did the GAF become involved in deployed operations.
Though it has-due to political and constitutional restraintscontributed in a limited way to Western air campaigns, the GAF nevertheless proved to be a professional force that can seamlessly plug into highly complex air operations. In this regard, GAF participation in major integrated air exercises such as Red Flag or Maple Flag proved pivotal and made up for lack of experience. While the GAF has been gradually geared up for expeditionary warfare, operations at the upper level of the spectrum of force are likely to remain an exception. A clear-cut humanitarian purpose will certainly remain a crucial prerequisite. Nevertheless, with the earmarking of combat aircraft to the NRF and to German-led EU battle groups, missions across the spectrum of force might become a reality at any time. Reluctance to contribute to offensive missions, however, did not imply that the GAF was not ready to expose its personnel to increased levels of risk, as was revealed by Germany's contribution to airlift operations in Bosnia.
Germany's unease about deployed offensive operations might have led to a lack of top-down support for doctrine development and might have caused a gap in doctrinal thought throughout the 1990s. Only Struck's reform of 2002-3 helped to put an end to doctrinal stagnation. Against the backdrop of Air Force Structure 6, the Air Power Centre was established in order to grasp the latest developments doctrinally. In the same vein, the revision of the Air Force Service Instruction LDv 100/1, a basic air power doctrine document, was ordered in late 2005. Yet, air power thinking is still cultivated in a very top-down manner. For the top echelons of the GAF, there is an annual air power seminar series. However, forums for broader audiences to further a genuine air power debate to shape the Air Force's future-conferences or a specific air power journal-do not yet exist. This top-down manner is also reflected by the fact that the revised LDv 100/1, published in April 2009, is not available to the wider public. In the specific German case, air power thinking is moreover inhibited by the country's historical legacy. Historical aspects with regard to both military education and air power doctrine are hardly dealt with. Officers attending the staff college in Hamburg acquire intensive training in staff work for combined air operations. Yet, they are not systematically exposed to air power theory and history. On the positive side, a joint approach to teaching has been adopted, reflecting the integrated nature of deployed operations. Notes 1. Thompson, Political and Military Components, 200-202.  2.

This section first analyses the Netherlands' post-Cold War defence policy and its influence on the RNLAF's evolution. The Netherlands' alliance policies are described next, along with a view towards how they have affected its Air Force.
Between 1990 and 2003, four major defence reports were published-the Defence White Paper 1991, the Defence Priorities Review 1993, the Defence White Paper 2000, and the Prinsjesdag Letter 2003. The Netherlands' proactive defence policy exerted far-reaching impulses for Dutch air power and put the RNLAF relatively swiftly on an expeditionary footing. As such, the flexible and responsive Dutch defence policy turned the RNLAF into a relevant foreign policy tool.
Threat and Risk Perception. The Netherlands' defence posture has been closely related to its threat and risk perception, as military reforms followed the most recent security assessments. The Defence White Paper 1991 clearly recognised that European security had markedly improved and emphasised crises and armed conflicts outside Europe. While the Soviet Union was still considered a major military power, a strategic surprise attack was ruled out as a contingency. Nevertheless, the white paper suggested that NATO ought to maintain an equal and balanced military capability to meet that of the Soviet Union.

While the Defence White Paper 1991 announced a reduction in the RNLAF's F-16 fleet, a need for improved mobility and flexibility called for an enhanced air transport capability against the backdrop of a more active UN peacekeeping role outside the NATO treaty area. Particularly through the acquisition of tanker/ transport aircraft, it was intended to establish a strategic airlift capacity.

In the 1990s, the RNLAF developed from a static air force geared up for the defence of Central Europe into an expeditionary air force deployable across the entire spectrum of military operations. While certain specialised capabilities such as dedicated SEAD assets or CSAR have not yet been acquired, the RNLAF has been transformed into a more balanced air force. Balance was achieved through a shift in resource allocation from the combat aircraft fleet and GBAD units to the buildup of the THG as well as to the acquisition of C-130 Hercules and modified DC-10 aircraft. In this transformational process, role specialisation was to be avoided. Accordingly, the Prinsjesdag Letter of 2003 stated, "The Netherlands armed forces concentrate on a limited number of advanced capabilities, without following a path of excessive role specialisation and without unduly limiting the choice of deployment options. "

The Army received by far the largest part of the annual defence budget, though a slight trend towards increased spending on the sister services became visible. This imbalanced funding has its roots in the Cold War. In an effort to stifle interservice feuds, the Netherlands introduced a division of the defence budget accord-0 10 20 30 40   50   1989 1990 1991 1992 1993 1994 1995 1996 1997 1998 1999 2000   ing to the 1:2:1 formula, allocating half of the budget to the Army and approximately a quarter each to the other services.

In 1985 the Dutch scholar Jan Siccama observed that "the failure of neutrality in 1940 enhanced the tendency towards alignment after World War II in the same way as the success of neutrality in 1914 had fostered the continuation of that policy during the interbellum period. "

Encouraged by NATO initiatives such as the CJTF concept of 1994, the RNLAF has been at the forefront of European cooperative ventures, which it has considered as important force multipliers against the backdrop of constrained national defence resources.
ESDP and NATO Context. In the 2003 Prinsjesdag Letter, Dutch decision makers expressed their intention to reduce the Netherlands' contribution to out-of-area operations in the framework of NATO or the ESDP from three to two squadrons, each with 18 fighter aircraft.

Prior to the establishment of the DATF, the RNLAF together with the Belgian, Danish, and the Norwegian Air Forces set up the European Participating Air Forces (EPAF). EPAF members were all F-16 customers, and the concept was originally conceived for procurement purposes to pool national requirements and to gain bargaining leverage (an issue that is discussed in the section on procurement). The EPAF particularly laid out the common requirement for the MLU of the European F-16 Block 15 A/B. 
65
The combined EPAF deployment proved to be quite effective despite some legal and procedural obstacles. To further improve cooperation between the European F-16 users, Gen D. L. Berlijn, the RNLAF commander in chief, took the initiative to approach his Belgian, Danish, Norwegian, and Polish counterparts to ask for their views upon a possible expansion of the DATF concept, finally resulting in the EPAF EAW. The participating air forces intend to make optimum use of available and complementary assets in out-of-area operations to increase efficiency. For example, during the operations over Afghanistan, the Netherlands and Denmark provided targeting pods free of charge for common use, while Norway provided a hangar and a deployable communication module.

While the EPAF EAW is a form of enhanced cooperation and pooling, it does not extend to role specialisation, which is seen to curtail deployment options. This thrust is completely in line with Dutch decision makers' ideas about military cooperative arrangements. While the government views cooperation as a prerequisite for smaller countries to retain relevant armed forces, it considers a certain degree of autonomy essential to remain functional. 
70

In addition to these cooperative ventures, the RNLAF became a full member of the EAG on 12 July 1999 to further shape European standardisation and interoperability.

In the post-Cold War era, the Netherlands has been using its armed forces as an instrument for intervention abroad. Nowadays, the Netherlands armed forces are almost exclusively geared towards expeditionary warfare.

85
As early as 1991, the Dutch government was willing to commit F-16 fighter aircraft to combat missions. During the 1990-91 Gulf crisis, the Netherlands was actively seeking participation in the coalition against Saddam Hussein. Due to the concentration of extremely large numbers of aircraft in the Gulf region, though, all hosting options for Dutch F-16s turned out to be exhausted.

While the RNLAF could not immediately contribute to Desert Storm, it did so indirectly. After Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990, NATO decided to send Patriot units to Turkey for protection against Iraqi SCUD missiles. Two Dutch Patriot missile batteries were sent to Diyarbakir in eastern Turkey. This deployment was soon to be reinforced with two more Hawk missile squadrons and Stinger units. The RNLAF also deployed a Patriot missile battery to Israel.

For Operation Allied Force, a total of 20 Dutch F-16s and two KDC-10 tanker aircraft were made available to NATO. Transport aircraft were flying almost round the clock carrying the right type of munitions on schedule to Amendola Air Base in southern Italy, from where the Dutch F-16s were operating. Through these efforts, a high operational tempo could be achieved and an average degree of readiness of over 95 per cent could be sustained. Throughout Allied Force, Dutch F-16s flew approximately 700 airto-air, 450 air-to-ground, and 50 reconnaissance and battle dam-age assessment sorties over the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The RNLAF delivered more than 850 air-to-ground weapons, including 246 LGBs and 32 Maverick missiles. Given these figures, the RNLAF played a substantial role in Allied Force and provided, according to Dutch sources, approximately 7.5 per cent of the offensive NATO sorties.

The massacre of Srebrenica in 1995, where Dutch peacekeepers could not prevent genocide among the Muslim population, taught a crucial lesson to Dutch decision makers. In 2000 a Netherlands Marine unit together with four heavy Chinook transport helicopters was deployed to the Horn of Africa to support a UN mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea. This time, the Dutch parliament requested that a detachment of four Apaches be stationed in nearby Djibouti, providing the Marine unit with escalation dominance and guaranteeing a secure retreat if necessary.

The RNLAF has also played a role in humanitarian relief and crisis management operations throughout the 1990s and beyond. Though very modest at the outset of the post-Cold War era, RNLAF airlift capacities have grown over the years from small transport planes such as the Fokker F-27s to larger aircraft such as the C-130 Hercules and the KDC-10 strategic airlift and air-to-air refuelling aircraft.
After the collapse of the Berlin Wall and in the wake of Desert Storm, humanitarian relief missions targeted Eastern Europe and the Middle East. With the advent of the first C-130 Hercules, the RNLAF was able to shift its attention to hot spots in Africa and elsewhere. The genocide in Rwanda triggered a considerable number of Dutch C-130 airlift sorties.

In the context of NATO's integrated air defence, the RNLAF permanently maintains a two-ship of F-16 aircraft on QRA. After 11 September, aircraft on high readiness were increased from two to six for approximately one month. In the aftermath, Dutch QRA aircraft became-alongside NATO duties-also available for national air policing tasks.

Air Power Thinking and Doctrine?
The RNLAF's close relationship with the USAF and its early involvement in real operations facilitated sound approaches to deal with the intellectual challenges of the post-Cold War era.
In the latter half of the Cold War, experiences acquired during integrated NATO exercises as well as NATO doctrine laid the foundation for the RNLAF's approach to air power. As thinking was dominated by NATO doctrine, RNLAF officers rarely took the initiative to promulgate a national air power doctrine.

In 2005 the joint defence staff published a national defence doctrine. In his foreword, Gen D. L. Berlijn, chief of the defence staff, underlines that the Netherlands Defence Doctrine (NDD) filled the gap between the single-service doctrines and Dutch defence policy. 
144
145
146
Since the RNLAF is fully aware of its limited size, one of its goals is interoperability with the larger air forces not only in terms of hardware and software but also in terms of doctrine. In the mid-1990s, RNLAF officers were already stressing the value of international cooperation in air power doctrine. At a Dutch air power colloquium in 1997, an air commodore raised the idea of establishing a European air warfare centre, bringing together multi national expertise for developing doctrine, conducting education and training, and planning and organising multinational operations. 
147
In 1992 the Netherlands armed forces collocated the singleservice advanced staff courses and established the Netherlands Defence College (NDC), underlining the thrust towards joint education. A limited number of midcareer officers are selected to attend the year-long advanced staff course. It originally consisted of several modules, including one on air power and strategy.

Though the RNLAF had already organised air power symposia during the days of the Cold War, it was particularly in the aftermath of major air operations over Bosnia that the RNLAF began to organise air power symposia. 
159
Symposia and colloquia were specifically designed to benefit doctrine development not only within the RNLAF but also beyond by discussing the challenges of joint operations. 
160
161
In the aftermath of Allied Force, the topic of coercion was especially emphasised to reflect NATO's air campaign. From 6 to 8 June 2000, for instance, the NDC organised a three-day colloquium. Besides Dutch speakers, scholars from the United States such as Benjamin Lambeth, Karl Mueller, and Hammond were invited. 
162
163
In terms of publications on air power doctrine and theory, the RNLAF has remained rather passive. Yet, it is interesting to point out that a former air power studies lecturer at the NDC wrote his thesis on John Boyd's theories and published it as a book. 164
The Netherlands has a modest defence industrial base. Apart from naval systems and some Army vehicles, the Netherlands does not have the capacity to produce complete main weapon systems such as major battle tanks or fighter aircraft.

Along with Belgium, Denmark, and Norway, the Netherlands was one of the four initial European customers for the F-16 combat aircraft. Dutch F-16s were assembled at Fokker, and the first delivery to the RNLAF was in June 1979. Overall, the Netherlands procured 213 aircraft. As examined above, this number had to be considerably reduced in the post-Cold War era, and by 2003, all remaining operational F-16A/Bs had undergone an MLU programme.

With the experience gained over the Balkans, the armament of the F-16 aircraft had to be constantly adapted to the latest demands. In the wake of Deliberate Force, it was decided to acquire a precision ground-attack capability by the procurement of AGM-65G Maverick air-to-ground missiles.

These transport helicopters were to be augmented with combat helicopters. In November 1996, the RNLAF received 12 AH-64A Apaches on lease from the US Army. They would be operated until the delivery of 30 AH-64D Apaches had been completed. The leasing of US Army AH-64As allowed Dutch crews and mechanics to familiarise themselves with the system. Together with the Chinooks and Cougars, the Apaches form the RNLAF THG.

Multinational cooperation in the domain of C4ISTAR is fully in line with the Netherlands' defence and alliance policy. Being closely integrated into NATO and the emerging ESDP, the Netherlands can benefit from international cooperation and thereby overcome the limits imposed by the size of its GDP. It is for exactly this reason that the Netherlands became a member of NATO's Airborne Early Warning and Control Force in the early 1980s.

For GBAD, including TBMD, the RNLAF has also focused upon quality and deployability. Systems no longer considered of immediate relevance in the current threat environment have been decommissioned to free resources for state-of-the art equipment. Accordingly, the RNLAF's radar-guided anti-aircraft artillery for point defence of air bases was phased out in 2000.

The Netherlands' changing security assessment, the redefinition of the tasks of the armed forces, and the shift away from territorial defence to expeditionary warfare have brought with them far-reaching impacts upon air power. Despite reducing its fighter aircraft fleet in response to its defence policy, the Netherlands has an enhanced ability to project power beyond NATO's boundaries.
In parallel, the RNLAF has embarked upon a number of cooperative ventures. In fact, they represent a response to the Air Force's limited size and shrinking resources. Dutch decision makers believe that air forces of a limited size without far-reaching cooperation would not remain relevant on the international stage. The establishment of the European Participating Air Forces' Expeditionary Air Wing is so far the most significant Dutch-led cooperative effort. Nowadays, the RNLAF has well-established links to the USAF. Simultaneously, it is well anchored in the emerging European defence architecture. This provides Dutch politicians with a broad array of political choices and deployment options. Therefore, it can be concluded that the RNLAF has grasped the uncertainties created by shifting defence and alliance policies as a chance to benefit from international synergies. Cooperation has not yet led to role specialisation, as this has been seen as unduly limiting deployment options. Nevertheless, certain capabilities have been kept at a minimum level, such as intertheatre airlift. Given its limited number of C-130 transport aircraft, the Netherlands hinges upon international cooperation, which could be seen as limited role specialisation.
Due to far-reaching transformation in the early post-Cold War era and its proactive stance in the field of multinational cooperation, the RNLAF has been able to punch above its weight. With its below average NATO defence budget, this is a remarkable achievement. However, the Netherlands' limited intertheatre airlift capacity might constrain its planned goal of deploying 36 F-16 combat aircraft in the context of NATO or EU operations. While the RNLAF proved capable of dispatching and sustaining up to 20 combat aircraft over a prolonged period for air operations over the Balkans, more distant theatres involving operations from bare bases might turn out to be too challenging. The RNLAF operated only contingents no larger than 10 combat aircraft in Central Asia. In this regard, an imbalance in the RNLAF's force structuring can be pointed out. While a number of advanced combat helicopters were purchased in the 1990s, the procurement of intertheatre air mobility was not given equal priority. The Prinsjesdag Letter addresses this imbalance by proposing a reduction of operational combat helicopters. In parallel, the RNLAF transport fleet gained two C-130 Hercules as well as one modified DC-10 aircraft by 2007. However, this imbalance could only be mitigated through these measures.
On an operational level, cooperation has fostered mutual trust. In the post-Cold War era, the RNLAF has gained a reputation of being a reliable partner, even in dangerous situations. The lessons of the "near deployment" to the Gulf area in 1990-91 were swiftly implemented, and the new emphasis on crisis intervention in the early 1990s led to a substantial Dutch contribution to the air campaigns over the former Yugoslavia. In the wake of the terrorist attacks in 2001, the RNLAF actively took on its share in the fight against terrorism. It provided the weapon of choice in operations at the upper end of the spectrum of military force and has made Dutch alliance solidarity visible. In the post-Cold War era, all of the RNLAF's major weapon systems have been deployed to outof-area operations. The Dutch contributed to the air campaigns over the Balkans in terms of not only quantity but also quality. Dutch aircrews were prepared to execute dangerous frontline missions. RNLAF AH-64 combat helicopters and Patriot missile units provided sought after capabilities to deployed multinational operations. Due to its flexibility, the Dutch transport/tanker fleet has also shown an outstanding performance. Despite a below average budget, the RNLAF has proved to be a member of the A-team, partly explained by its can-do mentality. Even in cases where Dutch equipment did not meet the latest Western standards, the RNLAF achieved respectable results by making the best of the available means. For instance, devoid of an air-to-ground precision strike capability, Dutch F-16s released unguided air-toground weapons with great accuracy against ground targets during NATO's air operations over Bosnia.
In the final years of the Cold War, bottom-up attempts were already being undertaken to enhance education in air power theory and history. Some RNLAF officers understood that air power had to be mastered not only in technical terms but also in terms of theoretical and intellectual developments. This bottom-up approach was backed by the upper echelons of the RNLAF leadership and finally led to an institutionalised relationship with SAASS at Maxwell. It ensured that there has been a corps of educated Dutch officers throughout the post-Cold War era. This educational relationship has particularly been in line with RNLAF policy of putting a high premium upon interoperability with the USAF. Moreover, the RNLAF's participation in air operations over Bosnia led to the first formal strategic air power doctrine in the mid-1990s and to air power symposia conveying the close interrelationship between operations and air power precepts. These seminars can be considered an integral, though implicit, part of the RNLAF's lessons learned process. The RNLAF senior command has been receptive to sound education, perceiving it as one of the fundamentals for operational performance.
Since the Netherlands does not have the capacity to produce complete main weapon systems nationally, the RNLAF has procured its major weapon platforms from abroad, primarily from the United States. Buying American is in line with the Netherlands' transatlantic orientation, and it reflects the RNLAF's combat experience in air campaigns with the USAF being the lead air force. While this approach makes the Netherlands dependent upon foreign suppliers, the RNLAF's procurement policy can be directed more by combat experience than by politico-industrial aspects. Undoubtedly, this approach has benefited from shortterm bargains-such as the procurement of secondhand Chinook transport helicopters from Canada-and has enhanced the RNLAF's combat effectiveness at relatively low costs. Yet, it does not contribute to the overarching goal of a capable European defence industrial base. Another factor contributing to the RNLAF's outstanding performance has been the reduction of certain key assets. The numbers of available F-16 aircraft, Patriot batteries, and Apache combat helicopters have been deliberately kept low or reduced to improve deployability of the available systems. Moreover, certain systems were completely phased out. Amongst the major GBAD systems from the Cold War era, only the Patriot has remained in service; this system also has a TBMD capability and is thus particularly suited for the current threat spectrum. Through this constant focus upon the requirements of deployed operations, the RNLAF has effectively played in the league of the major European air forces. Chapter 6
In June 1925, the separate Army and Navy air corps were unified in an independent air force, the then Royal Swedish Air Force.

This section first analyses Swedish post-Cold War defence policy and the SwAF's response to it. It then analyses Sweden's alliance context and its influence on the SwAF.
Sweden's changing defence posture in the post-Cold War era is closely related to its threat and risk perception. Over the centuries, Russia was the dominant factor in the Swedish strategic calculus. It took Sweden almost a decade to adapt to the post-Cold War realities, and the Nordic state finally shifted away from a predominantly Russia-centric view to an international one, which resulted in a significant impact upon its Air Force. 
18
Threat and Risk Perception. During the Cold War, Soviet-Swedish relations reached periods of considerable tension. As described later, Soviet fighters shot down at least one Swedish aircraft over the Baltic Sea in 1952, and in the early 1980s, Soviet submarines intruded into Swedish waters.
In 1990 Swedish authorities urged caution in the Swedish response to the events unfolding in Eastern Europe. They were indeed very suspicious of the permanence of the developments in the Soviet Union. A setback in Soviet reforms by communist hardliners was still regarded as a possibility.

The positive security assessment within Sweden's neighbourhood stood in stark contrast to other regions of the world. Swedish Government Bill 2004/05:5, Our Future Defence, underlines the concerns about stability in the wider world. Regional conflicts were not believed to be restricted to a single country or region; instead, they could produce ripple effects. Leni Björklund, minister of defence at the time, concluded that by participating in international operations for peace and security, Sweden would enhance its own security. 
28
However, the 2008 Russian military intervention in Georgia was received by Swedish decision makers with a certain degree of concern and gave new impetus to the importance of a capability to counter limited but rapidly occurring military crises. In 2009 a new government bill, A Functional Defence, was issued to meet these concerns. While it argued that both NATO and the EU exerted a stabilising influence upon the Baltic region and that the threat of invasion from a previous superpower had disappeared, the risk of military incidents either on or around the Baltic Sea could not be discounted. 
29
30
Only the 1999-2000 government defence bill brought about a significant shift towards out-of-area operations. Broad participation in European defence cooperation and contributions to crisis management were henceforth regarded as essential means to safeguard Sweden's own security, reflecting the 1999 turning point in Swedish defence policy.

Only since 1999 have Swedish international ambitions intensified significantly. Regarding European security, two major events Courtesy Swedish Air Force Swedish C-130 Hercules in Afghanistan took place during this year, serving as catalysts for Sweden's defence transformation. First, the Kosovo campaign showed the inadequacies of European defence postures. Second, at the European Council in Cologne in June 1999, EU member states asserted the need for the EU to become a strategic actor. In line with these developments, the 1999-2000 government defence bill stated that the defence organisation was to be restructured for both national and international missions. Particular reference was made to the conflict in Kosovo by concluding that Sweden's ability to participate in an international operation rapidly and with interoperable equipment was to be improved.

Only in 2009 was the abolishment or temporary annulment of compulsory conscription seriously considered. As an alternative, the Ministry of Defence proposed voluntary military service.

Finally, on 19 May 2010, the Swedish Parliament formally suspended compulsory military service. On 1 July 2010, the Ministry of Defence initiated the transition to a 100 per cent professional and contract force.

During the Cold War, the Swedish armed forces were structured in a way that would have allowed them to conduct a defence in depth. The SwAF attack aircraft fleet, like the Swedish submarine force, was intended to attack invading forces far out in the Baltic Sea. Moreover, the coastal defences would have been supported by maritime strikes, and the limited ground attack capacity-primarily in the air interdiction role-would have been concentrated in northern Sweden.

With Sweden's increasing thrust towards international operations across the spectrum of military force, interoperability became a specifically important issue and had a far-reaching impact upon the SwAF's force inventory. Only Gripen squadrons equipped with the NATO interoperable JAS 39C/D version have been considered operational from 2005 on. The remaining squadrons, purely equipped with the JAS 39A/B version, lost operational squadron status and were either disbanded or have been used for conversion training and tactical evaluation. Accordingly, the number of operational Gripen squadrons was reduced from seven in 2004 to three in 2005 and increased to four again in 2006, with more JAS 39C/Ds delivered.

Yet against the backdrop of a reasserting Russia, the 2009 government bill, A Functional Defence, declared that "the air force must primarily develop the capability to operate in our region. It should also be able to participate in air operations together with other countries, in Sweden and within and outside our region. "

Prior to the dissolution of the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, Swedish neutrality policy was defined as military nonalignment in peace, implying neutrality in war. In early 1992, Swedish neutrality in war was no longer deemed an imperative. Instead, a flexible approach was adopted, whereby neutrality was regarded as one option amongst others. Henceforth, the purpose of being non-aligned has been to enable Sweden to remain neutral in the event of a conflict in its vicinity, should Sweden wish to do so.

Sweden joined the EU in 1995 and embraced the 1999 Cologne Declaration stating that the EU should acquire the necessary civilian and military capacities to engage in crisis management operations. Due to its policy of non-alignment, Sweden did not endorse an EU solidarity clause, calling for collective defence.

Sweden's alliance policy has indeed influenced the SwAF. Nowadays, it can be regarded as one of the most important factors dominating force transformation. With Sweden's commitment to PfP and especially the ESDP, Swedish combat aircraft have been made available for international operations since the turn of the century. Furthermore, the SwAF started to participate in and to conduct international exercises. This has enhanced interoperability with other air forces on a tactical level. Sweden's alliance policy and increased commitment to out-of-area operations have also had direct repercussions upon the SwAF at the technical level.
ESDP and PfP Context. In 2001 Minister of Defence Björn von Sydow stated that the internationalisation process permeated the Air Force organisation as a whole, from doctrine, training, exercises, staff procedures, procurement, and language training to the air base and C2 structure.

Cooperation on an Operational Level. During the Cold War, it was very unusual for the SwAF to participate in international exercises, and the mindset of SwAF officers was almost exclusively geared up for national defence scenarios. In this regard, the post-Cold War era brought about a significant shift. To facilitate the SwAF's thrust towards increased interoperability, English became the language of tactical aircraft-to-aircraft communication. Furthermore, PfP provided a platform for participation in multinational exercises.

The SwAF has continued to patrol the Swedish airspace and the Baltic Sea in the post-Cold war era. Swedish combat aircraft have remained ready to scramble in case of an emergency. While the number of military flights over the Baltic Sea has considerably decreased, 11 September underlined the importance of aerial readiness.

In the early 1990s, 13 SF 37 reconnaissance Viggens were upgraded to the AJSF 37 standard.
Despite the rather relaxed situation, missions over the Baltic Sea were not without risk in the 1990s. At the end of the Cold War, the Soviets lost a fighter aircraft following a Swedish reconnaissance Viggen, and on 16 October 1996, the SwAF lost a fighter aircraft between the island of Gotland and Latvia. Executing a low-level pass for identification of a Russian warship, the Viggen collided with the water surface.

Since the delivery of the first C-130 in 1965, Swedish C-130 Hercules transport planes have participated in relief operations around the world, mostly for the International Committee of the Red Cross and the UN. The first major relief operations were conducted by the SwAF transport unit at the formal request of the Red Cross in Ethiopia, when the country was struck by successive famine disasters in

Milestone steps in the evolution of air power doctrine development and military education have been closely related to the steps Sweden made towards opening up its defence policy in the late 1990s. As such, Sweden has increasingly cooperated with other countries, and its armed forces have become more interoperable (e.g., SwAF's rapid reaction units). According to a Swedish scholar, the demands of international operations required the military to rethink the Swedish approach to doctrine and education. To foster interoperability, it was considered necessary to embed Swedish military thinking into a common Western-or rather Anglo-Saxon-discourse. 150
In 1996-97, the doctrinal development process within the SwAF started as a bottom-up approach, when a mid-career officer attending the Swedish National Defence College (SNDC) wrote a draft of an air power doctrine. This draft was well received by the higher echelons, and a small study group was set up within the SwAF to elaborate on it. Yet officers in charge could only work part-time on the project, and it soon faded out. 
151
152
153
154
The doctrine team consisted of three officers working full-time and a number of other officers, researchers, and staff personnel helping out on a part-time basis. Officers returning from foreign staff colleges gave their input on an ad hoc basis. In contrast to the earlier attempts at developing a national air power doctrine, a steering committee headed by a general as well as an expert panel had taken on responsibility for the work in progress. 
155
The chapters of the 2004 air power doctrine were structured according to a genuine logic, which started out with the air environment and air power' s abilities and principles. As a further step, the single mission types were analysed. To conclude, the international dimension of air operations and an outlook for the future were presented.

161
The 2004 Air Power Doctrine was bestowed only draft status, as the decision was taken that the single service doctrine had to be harmonised with the joint doctrine that was still being developed, primarily by Army officers. To comply with the demands for harmonisation, the 2004 air power doctrine was amended without further delay, and an updated edition was published in early 2005 alongside the joint doctrine. The preliminary version of 2004 served as a basis for the revisions. 162 Despite its unofficial status, it nevertheless represented a milestone step for the SwAF.
The updating process focused primarily upon rearranging existing material. As such, the structure of the revised air power doctrine was brought completely in line with the joint doctrine. 
163
164
165
The doctrine development process within the Swedish armed forces in general and within the SwAF in particular followed the major defence reform in 1999. It can therefore be argued that Sweden's increasing engagement in international operations as well as the shift from a threat-driven defence towards a capability-based Courtesy Gripen International; photo by Katsuhiko Tokunaga Split from Gripen dual-seat cockpit defence represented the key motivations for grasping doctrinal issues. Yet, the revision of the first edition represents an institutional evolution and not an intellectual one.
A SwAF career officer undergoes three courses in which air power history and theory are taught in greater depth. The first course is the seven-month junior staff officer (JSO) programme. Next, majors attend the general staff officer programme I and II (GSO I & II) at the SNDC, each of them taking one year. The JSO and GSO programmes were established in the 1960s, though with different names. Until the late 1990s, these courses put a premium upon the study of tactics and staff work. While the courses were almost exclusively intraservice, GSO II allocated brief interludes for joint training and education.

Sweden's security political reform had an impact not only upon joint education but also upon international cooperation. In the late 1990s, the SwAF started to send officers to the Air War College or the Air Command and Staff College at the Air University at Maxwell AFB. 
175
176
177
An educational goal of the SNDC air faculty is to form officers capable of informed judgement in the field of air power and beyond. It is assumed that academic warriors have a better chance of accomplishing their objectives due to a broader range of insights. After having attended the GSO programmes, airmen are expected to be capable of accomplishing their tasks in combined and joint air operations. This goal is supported by combining the teaching of the operational art with historical case studies from the Second World War up to the latest air campaigns and conflicts. The concept of defensive counterair operations, for instance, is exemplified by studying the Battle of Britain, while offensive counterair operations are introduced by scrutinising the air campaign of Desert Storm. Operation Allied Force for its part is deemed an adequate example for the study of multinational operations. Furthermore, the teaching of air power theory heavily draws upon the historical evolution. A particular emphasis is put upon air power thinking in the interwar years, with particular reference to the situation in Sweden. 178
The annual air power seminars held at the SNDC became an important vehicle to further the intellectual air power debate within the SwAF. Furthermore, publications on air power theory produced by the SNDC underline the SwAF's thrust towards achieving a professional grasp of the new intellectualism in air power thinking.
From 2002 to 2005 air power seminars were organised annually. The 2002 seminar dealt with the nature and essence of military doctrine. It was basically run by Swedes.

In addition to the annual air power seminars, the SNDC started to produce its own publications on air power theory, with a particular focus on the application of air power in the post-Cold War era.

to Maintain a Relevant Air Force in Light of Escalating Costs and Advanced Technologies?
Throughout the Cold War, Sweden maintained a vast defence industrial complex capable of producing complete main weapon systems. A particular concern was the development and production of indigenous fighter aircraft. The roots of the Swedish aircraft and aerospace industry reach back before World War II. In 1937 Svenska Aeroplan was founded and later became known as Saab. Originally, activities were relegated to building foreign aircraft under license, but being cut off from foreign supplies during World War II forced the Swedes to design and manufacture their own aircraft. As a result, since the 1940s, the procurement of domestically designed, developed, and manufactured combat aircraft has been considered an important pillar of the Swedish defence posture. Throughout the Cold War era, the Swedish aerospace industry proved its capacity to turn out very sophisticated aircraft such as the Draken or the Viggen. Yet, components threatening to overstretch Sweden's industrial base, such as jet engines or air-toair missiles, were built under licence. The American C-130 Hercules is a rare example where an off-the-shelf procurement policy was adopted. 
186
187
188
Throughout the 1990s, a major reform within the Swedish defence industrial complex took place. It was acknowledged that autarchy in armaments production was no longer economically and technically reasonable. Sweden therefore began to pursue a process of consolidating and rationalising its national defence industrial base, thereby focusing upon core competencies and promoting arms exports. This process was accompanied by a vigorous thrust towards international cooperation. 189 It was even argued by Swedish decision makers that international cooperation would help to ensure reliable access to defence material in the event of a deteriorating security situation-an argument standing in stark contrast to Sweden's Cold War approach to defence procurement.

JAS 39 Gripen. 192
193
Undoubtedly, the development, manufacture, and introduction of the JAS 39 Gripen into the SwAF were the most important achievements of the Swedish defence industry in the 1990s. To bridge the gap between earlier aircraft designs and the Gripen, the SwAF pursued a path of upgrading operational aircraft designs. Since the delivery of the first JA 37 interceptor Viggen to the SwAF in 1978, the aircraft had been constantly upgraded, primarily in the area of software, and a data link allowing aircraft-to-aircraft communication was

Insufficient power projection capabilities also became apparent against the backdrop of the establishment of the SwAF's rapid reaction units. Though all necessary support functions were contained within the unit, SWAFRAP JAS 39 was dependent upon lead nation support in deployed operations, especially when operating from so-called bare bases. 
213
214
215
Due to Sweden's strategic position and proximity to the Soviet Union, early warning and rapid response were crucial for Swedish defence preparations throughout the Cold War era. Hence, a sophisticated intelligence gathering, processing, and response system was indispensable. For this purpose, a highly integrated C2 system, the Stril 60, was procured in the 1960s and early 1970s. 
216
217
Given Sweden's emphasis upon the ability to counter limited strategic attacks throughout the 1990s, the need for situational awareness was given particular priority in the aftermath of the Cold War. The Flygvapnet 2000 concept was specially designed for this purpose, allowing for a free data flow between the different systems, with the combat aircraft itself serving as an intelligence collection platform.

During the post-Cold War era, the SwAF has come a long way from an air force almost exclusively geared up to autonomous territorial defence to an air force that can operate in an international environment. Yet, in an era where power projection and combined operations have become increasingly important, Sweden's Cold War legacy exerted significant inertia upon reforms. Only in the late 1990s was the Swedish defence establishment ready to forego fundamental principles such as the focus upon autonomous territorial defence. The defence reform, commencing in 1999, had far-reaching consequences for the SwAF. As such, it underwent massive force cuts. In fact, the SwAF seems to have reached a critical force level for autonomous territorial defence scenarios. Such drastic reductions were particularly justified in light of NATO's expansion to the Baltic, which was perceived to have a stabilising effect upon the region. Moreover, the SwAF accepted a setback in its very advanced course towards an autonomous networkbased defence approach when it forewent the indigenous Taras data link and instead opted for a Link 16-compatible terminal for its combat aircraft. Particularly, the decision to reduce the operational S 100 Argus fleet from six to two upgraded and NATOinteroperable airborne early warning and control aircraft underlines the importance that Swedish defence policy attaches to the multinational dimension. Defence is no longer understood in purely national terms. The 2009 government bill made it clear that the SwAF should be able to conduct combined air operations in the Nordic region. Immediately available and interoperable resources to counter rapidly unfolding military crises of short duration are considered more important than a large autarchic defence that requires a significant time span to reach operational readiness.
Despite drastic force cuts and the abandonment of an advanced Swedish data link, the SwAF has-in the context of territorial defence-remained a full-spectrum air force, allowing it to reconstitute in a time of heightened tension. For instance, unlike many other European air forces, it has acquired airborne SIGINT and retained an expertise in airborne standoff jamming. Moreover, the planned number of 100 JAS 39C/D Gripens is still significant, given the size of the Swedish state and compared, for instance, to the GAF, which originally planned to acquire 180 Eurofighters.
Besides the 1999 defence reform and a reduced defence budget, the SwAF's considerable force cuts can be related to the requirements of deployed operations. Whereas the Cold War was characterised by deterrence postures and hence dominated by how many squadrons an opponent could potentially muster, the ability to generate air power has become much more dependent upon other factors than primarily airframes. Already suffering from overstretch during the Cold War and throughout the 1990s, the SwAF could no longer sustain an oversized combat aircraft fleet. To operate across the spectrum of military force in deployed scenarios, sophisticated training and professionalism could no longer be compromised in order to retain an excessive aircraft fleet. SwAF rapid reaction units regularly participated in multinational integrated exercises and exclusively drew upon professional and contracted personnel for potential deployed operations. Moreover, the demands of interoperability dictated the SwAF's force structure. Only NATO interoperable combat aircraft are retained in the operational squadrons. Force reductions have been partly made up through force multiplying factors such as increased situational awareness as well as swing-role-capable combat aircraft and advanced armament. It can be concluded that Sweden's alliance policy and emphasis upon power projection were the driving factors behind the SwAF's transformation since 1999. Yet, against the backdrop of a reasserting Russia, Nordic defence scenarios in cooperation with other neighbouring states will most likely become the cornerstone of the SwAF's continuing adaptation.
During the Cold War and throughout the 1990s, international operations were completely divorced from Sweden's main defence effort. The SwAF's implicit response to Desert Storm was not to emulate its Western counterparts but to improve its air defence for countering the new capabilities of precision air power. Today, it is the declared aim to generate defence resources which are polyvalent and can be used in both a national and international context. This dual-use approach combined with the indigenous combat aircraft industry has restricted the buildup of adequate force enablers for deployed operations. A relatively large strategic airlift fleet only makes sense in the international context, and Sweden's aircraft industry required economy of scale to avoid excessive costs. Therefore, given Sweden's limited defence budget, the imbalance between strike assets and force enablers could not substantially be redressed. Through cooperative ventures such as SALIS or NATO's Strategic Airlift Capability initiative, these shortcomings can most likely only be mitigated. As in the case of SWAFRAP JAS 39, it can be assumed that the NBG Gripen detachment is still dependent upon foreign assistance in deployed scenarios, particularly when operating from bare bases.
Sweden's shift towards enhanced deployability also had an impact upon the prioritisation of the SwAF's air power roles. Whereas air defence was the predominant mission in the 1990s, the ability to influence events on the ground has gained in importance. This shift in importance is closely related to the changing threat and risk perception. Limited strategic attacks against Swedish key infra structure were considered a major threat scenario during the 1990s. To counter them, a good air defence and early warning capability were considered crucial. Yet, with the thrust towards international operations at the end of the century, air-to-ground capabilities have become more important. Particularly against the backdrop of the buildup of rapidly deployable Army units, the SwAF had to develop from scratch an advanced CAS capability.
Due to its tradition of neutrality and the fact that most of its air power assets were not interoperable throughout the 1990s, the SwAF contributed only in a limited way to deployed operations. It did this mainly through the provision of airlift at the lower level of the spectrum of military force, which nevertheless entailed significant risks for the crews involved. Since the turn of the century, the SwAF has readied rapid reaction units for international operations, also involving fighter-bombers. While SWAFRAP AJS 37 was primarily relegated to reconnaissance, the NBG Gripen detachment is able to deliver CAS for ground troops. The capability to act across the spectrum of military force in deployed operations became a key criterion for the Swedish armed forces in general and for the SwAF in particular. These requirements demanded a high degree of professionalism, which was met by the SwAF's rapid reaction units.
Not only with regard to hardware and software but also in terms of the intellectual mastery of air power, the SwAF has become increasingly interoperable. Both the revision of the air power curriculum at the SNDC and the air power doctrine development process coincided with Sweden's defence reform and hence reflected the shift away from an emphasis upon autonomous territorial defence towards a combined and expeditionary mindset. The defence reform itself provided the necessary top-down backing for these intellectual responses to the changing security environment. Though the teaching of air power theory has heavily drawn upon Anglo-Saxon concepts, the SNDC has been slowly emancipating itself and has produced its own publications. It can therefore be concluded that the SwAF has proactively responded to the new intellectual challenges since the late 1990s. Though this process has required top-down backing, individuals and personalities at lower levels have played a key role.
As the preliminary findings demonstrate, each air force has responded to the air power challenges of the post-Cold War era according to its context. The following discussion synthesises the responses of the air forces examined across the four guiding challenges-shifting defence and alliance policies, real operations, new intellectualism in air power thinking and doctrine, and procurement.
Since the threat and risk spectrum of the post-Cold War era was no longer determined by two opposing blocs, the military-strategic focus shifted from territorial defence to deployed operations. Power projection in support of the UN, the ESDP, or NATO has become the determining factor in shaping Continental European air power. Amongst the four countries, the Netherlands was the first to accept these new realities; consequently, its military transformation was the most advanced in the period studied. Its rapid shift towards expeditionary warfare allowed the RNLAF to contribute to deployed operations disproportionately to the size of the country. France, under the presidency of Jacques Chirac, came to terms with the new realities in the mid-1990s. Whereas the country's military strategic doctrine had long been dominated by the nuclear force, conventional power assumed centre stage, offering the possibility to prevent, contain, or stabilise regional crises.
Germany and Sweden, on the other hand, only began to accept the new strategic realities at the end of the 1990s, significantly delaying the transformation of their air forces. Germany's historical legacy and the vestiges of Sweden's neutral tradition exacerbated these delays. Moreover, both nations had been frontline states, and their decision makers found it difficult to relax after the Cold War. The GAF had a unique experience in the early 1990s, when it was tasked to disband the East German Air Force and to integrate some of its personnel and equipment. This process did not lead to a hybrid between Western and East-ern concepts-instead, West German concepts were extended across Germany. Carefully screening former East German officers who aspired to be reemployed was in part responsible for this outcome. The costs of German reunification and the socalled peace dividend led to severely reduced defence resources, causing delays and reappraisals of multinational acquisition programmes such as the Eurofighter. Reunification efforts probably also caused the German armed forces to be more preoccupied with themselves than with deployed operations. It can be concluded that the Netherlands entered the post-Cold War era with the least baggage, enabling it to adapt almost immediately to the altered post-Cold War strategic environment.
The sharp increase in deployed operations caused the four countries examined to initiate a shift towards professional armed forces. France and the Netherlands abolished conscription in the 1990s-primarily due to the requirements of deployed operations across the spectrum of military force. Sweden suspended conscription in mid-2010, while, as of 2010, Germany still held onto the tradition of conscription. The suspension of conscription is scheduled to be implemented in July 2011.
Unlike armies, air forces are to a larger degree dependent on equipment. Given the exponential rise in the cost of air power equipment, national economic performance can significantly impact a nation's air force. To put national defence resources and the size of the four examined air forces into context, the following tables compare gross national products (GNP)/GDP and defence expenditures (table

As this study shows, the size of the defence budget is only one determinant in shaping effective defence. Equally important is an air force's approach to real operations, multinational cooperation, and procurement, as well as the political will to make contributions across the spectrum of military force.
Resource allocations to the air forces vary across the four countries. In 2002 France allocated the air force 17.7 per cent of its overall defence budget-including expenditures for the national paramilitary police force (Gendarmerie Nationale) and research and development; according to a 1999 assessment, Germany appropriated 29 per cent.

In terms of flying frontline squadrons and air force personnel, the four air forces examined differ significantly. Yet, as is argued in this book, the operational potential does not directly correlate with the number of available squadrons but with the number of deployable and employable squadrons.
Single European states have been unable to acquire the capacities of a full-spectrum air force capable of autonomously staging an operation of the size of Allied Force. As table 8 shows, even five major European air forces combined did not get close to American capabilities in 1990 or 2000. This discrepancy in manned air assets is also mirrored in the domain of MALE and HALE RPAs. According to a JAPCC report, European NATO members (Turkey excluded) operated only 64 MALE/HALE RPAs in 2008 as opposed to the United States, which had more than 400.    39, 41, 43, 51, 80.   c   Data on flying frontline squadrons is relegated to fixed-wing fighter/fighter-bomber aircraft in the air-to-air, air-to-ground, and reconnaissance roles. For the FAF, strategic and prestrategic nuclear squadrons, which can also be used in a conventional role, are included. d Excluding reservists. a IISS, The Military Balance 1990-91 (London: Brassey's for the IISS, 1990), 17, 21-24, 65-66, 68,  75, 84-85, 93.   b IISS, The Military Balance 2000 -01 (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press for the IISS, 2000), 28, 30-31, 59-60, 62-63, 70, 81-82,   (56), and Denmark (48); Gripens-Hungary (14) and Czech Republic (14); Eurofighters-Spain (87), Austria (15), and Italy (96).

While including other select European air forces would increase the total number of combat aircraft, they would not add substantially to air mobility. The UK and France, for instance, had the only significant European tanker fleets and were the only air forces to have a national and deployable airborne early warning component in the 1990s.

For the foreseeable future, the United States will retain its air power dominance. Though Europe's currently planned 1,320 newgeneration combat aircraft seem impressive, they are by no means all usable in deployed operations, particularly due to a lack of force enablers. European defence resources turned out to be too scarce for the buildup of a tanker fleet that is even remotely comparable to that of the USAF. Air bases and equipment for deployed operations are also lacking, as has been demonstrated by NATO Response Force packages. Up to the time of writing, deployable air bases have remained a bottleneck, and only the RAF and FAF have been able to provide deployable air bases on a national basis. On the positive side, programmes such as the A400M are under way to remedy the situation. This airbus is expected to become the backbone of the multinational European Air Transport Command and is likely to considerably enhance European intertheatre airlift capacities.
Shortcomings in materiel can partly be compensated for through bi-and multinational cooperation, as the RNLAF has proven. Through embedding its Air Force into multilateral approaches, combined with its willingness to share risks across the spectrum of military operations, the Netherlands has counterbalanced a limited defence budget. By virtue of its Air Force's military prowess, the Netherlands has established itself as a trustworthy alliance partner-particularly in the view of the United States-that could make meaningful contributions to combined operations. It can be argued that the RNLAF's limited size-combined with its natural inclination to play a leading role in deployed operations and its conducive political environment-bolstered its adaptation to the organisational and doctrinal challenges of the post-Cold War era.
In France and Germany, the challenges of deployed operations have fostered a readiness to transfer national authority into cooperative ventures that have enhanced air power's effectiveness, particularly in air mobility. Promoted by these two countries, the EATC represents the culmination of European air mobility integration and is likely to appreciably cut administrative overheads. For rapid deployments, European nations need to be able to summon substantial airlift capabilities. The EATC provides member countries with an unprecedented surge capability. Another example of a successful cooperative venture was the establishment of a multinational European F-16 expeditionary air wing in 2004. So far, the trend has gravitated towards cooperation and pooling, while role specialisation has been viewed as limiting potential deployment options. Yet, role specialisation has occurred by default rather than by design. For instance, when its Jaguar fleet was phased out, the FAF also lost its dedicated SEAD capability. It was subsequently announced that the FAF would rely upon partners for this particular role in multinational air operations.
As regards alliance policy, American influence in European security matters has been welcomed by some, while others have attempted to minimise it. The Netherlands has chosen a strong transatlantic link, allowing it to generate effective segments of air power at a relatively low price. While the RNLAF has versatile and potent multirole combat aircraft and helicopter fleets at its disposal, it lacks essential functions such as deployable air operations centres, deployable air bases, or sufficient strategic airlift. The RNLAF is geared up for effectively plugging into American-led operations. In contrast, France has sought to generate independent European air power, which is nevertheless interoperable with US air power.
Unlike France, Germany has never had an ambition to supplant NATO by an independent European approach. Nonetheless, it strives to make the transatlantic partnership more equal, requiring the buildup of genuine European capabilities. Given Germany's close embedment into alliance structures, efforts such as NATO's Defence Capabilities Initiative or the Helsinki Headline Goallaunched in the same year-have considerably influenced force transformation. Consequently, the GAF has developed into a more balanced force. Moreover, Franco-German cooperation might be gaining in importance. Their combined armed forces are expected to cover a broad range of aerospace power capabilities in the medium term-including airborne early warning, SEAD, theatre ballistic missile defence, MALE/HALE RPAs, deployable air operations centres, combat search and rescue, air-to-air refuelling, and strategic airlift-without recourse to commonly owned NATO assets. This leads to a further conclusion highlighting the importance of European cooperation for generating relevant air power. A Franco-German core of European aerospace power capabilities will be coherent and will allow smaller European nations to plug and play.
European countries do not have to be capable of autonomously dealing with major contingencies in deployed operations, such as a future conflict involving a major regional military power. In these circumstances, it is-according to the British strategic expert Lawrence Freedman-"inconceivable that European governments would act independently of the US. " 5 However, the EU must be equipped to autonomously undertake peace support operations across the spectrum of military force, especially battlegroup-sized early-entry operations in failed states. After severe disagreements over Iraq in early 2003, it is difficult to imagine that the EU could have drawn easily upon NATO resources for Operation Artemis in mid-2003.
Rapid intervention operations in failed states require solid strategic airlift, ISTAR, and CAS capabilities, the latter providing escalation dominance. While a NATO C-17 airlift fleet might prove useful in these scenarios, ultimately, US consent will be requireda right Americans have put a premium upon to secure their influence upon European security.

NATO and the ESDP complement each other. The former guarantees a strong transatlantic link and provides for collective defence. The latter is particularly suited to respond to active requests by the UN secretary general against the backdrop of crises in the developing world. In many cases, the ESDP is the natural choice for the conduct of non-Article 5 crisis management scenarios. ESDP-led operations are seen in certain theatres as more benign than potential NATO operations. This specific reality was underlined by a French Air Force officer with ample experience in the African theatre at a 2008 NATO conference. 
7
With regard to European cooperation, the SwAF, for instance, still retains a coherent force structure for national defence scenarios and might be in a position to contribute key niche capabilities such as airborne early warning and control. Yet, the Netherlands and Sweden have been unable to build up capacities in resourceintensive areas, such as intertheatre airlift, similar to those of Germany and France. The SwAF has been forced to redress the imbalance between an overstretched force structure and operational requirements. As in the case of Germany, European headline goals have had a significant impact upon Sweden's military transformation-with interoperability and rapid deployability becoming the determining factor for the SwAF's force structure. Whereas during the Cold War the SwAF was able to maintain a large aircraft fleet through cost-effective national approaches to air power and the use of conscripts, deployed operations impose a number of minimum requirements such as participation in integrated exercises.
Simultaneously with the end of the Cold War, Desert Storm proved to be a major catalyst for the evolution of Western air power. According to their national circumstances, the four air forces examined reacted differently to the air war in the Gulf. For the FAF, Desert Storm changed paradigms about interoperability and international integration and generated a new emphasis upon advanced conventional weapon systems. German decision makers felt uneasy with offensive deployed operations and continued to emphasise territorial alliance defence throughout the 1990s. This outlook led to a gap in doctrinal innovation in the GAF, which was only overcome with the 2002-3 defence reform. The Netherlands entered the post-Cold War era with the least baggage, and the country-closely aligned with the United Statesswiftly implemented lessons on a political level from its "nearfighter-deployment" to the Gulf area during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. But on a military level, particularly for developing doctrine and acquiring an air-to-ground precision capability, Operations Deny Flight and Deliberate Force were more instrumental. In Sweden, lessons were not explicitly formulated. Yet throughout the 1990s, the capacity for countering limited strategic surprise attacks was particularly emphasised-basically an attempt to offset conventional precision air power. It can be concluded that amongst the four air forces examined, Desert Storm had the biggest impact upon the FAF, both politically and militarily. This is not surprising since the FAF was directly involved in the operation. There is a difference between "being there" and "watching an operation. "
While Desert Storm was a watershed for the FAF, operations at the upper end of the spectrum of military force were nothing new for the French-the FAF had been deployed to African theatres in the days of the Cold War. In the case of the RNLAF, the political leadership's willingness to employ it across the spectrum of force has become a significant leverage for Dutch air power. The RNLAF delivers proof that smaller nations can make a significant contribution to multinational operations disproportionate to their size when political resolve is combined with adequate military capabilities to carry out missions across the entire spectrum of military force. This is partly because the RNLAF entered the post-Cold War era with the least baggage amongst the four air forces examined. Yet, even with the Netherlands, an overtly aggressive stance in the use of offensive air power had to be avoided. To circumvent arousing public concerns, the Dutch supreme commander deliberately imposed a low silhouette upon the RNLAF's performance in Operation Allied Force. This was particularly the case after a Dutch F-16 downed a Serb MiG-29 in the first night of operations, the only European air-to-air kill in major air campaigns throughout the 1990s.
In contrast, because of their different historical experiences, Germany and Sweden have been hampered in employing military power in real operations and in moving away from a threatbased paradigm to a more proactive defence policy, taking on security challenges at a distance. Consequently, the GAF's performance has been constrained considerably in real operations. German out-of-area contributions, apart from air mobility, have been relegated to SEAD and reconnaissance. Though readied to do so, the GAF has not so far dispatched ground-attack aircraft armed with LGBs. In the case of the SwAF, only the transport unit has been dispatched on out-of-area missions up to this writing. Both Germany and Sweden prefer the employment of their offensive capabilities against purely military targets to avoid collateral damage. Accordingly, the SwAF's rapid reaction units were first prepared solely for reconnaissance and air-to-air tasks, and the NBG Gripen detachment is geared up for CAS. Nevertheless, both the GAF and the SwAF have exposed crews to appreciable risks entailing potential fatalities.
Real operations in the post-Cold War era have highlighted significant European air power shortfalls. Some of these deficits have not been due to a lack of capabilities but to national caveats. The GAF, for instance, has a potent SEAD component that was used to great effect in Allied Force, where it released nearly a third of all anti-radiation missiles. In light of the small size of the German detachment, this was a momentous achievement. While this capability was already available during Deliberate Force in 1995, it could not be used to its full effect because of political constraints. Participation in deployed operations that might entail combat are still highly sensitive in Germany, as demonstrated by the recent debate about German crews manning NATO AWACS aircraft patrolling Turkish airspace against the backdrop of Operation Iraqi Freedom.
Real operations have been a catalyst for cooperative endeavours, doctrine development, and procurement in the post-Cold War era. The Franco-British Air Group, the predecessor of the European Air Group, for instance, developed from Franco-British experiences in the air operations over Bosnia. The operational dimension itself has been shaped by the requirements of combined operations, which have been dominated by US air power and which meant the adoption of a doctrine geared up for mediumaltitude operations. Thus, while regular low-level training in Canada was abandoned by both the GAF and the RNLAF, integrated exercises such as Red Flag in the United States have become of pivotal importance. These exercises allowed German and Dutch pilots to plug seamlessly into combined air campaigns over Bosnia and Kosovo, despite their lack of combat experience throughout the Cold War. Even the SwAF, which is not a NATO alliance air force, came to recognise the importance of integrated air exercises for deployed operations. Real operations and integrated exercises led to a convergence of European air power. This thrust has been further facilitated through ventures such as the NATO Response Force in a NATO context or, more recently, the EU Air Rapid Response Concept in an EU context, underlining the importance of European air power cooperation. In the setting of these ventures, major European air forces, such as the RAF or the FAF, have gained leadership experience by taking on responsibility for combined air component commands. Yet, despite the adoption of a common operational doctrine, certain distinct features have been retained by the air forces examined. The RNLAF has employed its swing-role concept to great effect, and the FAF has excelled in deploying small contingents for integrated operations in Africa.
In Kosovo in 1999, air power was the weapon of choice for not only the United States but also for European participants. Yet unlike USAF doctrine, a fragile political environment has resulted in a gradualist Continental European approach to the use of air power-demonstrated in Allied Force. Continental Europeans are reluctant to get involved in "shock and awe" air campaigns, given the casualty sensitivity in the context of wars of choice. Germany and Sweden-with their particular but different legacies-prefer stabilisation operations, where air power is used in an integrated mode and plays a rather ancillary role. In fact, a transatlantic division of labour was apparent. While European nations provided the bulk of ground forces in Bosnia and Kosovo, Americans provided most of the assets for air operations. For instance, the Clinton administration steadfastly refused to commit ground forces to UNPROFOR in Bosnia, but the United States was the key player in Deny Flight and Deliberate Force. 
8
Yet, growing involvement in out-of-area operation can cause increased expenditure on air power. In the case of Germany, the A400M programme together with the Eurofighter is about to consume a significant share of the defence equipment budget. Deployed operations in general have had far-reaching implications for procurement, serving as a major catalyst in force protection, armament, and C4ISTAR. The issue of casualty aversion was addressed by a new emphasis on force protection, while highly complex combined air campaigns demanded an advanced and interoperable C2 infrastructure-as the FAF painfully learned in Desert Storm.
Apart from deployed air campaigns at the upper end of the spectrum of military force, the post-Cold War era has seen so-called non-kinetic air power used to great effect in humanitarian operations. Sweden and Germany have particularly felt more at ease with these kinds of operations in light of their particular legacies.
Thinking and Doctrine
Developments at the grand-strategic level have influenced air power thinking and doctrine. Sweden's and Germany's major defence reforms triggered, or at least supported, a more sophisticated approach to the doctrinal dimension of air power. The German Air Power Centre was set up against the backdrop of the 2002-3 defence reform, and Germany also acted as the lead nation in setting up NATO's Joint Air Power Competence Centre, which became operational in early 2005. Similarly, the Swedish doctrinal debate experienced a major impetus after the country's defence political process began broadening, starting in 1999, and with the SwAF readying units for rapid deployment. From 2002 onwards, the SwAF organised a series of major air power conferences annually. It became involved in a doctrine development process that in 2004 resulted in the SwAF's first published air power doctrine. In addition, the air faculty at the Swedish National Defence College started to produce its own publications on air power theory. Moreover, doctrine and proactive air power thinking provided the SwAF with a means to foster NATO interoperability. Despite Sweden's non-membership in NATO, the Swedish armed forces in general and the SwAF in particular have deliberately transferred NATO concepts into their military doctrine manuals.
Besides developments at the grand-strategic level, real operations have triggered doctrine development and a broader air power debate, particularly in the case of the RNLAF and the FAF. The launching of the air power journal Penser les ailes françaises can be understood as a response to the FAF's increased involvement in combined air operations. In line with its goal of being a lead European air force, the FAF has felt it necessary to also shape the air power debate. The RNLAF published its first air power doctrine in 1996 as a reaction to its involvement in the air operations over Bosnia and other deployed operations. Two major motivations can be discerned for doctrinal innovation within the RNLAFstaying compatible with its US counterparts as well as codifying and disseminating lessons learned from recent deployed operations. The RNLAF has viewed a doctrinal debate as contributing to its professionalism and enhancing its performance in combined air operations. As previously mentioned, General Manderfeld, chief of the Air Staff from 1992 to 1995, attributed the RNLAF's outstanding performance over Bosnia not only to training but also to education.
Accordingly, the RNLAF's efforts were well received, as General Horner, the Desert Storm air component commander, indicated. He particularly underlined the RNLAF's outstanding qualities with regard to professionalism, equipment, training, and attitude. RNLAF leadership envisions that a sound grasp of doctrine and air power theory will empower Dutch airmen to be on a par with the Netherlands' most advanced allies and maximize their operational effectiveness.
As revealed by Germany's response to Desert Storm, the GAF was uneasy with offensive air operations in the wake of the Cold War. This stance also reflected on air power doctrine. US operational dominance naturally led to US doctrinal dominance, which put a premium upon offensive air operations. Germany's difficulty in reconciling offensive air power doctrine with its historical legacy resulted in doctrinal stagnation throughout the 1990s. Right after Desert Storm in March 1991, the GAF published its first air power doctrine. The document was doctrinally anchored in the later stages of the Cold War. Unlike the RAF, however, which also published its first edition of AP 3000 in 1991 and saw a need to revise the doctrine to codify the lessons of Desert Storm, the GAF was reluctant to incorporate those lessons. Whereas in the later stages of the Cold War, GAF officers regularly expressed their views on issues such as the GAF's role within NATO's defence doctrine in various journals, in the 1990s fewer GAF officers wrote about doctrinal issues. Only in the environment of the 2002-3 defence reform did the GAF again approach doctrinal and conceptual issues more proactively. The establishment of the Air Power Centre and the GAF's lead role in the formation of NATO's Joint Air Power Competence Centre are part of this reorientation, perceived as necessary in light of recent German commitments to cooperative endeavours such as the NATO Response Force or the EU Air Rapid Response Concept. Doctrine has not only been a response to the challenges of deployed operations but has also been a carrier of institutional interests. The SwAF and FAF responded to joint doctrine manuals by developing single-service doctrines. The GAF started to revise its air power doctrine when faced with a new armed forces reform that put a premium upon the joint level. Its leadership perceived it necessary to express explicitly air power's capabilities so as not to lose out relative to the other services.
The senior command echelon plays a crucial role in the doctrine development process, as particularly exemplified by the Royal Australian Air Force. Recognising the importance of doc-trine, the chief of the Air Staff ordered the formation of the RAAF Air Power Studies Centre in 1989, providing Australia with an edge in doctrine development in the post-Cold War era. In France, the opposite occurred throughout the 1990s. Attempts at formalising doctrine were primarily driven by exogenous factors, and the chief of the Air Staff considered formal doctrine dogmatic, inhibiting innovative thinking. Only recently has doctrine development in France received top-level cover. Germany's uneasiness with deployed offensive operations also might have led to a lack of top-down support for doctrine development. Only the defence reform starting in 2002 put an end to doctrinal stagnation.
In contrast, the Netherlands entered the post-Cold War era with the least historical and political baggage. Partly as a consequence of that and due to natural inclination, the RNLAF senior command was receptive to the importance of sound education and doctrine. As argued above, General Manderfeld regarded education as vital for operational effectiveness. His successor, General Droste, directly linked deployed operations to the need for adequate air power doctrine in his foreword to the RNLAF's first published version of its air power doctrine in 1996. 
9
The senior command's attitude to doctrine also proved to be crucial in the case of the SwAF. Whereas the first and second attempts at developing a national air power doctrine were bottom-up approaches, only with sufficient top-down backing and resource allocations did the third attempt result in a published doctrine.
The Continental European air forces-particularly the senior command levels-have gradually recognised the value of air power doctrine in the post-Cold War era and have started to emulate their Anglo-Saxon counterparts. This is reflected not only in the air forces' doctrine development but also in the dissemination and teaching of air power thought. However, they have not yet come up with truly innovative thinking. As the air power conferences in Sweden and the Netherlands reveal, the Western air power debate is still dominated by Anglo-Saxon thinkers. Moreover, though the defence colleges in the Netherlands and Sweden developed rigorous air power reading lists for their students, none of the four air forces has yet produced an intellectual air power study course comparable to that of SAASS in the United States. While ventures such as the EAG or NATO's JAPCC are commendable and help European air forces to become more interoperable, they do not really address challenges on an intellectual level.
Genuine European air power also requires a conceptual grasp of air power theory and history. No European air power school of thought has yet emerged and encapsulated modern Europe's gradualist approach to air war. This mindset is a result of Europe's rather tenuous political environment and preference for integrated and stabilisation operations. If European air forces intend to go beyond mere pooling of forces and to be an effective tool for common military and foreign political goals, a conceptual grasp of air power is essential.
Continental European states generally have pursued three approaches to procurement-national programmes, cooperative programmes, and buying off the shelf. The low impact of politicoindustrial concerns in the Netherlands has facilitated its ability to buy off the shelf, allowing the procurement of advanced American aircraft at relatively low unit costs. As a result, the RNLAF has been able to concentrate almost exclusively upon operational requirements and thereby to generate-in the short term at leastrelevant air power. Buying off the shelf freed resources which could be invested in swing-role training.
In contrast, the path of strategic independence, as pursued by France, has its price in terms of operational effectiveness. Ambitious national development programmes in times of constrained defence budgets have led to significant delays in acquiring new capabilities. Particularly, the French air transport fleet has been suffering from chronic shortcomings and overstretch. This leads to a further conclusion which has affected all of the four air forces to a larger or lesser degree. Essentially, they ignored the impact of cost escalation on procurement and adopted overambitious plans. Plans had to be subsequently cancelled, as was, for instance, the case with a planned Franco-German SEAD missile Despite the consequent loss of capabilities, such as dedicated SEAD, the FAF has been able to retain a balanced force structure, allowing France to stage smaller operations independently in deployed scenarios. For France, an independent defence industrial base is pivotal to further French ambitions. In the post-Cold War era, France has been the only European state to independently develop and produce not only combat aircraft but also a coherent range of subsystems from laser-designator pods to air-to-air and air-to-ground weapons. Only in cases where autonomous approaches have become excessively expensive, such as in the case of airborne early warning, has this principle been abandoned. Germany, participating in the multilateral Eurofighter programme, has been successful in evolving towards a more balanced air force by striving for an improved ratio between strike assets and force enablers. The GAF's force transformation was further facilitated through multilateral development and procurement programmes. This approach has been deliberately pursued to strengthen the interrelationship within both the NATO and EU alliances. It has enabled Germany to be less concerned about economy of scale-particularly in the area of combat aircraftwith the burden being shared by several partners. It can hence be argued that the advantages of cooperation outweigh the handicaps. Yet, the GAF's evolvement into a more balanced air force is unlikely to be fully translated into effective operational output as a dichotomy between operational potential and political acceptance still exists.
Note that the Netherlands-which did not have any major politico-industrial obligations in European cooperative aircraft programmes-has not placed a larger emphasis upon the forceenabling component of air power. Instead, it has put a premium upon acquiring state-of-the-art strike assets such as the AH-64 Apache. Kinetic assets are still seen as providing for a country's defence, whereas an overemphasis on force enablers is seen as role specialisation-supposedly only providing a narrow bandwidth of political options. The nation-state still dominates the shaping of air power; this results in a significant imbalance between the shaft and the spear, not only on a national level but particularly on a European level. Despite the fact that, for instance, the procurement of a limited number of C-17 Globemasters in the late 1990s by a medium-sized European state would have generated an international leverage out of proportion to the costs involved, this option has not been pursued.
Different approaches to procurement lead to a further conclusion concerning the importance of European air power cooperation. Buying off the shelf, while promising cost-effective, shortterm bargains, has not contributed to the buildup of European strategic autonomy. In the case of France and to a lesser degree of Germany, politico-industrial concerns were paramount over operational requirements. In contrast, the Netherlands-with its strong transatlantic orientation-has primarily equipped its Air Force with sophisticated American equipment at relatively low unit costs. Yet, in the absence of a European aerospace industry, American suppliers might have had no incentive to offer their products at a competitive price. Hence, it can be argued that the Netherlands has indirectly benefited from a European aerospace industry. Moreover, if Meilinger's tenth air power proposition that "air power includes not only military assets but an aerospace industry and commercial aviation" holds true, an aerospace industry is a critical requirement for at least the larger European nations. 
10
From a grand-strategic point of view, only approaches taking into account the importance of a credible European aerospace industry can serve a common European defence effort in the long term. One British commentator argued that "it would be difficult to envisage any credible European security policy in the second century of air power without a credible aerospace industrial base to sustain it. " 
11
In the post-Cold War era, technological advancements have compensated for reductions and limited defence resources, particularly through the increased attention upon multirole-capable air power assets. A 1992 RAND study's assumption that the number of multirole squadrons would decline substantially did not materialise at all-quite the opposite has been the case. 
12
Technological trends have particularly played into the hands of the RNLAF and have allowed it to overcome its limited defence resources. In the 1980s highly sophisticated and specialised air-craft such as the Tornado were required for the all-weather attack role. But the shift towards medium altitude combined with bolton solutions, such as laser-designator pods or GPS devices, transformed lighter fighters such as the F-16 into potent multirole aircraft. The RNLAF F-16s are expected to remain in the front line up to 2020. Through this extended life span, significant cost savings can be achieved. Given the relatively permissive air environment of the post-Cold War era, bolt-on solutions have also turned less advanced aircraft into relevant attack aircraft. In Allied Force, where no major air superiority battles had to be fought, French Jaguars equipped with laser-designator pods made significant contributions. The asymmetry between Western air power and potential opponents in general led to a new emphasis upon the air-to-ground role as opposed to the air-to-air role.
Technological advancements have also appreciably enhanced precision and firepower. The Rafale, for instance, can release a standard air-to-ground weapons load of four to six PGMs. In Allied Force, advanced strike aircraft such as the Tornado, the Mirage 2000D, or the F-16 carried a standard weapons load of only two
LGBs. Such an increase in firepower puts a British commentator's argument, made in the wake of Kosovo-that Europe would have to increase its 500 all-weather bombers by 50 per cent-into a different perspective. 
13
Several technological benchmarks have been established. Minimum requirements have to be met to plug and play, particularly in the areas of interoperable C2 and precision strike. These common criteria no longer allow for autonomous approaches. In this regard, the way that air power has been generated has become more convergent. Advances in the technological dimension also helped to computerise C2 functions and hence facilitated leaner overall command structures. Only through these technological advances could a long-held air power tenet-unity of command over all air assets-be put into practice.
France's leading role in the development of the Link-16 terminal MIDS is a good example of how grand-strategic ambitions and operational requirements have influenced each other. Its ambition to be a lead nation in European defence and its shortcomings in Desert Storm in interoperability led to France's decision to become a key player in this crucial technological endeavour. The demands of interoperability also influenced the SwAF, which had to supplant its advanced national data links with NATO interoperable Link-16 terminals.
In general, the emphasis upon airframes has shifted to a more balanced approach that gives more consideration to air power software. In fact, air power software gained unprecedented importance at the outset of the post-Cold War era. In the wake of Desert Storm, Martin van Creveld argued that "no other country possesses the hardware, much less the 'software, ' needed for mounting an air campaign that will even remotely compare with US capabilities in this field. " 
14
While the technological dimension is without doubt of utmost importance for the generation of relevant air power, it has been less important for Continental European air forces as compared to the USAF. During Operations Deny Flight and Deliberate Force, for instance, the RNLAF alongside other European allies would have preferred to employ air power more flexibly instead of relying upon rigid force packages with standoff jammers and dedicated SEAD assets. This more human-centric approach was also revealed in logistics when the FAF deployed to Manas in Central Asia in early 2002. In contrast to the American detachment, the FAF made up for limitations in power projection by drawing as much as possible upon regional resupply. Accordingly, Continental Europe has not produced technological quantum leaps in air power but has pursued a path of gradual steps.
Given air power's dependence upon technology and the almost exponential rise in the costs of air power assets, one might expect materiel and defence budget resources to be the primary shapers of air power. Contrarily, the evidence suggests that adaptations to the altered strategic environment and a nation's willingness to share risks across the spectrum of military operations have largely influenced Continental European air power from 1990 to 2005. These characteristics effectively offset economic and material limitations.
Political adaptations to the new post-Cold War realities could potentially be realized faster than major development programmes, which could not be so easily adjusted in this transition period. Consequently, force size was not the predominant factor in producing relevant European air power-as exemplified by the RNLAF. Size will be more relevant once new capabilities have been strengthened, particularly in the force-enabling areas.
It is in technology and operations where Continental European air power has become most convergent. Combined operations have required common doctrinal and technological criteria. Only by meeting these criteria can an air force plug and play.
At the outset of the post-Cold War era, Desert Storm gave a vivid demonstration of modern air power. According to their national circumstances, the four air forces examined reacted differently to the air war in the Gulf. Yet in the medium and long term, each of the air forces began to implement the lessons of modern air warfare. Their approaches to force structuring, operations, procurement, and doctrine reflected these lessons.
Buying American-combined with a willingness to actually employ air power across the spectrum of military force-has facilitated effective air power at a relatively low price. In contrast, European autarchy in developing new proficiencies has led to shortcomings in the operational dimension, particularly in intertheatre airlift. Nevertheless, this approach is pivotal for fortifying European defence. As discussed above, however, meaningful European air power hinges not only upon physical but also upon conceptual components. A doctrinal grasp of air power that reflects Europe's political environment and distinct approaches to air power is therefore a prerequisite.
Each air force has responded to the air power challenges of the post-Cold War era according to its context. Hence, the single air forces are not representative and are to a large degree sui generis. Yet, the four air forces combined set the benchmark for Continental European air power in its various dimensions, including a transatlantic, national, and European emphasis upon air power. While European shortfalls have led to various cooperative ventures, leading to converging European air power at the technological and operational levels, these developments are not likely to end up in a wider European air force. The nation-state still dominates defence policy at the strategic level.
Overall, Continental Europe places less merit upon air power than does the United States. Nevertheless, Continental Europe has been strengthening air power capabilities that have the potential of taking on a more prominent role on the international stage. Provided that planned development and procurement programmes are implemented, Continental Europe together with the UK will be capable of autonomously conducting a potential operation similar to Deliberate Force in Europe's vicinity. Deliberate Force saw the employment of approximately 300 combat and support aircraft, mainly from well-prepared air bases in Italy. This number was slightly below the requirements stated in the EU Helsinki Headline Goal of 1999, which conceived the ability to deploy up to 400 combat aircraft for EU operations but proved too ambitious at the time. Yet a campaign similar to Allied Force, involving about 1,000 aircraft in the final stages-including American long-range bombers-is still beyond Europe's capability alone despite technological advances and requires significant American involvement.

Royal Netherlands Air Force (Koninklijke Luchtmacht)
The Royal Netherlands Air Force (RNLAF), or Koninklijke Luchtmacht, has its roots back in 1913, when it consisted of a single aeroplane and a unit of merely six men. After World War II, in 1953, the RNLAF was formed as an independent service.

When Gen Charles A. Horner, the air component commander of Operation Desert Storm, was asked to comment upon the RNLAF, he particularly highlighted the Air Force's outstanding qualities regarding professionalism, equipment, training, and attitude. Moreover, he took the view that in the course of Allied Force, the RNLAF proved to be highly interoperable and able to cover a broad panoply of air power missions, including offensive air combat missions. As such, the air component commander could rely upon the RNLAF to execute difficult missions, with other NATO Paveway II LGBs as well as Litening III laser-designator pods were procured for the Gripen fleet.

The SwAF was the first European air force to buy the C-130 Hercules and took delivery of its first C-130 in February 1965. It bought a total of eight aircraft, the bulk of them in the early 1980s.
