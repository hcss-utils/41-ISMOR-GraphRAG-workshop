In Georgia, Russia created and then froze ethnic rebel conflicts as a point of leverage in Georgian politics.
In both Georgia and Ukraine, Moscow engaged in political subversion, armed proxy groups, manipulated economic conditions and used different levels of violence toward achieving strategic objectives for years before the brief introduction of more traditional forms of military warfare.
In Georgia and Crimea, Russia masked the dynamic change of the status quo behind other world events and kept the level of violence below a threshold that might induce foreign intervention.
In Donbas, Russia lacked a clear strategic objective and attempted to capitalize on the Crimean success while world attention was focused on Ukraine, resulting in a costly war that escalated and risked Western intervention.
In all three cases, hybrid warfare continued after the reduction of overt warfare as Moscow worked to prevent the opposition governments from establishing stable democratic environments and reestablishing sovereign control of their territories.
