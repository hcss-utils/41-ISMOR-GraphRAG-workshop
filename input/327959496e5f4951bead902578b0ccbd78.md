Leading up to the Russo-Japanese War, there were examples of militaries successfully exploiting the use of railroads, e.g. the Franco-Prussian war, the Austro-Prussian War, and the American Civil War.
Ironically, the Russo-Japanese War would be fought because of the existence of a railway.
Eastward expansion by the Russia became a clear threat to Japan's interest from the construction of the Trans-Siberian Railway which linked Western Russia with the Far East.
The railway network provided a dynamic element to the Russo-Japanese War.
The Russian forces, however, approached their railways in a passive way, regarding them mainly as a logistical support capability, and purely as a means of transport for their human and material supplies.
In contrast, the Japanese saw their railways as a factor to be integrated into their overall strategy, using lines as a support facility, but also integrating them into broader plan of attack.
