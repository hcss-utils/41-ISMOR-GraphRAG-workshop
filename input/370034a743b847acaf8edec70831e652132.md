The Kosovo experience was an instructive one for Moscow.
In his Kremlin speech on March 18, 2014, Russian President Vladimir Putin cited the "Kosovo precedent -a precedent our Western colleagues created with their own hands in a very similar situation, when they agreed that the unilateral separation of Kosovo from Serbia, exactly what Crimea is doing now, was legitimate."
