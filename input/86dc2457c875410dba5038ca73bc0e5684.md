The case of Libya demonstrates Russia's willingness to step into conflicts from which the US has distanced itself.
With the goal of expanding influence in the Middle East and securing lucrative energy contracts, Moscow could contribute to instability in a region that has long been a top US national security priority.
At a time when the US is perceived as withdrawing from involvement in the Middle East, Russia is demonstrating its ability to step into the vacuum with goals incompatible with both US and NATO policies.
Moscow may be a more attractive partner to some in the region because assistance does not come with the price tag of human rights concerns and intolerance of damage to civilians and infrastructure, tradeoffs of working with the US and NATO.
Russia's weapons sales process also works faster than most Western nations', potentially turning an evenly matched conflict (with more possible opportunities for peaceful negotiation) into a lopsided victory for one side in a matter of weeks.
Russian PMSCs are often the vanguard for involvement in these regions, allowing Moscow to exercise one element of its hybrid warfare strategy while keeping Russian soldiers out of potentially hostile situations.
