Professor Nathan Freier, associate professor of National Security Studies at the Strategic Studies Institute, US Army War College, focuses on defense and military strategy and policy development, and strategic net and risk assessment.
ABSTRACT: Adversaries are actively targeting US and NATO critical infrastructure, particularly energy, transportation, information, communications, and the defense industrial base sectors to undermine military capability, readiness, and force projection.
In some cases, adversaries are penetrating the critical infrastructure of the United States and our allies to identify vulnerabilities for later exploitation, and in others critical infrastructure is being weaponized by Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea as a form of hybrid warfare.
