Regional powers such as China, Russia, and North Korea continue to attempt to increase their influence by expanding and upgrading their military forces.
For example, China maintains the world's largest army and is currently expanding its military budget in order to modernize its armed forces.
Much of China's emphasis remains in the high technology arena including: anti-access and area denial, long range strike and space and information warfare capabilities.
It's surface and submarine fleets recently upgraded its weapon systems to include high-speed torpedoes capable of exceeding 200 knots and the Mach 3, SS-N-22 anti-ship cruise missile which ranges in excess of 125 miles.
Both of these systems could pose a significant threat to the Unites States naval forces operating in the Pacific.
