General European war began in September 1939.
While Britain and France expected another long war of attrition, the German dictator destroyed or intimidated his opponents with a series of quick, decisive victories.
Poland, Norway, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, and France fell to the mechanized blitzkrieg with surprising speed, and Churchill's England barely managed to weather the storm that followed.
Unable to defeat Britain and fearing an eventual Anglo-American coalition in the west, Hitler needed military security in the east and assured supplies of food and raw materials.
To secure this, he launched an invasion of Russia in mid-1941.
Stubborn resistance by both Russia and Britain finally ended the Nazi war of movement and, with the American entrance, turned the struggle into a war of technological attrition in the West and manpower attrition in the East, with Germany the loser.
The Western Allies made up for Gallipoli by a dazzling series of amphibious invasions more reminiscent of Foch's strategy of 1918 than of the indirect approach.
Once the huge Russian armies began rolling in from the steppes, Germany was overwhelmed and Europe divided between American and Soviet spheres of influence.
