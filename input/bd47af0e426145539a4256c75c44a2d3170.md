By 1858 at the Treaty of Aigun, and in 1860, when Russia played the role of go-between in China's Second Opium War with Great Britain and France, China was forced not only into concessions to these two European powers, but also to cede important territory to Russia, its interlocutor.
An unequal treaty with one foreign power normally resulted in "most favored nation" status for all the others involved with China.
During the period 1879 to 1881, two years before its war with France over influence in Vietnam and the East China Sea, the Qing also had a border dispute with Russia in East Turkistan, now the Uygur Autonomous Region of Xinjiang (Sinkiang), called the Ili Crisis.
While territory occupied by Russia was returned, the borders and influence with ethic groups in the west remained fluid, disputed, and periodically contested militarily, not only in Xinjiang, but also in Tibet.
There are territories in the west, ceded to the Tsar at this time, that remain part of the Russia Federation and Central Asian states today.
