-General Mac Schwarte, Technik des Kriegswesens (Leipzig, 1913)   The 2017 Slaughterbots, a film produced by students at the University of California Berkeley, warns of the rapid development of military technologies.
In the film, a fictitious company develops an armed microdrone capable of executing precision strikes against preprogrammed targets utilizing artificial intelligence, facial recognition technologies, and tactical sensors.
In the film, the industrial sponsor of this technology makes the claim that this technology marks the transition to a new age of warfare, making nuclear weapons obsolete as the tiny robots provide a scalable weapon of mass destruction that is precise, effective, efficient, and, most importantly, unstoppable.
1 Although Slaughterbots is a science fiction dystopia intended to propagate anti-autonomous lethal weapons rhetoric, the film illustrates the potential capability of automated weapon system swarms and the effects capable of combining technologies that are currently available for military use.
The concept of using unmanned aerial autonomous weapons to eliminate targets is not only realistic but a reality.
Countries like China, Israel, and Russia currently invest in the research and technology necessary to produce and employ autonomous weapons systems, in particular autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), as part of their military arsenal.
