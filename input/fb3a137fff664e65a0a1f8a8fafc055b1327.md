After Napoleon forced the Austrians in January 1806 to accept his decision to dissolve the Holy Roman Empire, he created the Confederation of the Rhine in July of that same year.
With Prussia and Austria excluded, sixteen German states joined in a military and political union under protection of the French emperor.
All member states received full sovereignty over domestic affairs but a national parliament would formulate foreign policy.
In return for Napoleon's "protection," member states would pay a "blood tax" by supplying forces for his armies, initially 63,000 men annually.
Napoleon succeeded in making the Third Germany a French satellite to better harness its military resources.
This did not sit well with the Prussians, who felt betrayed over the issue of a Prussian-led North German confederation.
