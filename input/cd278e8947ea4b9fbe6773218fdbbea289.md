Napoleon Bonaparte was the central character in the "transformation of war" in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.
It seems extraordinarily trite to say Napoleon was central to Napoleonic warfare, yet the most striking facet of the changing nature of war in this period is how very little Napoleon had to do with it; he initiated very few innovations and, oddly, given his reputation, acted as a brake on change as often as he effected change.
Wherever we look in our taxonomy of change, whether armies, means, costs, superstructure, or relationships, we see the hand of Napoleon; not, as we would think of the "God of War," as innovator, originator, creator, but as implementor, taking the raw material of change and adapting it to his purposes.
Clearly, the transform function was the French Revolution and Napoleon had little part in the transformation; but, as we shall see, his genius was to see the first derivative in this historical calculus.
It took almost a generation for his contemporaries to see what Napoleon had done, reform their own houses and bring his own genius to bear against him.
Of all of Napoleon's adversaries, England, Russia, Austria-Hungary and Prussia, none was more proficient in adapting Napoleonic warfare against Napoleon than Prussia.
It did so by close study and adaptation of the French changes in armies, means, costs and superstructure of war.
