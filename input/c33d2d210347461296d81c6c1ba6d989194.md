These two states are also in different situations in terms of developing and using new weapon technologies to balance U.S. military power, which has had a direct effect on their respective defense strategy implementation.
Recently, both countries announced their weapon systems; his message was directly threatening the United States and NATO, which reveals two setbacks in Russia's position.
First, an arms race and military coercion are the last and only cards Russia can play in the great power competition game.
Second, this show-of-force behavior only causes continuing economic sanctions from the Western countries in order to limit possible Russian threats.
This, in turn, causes a major hindrance to Russian defense strategy implementation since Russia's current national budget is not sufficient to run the SAP.
Additionally, Russia's "Possible First Use" nuclear strategy is in a tense situation after the U.S. administration announced that it would withdraw from the Intermediate Range Nuclear Force treaty, leaving Russia with no other leverage than use of nuclear weapons.
At the same time, China introduced its new weapon systems in a commercial air show, intended to send a message to the United States and other powers that China is not behind, but actually ahead in terms of some technology developments.
