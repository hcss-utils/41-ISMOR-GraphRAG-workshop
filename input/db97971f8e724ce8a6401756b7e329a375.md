The Russian Air Force was an integral part of the campaign plan.
Aircraft conducted reconnaissance, close air support, air superiority missions, and interdiction missions to spoil Georgia's ability to respond militarily.
With the initial phase of operations in South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Russian aircraft attacked airfields east and south of Tbilisi, command and control facilities, and military bases to achieve depth to the operation, attack follow-on echelons, and assist in isolating the battlefield.
