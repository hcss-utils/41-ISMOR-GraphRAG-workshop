After 9/11, and with its denouement in the war in Iraq, this rather good picture has been drastically changed.
Proliferation is now apparent in Iran and North Korea.
The U.S. is at odds with France and Germany, and thus possibly with the EU.
Russia sees its economic future as lying with Europe more than with the U.S., and sided with France and Germany in the UN on the issue of war with Iraq.
The economies of the advanced countries, including that of the U.S., seem to be in trouble.
The al Qaeda threat is widespread, at least for the U.S. and across the Islamic world (but not in Europe, Russia (except in Chechnya), China, Japan).
The world is nervous about the U.S. preemption strategy.
