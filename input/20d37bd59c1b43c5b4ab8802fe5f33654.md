The research to answer these questions was conducted in three steps.
First, we conducted an extensive review of the existing literature on proxy warfare.
Second, we used quantitative analysis to assess trends in and drivers of proxy warfare.
Third, we conducted case studies of three of the major powers that have used proxy warfare over the past several decades-Russia (and the Soviet Union before it), China, and Iran-to determine why they had engaged in proxy warfare and, for the periods in which they had turned away from this instrument of competition, why they stopped such practices.
