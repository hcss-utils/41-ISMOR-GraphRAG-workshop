The author would like to thank Russian researcher Maria Kuchma for her assistance in checking the Russian-language version of the Foreign Ministry's website and confirming that no statement had been issued on China's ADIZ as of 7 December 2013.
Source pointed out by Maria Kuchma "США и их союзники вступили в "войну нервов" с КНР, считает Пушков", Ria Novosti, 8 December 2013, available at http://ria.ru/world/20131208/982757837.html Picture taken from "США и их союзники вступили в "войну нервов" с КНР, считает Пушков", Ria Novosti, 8 December 2013, available at http://ria.ru/world/20131208/982757837.html East Asia, playing off one side against the other, and providing strategic cover for the much needed development of her Far East.
Thus, Moscow may simply have no incentive to enter the debate on China's ADIZ, at least publicly, at this stage.
It is clear, though, that where Russian and Chinese interests have clashed directly, namely in the Arctic, Moscow has drawn a line in the sand.
It is also significant that, while Russian leader Putin may not have publicly addressed the ADIZ controversy, he happened to travel to Vietnam, where he "pledged to expand military supplies to Vietnam, a move that looks set to raise concerns from Beijing as tensions over the South China Sea linger".
According to Zhang Mingliang (an expert on China's relations with South-East Asia from Guangzhou's Jinan University), Beijing probably watched closely any talks on future military cooperation during Putin's visit.
He noted that "Russia has been the biggest supporter of Vietnam in the South China Sea", citing submarine sales and oil development cooperation in waters claimed by China.
