We conclude by presenting our findings as to what the organization of the General Staff reveals about the leadership system that it serves and the balance of power within Russia's national security decisionmaking structure.
We thus discuss the position of the General Staff within the context of the broader Russian national security system, both formally and informally, including why certain concepts and authority structures persist and how the General Staff affected the transformation of the Russian Armed Forces into an effective tool of foreign policy.
Although the network analyses of the individuals involved in Ukraine and Syria lend support to the contention that informal personal networks dominate national security decisionmaking, which is a finding consistent with the literature on Russian informal politics, our research suggests that bureaucratic rules and procedures appear to dominate military decisionmaking.
Moreover, our research suggests that multiple passive and active opportunities exist for the General Staff to influence the Russian decisionmaking process, other than participating in the actual decision to use military force.
Therefore, the formal decisionmaking system of the General Staff appears to uniquely condition the informal decisionmaking system that dominates national security.
We thus propose some tentative conclusions about what the organization of the General Staff reveals about the leadership system it serves.
