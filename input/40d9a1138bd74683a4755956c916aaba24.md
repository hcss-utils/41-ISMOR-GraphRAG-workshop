While some scholars are confident in defining Russia's behavior in Ukraine as hybrid or nonlinear warfare, others are hesitant to offer a distinctive label for Russia's actions.
Michael Kofman and Matthew Rojansky find Russia lacks a specific hybrid warfare doctrine, but instead employs all instruments of national power to attain a strategic advantage.
10 As the U.S. employs diplomacy, information, economics for global influence and to sustain its standing throughout the world, Russia uses the same tools within its own spheres of influence.
Kofman and Rojansky caution policymakers against using the concept of hybrid warfare to describe an evolution of twenty-first century Russian doctrine.
Instead, the authors warn that policymakers should focus on "how to deal with a major power such as Russia when it chooses to employ its full range of national power."
