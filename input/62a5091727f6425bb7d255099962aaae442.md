Since World War II, Russia has, albeit with notable inconsistencies, maintained one of the world's premier ground combat forces.
For most of the Cold War, the Soviet Army was the dominant land force in Europe.
Soviet leaders routinely deployed ground combat forces around the world ranging from small advisory groups to corps-sized land armies.
In many cases, the Soviets were able to secure their lines of communication using large surface and subsurface warfare fleets, long-range air arms, and a network of allied states willing to host Soviet military assets.
Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the Russian military has waned and then waxed.
Operations in the early to mid-1990s were few and disastrous.
The 1994 attack on Grozny, Chechnya, marked a historic low point.
The Second Chechen War, beginning in 1999, marked a turning point.
Operations there, in Georgia, and now in Ukraine and Syria have demonstrated Russian resilience and military power.
