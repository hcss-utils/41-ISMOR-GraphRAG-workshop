A then classified U2 Dragon Lady flew from Peshawar destined for BÃ¸do, Norway, and was to photograph two Russian intercontinental ballistic missile sites enroute.
Both sites were known to be surrounded by heavy anti-aircraft systems.
As the U2 approached Sverdlovsk, flying at 67,000 feet, the Soviets volley-fired 14 SA-2 surface-to-air missiles.
Although the missiles were clearly unable to reach that altitude, "the aircraft disintegrated in the shock waves caused by the exploding missiles."
