Clearly China has gone to great lengths over the past two decades to de-conflict its own strategic doctrine, which is unequivocally based on continuing deterrent relationships vis-Ã -vis its principle adversaries (the US and Russia, and regional rivals India, Taiwan, and Japan), from its declaratory policy, which is based on an interesting amalgam of criticism of nuclear deterrence, selective support of arms control and disarmament mechanisms, and periodic calls, however disingenuous, for complete nuclear disarmament.
The end result appears to have been a doctrine that lies somewhere between existential and minimal nuclear deterrence seasoned by declaratory policy branding deterrence -especially "deterrence based on first-use" -as somehow immoral.
If this were the whole story, then the CPC regime would merit George Orwell's praise for its mastery of what he called "double-think" -the ability to psychologically reconcile two mutually contradictory ideas.
But it is not the whole story.
The following section will take a more in-depth look at how China's view of deterrence has evolved since its acquisition of nuclear weaponsand, therewith, its first "existential" deterrent capability.
