Many scholars classify Russia's actions within Ukraine in 2014 as hybrid warfare since Russia combined both conventional and unconventional warfare to achieve its political objectives.
Frank Hoffman defines hybrid warfare as "any adversary that simultaneously and adaptively employs a fused mixture of conventional weapons, irregular tactics, catastrophic terrorism, and criminal behavior in the battlespace to obtain desired political objectives."
