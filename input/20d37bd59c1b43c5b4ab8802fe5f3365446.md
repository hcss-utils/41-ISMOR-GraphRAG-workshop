There are, therefore, substantial reasons to be concerned that geopolitical factors could motivate an increased interest in proxy warfare on the part of U.S. competitors, and potentially the United States itself.
Beyond the increasing bilateral intensity of competition between key rivals, the international system as a whole may be moving in a direction that makes proxy competition between rivals more feasible and attractive.
During the immediate post-Cold War period, the relative unipolarity of the system went hand in hand with a reduced interest, and reduced opportunities, for other great powers, such as Russia or China, to challenge the United States through proxy warfare.
As the system shifts toward greater multipolarity or, potentially, a renewed bipolar competition with China, other states may feel that they have less to risk and more to gain by challenging U.S. interests through the use of proxy warfare, given the reduced relative position of the United States in the international system.
