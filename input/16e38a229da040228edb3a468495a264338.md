War for evidence of a deliberate Russian effort at experimenting with hybrid warfare, the 217 Svante E. Cornell and S. Frederick Starr, The Guns of August 2008: Russia's War in Georgia (Armonk, N.Y.: M.E. Sharpe, 2009), 5.
The Russian-Georgian War has a number of names including "The Five-Day War" and the "War over South Ossetia."
Even the name of the conflict is part of the ongoing effort by Russians to frame the war in terms that support their narrative, and similarly on the part of the Georgians to paint their side of the conflict as purely defensive.
The August 7th start date is also debated as part of a determined Russian effort to maintain a strategic narrative of being the victim of Georgian aggression.
Coordinated Russian cyber-attacks of Georgian systems began two days before the "start" of the ground war, and the Russian invasion was only possible because the requisite troops had been mobilized and massed on the border well in advance of the shooting.
Russian forces definitely passed through the Roki Tunnel into South Ossetia on August 7th to "reinforce peacekeeping forces."
The Georgian Army later shelled the road in front of this force to prevent them from seizing Tskhinvali.
Russia continues to claim that this shelling was the opening hostile act and that the subsequent Russian offensive on August 8th was necessary to protect Russian peacekeepers and South Ossetian civilians.
