Evaluating the political or military value of missile defenses in current and prospective policy terms requires that we acknowledge new possibilities and new dangers.
Compared to the Cold War era, the United States and Russia now have fewer deployed long-range nuclear offensive weapons.
In addition, missile defense technologies are of interest not only to the United States and potentially Russia, but also to other states that feel threatened by the spread of ballistic missiles outside of Europe.
For example, Japan-although its government would prefer neither to join the ranks of nuclear weapons states nor to enter into a regional nuclear arms race-is nevertheless very interested in missile defenses.
Japan is already cooperating with the United States in developing and deploying theater missile defenses for its state territory and contiguous waters.
This stance is not unreasonable from Japan's perspective, considering its proximity to North Korea, China, and other Asian nuclear powers.
Missile defenses might provide an alternative "deterrent by denial" for countries like Japan or South Korea instead of a nuclear deterrent by threat of STRATEGIC STUDIES QUARTERLY â™¦ FALL 201 3 [75]  unacceptable second-strike retaliation.
Such defenses could also serve as an insurance policy against accidental launches or unauthorized rogue attacks.
