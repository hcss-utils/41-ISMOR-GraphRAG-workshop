One of the central questions in the debate about Russian "new-type" warfare is, "is Ukraine unique?"
This question is a side issue, and it does not matter whether Ukraine is unique if the actual problem is whether Russia can achieve its goals without having to conquer territory.
If this is the case, then the most critical part of the whole concept of hybrid war or NTW is the first stage, the so-called preparation phase for later stages.
What does make Ukraine unique is that stage one was already built-in due to Soviet history, and that goes to emphasize the relevancy of Russia dominating the first stage of a conflict.
