Such comparisons are not wholly informative about investments into social media-based information warfare in large part because, in contrast to Russia, the United States does not involve any such resources in offensive social media efforts.
Nonetheless, the disparities in cyber and psychological resources likely do affect Russian perceptions of those capabilities.
There is evidence that, whatever the facts of the matter, Russia perceives its information-warfare arsenal generally to be smaller than those of other states and those of the United States in particular.
For example, a Russian information security company, which lists the defense ministry as a client, published a report that said that the U.S. cyberoperators who are engaged in information warfare, cyberattacks, and espionage outnumbered Russia's by nine to one.
