The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 emanating from Berlin, and it seemed as if Russia's allies might prefer talking the issue to death than act.
Once again, Russia promised to come to Serbia's defense but backing down as it had done in 1909 was not an option this time.
Russia's prestige, indeed its very status as a Great Power, was on the line.
This time, Russia would force the issue-declaring mobilization and setting its armies in motion towards the Austrian border.
But not merely the Austrian border: Russian troops were also pouring into Poland and the Baltic littorals, heading towards the frontier with the real enemy, the foe who had blocked Russian advancement at every turn for the past forty years: Germany.
In that sense, German-Russian strategic rivalry was the real and proximate cause of World War I.
