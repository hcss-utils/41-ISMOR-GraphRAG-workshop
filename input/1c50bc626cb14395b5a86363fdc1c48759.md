Admit:'dly, modifying America's military system to partially duplicate that of Prussia will be require some serious overhauling and will be painfully slow.
In the case of the flowthrough system, for example, there will be a need to begin at the lowest levels of the officer and enlisted personnel structure.
and it will be years before these soldiers move on to positions of greater responsibility in the reserves.
Filling the reserves' mid-level and senior-level positions with soldiers who have active duty experience is possible.
but not immediately easy.
Attrition would be the only equitable way to accomplish this.
and care must be taken to insure that reservists who lack active duty experience are given a fair opportunity to advance their careers as well.
Career programs may well have to be redone.
for Reservists and Guardsmen in particular.
All of this will take a great deal of time and this points out the fact that even a partial adoption of the Prussian model should be considered a long-range planning goal.
