Sun Tzu's philosophy of warfare and strategic thought provide an excellent lens with which to view and analyze the strategic advantage gained by Russia through its use of hybrid and nonlinear warfare in Ukraine.
To appreciate this analysis, one must first understand certain key concepts foreign to Western ways of thinking.
In his book, Deciphering Sun Tzu: How to Read the Art of War, Derek Yuen provides an in-depth analysis of Sun Tzu's theory of warfare and Chinese strategic thought.
Yuen's analysis of Sun Tzu exposes the Western reader to a unique perspective reflecting the cultural and historical nuances of Chinese culture and strategic thought.
Likewise, in his introduction to his translation of Sun Tzu: The Art of Warfare, Roger Ames provides a philosophical overview of the key concepts behind Sun Tzu's work.
Most appropriate to the Russo-Ukrainian War is Sun Tzu's writings about gaining the strategic advantage over an adversary through nonmilitary means without fighting.
Ames' analysis of Sun Tzu's writings identifies Sun Tzu's concept of shih, or strategic advantage, as the fundamental basis of Sun Tzu's theory woven throughout the text.
