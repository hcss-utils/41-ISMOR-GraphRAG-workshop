Overall, the analysis of the OCO in the Russo-Georgian War found several key inferences within the analytical framework built from the Chekinov-Bogdanov commentaries: concealment of operations, adjust public opinion, destabilization of social situations, complicate rules and customs of war.
The researcher's labeling of objectives as key inferences does not indicate complexity, scope, or success.
It is only intended to highlight that OCO supports these generalized objectives, even in a rudimentary and unsophisticated manner.
