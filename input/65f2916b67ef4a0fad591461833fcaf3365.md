Greece's diplomatic relations with Russia are friendly while Romania's scarred relationship with Russia still needs to heal.
Romania's December 1989 revolution ended 45 years of communism under the influence of the Soviet bloc.
Due to Russia's relatively more robust economy and stronger military resources, its relations with Greece and Romania are highly unbalanced, and this will likely continue as Russia pursues its national interest in maintaining its post-soviet bloc spheres of influence.
As such, Russia perceives any NATO expansion as a threat to its interests.
Within this context, this thesis has analyzed Russian influence in the Romanian and Greek energy sectors with the goal of identifying courses of actions that these countries can take to prevent Russia from exerting control over their respective energy sectors.
