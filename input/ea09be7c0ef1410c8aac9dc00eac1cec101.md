As Russian actions in Crimea are discussed here, it is important to bear in mind that many of the actions taken by Russia were possible because of distinct characteristics that exist in Crimea.
In other words, Russia's actions in Crimea do not represent a generic model of hybrid warfare that are applicable in other situations.
In fact, critics of many Western definitions of hybrid threat often note that the current depictions fail to understand that conditions that are unique to each conflict.
The successful pursuit of Russian objectives in Crimea were aided by a largely pro-Russian civilian population, the presence of Russian military installations on the Russian disposition among many in the target population, and would not produce the same results in different contexts where pro-Russian sentiment was less certain.
