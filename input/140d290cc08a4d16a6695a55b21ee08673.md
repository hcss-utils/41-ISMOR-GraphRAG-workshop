Protestors took control of the regional administration building and demanded an annexation referendum in Luhansk on March 9.
By March 10, local Ukrainian police regained control of the captured administration buildings and arrested separatist leaders and supporters.
The arrest of the local political figurehead separatist leaders allowed individuals with links to Russian security services, military experience, and Russian associations and businesses to assume control of the protest movement and shift the focus away from politics to insurgency.
From April 6 to 23, armed separatist groups seized administrative and state security buildings in the Donetsk and Luhansk Oblasts.
Ukrainian military operations to contain the separatists initially faltered as the separatists received short-range air defense systems from Russia and as Ukraine diverted a majority of its forces to react to the 40,000 Russian forces amassed on Ukraine's border with Russia.4 9F
