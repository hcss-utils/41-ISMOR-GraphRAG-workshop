The time for the US military to develop ways to offset an adversary's technological advantage by employing and defending against swarming autonomous UAVs is now.
The technologies to conduct swarm attacks already exist and could pose significant challenges in the very near future.
This technology is cheap and available to many non-state actors as well as state adversaries that could employ a swarm of autonomous UAVs against any US formation overseas or over a populated area within the United States homeland.
These attacks, similar to the January 2018 Syrian rebel drone attack against a Russian airbase in Syria, could potentially constitute high yield, low risk operations that would significantly alter the balance of technological superiority traditionally held by the US military.
