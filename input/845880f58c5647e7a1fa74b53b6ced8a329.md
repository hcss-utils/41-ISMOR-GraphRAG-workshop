In contrast to the expansionists, the American business community appears to have had little interest in colonies, especially in the Far East, prior to the Spanish-American War.
However, the confluence of two events in 1898 led to a radical shift in business opinion.
First was the heating up of European efforts to carve up China.
In late 1897 Germany seized the Chinese port of Tsingtau and by January of 1898 China had agreed to cede the port and rights to economic development in the surrounding area to Germany.
Russian warships then entered Port Arthur, and by May 1898 China had agreed to cede territory in the Lia ´oding peninsula to Russia.
It now looked as though America was in danger of being excluded from the China trade by the European powers.
The China trade was then a small part of America's foreign trade, but one could imagine that it could be important in the future, provided the door to China was kept open.
True, in the end the China trade proved to be more myth than reality
