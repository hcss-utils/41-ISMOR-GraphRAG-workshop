A ndrew Monaghan suggests "the war in Ukraine has refocused Western attention on Russia and its ability to project power, particularly in terms of 'hybrid warfare' " (65).
Using the label "hybrid" in fact could result in overlooking the evolution of Russian military thinking, which contemplates "the increasingly prominent role of conventional force, including the use of high intensity firepower, in Russian warfighting capabilities" (65).
As a consequence, the author warns that "NATO as a whole, and even the US itself cannot rely on the automatic assumption that it would win a conventional war" and suggests recalibrating away "from Hybrid warfare to mobilization" (74, 65).
State mobilization, or mobilizatsiya, is a concept included in the military doctrine of the Russian Federation (2014) referring to measures for activating resources and capabilities in order to achieve political aims.
According to Monaghan, mobilization provides a "more flexible understanding of how the Russian leadership might view how that war might be fought and won."
