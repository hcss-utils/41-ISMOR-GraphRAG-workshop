The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 fragile any treaty relationship is if it crosses paths with strategic realities.
The original ruler of Bulgaria, Knyaz (Prince) Alexander of Battenberg, was a cousin of Alexander III and an officer in the Russian army.
His reign thus seemed to fulfill the promise of Russian primacy in the new state.
In 1885, however, after an uprising in Eastern Rumelia, the separated principality declared union with the mother country, and the Grand National Assembly of the new enlarged Bulgaria broke with Russia and forced Alexander's abdication.
Eventually, the Assembly offered the throne to another German prince, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a figure with close familial ties to the western dynasties.
Now Russia's humiliation from 1878-79 was complete, as its one legitimate gain from the war with Turkey had apparently slipped through its fingers.
