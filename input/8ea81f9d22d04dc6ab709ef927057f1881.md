The Persian Gulf War does demonstrate, nevertheless, that conflicts based on overt military aggression against states in the international system in which the United States has a vital interest are still possible and cannot be dismissed altogether.
The oft-cited example of North Korean aggression against South Korea is used in the DoD reports as a scenario to illustrate the need for the United States to intervene militarily outside the Middle East.
The Middle East and Korean examples, however, exhaust the population of plausible examples that can be currently cited to support this scenario.
In contrast, the prospect is raised repeatedly that Moscow's desire to establish a slightly smaller version of the former Soviet Union by intervening militarily against other former Soviet republics in the "near-abroad" will be a likely source of conflict in the foreseeable future.
1~5 However disruptive such a move would be to Russia's bilateral relations with the United States, Washington would not intervene militarily because of a lack of palpable vital interests, and its concerns over the escalation in fighting that would result from a commitment of US forcesY 6 Contemporary and future trends of conflict in world affairs indicate that a scenario based on overt military regional aggression that imperils US vital interests should be regarded as a "lesser-included" scenario in which to assess the capability requirements of US forces.
