What was Russia's approach to the use of cannon artillery in 2016?
phase IV stability operations began, artillery became less and less important.
Depending on which Regional Command in Afghanistan a unit was serving, cannon artillery may or may not have been used to great extent.
If artillery was employed, it was most likely as counterfire in reaction to incoming rockets or mortars.
In contrast, the Russian military was involved in three regional conflicts since 2000: Chechnya, Georgia, and Ukraine.
In each of these conflicts, Russia used cannon artillery consistently.
While the skills of the U.S. army artillery began to diminish due to lack of use, the Russian artillery's skills improved.
Therefore, it begs the question, what was Russia's approach to the use of cannon artillery in 2000 compared to 2016?
Through analysis of the Second Chechen War, the Russo-Georgian War, and the Ukraine conflict, this thesis will strive to answer those questions.
