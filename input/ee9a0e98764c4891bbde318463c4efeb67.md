Continuing Russian military provocations in northeastern Europe, Moscow's efforts to undermine democracy and intergovernmental institutions, foreign fighters from the Islamic State, China's increasingly exploitative behavior in Europe, and waves of migrants from Africa and the Middle East, however, threaten Europe's stability and security and hence American vital interests.
Magnifying these challenges is the economic disaster generated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which is likely to be the worst global contraction since the Great Depression.
This brief article will unpack for policymakers what these challenges may mean for transatlantic security in the coming two to four years.
To accomplish this, the article will first outline the current state of play in European security arguing a kind of equilibrium has been achieved over the last two years, in contrast with the mid-2010s when the European security environment was in great flux.
Nonetheless, as the second section of this article points out, several ongoing and emerging challenges combined to create an unsteadiness in European security at the beginning of this new decade.
Whether those challenges remain relatively manageable or erupt into crises will depend on the primary drivers of security in Europe, which are identified in the third section of this article.
Finally, the article outlines potential alternative short-term futures in Europe, drawing out some prospective outcomes and implications.
