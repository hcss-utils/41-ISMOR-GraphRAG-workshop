Finally, stable economic growth from the end of the last century gave momentum to both countries to increase their economic and military powers.
Yet, because Russia's economic improvement was largely dependent on energy export revenue, after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014, other countries have been able to impose sanctions that caused serious problems for the implementation of Russia's defense strategy.
On the other hand, China developed its economy via high levels of manufacturing, which leads to more development by building infrastructure, increasing the number of consumers, and creating services.
This development allows China to be economically independent, making other countries dependent on China's economy, thereby permitting China to increase its military power more independently than Russia.
