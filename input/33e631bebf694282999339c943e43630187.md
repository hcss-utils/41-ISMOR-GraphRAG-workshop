One possible future source of conflict between Norway and Russia is the northern areas and its rich natural resources, oil, gas, and fish, respectively, which affects the economy of the two countries significantly.
Indeed, petroleum products, fisheries, and ocean farming is the primary source of Norway's current wealth and standard of living (Jacobsen 2008).
Additionally, one of the richest areas when it comes to oil, gas, and fish is the Barents Sea, in which Norway and Russia still have an unresolved dispute concerning where the border between the two countries' maritime economic zones should go.
The recently discovered Shtokman Field, situated in the Russian sector of the Barents Sea, holds crude oil and natural gas of strategic significance to Gazprom, the Russian company that holds the rights to extract the oil and gas.
Indeed, one of Norway's largest companies in the oil industry, Statoil Hydro, is involved in the Shtokman project, from which Gazprom's goal is to extract approximately the same amount of gas per year as the annual total amount of Norwegian gas production (Gazprom 2006).
