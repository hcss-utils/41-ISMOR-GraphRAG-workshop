The Europe of the future will need the leadership of the sole remaining world power: the United States of America.
Without the leadership of an overseas and non-partisan power, NATO would lose its ability to act, because the West European partners' national interests would get in the way.
Europe would then lose the only functioning security system capable of filling the existing power vacuum in East Central Europe.
Given recent events in Russia, the absence of the United States and NATO would again make Europe vulnerable to political developments that might result in a "Second Cold War."
