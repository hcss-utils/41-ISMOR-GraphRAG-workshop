# Database: Google Scholar

# Fulltext:
Since August 2008, Russia has increased the use of soft power tactics in Georgia.
Disinformation, propaganda, and fake news have become part of the everyday narrative spread by Russian media. Many scholars have studied Russian soft power and concluded that it mainly targeted Georgia after that country's strong intention toward integration with the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). Russia's aim was to alter public opinion of Georgia and threaten the country's image in the international society. However, one vulnerable region in northeastern Georgia has not received much attention. This study takes a closer look at Pankisi Gorge, a valley that borders Russia's breakaway republic of Chechnya and populated mostly with ethnic Kists of the Islamic faith. Through the analysis of Russian media stories about Pankisi, this thesis finds that the valley is often presented as a "nest of terrorism," creating a false sense of threat in the entire region. Additionally, this thesis discusses how Russia can destabilize Pankisi through fake news and actually use the situation for its possible military intervention in Georgia. v
Russia actively uses tactics such as disseminating false statements that cause fear as well as manipulating social opinion to influence important processes. This is deliberately conducted through fake news, distorted facts, and falsification of history.
Many times, they combine these methods with the use military force to intimidate their adversaries, creating a hybrid-warfare model. Used in tandem, these methods polarize the population, which challenges a country's security and integrity. Specifically, in August 2008, during the Russian-Georgian military conflict in South Ossetia, Georgia, became a test ground for Russia's use of hybrid warfare tactics, from increasing military presence to cyber-attacks, disinformation, and propaganda.
Russia blocked the websites of the Georgian government, as well as spread false information about Georgia's activities during the conflict, with the goal of undermining the country's international image. This thesis examines Russia's use of hybrid warfare techniques in Georgia, specifically in Pankisi Gorge, as an example to demonstrate how well-planned disinformation and propaganda campaigns can engender instability in a country and how targeted messages related to certain Georgian regions can cause serious damage to a country's international image. The research contributes to understanding Russia's policy and hybrid warfare techniques. It can also help to provide the Georgian government with a specific, complex, and systemic approach to the problem of Russia's hybrid warfare, with an emphasis on methods and strategies used in Pankisi Gorge against the ethnic minorities. The case study in this thesis includes analysis and demonstrates challenges that might be interesting for representatives of the security sectors not only in Georgia but in other countries that face similar problems. It provides an excellent opportunity for the interested audience to observe the situation on the ground, analyze the best practices and the mistakes made by Georgia, so that others can avoid similar problems in their own countries.
2019, over 33 fighters from Pankisi have died in Syria, including some well-known terrorist figures such as the key commander of the Islamic State, Omar al-Shishani. News stories about Pankisi Gorge and terrorism have covered local and international media.
The image of the nest of terrorism, combined with the high unemployment rate, and the challenges of integration cause a lot of frustration among locals in Pankisi Gorge and make it a region vulnerable to destabilization. Russia capitalizes on this fragile situation in part by spreading disinformation, and creates a basis for future justification of its possible intervention in Georgia through Pankisi Gorge.
In addition to the introduction, this thesis consists of a literature review, presented in Chapter II, and four additional chapters. Chapter III offers a general overview of the country of Georgia and Pankisi Gorge. Chapter IV analyzes Russia's use of hybrid warfare against Pankisi and the country as a whole. The methodology and results of content analysis are presented in Chapter V. Finally, Chapter VI looks into the possibility of Russia using instability for its national imperialistic interests and influence expansion throughout Georgia and the region as a whole.
In the 21st century, propaganda, disinformation, cyber-attacks, and special forces have become part of war, blurring the lines of traditional warfare. A number of scholars, most notably, Frank Hoffman, now characterize several past military conflicts as examples of hybrid warfare. In 2007, Hoffman analyzed the complicated nature of modern conflicts and concluded that contingencies in the future would be hybrid threats aimed at the country's vulnerabilities.

Based on analysis of ancient and more recent wars, Peter R. Mansoor writes that hybrid warfare did not begin with more modern conflicts. The Helot uprising in the war between Athens and Sparta added "irregular dimension to the conventional conflict" because Spartans did not have any experience with Helots, felt uneasy, and made mistakes.

A number of researchers such as Tracey German, James K. Wither, and Greg Simons, argue that the goal of the Russian Federation in the post-Soviet region, including Georgia, is to preserve and increase its influence, while limiting the reach of any foreign country or military alliance.

These studies are built on the assumption that Russia uses traditional warfare methods together with irregular activities, such as propaganda, disinformation, and cyber warfare, to increase its influence and gain more power, as well as alter public opinion in these countries. The entire post-Soviet zone represents a vital element for the Kremlin's security and political/economic interests. For the Russian Federation, the Southern Caucasus embodies a buffer zone, where limiting the influence of any foreign power will guarantee the security in the Northern Caucasus. Additionally, the Southern Caucasus could serve as an alternative route for energy and goods to European countries and attaining control over this region will be necessary for Russia to preserve and broaden its energy markets.
To achieve all the aforementioned goals, Russia is using the methods described as hybrid warfare.
The subject of hybrid warfare has received even more attention since Russia initiated its occupation of Crimea in 2014. A number of scholars such as András Rácz, James K. Wither, Mehmet Seyfettin, and Safak Oguz have analyzed the case and discuss the different methods that Russia has used against Ukraine. Wither, a professor and a retired British army officer, wrote that in 2014 Russia's techniques against Ukraine were a mix of conventional and irregular methods, and "sponsorship of political protests, economic coercion, cyber operations and, in particular, an intense disinformation campaign."

Several Georgian authors, such as Otarashvili, Menabde and Lomtadze agree that Georgia is of a particular interest to Russia, because of its history, geopolitical location, and its aspirations to join the NATO and the EU. Russia advocates its national interests in the Black Sea-Caucasus region partially by consistent expansion of its military presence in the area.

Georgia is located in the South Caucasus, between the Black and Caspian seas, on the crossroads of Europe and Asia. Situated on a strategically important region, its neighbors include Russia, Turkey, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. With a population of a little over 4 million people, Georgia's native language is Georgian, which dates back to the fifth century.

As the Soviet Union collapsed, Abkhazians took part in the Soviet referendum of 1991 on whether to preserve the unity of the USSR, despite the fact that the government in Georgia's capital Tbilisi forbade the citizens to participate in such referendums.

In 2006, Georgia demanded Russia remove its troops from South Ossetia, another separatist region in South-Central Georgia; the troops had been based there since 1991. In 1989 South Ossetia "lobbied for joining its territory with North Ossetia in Russia or for independence." 
60
Also in 2006, separatists from South Ossetia reported that over 99% of voters voted for independence from Georgia in a referendum.

In August of 2008, President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili sent troops to South Ossetia, a move which was followed by Russia's air strikes.

In November 1990, the general national assembly was held the city of Grozny, where "The National Congress" was elected under the leadership of Soviet Air Forces general Jokhar Dudayev. In September 1991, the congress declared the independence of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria (ChRI). In the elections held on October 27, 1991, J.
Dudayev was elected as president with 90% of the vote while the local government assigned by the official Moscow was declared illegal. It is claimed that the idea of fighting for independence based on Chechen ethnicity/nationality is related to J.
Dudayev's name.

took place in 1999-2000 and was completed in March 2000 by taking the city of Grozny.
In those years, Russia actively created a narrative about Chechens as terrorists and still continues to do so in Pankisi Gorge. 
75
Instead, as the second Russian-Chechnian war escalated in late 1999, Georgia allowed Chechen refugees and rebels to settle in Pankisi Gorge as long as they remained peaceful.

Home to a Muslim minority, Pankisi Gorge is located in Eastern Georgia, in Kakheti region. Spread of Islam in this region has its cultural and historic prerequisites.
Before Chechen refugees came to Pankisi, the population here was mainly Christian.

Niklas Nilsson considers Georgia an interesting case study for Russia's use of hybrid warfare. Since its declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Georgia has often become a subject of Russia's various tactics.

Apart from military activities, there are the diplomatic and economic tactics that Russia uses against Georgia to pressure the government and influence the decisionmaking process.  Russian officials such as then Prime Minister Medvedev. In 2018, Burjanadze appeared on Russia's state TV channel and said that joining NATO would be "bad for Georgia"; instead, the priority should be a direct dialogue with Russia. She also mentioned that 108 Kapanadze, "Georgia's Vulnerability," 5. 109 Nilsson, "Russian Hybrid Tactics in Georgia," 37. 110 Giorgi Kvelashvili, "Russian Leader Meets Burjanadze: What Is on Putin's Mind?"

Georgia wanted to form a friendly relationship with the United States in exchange for ruining connections with Russia, and doing so was a big mistake.

In addition, the Georgian Orthodox Church is considered a large player in Russia's soft power activities. Markozashvili and Dvalishvili discuss that Russia implements its soft power tactics primarily in the societal and cultural spheres. The latter is developed around the church. Those who want Georgia to form a better relationship with Russia, instead of following a pro-Western direction, often identify the same religion as a main argument for closer alignment with Russia.

One of the central priorities of the Russian information narrative is to cultivate anti-Turkish sentiments in Georgia. Turkey is portrayed as occupying Georgia's ancestral lands, and carries out aggressive economic expansion. In accordance with the narrative, the Turkish threat will further rise in the case of Georgia's integration to NATO.

According to James K. Wither, one of the most successful methods that Russia used against Ukraine in 2014 was information warfare. As he writes, "Broader media 130 Markozashvili and Dvalishvili, "Russian Smart Power in Georgia," 183.

It mainly depends on the psychological aspect of information that helps to shape individual and collective ideas. In other words, using such methods creates and alters public opinion. 
135
News media, both Russian and Georgian, play the primary role in spreading As for the term disinformation, I used the following definition: purposeful spread of false information that is intended to mislead the public.

The content analysis allowed us to identify sources and narratives in two types of Russian media outlets that are the most accessible to the Georgian population. The content analysis is divided in two parts: qualitative and quantitative. The quantitative section includes the number and type of stories that contain at least one piece of disinformation, as well as which media outlet published highest number of such stories. The qualitative section deals with themes and narratives most common in Russian stories about Pankisi Gorge that contain disinformation, and the section identifies the authors of those narratives.
Through the targeted keyword search, I identified and analyzed 101 news stories in online and broadcast media. Out of those, the majority, 89 stories, were published in the form of online news, articles, or interviews, while 12 were published as broadcast stories. The analysis showed that out of 101 stories, 54 contained at least one piece of disinformation about Pankisi Gorge. And 47 stories did not have false information about the region or the events that took place there. As for the type of media, 11 out of 12 broadcast stories spread disinformation, while about half of the online content had false information or distorted facts.
Twelve stories (about 22%) with disinformation were published on Kavkazoved.info. The media outlet was founded by Russia in Abkhaziathe northwestern region in Georgia that the country has declared occupied by Russia.

section "the information presented on the site will be interesting and useful not only for scientists specializing in the study of the Caucasus, but also for everyone who is interested in this topic." 142 Alexander Borisovich Krylov is the president of Kavkazoved.

He has been very much interested in Georgian-Abkhazian relations and has written a couple of articles on the topic. In one of his articles he says that it is part of Georgian propaganda to blame Russia for escalating military conflict in Abkhazia. 
143
The next media outlet with the highest number of stories that contain disinformation was Topwar.ru (Voennoye Obozreniye). The online publication was founded in 2012 and has been publishing stories and analytical articles about military affairs, military conflicts, geopolitics, and weapons. 145 (See Figure

The analysis showed that themes of Russia's propaganda and disinformation campaign in Pankisi Gorge are different from the rest of the country. Throughout Georgia, Russia focuses on common religion and history and anti-Western ideology.
While when it comes to Pankisi Gorge, Russia tries to create the image of a lawless, extremist region where terrorists are trained and where the Georgian government has no power. The disinformation campaign is focused on portraying the locals as terrorists, strengthening the stereotypes, causing frustration among the residents of the valley, and creating destabilization. To achieve the goal, Russia actively uses the fact that youth from Pankisi Gorge have gone to fight with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). While such cases have happened, the number is not on the rise. The analysis shows that Russian media outlets falsify facts, use exaggerated data, and even mistranslate interviews to present Pankisi Gorge as a shelter and transit place for terrorists. In such stories, authors or sources often say that Pankisi Gorge poses a threat not only for Georgia, but for Russia and the entire region as well, to show that the two countries have to deal with the danger by cooperating with each other. There were four main narratives that the majority of stories spread. One is that terrorists have always been hiding in Pankisi Gorge and that there are training camps in the valley. Another is that Pankisi Gorge is an isolated, closed region where people do not speak Georgian and it is dangerous to walk without a local guide. The third narrative is that the valley poses a threat for Russia as well, because terrorists residing there can cross the border and attempt attacks on Russian territory. And lastly, there is the narrative that the EU, the United States, or Georgia's neighboring countries such as Turkey will not take action if the situation in Pankisi Gorge deteriorates. Georgia could only hope for Russia's help and cooperation in the fight against terrorism.

In 2003, Channel One, Russian government-controlled television, which has over 250 million viewers, said that Algerians arrested in Britain for making a deadly poison Ricin were trained in Pankisi Gorge.

156
Allegations continued in the following years. 
A couple of stories published in Russian media followed the narrative that Pankisi
Gorge is an isolated, closed community where people do not speak Georgian and where others should not go without a local guide. Such a narrative contributes to creating the image of Pankisi as a separate and marginalized region of Georgia, creating more frustration among the locals who have been trying to overcome the stereotypes for years.
In 2016, a state-owned TV channel Russia 24 published a 17-minute special video report about Pankisi Gorge with the following headline: "The Pankisi Syndrome." This news story is a perfect example of mixing disinformation with truth. In the beginning of the video, the author says that Pankisi has become a peaceful region where people do not move around with weapons anymore. But later in the story the journalist says that there is not a single hotel or restaurant in the valley. One of the most popular hotels "Nazy's
Guesthouse" was renovated in 2012-2013 and already existed when Russia 24 made the story in 2016. 
170
Other media outlets continued a similar narrative in the following years. A more recent story from May 2019 published on Lenta.ru had the following headline for the news about Chechens' protest against the dam being built in Pankisi: "Pankisi Invasion:
This Georgian gorge is called the 'home of terrorists.' Here according to their laws, Chechens live." 
178
Gorge is a closed community where strangers are not welcome and most people do not speak Georgian. 
179
Another story from Topwar.ru has the following headline: "A Problem for Russia or Georgia." The headline itself suggests that Pankisi Gorge can pose a threat to Russia.
The analytical article was also published after Lavrov's allegations and discusses the possibility of a terrorist camp in Pankisi Gorge. The author claims that South Ossetian officials are worried that terrorists would easily cross the border and organize attacks in their region. As the author says, "by Georgian standards, the border is securely guarded.
This means that everyone will pass."  In 2009, when the director of the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB)
Alexander Bortnikov made allegations that terrorists were moving from Georgia to the Northern Caucasus, the expert Mamuka Areshidze said that this statement had a message for the future. As he told Radio Free Liberty:
All the crossings and passes on the perimeter of the entire Caucasus are occupied by the Russianseven those that used to be either jointly that 'something is happening' theoretically means that they have the right to use force." 211
More experts talked about the possible military interventions in the years that followed. In 2018, colonel of the Security Reserve, Beso Aladashvili, said in an interview with a Georgian magazine Tbiliselebi that Russia is interested in Pankisi Gorge to move military operations from its territory to Georgia. Therefore, the issue of terrorists and militants is a continuous topic of discussion for them. Alasashvili thinks that it is important for Georgia to have close diplomatic ties with the United States and Turkey, to create defensive mechanisms for the prevention of Russia's intervention. 
212
213
To sum up, the experts who have commented on the issue throughout the years agree on one thing: Russia can use destabilization in Pankisi Gorge to intervene in Georgia and justify its actions alleging a terrorism threat is coming from the valley.
The study has provided an insight into Russia's use of hybrid warfare in Georgia, specifically its disinformation campaign against Pankisi Gorge. This campaign is carefully tailored and specific to the region's social, economic, ideological, and geopolitical context. A small region inhabited by a Muslim minority that struggles with religious extremism and borders Russia has become a perfect target. for more independent media outlets, their content was a mix of disinformation and truthful facts. But even when they published factual information, the context was still often focused on terrorism. In total there were only a couple of news stories in which Pankisi was not mentioned in connection with terrorists, extremists, or the Islamic State.
In the more recent past, Russia has focused on the issue of young locals that left Pankisi Gorge to fight with ISIS in Syria. Even though, Georgian officials said that the number of such fighters was not alarming, and it was, in fact, on the decline in recent years, Russian media sources claimed that Pankisi has become a huge contributor of fighters to ISIS. "A factory of terrorists", "a nest of terrorism," and "regional threat" are some of the descriptions that Russian media outlets have repeatedly used in headlines for stories about Pankisi Gorge. They have emphasized that the region poses a threat not only for Georgia, but for Russia, as terrorists would be able to cross the border, go to Russia, and organize attacks there. Therefore, it is a common threat for both countries and they should act in cooperation. According to the Russian narrative, other neighboring countries such as Turkey will not be able to help Georgia in the fight against terrorism, and Russia is the only nation that can solve the issue. Such a narrative serves to strengthen the stereotype that Russia is Georgia's saviorjust as it was believed in the 18th century when King Erekle II of Eastern Georgia signed the document with Russia that allowed Georgia to keep its territorial integrity.
Another important issue that Russian media outlets have covered is why youth from Pankisi Gorge might be drawn to ISIS. The authors of these news stories discuss unemployment, lack of educational opportunities, and the rise of
Wahhabismsomething that Georgian scholars name as contributing factors as well. But
Russian media outlets also wrongfully present Pankisi Gorge as an "isolated," "closed,"
"dull" community, where "foreigners should not move around without a local guide" and where most people do not speak Georgian. Even though Pankisi Gorge has issues of integration, it is definitely not a closed or isolated region that strives for autonomy.
Instead, it is a peaceful region where locals work to overcome the stereotypes that have been firmly established in Georgian and international society.
The existing image of Pankisi Gorge makes it more difficult for locals to attract tourists or foreign investors that would contribute to the improvement of the economy in the valley and ensure a better quality of life. Because of its natural beauty and proximity to the capital, Pankisi Gorge has a great potential for tourism. But, because of its image, tourism in Pankisi Gorge has developed more slowly than in the rest of Georgia, then the United States declared that even though there was a legitimate threat coming from Pankisi, it did not justify Russia' intervention in any way.
The majority of experts think that military intervention through Pankisi Gorge to Georgia is the most likely scenario. Russia could easily send groups of people into the region to create provocations. Their actions would be covered in Russian media outlets that have already presented Pankisi Gorge as a terrorism threat. Russia already has increased military presence throughout the country, especially in Abkhazia and South
Ossetia. Considering Pankisi's proximity to Russia's border, it would not be difficult for that country to bring in additional forces. Because of its intensive disinformation campaign, the Kremlin would have enough of a basis to call Russia's intervention in Georgia an "anti-terrorist operation."
The same year Russian tourists spent over $700 million in Georgia. In total, last year Georgia received $1.6 million from Russian tourists, money transfers, and the export of goods, which equals to over 9% of the country's gross domestic product (GDP). Nilsson argues that such dependence makes Georgia vulnerable to economic sanctions. For example, if Russia puts a ban on Georgian products, many local farmers would suffer from the consequences.

In its disinformation campaign, Russia often mentions that Pankisi Gorge is not just Georgia's problem and that the valley poses a threat to Russia and the entire surrounding region as well. This narrative serves to create an impression in international as well as local societies that Russia is in danger from terrorists operating in Pankisi Gorge because they can cross the border and organize terrorist attacks in Russia.
Therefore, if Russia decides to violate Pankisi's territorial integrity, there is a chance the government would try to justify the intervention through the high risk of terrorist attacks that would otherwise harm Russia.
In 2012 Topwar.ru published an interview with the former special envoy of the Chechen separatists in Georgia, Khizri Aldamov. He spoke about possible anti-Russian projects that Georgia's then president, Mikheil Saakashvili, was preparing. One was to create "the government of Ichkeria in exile" with the support of the United States and the second, to continue the activities of the Jamaat terrorist group from Pankisi Gorge. As Aldamov said, "in general, the problem is that the whole of Georgia since the collapse of 180 Antidze, "Панкисское нашествие: Это грузинское ущелье называют «логовом террористов.

The evidence strongly suggests that Russia is highly interested in Pankisi Gorge and is actively using disinformation and propaganda to spread a false narrative about the especially considering the fact that Russian tourists comprise a significant portion of foreign visitors to Georgia. In 2018 there were more than 1.4 million Russian tourists in Georgia and they spent over 1.8 billion Lari.

The stereotypes about Pankisi Gorge being a place of transit and shelter for terrorists, as well as a closed and isolated community, creates a lot of frustration among locals, especially the youth. They often have to prove that the region does not pose any threat to the country, it does not harbor terrorists, and that people living there are not "others." 215 As a result, locals feel marginalized and detached from the society and that leads to more frustration. Many families from the area have gone to Europe in search of a better life, especially after Georgia got a visa-free regime to Schengen countries in March 2017.
