These prohibitions are still subject to exceptions and reinterpretations based on specific and contingent notions of military necessity, just as they were in Sherman's time, and the ability to enforce them or punish those who break them still depends largely on who wins.
Today many of the strategies and tactics that Sherman and his fellow commanders once applied remain intrinsic to war-forced removal of civilians, reprisals against noncombatants, starvation, devastation of infrastructure and industries, bombardment of towns and cities.
The bloody denouement of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009, in which some forty thousand Tamil civilians were killed during the Sri Lankan army's bombardment of the "safe zone" adjoining the Indian Ocean; the destruction of some 2,800 Darfuri villages by Sudanese government forces and Arab Janjaweed militias; the scorched-earth campaigns waged by various warlords, armies, and rebel groups in the civil wars in the Democratic Republic of Congo; the siege and bombardment of Sarajevo by the Bosnian Serb army; the destruction of Grozny by Russian forces in the Second Chechen War; the bombardment of civilian areas by the Syrian army in the ongoing civil war-all these episodes demonstrate the continued prevalence of what Hugo Slim calls "anticivilian thinking and practices" in modern war.
