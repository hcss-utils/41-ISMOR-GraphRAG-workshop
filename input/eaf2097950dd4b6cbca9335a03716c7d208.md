The NDMC will certainly help Russia coordinate a response to any internal or external crisis, but its creation is more a reaction to the changing nature of war and not specifically because of the color revolution threat.
While Russia's military operation in Syria can be seen as an attempt to defend against a color revolution, Russia's intervention did not come until it was clear that Assad would be ousted from power without additional assistance.
Likewise, the Russians did not act in Kyrgyzstan in 2010, and they did not act in Ukraine in 2013.
In Ukraine, their response only came as a "counterattack" once President Yushchenko had already lost power.
Should a serious internal crisis break out in Central Asia or Belarus, it remains to be seen whether or not the effected country would welcome Russian / CSTO assistance, and even if it did, it remains to be seen if Russia would act in time.
