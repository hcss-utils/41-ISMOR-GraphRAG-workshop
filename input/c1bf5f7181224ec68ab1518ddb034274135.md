For Moltke, the strategic environment was greater Germany, Grossdeustchland, an amalgam of territories and states controlled by Prussia and Austria.
Within this environment were two kings who paradoxically desired peace and unification, albeit differently, but concluded that a unified state could only arise from civil war.
As Moltke recognized the reluctance of both monarchs, but more notably King William, he anticipated that Prussia would enter the war in a defensive posture, while Austria would attack first, with its goal to destroy Prussia.
Although he recognized that both monarchs would be reluctant participants in such an intra-Germanic war, he concluded that William would prefer Prussia to enter the war in a defensive posture, since he pursued the goals of unifying Germany under Prussia's banner and putting an end to Austrian hegemony.
Austria, on the other hand, would most likely attack first with the goal of destroying Prussia, as its aim was to put an end to northern hopes of German leadership.
Having thus perceived the national goal, Moltke accordingly devised multiple strategies, based upon varying conditions, to lure the Austrian Army, the center of gravity, into battle, destroy it, and force Austria to the bargaining table.
