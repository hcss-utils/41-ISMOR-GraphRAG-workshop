What do these past patterns tell us about the potential for a resurgence of the use of proxy warfare in a new era of great-power competition?
Below we survey the evidence from this report through three lenses.
First, we assess this possibility from the perspective of ongoing and historical trends in the incidence of proxy warfare.
Second, we summarize the evidence for a potential resurgence in proxy wars across the four categories of factors identified in our analysis as driving proxy war involvement: geopolitical, ideological, economic, and domestic.
Third and finally, we summarize the potential for greater proxy war involvement by states, including such key U.S. adversaries as China, Russia, and Iran.
