Russia blocked the websites of the Georgian government, as well as spread false information about Georgia's activities during the conflict, with the goal of undermining the country's international image.
This thesis examines Russia's use of hybrid warfare techniques in Georgia, specifically in Pankisi Gorge, as an example to demonstrate how well-planned disinformation and propaganda campaigns can engender instability in a country and how targeted messages related to certain Georgian regions can cause serious damage to a country's international image.
The research contributes to understanding Russia's policy and hybrid warfare techniques.
It can also help to provide the Georgian government with a specific, complex, and systemic approach to the problem of Russia's hybrid warfare, with an emphasis on methods and strategies used in Pankisi Gorge against the ethnic minorities.
The case study in this thesis includes analysis and demonstrates challenges that might be interesting for representatives of the security sectors not only in Georgia but in other countries that face similar problems.
It provides an excellent opportunity for the interested audience to observe the situation on the ground, analyze the best practices and the mistakes made by Georgia, so that others can avoid similar problems in their own countries.
