Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
International Feature fore, the birth of nuclear weapons prompted the concept of deterrence. Deterrence was nuclear in the first place. At the very beginning, the United States did not distinguish between a nuclear bomb and its con ventional kin except that the former was much more powerful, as demonstrated by the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. 8 That said, as early as 1946, Bernard Brodie, an initial architect of US nuclear deterrence strategy, remarked, "Thus far the chief purpose of our mili tary establishment has been to win wars. From now on its chief purpose must be to avert them. It can have almost no other useful purpose." 9  In reality, however, the US military was actively preparing to win the next war by means of the massive use of nuclear weapons. 10  In July 1953, right after the truce that ended the Korean War, some US strate gic analysts criticized the way the war was fought. They bluntly ques tioned why the United States, with such huge nuclear superiority, did not make the best of its nuclear weapons. Soon after, the world's first nuclear-based military strategy-the massive retaliatory strategy-was born. According to some US strategists of the time, if a single Soviet soldier steps across the Iron Curtain, the United States will launch re taliatory nuclear attacks "at times and places of our choosing." 11  In this context, one could consider the so-called massive retaliatory strategy equivalent to the nuclear deterrence strategy.
However, the global situation that developed disappointed US strategic decision makers somewhat; they acknowledged that a massive retaliatory strategy was, after all, something not easily applicable. True, Soviet forces did not cross the Iron Curtain, yet regional conflicts with various com plexities kept evolving. Moreover, Uncle Sam, with plenty of nuclear bombs in his arms, simply felt strong restraints that kept him from drop ping them. Against this background, a group of strategists represented by Kissinger put forward another concept different from, but closely related to, that of deterrence-limited warfare. 12 This addition lent substance to the concept of deterrence as the core of US military strategy. On top of this, Herman Kahn developed escalation theory, which in essence called for gradually increasing the level of deterrence. 13   
and limitations? How and why is the concept often miscomprehended and misinterpreted, and why has it evolved to become something mythical? What effects has it had on the global security environment? And how should the militaries of developing nations view and employ deterrence? This article tries to answer these questions.
In international strategy studies, the general view on deterrence holds that it is a country's threat to use force to prevent an adversary from taking damaging actions against it. Back in 1957, in his book Nu clear Weapons and Foreign Policy, Henry Kissinger identified three com ponents of deterrence: "Deterrence requires a combination of power, the will to use it, and the assessment of these by the potential aggres sor. Moreover, deterrence is the product of those factors and not the sum. If any one of them is zero, deterrence fails."

Second, deterrence inherently and tightly links to military threats. The deterring state implements deterrence via a threat to use force in an attempt to compel the adversary to give up conspired or construed hostile plans or actions. In this sense, so-called military deterrence is no less and no more than threatening the opponent with force. However, in an international society made up of sovereign states, the deterred nations often counter such military threats in kind, turning deterrence from unilateral to mutual, unequal as they may be. From what has happened
Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
International Feature to date, to deem the deterrence concept a theoretical source of most of the international crises in the Cold War years is not an overstatement.
Third, deterrence as a strategic concept is inherent in the gene of fail ure. In the face of military threats, if the state being deterred does not take the damaging actions presumed by the deterring state, the latter may assume that its deterrence strategy has worked. However, how can the deterring state be so sure that what has not happened is a positive result of its deterrence? Honest evidence won't come from the deterred state; the deterring state may use some human intelligence or technical means to collect evidence, which is usually insufficient for the deterring state to measure the effectiveness of its deterrence strategy. In contrast, it is fairly easy to determine the failure of this same strategy: all one needs to know is that the deterred state ignores the military threats and keeps following its course of action. Thus, for a deterrence strategy, suc cess is always hard to prove while failure is easily visible.
Notwithstanding the complexities and uncertainties of the concept of deterrence, after World War II, the nations of the Western world en thusiastically embraced this theory to formulate their military strate gies. Politicians and security scholars were particularly fond of two troublesome "strategic gums": containment and deterrence, which they kept chewing for decades.

Why are Western military analysts so fond of deterrence theory? The answer lies in reality rather than theory. First and foremost, deterrence is
Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
International Feature the favorite of the strong. We recall that the first component of deterrence is "power" or military strength. Usually people would think that only the stronger is qualified to deter, though military history repeatedly proves that the reality is not so simple. Since the end of World War II, the mem bers of the Western world in many circumstances have held a strategic advantage-indeed, superiority-over their adversaries, compared with the majority of developing nations.

Finally, designed to prevent potential enemies from launching pre emptive attacks, deterrence in theory is of a defensive nature. When a nation frames its military strategy on deterrence and then launches military actions under the flag of defense at the time of its choosing, it "kills two birds with one stone." Politically and morally, that country seizes the commanding point and at the same time harvests strategic gains for its national security.
A brief review of how the concept of deterrence was developed and employed, and how it succeeded or failed, may help the current dis cussion approach the core nature of this concept. As mentioned be
Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
As many people have pointed out, the strategic employment of de terrence theory successfully prevented a nuclear conflict. Initially, the nuclear-based military strategy of the United States upset the Soviet Union, which then rolled full speed ahead to develop and build its own nuclear arsenal for exactly the same objective of dissuading its rival from launching a preemptive nuclear attack. Mutual nuclear deterrence be tween these two superpowers soon took shape and lasted for decades. A series of strategic crises that occurred during the next two decades more clearly defined and strengthened the US-Soviet strategic relation ship of mutual nuclear deterrence. The Cuban missile crisis in October 1962 served as a timely wake-up call to the two superpowers, making them keenly aware of the existence of mutual nuclear deterrence and the possible eruption of nuclear war.

MAD stopped both sides from pulling the nuclear trigger first. In deed, it also prevented conventional wars between the United States and Soviet Union. During the Cold War, the world witnessed a number of regional conflicts; seldom or never did any of them feature face-to face confrontations of any size between the two superpowers (table

International Feature conflict with the Soviet forces. On 12 February 1988, on the Black Sea, two US warships sailed into waters only eight nautical miles from the Soviet coast. To repel the intruders, Soviet navy ships reacted by issu ing warnings, sending clear signals ("We are going to bump you!"), and then nudging the US ships in the side. 
15
Although nuclear deterrence strategy successfully prevented an all-out war between the superpowers, it drove them into a frenzied nuclear race that put the whole world under the shadow of nuclear catastrophe. According to US nuclear deterrence doctrine, to ensure credible nuclear deterrence sufficient to dissuade the Soviets from launching any preemptive strike, the United States had to hold "as sured destruction" capabilities, be able to kill 20-25 percent of the Soviet Union's population, and destroy 50 percent of its industry.

In stark contrast to its success in preventing nuclear conflicts, the post-World War II deterrence strategy has failed time and again in averting conventional regional conflicts, which took place for many different reasons. To label them indiscriminately as "Soviet proxy wars," as some American strategists did, was sheer generalization and oversimplification. 
20
To further illustrate the limited effectiveness of deterrence, let's take a look at strategic interactions between China and the United States during the Korean War and Vietnam War. In early October 1950, Zhou Enlai, China's premier and foreign minister at the time, asked K. M. Panikkar, then the Indian ambassador to China, to pass China's clear warning to the United States: If US military forces advance across the 38th parallel, "we will take the matter into our hands."

The discussion above indicates that so-called deterrence is but a de rivative effect produced from the employment of military power. This leads one to question whether something called "deterrence capabili ties" really exists. Capability, an attribute of the subject of action, can enable some action and produce certain effects. In other words, a ca pability can be measured by sizes and degrees based on the effects it achieves. Deterrence, however, only evolves into two opposite end ings: effective (i.e., it succeeds) or ineffective (i.e., it fails). Deterrence cannot be measured in terms of big or small, high or low. Actual mili tary capabilities generate the effects of deterrence, which one can describe as big, small, high, or low. But no direct connection exists between these military capabilities and the success or failure of deterrence. Indeed, socalled deterrence capabilities are but a fallacy.

One can further understand deterrence as a transaction of strategic gains and losses between two opposing parties. By threatening to use its superior military power, the deterring side (often the strong side) compels the deterred side or sides (often the weak side or sides) to back down or compromise in a way that benefits the strong and sup posedly allows the weak to avert yet bigger losses. Obviously, such transactions are never fair, insofar as the deterring side turns deter rence into a sort of strategic kidnapping, holding the other side's larger interests under imminent risk and forcing it to pick the "smaller loss" solution and give in. Now we may define the nature of deterrence as holding hostage the critical security interests of the deterred side and de manding that it accept an unequal strategic transaction. Back in the 1960s, China's strategic research community gave US nuclear deter rence another name: nuclear blackmail. The term, though bearing the political ingredients of the time, was appropriate as regards the nature of deterrence. Anyway, for policy makers, whether on the strong side or the weak, a strategic decision is no more than making a choice based on calculations of interests and strengths, gains and losses.
History shows that deterrence may fail. Why so? Unlike observations by some Western strategists, in many cases, it is not because the deter ring side does not possess enough strength or because it has not deliv ered a sufficiently clear message about its resolve to use that strength.
Often, the answer lies not so much with the deterrer as with the de terred. One major reason is that what the deterring side perceives as the deterred side's crucial interests is in fact not as crucial as it deems.
Here one should pay attention to the difference between Western and other civilizations. For example, when it comes to considerations of
Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
International Feature value, in Western culture, life is the most valuable thing of all; there fore, the deterring side logically places it under threat. In Eastern cul ture, however, there is something more valuable than life. Lao Tzu, founder of China's ancient Daoism, expressed this fact most thor oughly: "When people do not fear to die, what's the use of threatening them with death?" 
26
Scenario 1: Side B, the deterrer, holds hostage the critical interests (A1) of Side A, the one being deterred, asking Side A to compromise in A2, which is not as valuable as A1, whereas Side B's cost (B2) would be very small and ignorable. After comparing A1 and A2, Side A gives up. The deterrence of Side B succeeds. Scenario 2: Side B holds hostage Side A's critical interests A1, asking for A2, which is not as valuable as A1. In response, Side A takes Side B's interests (B1) hostage, which is as important to Side B as A1 is to Side A and bigger than A2. The situation is complicated, and the deter rence of Side B transforms into mutual deterrence. This in some sense means the failure of Side B. One often sees such a "boomerang effect" in the practice of military deterrence. Scenario 3: Side B holds hostage Side A's critical interests A1, asking for A2, which is less important than A1. But Side A thinks that it can effectively defend its A1 and force Side B to yield B2, which would be bigger than A2. The deterrence of Side B fails. Scenario 4: Side B holds hostage Side A's critical interests A1, asking for A2, thought to be smaller than A1. But Side A thinks A2 is much more important and prefers to fight for A2 at the cost of A1. The deter rence of Side B fails. Scenario 5: Side A is extremely weak and possesses almost nothing. Thus, Side B can take hostage nothing valuable from Side A. In this situa tion, no matter how strong it may be, Side B cannot effectively deter Side A. 
27

International Feature The above analysis may point to several considerations. First, suc cess or failure is determined more by the deterred side, not vice versa. Primarily, it depends on whether or not the deterred side has real, cru cial interests held hostage by the deterring side and on the cost ex change between the two opposing parties.
Second, deterrence strategy works only in proper conditions. In the current international system, composed of sovereign states, deterrence strategy may be one of the options for dealing with national security problems. However, as a military doctrine, deterrence is by no means a one-size-fits-all panacea. Not all adversaries are prone to deterrence. This is particularly true in asymmetric situations where the effects and coverage of military deterrence or subsequent military operations are essentially restricted.
Furthermore, observing what has happened after World War II, one may find that in many cases the military deterrence implemented by Western powers against targeted countries is not deterrence as originally defined. Rather, it has become twisted and alienated from the meaning of deterrence. Here, another related concept comes to mind-military coercion, which is less discussed in the world's military research circles.

cepts. Although deterrence aims to prevent an opponent from taking ac tions detrimental to one's interests, coercion goes a step further by compelling the opponent to do things desired by the coercer.

During the Cold War years, the Americans created another derivative concept of "extended deterrence," more commonly known as the "nu clear umbrella." This important notion, for which the author coined the well-comprehended abbreviation "ED" in 2009, serves as doctrinal sup port to the United States' global system of strategic alliance. According to the logic of ED, the United States provides its allies ED, protecting them from nuclear threats; in return, nations under this umbrella of ED allow the United States to deploy troops on their soil to form its forward de fense. In the Cold War era, distressed by the geographic disadvantage of lacking enough strategic depth in Western Europe, the North Atlan tic Treaty Organization (NATO), led by the United States, formulated a strategy involving the first use of nuclear weapons to counter the for midable Soviet conventional military threat-particularly the rapidly
Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
International Feature maneuvering strike groups of Soviet armor. However, would this nu clear umbrella work? NATO's European members kept asking them selves whether the United States would protect Frankfurt at the cost of Detroit. They had further questions about what might be left in Europe after the launching of nuclear weapons against attacking Soviet forces.
The crisis aroused by the deployment of Soviet and US intermediate missiles in Europe during late 1980s further exposed the fallacy of this umbrella. People found that these limited-range nuclear missiles could reach the inland of neither the United States nor the Soviet Union; in stead, wouldn't those nuclear warheads shot from either side explode over the heads of Europeans?

It will be increasingly clear that nuclear deterrence, no matter how much one may exaggerate its role, works mainly in countering nuclearcapable strategic adversaries. To threaten the use of nuclear weapons in conventional conflicts only pushes the threatening party into the di lemma of never-ending hesitation. In the short term, such a threat might deter opponents. But in the long run, it would usually generate a strong backlash by irritating opponents and causing them to pursue nuclear
Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
International Feature weapons as a countermeasure. In this sense, nuclear deterrence also acts as a theoretical and practical irritation to nuclear proliferation. Here, one sees an interesting paradox: "positive security assurance" works negatively, while "negative security assurance" plays a truly active role. 
33
During the Cold War, the United States regarded the Soviets and Sovietled Warsaw Pact as its strategic opponents. In that context, nuclear deterrence as an underlying strategy was understandable. In today's environment, long after the end of the Cold War, to continue allowing deterrence to guide one's military strategy is ludicrous.
Since the conclusion of the Cold War, nuclear deterrence has lost some of its prominence but remains an often-debated topic. The ten dency seems to indicate that nuclear deterrence is being reduced to its original role: to deter one's adversary from launching nuclear attacks. A renowned Chinese nuclear specialist once remarked that the role that
Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
International Feature nuclear weapons can play is tiny, right there to be seen. Any attempt to amplify it-to inflate it to the cornerstone of national security or the fundamental protection against any or all security threats-is to no avail. The US Nuclear Posture Review Report of 2010 declares that the United States will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in defending national security. This is a small step in the right direction. Still, this policy document insists on extending nuclear deterrence for maintain ing US military alliances, making this small forward step look some what reluctant and awkward. 
34
As nations move forward, deterrence from conventional weapons becomes even more elusive. Although it may have some value and play a limited role in some circumstances, such deterrence is really not worth serious attention.
Western powers have been quite fond of deterrence strategies, but should developing nations, often the militarily weak side, follow suit
Embracing the Moon in the Sky or Fishing the Moon in the Water?
International Feature and make deterrence the cornerstone of their military strategies? Mili tary leaders in developing nations ought to understand this concept, see it through, and possibly use a deterrence strategy against the right opponent at the appropriate time and under certain conditions. But they should be careful not to go too far down this path. In planning such military deterrence, these leaders should clearly answer the questions against whom, by what means, and will such deterrence work? More importantly, they should be aware that deterrence not only generates military uncertainties but also imposes an overwhelmingly intimidating presence, which is politically offensive even to third parties. The question then becomes, In the course of maintaining national security, should a developing nation appear intimidating? More specifically, how, to whom, and under what circumstances should a developing nation demonstrate its deterring might?
Militaries of developing nations may deliver clear messages to po tential aggressors or hostile elements trying to subvert their legal gov ernments or break their sovereignty, warning that they will pay a costly price for their conspiracies. Fundamentally, the national secu rity of a developing nation can count only on painstaking and steadfast efforts towards defense modernization. For developing nations, build ing a highly capable military force is certainly difficult, just as hard as embracing the moon in the sky, whereas deterrence is but a logical or consequential side effect of military power, like the moon's reflection in the water. Eventually, as one successfully embraces the moon in the sky, he or she gets the moon in the water automatically. ÔÇµ Notes 3. Kissinger soon after modified the third component, "the assessment of these by the potential aggressor," to "communicate with the potential opponent to ensure that it under stands the above two." See Kissinger, Necessity for Choice. 7. Many military analysts tend to agree that the concept of deterrence can be traced back to Sun Tzu, the famous, ancient Chinese strategist who, among other things, first put for ward the enlightening idea of "winning without fighting." One should note here that Sun Tzu's doctrine primarily reflects the military logic of the stronger rather than the weaker, and politically it serves the purpose of a king to pursue hegemony. In admiring Sun Tzu's great contribution to military thinking, one should also be aware of the historical limits in his thought. The author would also argue that Sun Tzu's "winning without fighting" doctrine conveys broader and deeper implications than mere "deterrence."  N o management action carries the impact of promotion. What ever an organization's stated goals and performance criteria, employees note and emulate behaviors that lead to advance ment. According to the Officer Evaluation System: Training Guide, "Throughout the history of the Air Force, there have been more than 8 different evaluation systems with 14 major variations, at a rate of a new version about every eight years."

Toward a Superior Promotion System Feature and officer corps, the system undergoes reform yet again. This article seeks to assess the current cycle of promotion procedures and propose an evaluation/promotion process for Air Force officers marked by sta bility, predictability, and transparency-one controlled by the actions of the officers it evaluates. Toward that end, it reviews the history and purpose of the current system, explores some of the latter's inherent challenges, and then proposes a series of recommendations that might enhance the promotions process by ameliorating some of these issues.
Evaluating military officers has never been an exact science. The British defeated Napoleon nearly two centuries ago and built an em pire by allowing the aristocracy to buy its commissions and promo tions. The purchase system ensured a homogeneous corps of com manders drawn from a common background and secured the army's loyalty because its officers had "a stake in the country." 2 However, the system failed to systematically reward ability, punish incompetence, or head off disastrous occurrences of "groupthink."
The American Continental Army "was initially led by men who had served in the British Army or colonial militias and who brought much of British military heritage with them."

Toward a Superior Promotion System
Subsequent systems were based upon seniority, giving officers in the upper echelons little incentive to retire and thus creating promotion stagnation due to the limited number of officer slots. Army officers re mained in the junior ranks for as long as 20 years.

Toward a Superior Promotion System
Over the next 10 years, the uncontrolled OERs developed their own rat ing scale. Since all officers could now be awarded the top rating of 1, most of them were. Soon, a rating of 2 or 3 became a clear signal to the promo tion board that the officer should not advance. Rating all officers at the top created a "Lake Wobegon effect": according to their OERs, "all of the chil dren are above average." To compensate for this nullification of the nu merical system, raters sought higher-ranking additional raters to set their officers apart. Commands soon developed guidelines regarding what offi cers could expect for endorsement levels, given their rank and position. 
12
13
14
Recent problems with the OES concern the system's constrained por tion, the PRF, which evaluates the officer's suitability for advancement by awarding one of three ratings: definitely promote (DP), promote (P), or do not promote (DNP). The DP recommendation is constrained to 75 percent of officers under consideration for promotion to major, and 55
Toward a Superior Promotion System Feature percent of officers under consideration for promotion to lieutenant colonel. 
15
16
The OES represents a significant attempt to address issues in the OER, a recognizable step in the historical cycle of promotion schema. Never theless, the OES is not necessarily the optimal promotion system-one free of flaws. In fact, it suffers from several significant weaknesses.
First, as occurred with the OER, the numerical ratings on the OPR are nullified since almost all officers receive the rating "meets standards." This fact makes the rating useless as a point of comparison or a feed back tool, a fact acknowledged by the separate, confidential feedback and PRFs. In the absence of meaningful numerical ratings and the elimi nation of the OER's endorsement scale, the OES relies heavily upon the writing abilities of the rater. Official guidelines for writing performance reports create a separate and distinct language for these reports, using "stratification" phrases (discussed later in this article) and "push" state ments. Although published OPR guidance states unequivocally that "promotion recommendations are prohibited in the OPR," guidance
Toward a Superior Promotion System Feature from major commands endorses the use of push statements-recom mendations for assignments that communicate a recommendation for promotion (e.g., "Air Command and Staff College now and then a tough joint job!"). 
17
18
Third, the inflated ratings of the OES system not only devalue positive reports but also emphasize negative-or insufficiently laudatory-com ments. The system assumes that no officer, at any time over the course of his or her career, will experience even a short period of less than stel lar performance or conflict with a supervisor. If the latter does not wish to write effusively enough on the OPR, future promotion boards will note this lack of enthusiasm. In such cases, the rated officer has little re course. One cannot appeal a favorable performance report simply be cause it wasn't sufficiently laudatory. Gen David C. Jones, Air Force chief of staff from 1974 to 1978, described the rating problem this way: "The effectiveness report system has become so inflated that far more people get perfect effectiveness reports than can be promoted. The pro motion board is faced not so much in finding out who should be pro moted, but who shouldn't be promoted. It's very difficult if somebody has a bad knock on his record to promote that person and not to pro mote somebody who doesn't have a bad knock on his record." 
19
20
To make the promotion system honest and understandable, we must recognize four significant truths.
All jobs are not the same. The mission of the US Air Force involves delivering sovereign options for the defense of the United States of America and its global interests-to fly and fight in air, space, and cyber space. 
21
The Air Force considers an officer who flies a combat aircraft more critical to the mission than an equally skilled (comparatively) budget officer. Granted, the budget officer is important, and the mission will suffer without his or her position, but the service can still carry out its core functions by retaining the pilot and eliminating the budget officer. The reverse is not true. Similarly, the budget officer's job is more critical to the mission than that of an officer supervising a section in Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR services). Again, the service would miss the MWR officer and the mission would suffer-but not to the ex tent that it would without the budget officer.
Toward a Superior Promotion System
Although the current system avoids such comparisons during indi vidual evaluations, when the promotion board meets, it quickly and methodically reduces the job descriptions to scores. All other factors being equal, the board will promote a pilot in preference to a budget officer, who will advance over an MWR officer, because of their relative effect on the mission.
All officers are not equal. Some people do better work than others. Although the current system includes the DP, P, and DNP ratings, the promotion decision actually depends upon the process of stratification, which "can be a statement of opinion, a ranking among peers, or can be reflected in a recommendation for an assignment, command, or [developmental education] opportunity." 
22
23
According to the Officer Evaluation System: Training Guide, the ac companying sample statements describe four strata of officer strength: 
It is possible that a formal rating system which equates the meanings of "superior" and "lowest" and interprets the description "one of my best" as "3rd level" may not provide optimal clarity of meaning to either the promotion board or the ratee. Even in the favorable levels, significant ambiguity exists between "top 3% of my 35 majors" (mathematically "first") and "top 10% in wing." This deliberately created, somewhat Or wellian alternative language ("superior officer" equals "the lowest per forming officer I know") exists in official guidance although not in the system's establishing regulations (e.g., AFI 36-2501, Officer Promotions and Selective Continuation). Though evidently created for a reason and a definable purpose, the nature of that purpose is not readily apparent.
Possible reasons for creating this language might include preserving the morale of the officer who receives a poor rating by describing his or her performance as "superior" or "outstanding"; hindering the ratee's ability to challenge or appeal the rating (the individual would have little basis for protesting the English meaning of "outstanding officer"); or relieving the rater of the possibly uncomfortable task of directly informing subordi nates that their performance is deficient. However, the availability of the translation guide undermines all of these reasons. Moreover, this lan guage might have arisen to remedy a problem in this or previous evalua tion systems and has continued to exist as a vestigial feature. The unique language of performance reports may have an origin but not a purpose. Eliminating coded language and reclaiming meaningful numerical ratings would greatly clarify the rater's actual judgment and intent.
At some point, everybody has a bad day. No evaluation system can possibly maintain its integrity when the slightest hint of less than-stellar performance-let alone failure-could mean the end of one's career. All officers, from those in the Punic Wars to participants in Operation Enduring Freedom, have made significant, costly blun ders at some time during their careers: "When initiative is used there is often an element of risk involved, and often mistakes are made when risks are taken. The Air Force wants officers who will take risks." 
25
Toward a Superior Promotion System Feature the penalty for failure prohibitively high. Officers should be expected to make mistakes as they learn. The current evaluation system's al most 100 percent promotion opportunity to first lieutenant and cap tain acknowledges this expectation. Assuming a lieutenant's lack of experience, raters make the appropriate allowances in writing their performance reports. Unfortunately, many careers end when the young officer, having little maturity and perspective, antagonizes the rater and receives a less-than-effusive OPR. History has shown that some of the greatest American military leaders went against the con ventional career paths at certain points in their careers, seeking un conventional opportunities that expanded their experience and made them more useful to the military profession.
Not every officer wants to be a general. The personal price of reaching the highest ranks is considerable. Competent, dedicated of ficers may decide that they are more motivated by family concerns, engaging duties, and desirable locations than by promotion to the highest ranks. This truth is the antithesis of the experience of many senior officers. No one becomes a general without trying very hard, for a very long time, to become one. Those who survive this competi tion may neither understand nor respect colleagues who choose a different path. The current promotion system-designed and en forced by officers who have reached the highest ranks-assumes that every officer strives for constant advancement. It does not value a competent, dedicated, productive major who does not actively at tempt to climb much higher.
To empower subordinates, one must respect their choices. A trans parent and predictable promotion system should make clear the path to higher rank and the relative costs of career (and life) decisions. A system that empowers the lowest affected echelon gives subordinates the opportunity, authority, and resources to do the job. If we trust our officers with so much that is vital to the nation, why do we hesitate to let them manage their own careers?
Toward a Superior Promotion System
The Air Force should adopt a simpler, more predictable, and more transparent system of evaluation and promotion that retains the cur rent stated values and criteria. As a starting point, such a system would review each officer position and assign it a score for its value to ward promotion. This will do nothing more or less than move this cal culation from the opaque, subjective judgment of the promotion board to a standardized, systematic, and transparent process that makes these position ratings known to the officers filling them.
By means of a simplistic methodology, each position would carry a numerical rating (0 to 2) based upon its attributes in the stated criteria of supervisory responsibility, policy-making responsibility, specialized expertise, operational duty, and mission essentiality. Scoring each category from 0 to 2 produces a 10-point rating scale for the position (see table below). Headquarters Air Force will assign position scores; otherwise, major commands would maneuver for favor among their own personnel and fields. Such a scaling system likely will increase the value of operational jobs, slightly decrease staff positions, and generally assign lower rat ings to base-level support positions. This quantitative rating will align well with the current position-description guidance, which assesses Feature the value of positions on their "level of responsibility, number of people supervised, dollar value of resources or projects . . . [and the] uniqueness of the job." 
26
This scale might value some positions so lowly that filling them with competent personnel becomes difficult. Such a situation raises the question of whether or not such positions properly require an officer or whether a noncommissioned officer or civilian contractor might prove more appropriate. Most importantly, members of the officer corps will know the value of their jobs in terms of promotion and be able to make rational, well-informed decisions about their future. Once again, some of these truths may seem harsh and adversely affect per formance and morale. However, after applying for operational and staff positions, an officer assigned to administrative duties-possibly at an undesirable location-probably has already experienced such ef fects and a realization that he or she might be an "outstanding officer." Having more precise, quantified information will let these officers know what practical steps they may take to improve their position (such as performing their current duties in a manner worthy of a higher score and volunteering for an undesirable position assigned a higher score as an incentive).
The scale favors supervisory jobs directly related to operations. The same position may be rated differently in various locations, based on required levels of readiness, geographical demands of the position, pri

A maintenance officer in a forward lo cation such as Korea may rate higher in mission essentiality than someone with the same position in Texas. The scale also rewards offi cers for assuming greater supervisory and policy-making responsibili ties. As in the past, this is the preferred path to higher ranks.
Although the position itself carries its own weighted value, perfor mance also will factor into the determination of promotion potential. Raters will score the officer's performance on a 1 to 3 scale, 2 repre senting competent performance of all duties. Establishing a require ment for significant justification of higher or lower ratings should give the performance score a strong central tendency. As the recent OPR analysis at US Air Forces in Europe observes, Fact: few officers' achievements truly stand out.

Toward a Superior Promotion System
The armed services do have some experience in objective rating sys tems. At the conclusion of World War II, the services faced a crisis in managing a vast force whose primary goal was to get out of the service and go home. The Navy and Marines encountered isolated but disturb ing incidents of rebellion when they forced veteran combat troops overseas to remain in service but released new recruits, still located stateside. 
28
Although not perfect, the point system was well received and quickly adopted by the other services, and demobilization proceeded to completion in an orderly manner. This discussion, however, pro poses a system that optimizes the possibility of producing a stable, pre dictable evaluation process manageable over the long term, as opposed to one that makes dramatic changes to satisfy short-term budget and manning requirements. For example, what could be done if the Air Force projects a need to promote 300 captains to major in a given year, but 350 officers attain the required score for promotion? Management of the force over an appropriately long horizon should allow anticipa tion of this problem several years in advance. If the service deems the problem critical, then it might raise the required score for promotion in small, annual increments over several years and make the problem known early enough to captains who might be affected so they could take meaningful actions. If the potential for overage persists, the Air Force might adjust its assignment rotations and needs to accommodate the extra officers. If the problem still occurs, then the service should promote the high-scoring officers. Undermining the integrity of the system is far more damaging to the service than the marginal cost of the extra promotions. According to a basic tenet of management, one 
should not incur long-term liabilities to satisfy short-term needs. After educating and training people for a decade, the Air Force should not sacrifice that investment, its potential future, and the faith of the offi cer corps in the system to meet the relatively small demands of the immediate circumstance.
Officers would undergo a performance rating at six-month intervals, thereby producing more reports than under the current system and di minishing the impact of each. Consequently, an officer could receive a poor rating during one period but improve it in the next, and his or her specific performance would not carry over. Raters must justify each rating with the performance only from the period of that report. The reports, much simpler than the current OPR, should reduce the administrative burden, even when produced more frequently. When this time period is divided between positions, administrative proce dures will address the consultation between supervisors and the prece dence of position scores. These anomalies will generally not prove sig nificant since the system primarily seeks to dampen the effect of any single performance report.
Periods of training and education (Air Command and Staff College, technical school specific to a career field / position, Squadron Officer School, etc.) would be rated on the same criteria, but officers would ac quire additional points for successful completion of the training. To prevent the continued addition of degrees for the purpose of inflating one's score, the system limits the number of times raters can award these points.
The officer would have time windows for promotion (one and a half to three years for first lieutenant, three to five for captain, and eight to 12 years for major). As officers reach specified longevity windows, their cumulative scores will be evaluated against an Air Force standard for promotion. The service reserves the right (though a limited one) to alter this standard to respond to its changing needs. Promotion is a long-term process, incorporating years of effort by the officer and in vestment by the Air Force. Standards for promotion should not re
Toward a Superior Promotion System Feature spond to volatility in short-term force-management concerns. Given the highly statistical nature of this system, the service should be able to control the rate of officer promotions to a high degree of precision while leaving the responsibility for realizing that standard squarely in the hands of the officers.
Promotion boards will remain to ensure quality control. An officer who has amassed a very high score does not, simply by virtue of having accumulated numbers, earn promotion while facing disciplinary actions. These boards will also offer a defense against raters who "game" this sys tem, as has occurred in the past, requiring substantiation of sudden jumps in an officer's score just prior to a promotion deadline.
Although this process may seem too simple and objective for the complexities of evaluating leaders, it does-in a visible and system atic way-only what the promotion board does when it scores officer records. At that board, senior officers evaluate the candidate's job his tory and performance and score them. Air Force Pamphlet 36-2506, You and Your Promotions, specified the use of a nine-point scale to at tain this quantification: 
29
30
Moreover, numerical grading by the direct supervisor most effec tively captures the subjective aspect of the promotion process implied in AFI 36-2501: "A promotion is not a reward for past service; it is an advancement to a higher grade based on past performance and future potential." 
31
Converting the entire system once again, as in past transitions, in volves some effort. However, the rescoring of past OPRs to the new format should prove relatively simple. If implemented, the promotion board process will remain essentially the same with very minor adjust ments. A central board will rate officer positions for scores, after which a second series of boards will review the officer's OER/OPR records and assign a rating of 1, 2, or 3 to each six-month performance period. Statistical sampling of past records would also allow the service to es tablish promotion-score standards that will accurately mirror past pro motion rates.
On the one hand, this system clearly offers a number of benefits, es pecially that of showing all officers where they stand at every point in their careers. Moreover, the service would set scores for promotion ac cording to its needs (similar to the percentages now associated with promotion potential). An F-15 pilot would know the consequences of refusing to leave the cockpit for a supervisory position. The value of
Toward a Superior Promotion System Feature military education and advanced degrees would be clear. Less-than perfect ratings on any single report would not prove fatal. Superior performance in a single position, though certainly beneficial to promo tion, would not guarantee higher ratings in future positions. The sys tem would vastly reduce the influence of the rater's writing skills. The promotion board would still exist as a quality check, but officers would finally feel that they are driving their careers, answering only to them selves with regard to reaching or not reaching their goals. The some times "paternalistic" role of the Air Force Personnel Center in guiding officers' careers would diminish, and speculation about what the pro motion board actually wants would finally end. Officers sitting on the boards would benefit from the simplified and less ambiguous language of the raters' comments and from the clearer meaning of the promo tion language at the time reports were written (stratification language today might mean something completely different than it would a de cade from now).
On the other hand, in this system, some jobs will not facilitate pro motion, and the officers in them likely will move. Certainly, we al ready know this, but admitting it will take an unaccustomed degree of candor. Measured objectively against other positions, jobs formerly on the fast track may be downgraded. Thus, in terms of their posi tions, officers will have a much clearer picture of their chances of promotion. The current system allows 18 months from the first noti fication of promotion denial to final discharge from the service-a great difficulty to overcome.
Additionally, the present system can adversely affect morale be cause officers cannot control, much less predict, a process that offers them little to no information with which to make informed choices. Provided with a clear, simple system, officers may respond favorably and maturely. Altering established ways of doing business calls for some adjustment, but many of these practices are the source of disaf fection among some members of the officer corps now. The nation trusts Air Force officers to control nuclear weapons, manage billions of  
KWar Feature versary's disadvantage. This article takes that thinking a little further, asserting not only that we must understand our adversaries but also that we should become more agile than they by rethinking our whole approach to command and control (C2). To be more agile, we need to build synchronized and centralized situational awareness as well as de centralized C2 (DC2) and execution systems and concepts of operations.
Specifically, this article aims to give greater meaning to and provoke additional thought about a more recent war-fighting concept-knowledge centric warfare (KCW), also known as "KWar"-which can produce strategic effects. 
1
Today's military leaders continue to look for and advance new ways of making warfare highly adaptive to the forces of knowledge-of train ing soldiers to use their minds (brain force) to fight innovatively with novel (although still brute-force) weapons without a centralized, rigid C2 structure to get in the way. As the revolutionary driving force of the Third Wave "knowledge age," technology (more specifically, infor mation technology) is changing the face of combat in the twenty-first century. This endless quest for information and knowledge stands to fundamentally change how we wage warfare. In conflict, victory will
belong to the side that acquires knowledge faster, understands its true value, and applies it more adaptively.
To make sense of the drastic technological progression occurring in today's "information age," we must have an appreciation for informa tion and know its origins and value. For our purposes, we define infor mation as a collection of facts or data that, when placed in context, provides meaning derived from the full range of sensory perceptions. In many cases, we use information as an asset that can improve the quality of life by connecting us to other people and events. We should also recognize, however, that people can use information today, even more so than in the past, to gain a strategic advantage: " 'In war infor mation . . . is the single most significant military factor . . . for control ling the battlespace. . . . Information is the organizing principle of war and postmodernity." 2 Additionally, we must note that "even if one has perfect information it is of no value if it is not coupled to a penetrating understanding of its meaning. . . . Judgment is key. . . . It is not neces sarily the one with more information who will come out victorious, it is the one with better judgment, the one who is better at discerning patterns."

All of these dimensions of knowledge are changing simultaneously, at speeds never before encountered and thus "demand much faster, smarter decision-making under more and more complex, if not chaotic, conditions" (fig.

In 2014, global IP traffic will reach three-fourths of a zettabyte. The Concept of Knowledge-Centric Warfare
The final development of Third Wave war may well be the conscious design of something the world has not yet seen: competitive knowledge strategies.
-Alvin and Heidi Toffler
As it concerns the military's operating in today's information do main, "at the strategic level, the aim of a 'perfect' information warfare campaign is to influence adversary choices, and hence adversary be havior, without the adversary's awareness that choices and behavior are being influenced."

Ultimately, the strategic goal calls for constantly changing the enemy's perception of reality so much that he becomes mired in uncertainty and disorder due to the overwhelming contradictions of inconsistent ideas and interactions, thus causing him to make erroneous decisions. The aim of penetrating the enemy's OODA loop closely reflects mili tary deception operations conducted at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels, defined in Joint Publication 3-14, Space Operations, as "those measures designed to mislead the enemy by manipulation, dis tortion, or falsification of evidence to induce the enemy to react in a manner prejudicial to the enemy's interests." 
12
Why is this critical, and what does all this have to do with cyber war fare? Focused primarily at the tactical level, cyber operations try to in filtrate and disrupt an adversary's computers and networks. However, although we continue to make great strides in improving both offen sive and defensive cyber capabilities, we must now lift our sights from the tactical to the strategic level. We can do this by recognizing the full potential and strategic implications of utilizing our knowledge to sup press and reduce the enemy's knowledge and channels for information by penetrating his decision cycle and influencing his observations and perceptions. To do so, KCW needs to target and successfully distort
what Alvin and Heidi Toffler call "truth filters," used to validate one's observations and beliefs.

Because decisions increasingly depend upon the constant barrage of data and information, we must know what is real and what is not. Consequently, the Tofflers contend that individuals in certain cul tures and societies use any of six accepted criteria, or filters, to vali date their beliefs:
1. Consensus: something deemed true through conventional wisdom.
harmonize with other facts.
3. Authority: something authenticated by a leadership figure.
4. Revelation: something assumed true and not subject to debate.
5. Durability: something that confirms inherited facts which have stood the test of time.
6. Science: something that ascertains truth through rigid tests and experiments.

Acquiring a better understanding of our adversaries' orientation, which shapes the local context on the periphery of the battlefield, de mands that we give stronger consideration to creating a more agile DC2 structure, allowing generals to give field officers greater initiative to supply a more comprehensive picture of the battlespace. This im age, in turn, enables the desired synchronized and shared situational awareness that generals must have to make more effective strategic decisions. The current austere environment of US defense investment, caused by budget constraints, means that we must do more with less. For that reason, we have to think beyond cyber-based maneuvers at the tactical level and focus on adapting and perfecting our KCW capa bilities at the strategic level in order to compete effectively. In KCW, the victor will strategically target and successfully affect the oppo nent's truth filters, which the latter uses to validate beliefs and knowl edge that guide his decisions. We can produce this effect only by means of synchronized and shared situational awareness as well as DC2 and execution.
Social media can greatly aid in the development of in-depth under standing of adversarial truth filters. Social media tools for using "science" to affect the other truth filters-consensus, consistency, authority, revelation, and durability-abound, and few are "military." One social media information organization lists more than two dozen such tools, which include (1) online profiles and online connections; Yet each of these tools, to one degree or another, can have a "mili tary" instantiation to create arsenals of superior knowledge and affect an adversary's truth filters. To what degree was nascent KWar evident during the Arab Spring? According to Kate Taylor, After analyzing more than three million tweets, gigabytes of YouTube con tent and thousands of blog posts, a new study has concluded that the Arab Spring truly was fueled by social media. "Our evidence suggests that social media carried a cascade of messages about freedom and democracy across North Africa and the Middle East, and helped raise expectations for the success of political uprising," says Philip Howard, an associate professor in communication at the University of Washington. 
20
Successful application of KCW depends upon its organization. Adm Arthur Cebrowski and John Gartska, who introduced the notion of network-centric warfare (NCW) in 1998, observe that synchronization is the "operating of entities in the absence of traditional hierarchical mechanisms for command and control," serving as the "link between shared situational awareness and mission effectiveness." Synchroniza tion "is the ability of a well-informed force to organize and synchro nize complex warfare activities from the bottom up." 
21
Rather than the NCW bottom-up approach, KCW seeks to obtain and expand synchronized situational awareness across a wider landscape of the battlefield, offering a more detailed picture of the operating en
vironment. The use of new operating concepts and technology facili tates a shared understanding of that environment across a DC2 struc ture that enables delivery of more relevant and timely information to the participants anywhere and at any time, yielding the desired effect of synchronized situational awareness (fig.

Feature functions in a flexible and adaptive manner. 
23
War today goes well beyond the kinetic campaign maneuvers of the battlefield and has a much broader scope that includes postconflict objec tives, joint training exercises, economic development, and nation building, all of which require military commanders to serve as both advisers and con sultants with supporting subject-matter experts and ad hoc entities. In terms of shaping KCW and related efforts to create DC2 that fosters im proved intelligence analysis and effective situational awareness, numerous consulting engagements that run advanced analytics across the commercial and public sectors have enjoyed great success. Given that intelligence analysis concerns itself with knowledge competition, efforts such as these have directly contributed to creating the shared and synchronized situa tional awareness of the environment. They do so by utilizing methodolo gies that not only focus on identifying the adversary's unknown biases and values but also aim to answer the key intelligence question in an effort to provide critical insights in a compressed time frame.
With regard to cyber warfare, the fact that commercial and military systems are not impervious to viruses and data corruption by way of sabotage makes the thrust towards developing KCW capabilities all the more pertinent. Some of the key technology areas of KCW include ad vances in (1) cognitive reasoning, which deals with understanding human-technology interactions and strives to grasp the cognitive skills underlying behavior, such as problem solving, decision making, and assessment; (2) behavioral modeling, which involves the study of how the human brain functions, reasons, and assesses data, information, and knowledge-a process that machines can mimic, offering more human-like alternatives for a decision maker to consider; and (3) selflearning knowledge extraction, which attempts to develop an auto mated capability to reason, infer, and discover knowledge implicit in extracted information. 
24
As these capabilities become more integrated, we might foresee something similar to IBM's Watson computer put to use in military cy ber, network, and knowledge domain operations. Watson could search and process a tremendous amount of data in less than six seconds per question, outthinking even the smartest contestants on the trivia game show Jeopardy! Imagine how this computer's advances in deep analyt ics and its ability to process unstructured data as well as interpret nat ural language could be tailored to fit the requirements of new solutions in obtaining knowledge dominance in the cyber battlespace. 
25
26
Herein lies a working theory and construct that offers an approach to a new strategic command framework that will better accommodate and accelerate the acquisition and distribution of information and knowledge across the battle sphere. The fact that conflicts are becom ing more globally interconnected demands new conceptual thinking from military leadership and subject-matter experts, presenting a unique opportunity to embrace a new C2 structure for greater success across future complex conflicts.
Ashley KWar
The Department of Defense's fiscal circumstances have changed our strategic priorities and made our joint force smaller and leaner. To maintain our military superiority in a world where complex conflicts occur across a greater expanse of the globe, we will need new operat ing concepts, one of which calls for a more dispersed and decentral ized command structure across all domains. This creates the agility necessary to respond to a myriad of contingencies at any given time. A flatter command framework that demonstrates agility with an empha sis on human behavior will gain the competitive advantage in knowl edge in a rapidly changing, complex environment. This emphasis on human behavior remains central to KCW, attained by creating knowledge derived from a comprehension of what people value and why they value it within their environment. By completely under standing the adversary's truth filters-what shapes their perceptions, ob servations, biases, and beliefs-and by using this knowledge adaptively, we gain the desired situational awareness demanded at all levels of com mand. We will dominate the knowledge sphere once we have a genuine understanding of what our adversaries value and how those values drive their intentions and motivations within their environment.
In the networked-connected wars of the twenty-first century, new operating concepts and advanced war-fighting technologies are shap ing "an environment 'where the strategic, operational, and tactical levels of war can at times be so compressed as to appear virtually as a single function.' " 
27
The very essence of this article concerns the need to know what and why. A new, decentralized command structure that delivers accurate and timely intelligence will give modern commanders a fuller aware ness of their environment. When we attain such awareness and always know the answers to what and why, we will have achieved the knowl edge dominance that we seek.

Rediscovering Our Raison D'√™tre A fter 10 years of witnessing a US focus on land-centric conflicts, commanded mostly by Army and Marine generals, the Ameri can public and even a number of Airmen understandably are beginning to believe that the primary purpose of the Air Force is to support land forces. Indeed, the Army began promoting this concept vigorously more than a decade ago by expounding a vision of war in volving decisive land forces and a supporting airpower force. 
1
Stephen Budiansky comments that "the Air Force's own seriousness about making the battlefield the focus of its application of precision air power had produced a cadre of officers vastly more knowledgeable about land-warfare strategy and joint operations than their narrowly
From the Air Feature air-minded predecessors." 2 Although the Air Force certainly had to sup port the Army and Marine Corps during Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom, these joint efforts might cause a large cadre of Airmen to identify more with supporting ground operations than with fighting and winning the nation's wars through the strategic application of air, space, and cyberspace power. Hence, these Air Force officers could lose that aspect of "air-mindedness" described as "a global, strategic mind-set providing perspective through which the battlespace is not constrained by geography, distance, location, or time." 3 Such a loss could have negative consequences as land opera tions in the Middle East and Southwest Asia wind down and the inter national emphasis shifts toward East Asia, where air and sea opera tions would predominate.
This problem is exacerbated by the fiscal challenges facing the De partment of Defense (DOD). During a time of declining military bud gets, forgetting that the Air Force represents (as an independent ser vice) the nation's principal strategic military arm creates problems in determining which of its core functions are most critical to the na tional interests. In a recent off-the-record conversation, one senior Air man suggested that "the Air Force is a budget in search of a strategy," indicating that years of supporting ground forces may have produced insufficient understanding, within the service at large, of how airpower and the Air Force can perform their main core functions, which are often independent from those that undergird land forces.
Given the daunting issues confronting the Air Force, Airmen would do well to look back at the service's reason for being and remember why the nation established an independent air arm. Admittedly, the Air Force will and should continue to support ground forces when ap propriate, but Airmen should concentrate on those core functions that the service was created to perform. Current doctrine lists 12 such func tions, but the Air Force could leverage its most fundamental purposeattaining national security objectives-by prioritizing seven of them:
(1) air superiority; (2) space superiority; (3) cyberspace superiority; The Air Force's Roles and Core Functions
The Air Force came into being as the nation moved from an isola tionist to an internationalist perspective. The experience of World War II, coupled with the advent of nuclear weapons, placed the Air Force in a unique position as the service that could most readily react to future conflicts and strike distant adversaries. The National Security Act of 1947 described the organizing principle of the Air Force:
In general the United States Air Force shall include aviation forces both combat and service not otherwise assigned. It shall be organized, trained, and equipped primarily for prompt and sustained offensive and defensive operations. The Air Force shall be responsible for the preparation of the air forces necessary for the effective prosecution of war except as other wise assigned and, in accordance with integrated joint mobilization plans, for the expansion of the peacetime components of the Air Force to meet the needs of war.

Gen Norton Schwartz, the Air Force chief of staff, apparently having the foresight to see past current conflicts, has begun to lay the ground work for prioritizing Air Force functions for the future.

The Normandy invasion was based on a deep-seated faith in the power of the Air Forces in overwhelming numbers to intervene in the land battle . . . making it possible for a small force of land troops to invade a continent. . . . Without that Air Force, without its independent power, entirely aside from its ability to sweep the enemy air forces out of the sky, without its power to intervene in the ground battle, that invasion would have been fantastic, it would have been more than fantastic, it would have been criminal. 
14
The need for air superiority is no less important today than it was in 1944. Although the doctrinal definition of air superiority leaves room for varying interpretations, it is best understood as local control of the air, which enables air, land, and naval forces to operate without inter ference from the enemy.

One must not undervalue the significance of air superiority to joint op erations and to the Air Force's ability to deliver strategic effects inde pendently. Control of the air, which enables victory on the land and at sea, may become even more influential in the future. Hence, ceasing production of the F-22 Raptor may be a mistake if the nation continues to demand that the Air Force maintain broad air superiority. Accusing the service's leadership of suffering from "next-war-itis" and failing to concentrate on the ground campaigns of Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates relieved both Air Force Secretary Michael Wynne and Chief of Staff T. Michael Moseley in 2008-ostensibly for failure to maintain proper stewardship of the nu clear arsenal.

Maintaining air superiority with fewer less capable aircraft will prove difficult. With the appearance of the MiG-15 during the Korean War, the Air Force nearly lost air superiority with its less capable F-80 Shooting Stars. Fortunately Gen Hoyt Vandenberg, the Air Force chief of staff, re leased more of the advanced F-86 Sabres to the theater of operations, re gaining dominance of the skies over the peninsula. If the Air Force can not match an adversary with sufficiently capable aircraft, it may be forced to move away from more than 60 years of theater air superiority as a fundamental tenet/ability of American airpower, and Soldiers and Marines may no longer be able to take the friendly skies for granted.
DODD 5100.01 requires the Air Force to "conduct offensive and defen sive operations to gain and maintain space superiority," but significant disagreement exists as to whether the United States can or should dominate space.

From the Air Feature early warning systems and their operators travels through cyberspace. Data then moves to analysts for processing, exploitation, and dissemi nation. Early warning systems compromised by a cyberspace attack could leave the nation vulnerable to a strike. At a time when nuclear and ballistic missile technologies are proliferating, such a compromise is unacceptable. Second, command and control of the air sovereignty mission depends on cyberspace for transmission of critical informa tion. Something as simple as compromising the integrity of data in these networks would suffice to seriously degrade a core homeland de fense function. 
47
Clear evidence indicates that China and Russia, potential adversaries in a peer competition, are investing heavily in cyber warfare capabili ties.

50
Irregular warfare is also an area of concern as nonstate actors prove adept at waging cyber warfare from remote locations using less sophis ticated methods and equipment. The reported hacking of video feeds from American drones by Iranian-backed insurgents in 2009 repre sents one example. 
51
52
From the Air Feature the Air Force will undoubtedly face opposed network operations from nonstate actors. Establishing the right balance in cyberspace will con stitute a problem that the Air Force must solve with regard to peer and irregular adversaries alike. Moreover, although the Air Force probably will not have exclusive responsibility for cyberspace, the service should expect to ensure its own ability to operate in that domain.
Given its ubiquitous nature, cyberspace is the most pressing core func tion in need of attention. Unlike other functions in which the Air Force historically assumed leadership in innovative technology, cyber space has become the one area in which the service trails in techno logical development and has constantly asserted a reactive rather than proactive strategy in dealing with cyber threats. Turning the Air Force into a cyber fortress not only keeps adversaries out but also keeps Air men in-harming mission accomplishment. If the Air Force wishes to operate in an environment where opposed network operations are the norm, then it must develop an alternative approach to protecting the integrity of information.

Cyber Command addresses this challenge in its strategic vision: "Deliv ering cyberspace career force capabilities will require changes to the personnel system to identify qualified Airmen with critical skills for presentation to combatant commands when required." 57 Should the Air Force fail, the consequences will prove significant. The simple fact is that China, a potential competitor, already possesses a larger pool of skilled cyber personnel than the United States-a pool that the People's Liberation Army is aggressively expanding.

In his book Air Power, Budiansky notes that "after every war, soldiers curse the generals and politicians who neglected to anticipate and pre pare for war. Airmen, more than most, would draw an especially bitter pleasure in this pastime, forever repeating stories that demonstrated the obtuse shortsightedness of the great men who had dismissed the importance of the airplane."

Certainly, Afghanistan and, until recently, Iraq remain the most press ing security concerns, but they too will diminish in their significance as the military attains mission objectives and as budget constraints and war weariness take their toll. Ensuring that the Air Force can serve the na tion in its capacity as a strategic arm represents a responsibility for which failure is not an option. Lengthy design, development, and de ployment times dictate that the Air Force begin planning for a security environment in which peer competition assails the existing order.

The United States has long thought of itself as an island protected by the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Technology, however, is bridging these
From the Air Feature watery expanses. In the future, as in the past, the Air Force's core function of global precision attack, whether conventional or nuclear, will be important to homeland defense. Bombers designed for global precision attack, for example, send a clear signal to adversaries that the US Air Force can strike anywhere on the earth with speed and pre cision. Nuclear-capable bombers and the remaining ICBMs also deter adversaries from attacking the United States. These capabilities (con ventional or nuclear) have served the nation well for half a century and will become increasingly important in the years ahead. Develop ments in ballistic missile and other technologies bring enemies within striking distance.
Fortunately, defending the nation's vital interests against peer compe tition over the next two decades may not require major combat opera tions. Much more likely is the deterrence of a potential competitor from challenging the status quo with options for global precision at tack. 
67
68
From the Air Feature from altering the status quo through global precision attack is the foun dation of effective American strategy. In the decades ahead, the Air Force is best suited to deliver the strategic effects suggested by Friedman.
The nation's potential competitors understand the importance of American power projection, illustrated by China's focus on A2/AD, ballistic missile, and cyberspace capabilities. That country's expansion of the People's Liberation Army Air Force and People's Liberation Army Navy, together with its reduction of the People's Liberation Army, signals where China considers its strategic interests most vul nerable. Continuing to hold adversaries at risk with formidable options for global precision attack is in the best interest of the United States.
As the opening campaign of Enduring Freedom demonstrated, the Air Force, unlike other services, can generate strategic effects any where in the world.

Today, however, global precision attack is in precipitous decline be cause a much smaller Air Force continues to depend on many of the
From the Air Feature same global attack platforms it did when the Berlin Wall fell; indeed, some were in service when East Germany erected the wall. If, as Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Mich√®le Flournoy suggests, the United States will take a leading role in defending the "global commons," then the nation will need sufficient global precision attack to do so. 
71
During the previous generation, global attack platforms experienced a slow, steady decline in both numbers and capability. Only our 19 B-2 bombers are capable of penetrating advanced antiaircraft defenses; fielding a new global precision attack bomber is imperative. Although design and production of the "2018 bomber" are currently delayed, ini tially five blocks were planned for production between 2018 and 2025with the initial Block 10 configuration (24 aircraft) serving as the Air Force's last manned bomber. Subsequent blocks would integrate tech nologies on the leading edge and continue to improve US capabilities.

Finally, the retirement of air launched cruise missiles from the arse nal and the unsettled fate of the much shorter-range joint air-to-surface standoff missile and its extended-range variant create a decline in the Air Force's critical capability. 
74
From the Air Feature American aircraft. As China, Iran, and other possible adversaries extend the range of their antiaircraft defenses, the Air Force must be able to defeat these systems or face a world of highly contested global commons.
Although global precision attack is the kinetic element of power pro jection, airlift enables the Air Force to deploy personnel and materiel rapidly to any point on the globe when and where needed. 
75
76
At its simplest, airlift swiftly moves people and materiel across great distances. Because the United States has a history of taking war to its enemies rather than waiting for the fighting to reach its shores, the homeland has not seen the ravages of conflict in more than a century. Thus, airlift has an indirect role in homeland defense-principally in military support to civil authorities. Mitigating the effects of a largescale disaster is the primary role of airlift in homeland defense.
Projecting American power to the far reaches of the globe during peer competition will remain an important function for airlift. Examples of such Herculean efforts abound. Whether Gen William Tunner's airlifters flying supplies over "the Hump" to Gen Joseph Stilwell in the China-Burma-India theater during World War II, Gen Curtis LeMay's creation of the Berlin airlift in response to a Soviet blockade, or the
From the Air Feature transport of military personnel and supplies to the Persian Gulf during Operation Desert Shield, airlift plays a strategic role in the ever-present geostrategic competition against peer/near-peer competitors. 
77
Enduring Freedom and Iraqi Freedom, operations involving irregular warfare, serve as excellent illustrations of the significance of airlift in this type of conflict. Air Mobility Command reports that by the end of 2009, the Air Force had carried 9.66 million passengers and 3.92 mil lion tons of cargo during 529,981 sorties in support of these two opera tions. 
78
79
Airlift has become the backbone of American expeditionary warfare, making it a critical component of any strategy. Representing the ma jority of Air Mobility Command's inventory, the C-130 Hercules first entered service in 1956, and the latest model (C-130J) appeared as re cently as 1999. The Air Force, Air Force Reserve, and National Guard fly more than 400 of these durable aircraft-the nation's principal in tratheater airlifter.

With few exceptions, projecting airpower depends on the Air Force's refueling tankers to extend the range of American and allied airpower.
As the only country in the world with the aerial refueling capability to carry out global combat operations, the United States boasts tankers that greatly enhance the operational scope of US military aircraft and that of its allies.

87
Irregular warfare against nonstate actors places a high demand on the Air Force. For air-breathing platforms, persistence, which increases mis sion effectiveness, is a particularly important characteristic because of the often unexpected and brief opportunities that arise for striking fleeting targets. Aerial refueling gives ISR and air-to-ground attack aircraft that per sistence by increasing loiter time in places such as Afghanistan and Iraq. Regarding future irregular conflicts in which the United States is unlikely to have a large ground presence, RPAs with a combined ISR and strike mission will need aerial refueling as they undertake long-endurance mis sions and serve as a key instrument of American power projection. 
88
Despite aerial refueling's importance in supporting many of the other critical core functions in all three scenarios, some people fail to appre ciate its ability to enable long-range operations. Currently 400 KC-135 Stratotankers, manufactured during the Eisenhower, Kennedy, and Johnson administrations, serve as the Air Force's primary aerial refuelers.

Moreover, the service will require signifi cant investments to replace the aging platforms that conduct this mis sion. The Air Force has made significant progress in maintaining exist ing weapon systems and procuring new ones, but pressure to reduce military spending could jeopardize sustainment and modernization of the fleet.
The history of military aviation is replete with examples of aircraft serving as ISR platforms. During the Civil War, the Army of the Potomac used manned balloons to determine Confederate troop strength and monitor movements of the Army of Northern Virginia.

Among the Air Force's oldest and most important surveillance roles is its provision of early warning in the event of an attack against the United States. Initially Air Defense Command, the largest of the Air Force's original major commands, had responsibility for early warning and homeland defense. 
95
96
From the Air Feature tic missile and nuclear weapons technology as well as continued peer competition, the North American Aerospace Defense Command and its early warning mission remain an essential part of the nation's de fense-an area that benefits from the Air Force's significant contribu tion to the broader ISR core function.
Major combat operations against a large conventional force present a set of distinct, difficult issues for combatant commanders, including the development of comprehensive battlespace awareness. The sub stantial global ISR assets of the Air Force can greatly reduce the fog of war by providing a constant presence above the battlespace as they send information to commanders. Conflict with a peer/near-peer ad versary would likely necessitate very different assets than those de ployed to Afghanistan today. One should also highlight the fact that su perior battlespace awareness acts as a force multiplier, permitting fewer ground forces to attain tactical objectives against a larger enemy force. Since ISR stands to play a major role in future peer competition, it merits priority among the Air Force core functions.
Operations in Afghanistan and Iraq often serve as public examples of airborne ISR's part in contemporary irregular warfare.

ISR contributes to the joint fight and cannot be replicated by any other service. However, the current focus on RPAs (Reaper, Predator, and Global Hawk) capable of performing ISR and strike missions may not

The nuclear arsenal remains the most important capability for de fending national sovereignty from an attack by a peer competitor or rogue regime. Nothing else gives an adversary more reason for pause than nuclear weapons. Composed of three legs, the nuclear triad-ICBMs, manned bombers, and submarine-launched ballistic missilesgives the United States a deterrent force that makes direct attack on the nation a costly choice. The Air Force fields two of these platforms. 
102
After the United States dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Naga saki in August 1945, the distinctiveness of those weapons soon became
From the Air Feature apparent. As the world began to comprehend the power of thermo nuclear devices, developed in 1951, preventing nuclear war between the United States and the Soviet Union became the principal, if not the only, purpose of those weapons. Without question, deterrence was the most significant and successful policy of the Cold War-and it has not failed to prevent a nuclear holocaust. 
103
104
105
As nuclear weapons material and technology continue to spread, de terring current and future adversaries (nuclear and conventional) will remain central to American national security. Furthermore, because US policy precludes responding to biological and chemical attacks in kind, nuclear weapons provide an effective deterrent against these threats. 106 The ICBM's responsiveness is accompanied by bombers as the only leg useful in signaling escalation or de-escalation. Clearly, nu clear deterrence operations remain a critical capability. In today's strategic environment, some national security analysts be lieve that the most probable use of a nuclear weapon will come from a nonstate actor or, more likely, a rogue regime such as North Korea or Iran seeking to strike a devastating blow against the United States. 
107
From the Air Feature a force capable of performing such a mission. Rogue regimes seldom negotiate in good faith and tend to respond negatively to diplomatic overtures that would limit their nuclear capability, as evidenced by 20 years of fruitless efforts involving carrots and sticks to convince North Korea to halt its development of nuclear weapons. Additionally, cashstrapped nations such as North Korea could possibly sell nuclear weap ons to terrorist networks that would have extreme difficulty building a weapon of their own.
Past experience suggests that terror networks and their state sup porters are influenced by existential risks and rewards, which offers reason to believe that a visible limited-strike capability may assist in deterring a nuclear attack against the United States. 
108
109
The United States should retain a credible nuclear strike option, but the preferred alternative calls for improved multinational nonprolif eration efforts and nuclear forensics that will reduce the risk of nu clear terrorism by making nuclear material more difficult to acquire and anonymity more difficult to achieve. Extending the nuclear um brella over America's allies such as Germany, Japan, and South Korea, for example, has proven effective in convincing these governments to forgo development of their own nuclear weapons programs.

111
112
In the final calculation, deterrence equals capability plus will, leav ing the United States little option other than maintaining a limited strike capability and nuclear doctrine to support it. Current Air Force doctrine does provide for the limited use of nuclear weapons to con vince the enemy of the United States' commitment to using the neces sary degree of force to meet objectives. 
113
If the nation's nuclear deterrent is to remain credible, the United States must refocus on the core function of nuclear deterrence by maintain ing a nuclear arsenal and delivery platforms of sufficient size and di versity to assure both allies and adversaries that the United States has the capability and will to employ nuclear weapons to terminate large and small conflicts as quickly as possible on favorable terms.

People working in the highest levels of government wish to reduce the nuclear arsenal. The same strategic guidance that reaffirmed com mitment to the nuclear deterrent force also stated that "it is possible that our deterrence goals can be achieved with a smaller nuclear force, which would reduce the number of nuclear weapons in our inventory as well as their role in U.S. national security strategy" (emphasis in original).

Given the reality of today's fiscal resources, concentrating on the nu clear arsenal makes economic sense. With entitlement spending con suming an ever-increasing percentage of the federal budget, defense spending is declining.

Over the past two decades, the Air Force has spent considerable ef fort and resources meeting the airpower requirements of US Central Command. Beginning with Desert Shield, Air Force major combat op erations in the Middle East, the Balkans, and Southwest Asia, as well as contingency and crisis operations in Haiti, Indonesia, Japan, and
From the Air Feature elsewhere have continued unabated. The constant demands of major operations such as Desert Storm, Northern Watch, Southern Watch, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom require a heavy focus on the tactical and operational aspects of airpower, which has played a role in delaying the recapitalization of some platforms necessary to conduct Air Force core functions at the strategic level of war. While the Air Force is in the midst of acquiring the next generation of multirole fighters, airborne ISR RPAs, tankers, and possibly even remotely pi loted long-range penetrating bombers, it still has aging platforms that have long passed their expected service life. Consequently, the Air Force must either engage in costly modifications to maintain combatready status or modify the missions of these aircraft to adjust to the changing threat environment (e.g., using the B-52 as a launch platform for nuclear cruise missiles rather than a penetrating bomber).
In many instances, technological innovation and the capabilities of the nation's adversaries make these systems highly vulnerable. Thus, if the United States desires to maintain an Air Force capable of global vigilance, reach, and power, it needs a clear strategic vision that explains the service's objectives over the coming decades. Such a vision may then guide acquisition and planning. The fact that the service suffers from acquisition requirements well in excess of likely funding is cer tainly reason for concern. However, the Air Force has weathered diffi cult days throughout its relatively short history and may do so again.
If the myriad of defense experts are correct in suggesting that the economic and military growth of Asia-China particularly-signals a shift in American interests to the Pacific, then the region's geography may lead to a renaissance of airpower.

To illustrate the challenge posed by these vast distances, consider that a pilot must log only 3,638 miles from New York to Paris but 6,255 miles from Los Angeles to Beijing. If the United States wishes to protect its interests in an environment where distances are greatly extended and A2/AD strategies compound the problem, it will do so in part because the Air Force offers innovative solutions to future problems. The "core" of those solutions should concentrate on functions that contribute to the Air Force's strategic mission. ÔÇµ

The R ecently, the Department of Defense increased its emphasis on irregular warfare (IW), a concept difficult to define although most military professionals know it when they see it. Identify ing IW as one of the department's core mission areas, the Quadrennial Roles and Missions Review Report of 2009 then defines it as "operations in which the joint force conducts protracted regional and global cam paigns against state and non-state adversaries to subvert, coerce, attrite, and exhaust adversaries rather than defeat them through direct conventional military confrontation. Irregular warfare emphasizes winning the support of the relevant populations, promoting friendly political authority, and eroding adversary control, influence, and sup port."

In the context of Operation Enduring Freedom, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) is helping Afghanistan organize, train, and equip its forces to the benefit of the nascent Afghan military, the Afghan government, and, ultimately, the civilian populace. By conducting suc cessful IW operations, the Afghan military gains self-confidence and encouragement from the NATO community. Moreover, by supporting these missions, the Afghan government demonstrates its legitimacy as the ruling power against the Taliban insurgency. Such operations high light the insurgents' inability to provide significant benefits on par with those of the Afghan government that would tangibly improve the liveli hood, security, and well-being of the predominantly rural Afghan masses.
As part of the Combined Air Power Transition Force and now the NATO Air Training Command-Afghanistan (NATC-A) from December 2009 to November 2010, I served as an air advisor to the Afghan air force (AAF). According to the Air Advisor Academy's charter, air advi sors serve to "apply aviation expertise to assess, train, advise, assist, and equip foreign personnel in the development and application of their aviation resources to meet their national needs in support of U.S. interests."

The AAF is a highly visible representation of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan-an administration that is struggling to establish its legitimacy among a far-flung and fiercely self-reliant population. Airpower in the form of the AAF's Mi-17s lets the govern ment reach the people, no matter how remote their location, and as sist them with their basic and humanitarian needs. This use of air Views power demonstrates government responsiveness and commitment that Afghans will not likely forget. More importantly, from a US per spective, facilitating this kind of unmistakable connectivity between the government and its population lies at the very center of NATO's strategy in Afghanistan. According to former secretary of defense Robert Gates, "Where possible, U.S. strategy is to employ indirect approachesprimarily through building the capacity of partner governments and their security forces-to prevent festering problems from turning into crises that require costly and controversial direct military intervention. In this kind of effort, the capabilities of the United States' allies and partners may be as important as its own, and building their capacity is arguably as important as, if not more so than, the fighting the United States does itself."

Part of the NATO Training Mission-Afghanistan, the NATC-A plays an important role in the current mission of building a partnership with the Afghan government. Officially, the NATC-A-headquartered at Camp Eggers in Kabul, Afghanistan, and organized similarly to a US Air Force wing as the 438th Air Expeditionary Wing-seeks to "set the conditions for a professional, fully independent and operationally ca pable Afghan 'air force' that meets the security requirements of Af ghanistan today . . . and tomorrow."

The mission of the AAF entails "provid[ing] trained and ready air men and soldiers to execute critical tasks from the air in support of the Afghan National Army and when directed by the [Ministry of Defense] and General Staff, to support by air the civil authorities of Afghanistan at all levels." 10 That mission includes transportation of the president and distinguished visitors, casualty evacuation, air mobility, training, and close air attack in support of the Afghan National Security Forces. 
11
Organizationally, the AAF functions as a distinct subdivision of the Afghan National Army, currently divided into six geographically as signed infantry corps and one capital division, supported by the single air force.

In February 2010, heavy snows triggered deadly avalanches that killed some 150 people in the Salang Pass in north-central Afghanistan.

The mission also recovered many people killed in the calamity, a noteworthy achievement in light of Muslims' sensitivity to the quick recovery and burial of their dead. The AAF fulfills a requirement of the Afghan National Security Forces to move soldiers killed in action from the battlefield to their final ancestral burial site within 48 hours of notification. It does so by using a combination of rotary-and fixed Views wing aircraft to ensure timeliness while retaining maximum capability for battlefield support. Further, the AAF has an obligation to recover and evacuate injured Afghan National Security Forces personnel, begin ning mission execution within one hour of notification and delivering any wounded Afghan National Army soldier to a level-two (comprehen sive trauma care) medical facility within five hours of notification. The AAF's transfer of patients throughout the country elicited an immensely favorable reaction from both those individuals and their families.
On 28 and 29 July 2010, severe flooding hit the northwest corner of Afghanistan and the surrounding area. 
15
At that time, the governor of Kunar requested that the AAF rescue more people from the floodwaters in the Kunar Valley, a location noto rious for routine attacks from Taliban small arms and rocket propelled grenades against AAF helicopters. Nevertheless, the combined Afghan/ US crews began recovering those in need of lifesaving assistance. Notably, during these missions a large Taliban flag could be seen to the east of the recovery zone where the crews off-loaded the recovered personnel. Afghan civilians on scene informed the crews that this flag served as an unambiguous signal that the Taliban was observing the recovery operations in the area. Despite their unmistakably close proximity, Taliban forces opted not to attack the aircraft and crews that Views day because of the essential assistance provided by the AAF to them and their families. Moreover, during these missions Afghan civilians took pictures of the event with their cell phone cameras. Despite the extremely poor weather and high-threat environment, the crews received credit from NATO's International Security Assistance Force for rescuing almost 2,100 Afghan civilians from the flood and minimizing loss of life. 
16
These same floods resulted in thousands perishing in nearby Paki stan. Flush with confidence gained by completing the formidable op eration in Afghanistan, the AAF deployed to Pakistan the following month to help with the multinational flood-relief efforts there, adding support to the Afghan government's claim of legitimacy with both the Afghan populace and neighboring states (fig.

With the help of the NATC-A, AAF helicopters also lent extensive sup port to several humanitarian missions. NATC-A members and AAF leadership developed a working relationship with two humanitarian organizations-Global Roots and the Central Asian Institute (made fa mous by the book Three Cups of Tea by Greg Mortenson).

During these missions, members of both the NATC-A and the AAF in teracted with local men, women, and children, who saw that the Afghan military could operate freely in most areas of the country (fig

Undaunted by the threats, NATC-A mentors formulated a plan to exe cute the mission and recover the ballots under cover of darkness. (Only a few AAF aircrews had qualified to fly the Mi-17 using night vision goggles, and they were assigned exclusively to the Presidential Airlift Squadron.) After hearing a briefing on the potentially dangerous mission, the AAF crew members eagerly volunteered and became part of the planning cell. Despite poor weather and the Taliban threats, two AAF Mi-17s, escorted by two US Army AH-64s, recovered the ballots successfully. Lt Col Qudratullah Hotaki, one of the AAF pilots who flew on the mission, remarked that in his 30 years of experience with helicopters (which included flying with the Russians and Northern Alliance), he had neither seen nor participated in anything of this magnitude or complexity. The mission showcased the rapidly escalating operational capabilities of the AAF, thanks to the NATC-A's training, support, and mentorship. Similarly, according to Brig Gen Asadullah Hashimi, com mander of the Kabul Wing Operations Group, despite the difficulty of the mission and the presence of national controversy (with respect to the fairness of the elections), it was good for the Afghan people to see the AAF executing such a complicated operation. He also observed Views that as Afghanistan gained more experience holding elections, the pro cess would become more transparent and less challenging. Overall, the AAF's support of these elections had a major strategic impact on the Afghan populace insofar as it illustrated the growing competence and proficiency of the Afghan military and government.
In September 2010, the government of Afghanistan turned to the AAF's helicopter force to assist with a problem affecting the country's economic structure. Nervous Afghan depositors had withdrawn the equivalent of $180 million from the Kabul Bank over the course of two days. 
19
The Afghan government determined that cash deliveries to banks throughout Afghanistan would solve the problem. Because security con cerns made land transportation untenable, the government tasked the AAF to make the deliveries. Most of the destinations did not have access to a nearby runway; therefore, AAF helicopters were pressed into ser vice. Admittedly, the strategic effect of a Kabul Bank collapse is hard to estimate since most Afghans do not use banks in the same way as the citizens of industrialized nations, but keeping the bank solvent certainly maintained the Afghan government's legitimacy. Its failure would have served as additional propaganda for the Taliban insurgency-a sign of the government's inability to care for its people's basic needs.
The unique environmental, political, and topographical nature of Afghanistan lends itself to extensive use of rotary-wing aircraft in sup Views port of numerous IW missions. Current US strategy depends upon a strong, effective central government (which Afghanistan has never had) that is visible and relevant to a population scattered across a huge area and therefore difficult to reach. Development of Afghan air power-a rotary-wing capability in particular-provides a direct, uniquely powerful illustration of such a government in Afghanistan. Specifically, as noted in Field Manual 3-24 / Marine Corps Warfighting Publication 3-33.5, Counterinsurgency, "the government [must secure] its citizens continuously, [sustain] and [build] legitimacy through effec tive governance, . . . effectively [isolate] the insurgency, and . . . man age and meet the expectations of the nation's entire population." 
20
The rescue of a few thousand Afghans certainly might incline those individuals less committed to the insurgency to shift their allegiance to the Afghan government. The video taken by the Afghan public affairs officer, the cell phone pictures taken by civilians, and the school sup plies delivered by AAF helicopters might also influence a tribal chief to realign his tribe's loyalty.
Clearly, building the Afghan government's airpower capacity lies well within our national security interests. It is equally clear that the AAF represents a requisite component of IW operations in Afghani stan. The NATC-A mentorship program that abetted missions support ing strategic-level goals, described in this article, deserves nurturing and maintaining. As noted by President Obama in 2009, "a campaign against extremism will not succeed with bullets or bombs alone."

However, the US presence and the special relationship with the United Kingdom has formed only part of the European defense equa tion. Although President Charles de Gaulle withdrew French forces from NATO's integrated military command structure in 1966, France remained a member of NATO and a deeply responsible part of the European community. France and the United Kingdom have been close partners for decades, but developments in the early years of the twenty-first century have brought them even closer together. Without doubt, President Nicolas Sarkozy's decision in 2009 to rejoin the inte grated command structure of NATO is a significant factor, raising France's military power within British consciousness. The signing of the Anglo-French treaty on defense and security cooperation in No vember 2010 is just as much a factor, drawing the nations inextricably nearer and inculcating a burden-sharing culture between them.

Preventive air operations over Libya in 2011 highlighted the signifi cance of the Arm√©e de l'air (French air force) as a European expedi tionary air power. Yet the apparent arrival of the French on the Euro pean and international scene is nothing new: the Arm√©e de l'air had engaged in coalition operations over Bosnia, Kosovo, and Iraq, and re mains active in the skies over Afghanistan today. Indeed, the rich his tory of contemporary combined air operations between the Royal Air Force and the Arm√©e de l'air enabled Anglo-French forces to act effec tively and rapidly after the United Nations' endorsement of UN Secu rity Council Resolution 1973, authorizing the protection of Libyan citizens and the enforcement of a no-fly zone over Libyan territory. With the US Air Force "leading from behind," operations over Libya were perhaps indicative of a new paradigm in European expeditionary air operations.

Within this relationship is an emerging line of unified exploration steered by collaborative activity among strategy teams representing each of the air forces through the United Kingdom's Air Staff, the French Centre d'√©tudes strat√©giques a√©rospatiales, and the US Strategic Studies Group. Coined the Trilateral Strategy Steering Group, this tri partite team draws strength from its constituent members' diverse, col lective means of airpower advocacy, which range to various degrees among the teams from the respective air force leadership across de fense, internal service, academia, and both the private and public sec tors. Leveraging off each air force's investment in strategic thinking, the Trilateral Strategy Steering Group seeks to contribute to establish ing a resilient steady state of collaborative engagement, aiding adapta tion to an uncertain future, and articulating the airpower message of the strength, value, and relevance of our relationship. Doing so will better inform our own joint compatriots; the broader defense commu nity, including political decision makers; and the wider international community of air forces.
Conducting more exercises with each other, as with each of our other allies, has served as the bedrock of contemporary Western coali tion air operations. With a common understanding of the roles and employment of airpower, the political will to lead air operations when called upon, and, crucially, senior airmen having the operational ex pertise to do so, the Royal Air Force and the Arm√©e de l'air are well placed to play a leading role in the assurance of Europe's continuing security while the US Air Force adjusts its force structures and role on the continent. Yet impediments remain, and the optimization of our air forces' European and global effectiveness, synergy, affordability, Views and responsiveness will require improved command and control pro cesses and infrastructure. It also demands an increased willingness to share information, constrained neither to the intelligence axis nor in terms of with whom to share (to whatever appropriate degree) that in formation. Lastly, in an era of global austerity, such optimization re quires the confidence to parse sovereign capabilities and increase our mutual interdependence.

The Impact of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 on Domestic Disaster Response Col John L. Conway III, USAF, Retired T his year's National Defense Authorization Act amended public law to allow the secretary of defense (upon the direction of the president) to mobilize reserve components involuntarily up to 120 days in response to natural or man-made disasters. 
1
Although governors have long had the authority to mobilize National Guard troops, reserve units have remained unavailable due to the ab sence of a mechanism to recall them involuntarily for domestic disas ter relief. This situation became apparent two weeks after Hurricane Katrina's landfall when the approximately 66,000 military personnel present in the affected area included only about 1,900 reservists (to gether with 45,871 members of the Army and Air National Guard and 18,276 active duty troops). This change will act as a force multiplier, but most natural disasters do not rise to the level of federal involvement; consequently, members of the National Guard will remain each state's first "first responders" for most incidents. Moreover, the event must overwhelm state re sources, and the governor must ask for declaration of a major disaster before the president can approve federal aid. If support from the De partment of Defense (DOD) is necessary, it makes sense to call up local title 10 reserves before summoning active duty assets because of the shorter distances involved (in most cases), their detailed local knowl edge, and, obviously, the availability of local support. Texas, and at Dobbins Air Reserve Base, Georgia, and its new Medevac Blackhawk helicopters at Fort Knox, Kentucky. All of these platforms, potentially available in a declared emergency, can cover a wide variety of regional disaster scenarios and are present in numbers that allow response to more than one crisis at a time. Beyond airlift, all four title 10 reserve components have medical personnel, engineering and transportation units, and a host of other specialized expertise that they could bring to bear in any major disaster scenario-and that they could bring to the fight via organic transportation. Despite this wealth of new resources, the devil is in the details.
Like their active duty counterparts, title 10 reservists cannot be called up without the same adherence to the procedure outlined in the National Response Plan (now called the National Response Framework), which determines the type of federal assistance necessary to respond to a governor's request. As chronicled in the White House's Federal Response to Hurricane Katrina: Lessons Learned, this series of actions is lengthy: "From the time a request is initiated until the military force or capability is delivered to the disaster site requires a 21-step process." 2
Therefore, day-one disaster support by title 10 reservists is neither bureaucratically practical nor planned for.
When state officials need federal military support, they should ask for exactly what they require rather than repeat the famous "Send me everything!" plea by Louisiana's governor after Hurricane Katrina. The challenge lies in understanding the vast array of reserve units within each state (and those of nearby states) and their capabilities in order to make an informed call for assistance. But this information cannot be cobbled together within two days' landfall of a hurricane. It demands prior planning and commitment. As the saying goes, the day after a di saster is no time to exchange business cards. The following suggestions would enhance the process.
Start locally. Adjutants general should survey all of the title 10 re serve units within their respective states to compile data on equip ment, personnel, and assigned missions. Canvassing Army and Air Force Reserve units should be easy because of the similar nature of their National Guard counterparts. Understanding the markedly differ ent Navy Reserve and Marine Forces Reserve force structures, how ever, may prove a bit more daunting but certainly worth the effort. Next, it's time to meet these units face-to-face; receive mission brief ings; and, yes, exchange business cards. Liaison officers from each re serve component should be attached to each joint force headquartersstate to enhance the coordination and situational awareness process as envisioned in DOD Directive (DODD) 5105.83, National Guard Joint Force Headquarters-State (NG JFHQs-State).

Think regionally. Under a congressionally ratified arrangement known as the Emergency Management Assistance Compact, governors can call upon the resources of other states-including the National Guardduring emergencies. This concept proved its worth in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina when Guard units from all 50 states, three territo ries, and the District of Columbia mobilized to assist Louisiana and Views Mississippi, serving under the command of the adjutant general of the state they assisted. Reserve units from nearby states, subject to call-up under the newly amended law, would come under the title 10 chain of command in each state. Using the tactical airlift model from above, Air Force Reserve Command's C-130 units in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, and North Carolina, which are aligned on a map like a string of pearls, could provide close-by emergency airlift support to the entire South east coastline from Texas through Virginia and beyond. Calling upon title 10 reservists in neighboring states will pay the same dividends as those found under the Emergency Management Assistance Compact construct, and planning for them should occur in advance.
Plan nationally. US Northern Command, already key to the planning and response process for national disasters, should focus on under standing the disaster-relief capabilities and unique command relation ships of the title 10 reserve community. Headquarters Marine Forces Reserve, Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command, Headquarters Army Reserve, and Headquarters Navy Reserve also need to turn their attention to planning for disaster-relief augmentation. Of particular concern to all parties are liaison requirements, warning/notification processes, delineation of chains of command (operational control, ad ministrative control, and tactical control), and funding. Although DODD 5105.83 describes Army and Air Guard linkages to active duty forces, it needs revising to address title 10 reserve forces as well.
Exercise frequently. In the future, all local-, state-, and national-level disaster exercises should include mobilization of title 10 reserve forces, assuring an all-in approach to DOD disaster mitigation.

Colonel Conway (BA, MA, University of Alabama) is a military defense analyst at the Air Force Research Institute (AFRI), Maxwell AFB, Alabama. During his more than 30 years in the Air Force, he served as an intelligence officer with major assignments at Headquarters Air Intelligence Agency, North American Aerospace Defense Command, and the National Security Agency. He was the senior intelligence officer at Headquarters Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC), Robins AFB, Georgia, and held several wing and squadron intelligence assignments, including a combat tour with the II Direct Air Support Center in Pleiku Province, Republic of Vietnam. For his last active duty assignment, he was the chief, Counterdrug Support Division, Headquarters AFRC. Following active duty and prior to joining AFRI, Colonel Conway was a systems engineer ing and technical assistance contractor to the U-2 Directorate at the Warner Robins Air Logistics Center, Robins AFB, Georgia, and a civilian adviser to the commander, Gordon Regional Security Operations Center, Fort Gordon, Georgia. He is a frequent contributor to Air and Space Power Journal. Air warfare has come upon us so rapidly that the military in struction of Air Force officers has never been thought out and ana lyzed as a new military problem. The traditional army basic train ing has consequently served as the model for military instruction in the Air Force. Close-order drill, bivouacs, field exercises and the other common routine ground-training maneuvers are as much an introduction to military life for a young flyer as they are for a foot soldier. This approach overlooks the fact that each occupation has its own peculiar psychology, its own dialectics.
Flying, which has been a dream of mankind throughout his tory, adds a new dimension to man's existence. There is no experi ence in a flyer's life prior to his air training that prepares him for this dimension, whereas an infantryman learns to walk and to doubletime as a child, and a sailor learns the problems involved in han dling a ship through the experience of operating and directing a wheeled vehicle over a definite course. When we subject the flyer to the same basic military instruction as an infantryman, we not only delay his orientation to this new sphere-the air-but we doubly handicap him by forcing him to act two more long years as an infantryman.
As there is no preparation for the flyer in ordinary life, a spe cial emphasis is needed to steep him in his new element from the *Reprinted from Air University Quarterly Review 1, no. 2 (Fall 1947): 9-24.
very beginning of his military instruction. And emphasis means that he must be torn away from his habits of thinking of the earth as a place to be walked upon or driven over. The infantryman thinks of assaulting frontiers and breaking the resistance of armies. The sailor envisages the blockading of sea lanes, and victory through attrition and starvation. But total warfare, the new concept which has grown out of the development of the airplane, finds its most effective expression in the destruction of centers of production. The airman must be taught to think about methods which will para lyze the economy of an enemy nation; further on in this article, the study of economics is discussed as the major subject of general education which provides the airman with this knowledge.
The Air Force will never realize its full potentialities from its own element, the air, unless the airman is first allowed to develop his soldierly qualities out of this element. He must learn to look at everything from the air, including his problems of drill, discipline, comradeship, courage, organization, and administration. The pre flight inspection, for example, might be the basic act around which all the discipline of the Air Force centers or grows. By learning to look at the world of the air, all misleading symbols, such as closeorder drill, would be done away with. If flying is at the center of the military instruction program, other related subjects will fall into place naturally and acquire greater meaning, "care and feed ing of troops," "transportation and troop movement," "military his tory and biography," and "survival"-all these subjects which have become complicated in fast-moving aerial warfare should be ap proached by airmen who are familiar with the possibilities and limitations of Air Power.
A subject of military instruction that is lightly touched upon in the Air Force is "physical training." All voluntary or ordered hardship, such as training to get along with little or uncomfortable sleep, to survive on short rations, to know something about self sufficiency, should be included in military instruction. In the past, the Air Force has been able to provide its men with more conve niences than were necessary. It is fine if this can be done without interfering with operations, but unless the men have exerted them selves at some time to sacrifice these comforts, constant grumbling will always plague the field commander. The programs of physical training should not lead officers to think that they are passively undergoing this as a training, when in reality they are showing themselves capable of surviving a rugged experience. As long as we call it "physical training," we shall have no lasting results be cause the exertion must be an attainment of the character and not of the muscles.
The Air Force was founded and developed to full maturity, in only thirty years, under the pressure of two wars. This precocious growth has hindered the establishment of great traditions which mean permanency in any institution, for without a heroic past no really hopeful future is possible. This is a secret of institutional life which must be recognized in the Air Force. Continual neglect of tradition might lead to an argument by the other services that the Air Force is not permanent, but merely a new development which itself is now superseded by guided missiles. Therefore, the Air Force must insist that today it is the heir and the instrument which carries on the great military traditions of this country. In its explo ration of new frontiers, in its responsibility as the first line of de fense, and in its readiness to dissent from untenable military opin Historical Highlight ions, the Air Force represents the continuation of the achievements of Lewis and Clark, of Fremont, of Perry, of Byrd. Our present pioneering in the Arctic and our explorations in the ionosphere represent a modern conquest of frontiers. The study of military history and biography should be included as an essential part of the military instruction program in all service schools so that this background could be added to the consciousness of the officers of the present Air Force.
The second element of education-specialist training-is an outgrowth of the union of economics and experimental science. Science has endowed technicism with the possibility of limitless growth, and industry has applied this knowledge in the develop ment of innumerable diverse occupations. Specialization has thus become the means for advancement in modern society, yet we know that a wisely ordered society cannot be wholly controlled by specialists, and this same condition holds true for the Air Force. Modern warfare cannot be fought by the general-duty officer or soldier, but neither can the expert be allowed to determine what chances will be taken, for the expert is a specialist only in ma terials and techniques. Training a pilot in electronics will not pro duce a better commander, for it is not the possession of techniques that defines leadership. This situation was evident during the war, when many squadron commanders who had been in the Air Force long enough to have been thoroughly cross-trained were incapable of providing the leadership which the position required.
In politics, in art, in social usages, in the other sciences, the expert is apt to be an ignorant man. Because he knows his own tiny corner of the universe, he is led to believe that he may dominate Historical Highlight fields outside his profession. An examination of the graphic pre sentation of the "Army Air Force Educational System," depicting the career outlook of an Air Force officer, discloses no evidence which shows the specialist, despite his cross-training, growing into a wise, mature leader. The quality of leadership proceeds from the inner convictions of a man, and no amount of mechanical knowhow can substitute for this essential.
Despite the dangers in a system of specialization, no one can dismiss the value and necessity of a division of labor either in mod ern industrial society or in the modern army. The extent to which technological developments have been applied to military weap ons staggers the imagination. Today the Air Force makes more use of these complex weapons than any other arm or service, and there fore it requires technical schools for instructing technicians which are comparable to the shops and laboratories in industry. Gone are the days in which basically qualified soldiers could man the sev eral branches of the army. It has been necessary to diversify labor within the military establishment, and the classification system for Military Occupational Specialties has become similar to that of Civilian Occupational Specialties. Although the positions are broadly defined as possible, the number approaches a thousand, with twelve different specialties for enlisted radar mechanics alone. The training of individual specialties does not involve difficult edu cational problems, for the science of job analysis and the improve ment of training materials have greatly facilitated the specialist training of an unskilled soldier.
Today when real technical progress is achieved in a particular field, it is usually due to a combination of two or more existing specialties. Thus experimental science is science in a constant flux, Historical Highlight and it is anti-specialistic. The intrenched specialists usually fight such integration, declaring it to be unwise, or unnecessary, or im practicable, or of merely transitory value. However, the profusion of cultural and technical possessions is such today that it threatens to engulf mankind. It is urgent, therefore, that we base our special ist training, its methods and instructors, upon the plain, humble principle that the student cannot learn all that we would like him to know. Since all officers and enlisted men have become specialists within the military profession, the most serious task now is the necessity of developing within each specialist a larger view of his contribution to the total social effort. This is possible only if he is given a broad familiarity with the men and ideas which comprise his heritage.
The remainder of this article will deal with general education, its definition, theory, development, content, and necessity in an ag gressive, specialized, purposeless society. There is an airy and un specific connotation to "general," for in uncertain circumstances we are carried through largely by the quality of our nature. In this study the word "general" signifies "universal," and it applies to and is concerned with the recurring and changing roles that we enact in our lifetime.
The universal theme of America is a belief that life holds a promise for all men, that limitations must not be imposed upon their development, and that this life can only continue as long as mutual trust exists among men. Many disintegrating ideas and practices have weakened this faith: in an ever-changing society, its true meaning and power must be constantly rediscovered. Educa tion is not the only means of achieving this, but it is one of the in Historical Highlight stitutions that men have built to accomplish it. There is another side to general education that emphasizes the recurring roles of father, judge, teacher, soldier, politician, worker, player, lover, and philosopher which each man lives in his lifetime. These actions and occupations are not produced in us mechanically. At each mo ment it is necessary to make up our minds whether we shall live vitally or whether we shall pass things by. Even when we seem to drift, to make no decision, aimlessness is our decision. The com plexities of modern society have striven to split the personality: narrow specialization in the economic field is disorganizing family and community life; bureaucracy threatens to put an end to per sonal government; and pragmatism as a philosophy has substituted empiricism and expediency for authority and responsibility. Until 1939, life in this country was drifting into anarchy, and the tradi tion of liberal education which was concerned with the develop ment of the whole man was being lost in departmentalization.
During the last few years, a general re-appraisal of college education has been taking place, and widespread plans for reshap ing curricula have been proposed as a response to the need revealed and created by the catastrophe of a World War. Educators began to realize that peace and survival were frail entities, that social re sponsibility could not be delegated. The isolationism of this coun try did not belong to any class or section; it existed primarily in the hearts of the people. We know now that individuals must again begin to act energetically and directly in all of their roles, that they must become familiar with their history and with their society. General education is concerned with a people's attitudes and with the spirit in which they face life.
The renewed interest in general education has also been brought about by the contempt with which many college graduates view higher learning. Many have held that the essential benefit of college life resided in the social intercourse and the contacts that were made. As knowledge became investigation, information, and opinion rather than the pursuit of truth and wisdom, real intellec tual development was frustrated.
When knowledge becomes cheap, mass production methods must be introduced to support the facade of learning. There has been a noticeable trend in the last thirty years to let students obtain a college degree in the least possible time and in the easiest possible manner. Pseudo-scientific systems of measurement have been de vised to determine the amount of learning an individual possessed, and education has been reduced to a quantitative analysis. Here, again, knowledge was separated from purpose and became mere information which was readily forgotten. In professional and tech nical training the emphasis upon "scientific" testing methods and teaching procedures, optimum classroom size, and student load is well rewarded, but in general education, where there is a spirit to transmit, where great ambitions and the feeling of infinite growth are the conditions of learning, these practices emasculate teaching and degrade education. Any plan of general education must rule out shortcuts whether they be correspondence courses, intelligence tests, or other impersonal agencies which attempt to peddle educa tion as if it were the latest breakfast food.
Let us now consider seven specific subjects in the field of general education and the contribution each can make toward bettering the performance of duty of every officer.
Knowledge, fundamental to the understanding of America and to the true meaning of our lives, is derived from the study of history. One of our greatest errors in studying history is that we generally study it on a small scale, in textbooks and outlines. His tory becomes an affair of abstract centuries and the struggles, ago nies, passions, and uncertainties of events disappear. Issues which at the time were confused seem clear, outcomes seem obvious and inevitable, and we never realize how near to failure were the tri umphs that to us seem easy, or how close to success were complete and disastrous failures.
Deterministic interpretations have confused and clouded the truly universal factor of history, the element of human nature as it struggles with an uncertain or unpredictable future. Geographers have won and lost history, due to geographical or climatical condi tions. Marxists have found a class war in every uprising. Interpreting the appearance of an individual genius or the role of intellectual and moral qualities in these terms may satisfy the theorists, but it is no comfort to the human being who wavers, suffers, and sacrifices.
Popular government is based on the decisions of the majority. In the United States, if people are to decide wisely, they must know as many of the useful lessons from the collective memory of man kind as are available. The courage, the wisdom, and the faith of the people who renounced and sacrificed and died for us, inspire us to become worthy of them. This cannot be fully expressed in educa tion, and yet education is the only peaceful method of learning these lessons.
If we are to have the best chance to avoid some fatal error in the conduct of our future affairs, we must break the spell of the purely American past. We need to find out which examples have Historical Highlight shaped men and what real choices lie ahead. Our first and most obvious task is to see that our officers are immersed sufficiently in history to act wisely in relation to Poland, Greece, Iran, China and all other parts of the world in which they are representing this country. Our foreign policy since the end of World War I has been partial and complicated, and our failures have been due to indiffer ence, faulty analysis, and irrelevant emotion.
To know ourselves we must begin with the fact that the United States is the daughter and the hope of Europe, and that our heritage is directly drawn from the society of Western civilization. We must learn that our legal system, our universities, the rise of towns, and the development of modern science, are all intimate parts of our own history which represent marvelous responses to problems which at one time seemed insurmountable.
The second subject of general education is science and mathe matics. Some understanding of the physical scheme of the world and the organic life therein is a prerequisite for citizenship in the Air Age. Unfortunately, most science courses in colleges are designed as introductory courses for the professional scientist. This is also true of college mathematics courses. There is no reason why the ordinary man needs this information. Even the professional man, the doctor or the engineer, is burdened in many courses with the study of scien tific investigation. Mastery of these professions demands apprentice ship and repetitive practice, but not the attempt to turn people into scientists. The real scientist is a creative person, and his career in volves a calling and an asceticism which is quite unworldly.
Even the courses designed for the technical or professional man are far beyond the need of general education in science for an officer. In considering the place of science in general education, Historical Highlight the Harvard Report on General Education in a Free Society states, "Most of the time in such courses is devoted to developing a tech nical vocabulary and technical skills and to a systematic presenta tion of the accumulated facts and theory which science has inher ited from the past. Comparatively little attention is given to the examination of basic concepts, the nature of scientific enterprise, the historical development of the subject, its great literature, or its interrelationship with other areas of interest and activity." The gen eral course in science is taught in very few American colleges, and on the whole science departments contribute the greatest proportion of backward looking, anti-intellectual, mechanic-minded members of the faculty.
We glibly talk about our "scientific age" and the need for the "scientific habit of mind." We mean by this a recognition of the fact that our lives, from the kitchen to the battle line, are shaped by the influence of machinery embodying scientific principles. On a large scale, all major social questions involve scientific matters. Everything from soil erosion and air transport to water supply and public health involves at some point matters of fact and theory from the realm of science. In spite of the fact that the sciences have been taught for fifty years in schools and colleges, the understand ing of scientific truth and procedure which is necessary for intelli gent leadership in public life is largely lacking. We tend to "leave it to the experts." The result is that we are ruled in public life by scientific ignoramuses and in the scientific laboratory we have, for the most part, political and social illiterates.
In mathematics students should be given an understanding of mathematical systems and their development. The role of mathemat ics in gaining knowledge of the natural world, its special and quantita Historical Highlight tive relations, is as important as the mastery of the logical structure of algebra, geometry, trigonometry and calculus. Some conception of the theory of numbers, familiarity with statistical analysis, symbolical representation, and the calculation of chances, may aid in detecting many fallacies in a world that swarms with them.
The physical sciences are probably more obviously related to Air Power than any other subject. Consequently, most Air Force officers will accumulate a large amount of informal knowledge about the physical world. In formal education, however, such fields as the theory of the structure of matter-molecular, atomic, elec tronic-and theories of its variety and change, will serve to en force their understanding of the principles employed in the devel opment of the latest weapons. Air Force officers should also be familiar with the fundamental chemical phenomena, concepts, and classification: elements, compounds, affinity and stability, ioniza tion, isomerism, and the periodic table. They should also know the present physical theories of waves and radiation, such as wavemotion, sound, and light; the quantum theory of light and matter, and the theory of relativity, as well as the fundamental laws of en ergy and the transmutation of matter. Finally, in the physical sci ences, some consideration should be devoted to geological fact and theory, and to astrophysical phenomena and theory. All of this is the basis of language in the Air Age.
In the biological sciences, a general course should include the structure, function, variety and relationships of living organisms and the influences of heredity and environment in the evolution of life.
A review of the field of science and mathematics would suggest that treatment could be given in only a survey course or as it is pre sented now-an introduction to specialization. This is not necessarily Historical Highlight the case. General education calls for a thorough rationalization of the systems of instruction. The methods of descriptive analysis that have been used and are still in use must give way to the task of sim plifying and synthesizing without sacrifice to the quality or substantial ness of science. In order for a student to grasp the fundamental ideas of any science-the principles, the methods of procedure, the re sults-it is not necessary that he receive any great amount of formal training or familiarization with the techniques. Science presented in this manner will not be divorced from our first subject, history, for it will continually emphasize the greatness of man's conquests and will enable the student to realize and appreciate the advances of the qualified leaders of the modern scientific world.
The third subject in the general education curriculum might be criticized, but the major social problem of our day is the economic problem, and all Air Force strategy and Air Defense centers around a complete understanding of the rationalization and localization of industry. Economics as terminologically used here is not concerned with the superficial aspects of economics, such as tariff, money, banking, corporations, taxes, or the traditional subjects of an eco nomics department in a college. We should be concerned with the study of the reproductive problems of society; the depersonaliza tion of labor in modern industries; the disintegration of community life under the impact of industry; the organization of the large un industrialized areas of Africa, China, South America and India; the just allocation of world resources; and the decentralization of in dustry. These are the unexplored fields of economics that lie be neath the ruins of thirty years of war and revolution. Whether the beliefs that led to the founding of this country can survive in this global economic world where unemployment, impoverishment, Historical Highlight inflation, hunger and forced migration strike all nations, is the out standing question of our future. The professional soldier must think about these questions, for our society will live or die accord ing to our settlement of these violent problems. How to make our own country invulnerable to the moral and physical onslaught of the new era will either be answered by bold thinking done in the Air Force or not at all. The so-called Air Defense will not protect the United States and its productive plant from the atomic bomb. It may be that this plant has to take on a different shape and for this reason economics in our sense of the term is a compulsory subject for the Air Force, for in exposing every officer to this subject we may find the true strategist of the Air Forces.
The fourth subject in the general education of an air officer is philosophy. Men are crushed in all effort today by the common place. Mass systems of communication and unconscionable adver tising beat on our individuality twenty-four hours a day and further atomize the tenuous organization of life. To attempt to uphold any thing sacred, any value, anything of quality, is an almost impossible task. Everything that is different, that is excellent, anyone who holds out for the best, runs the risk of being eliminated.
An awareness of the great purpose of this country, the hope that it holds for its people throughout the world, lies neglected be neath the surface of everyday living. The absence of any common knowledge of the great ideas and aspirations which our best mod ern philosophers embody, further darkens an obscure future. The unwillingness to take "time out" for meditation, the con tinual noisiness of our surroundings, the uncertainty of a drifting course, the immense complexity of modern life, all are provocations to discover and examine the systems, the problems, and the thoughts Historical Highlight of present and past philosophy for guidance in our confusion. Phi losophy is the product of men who have suffered, endured, experi enced, and comprehended the diversity and universality that under lie all things. William James said, "To know the chief rival attitudes toward life, as the history of human thinking has developed them, and to have heard some of the reasons they can give for themselves, ought to be considered an essential part of liberal education."
Soldiers in the recent war demonstrated that courage, obedi ence, judgment, and humor are present in our personality today as much as they ever were. But in war the issues are obvious, the choice is narrow and limited. In the times that lie ahead in peace the path is not clear; right and wrong often are hidden in mist. Un certainty will inevitably lead to indecision. The profuseness of the sciences, far from strengthening our faith, has upset our unity and obscured our sense of values. We must remember that the German army fell an easy victim to a seemingly unbelievable political phi losophy. In peace, extraordinary effort is needed to insure that our Air Force is soundly established in harmony with our fundamental beliefs. As Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy says in The Christian Future, "Thinking for soldiers is a very new aspect of research and educa tion. But this is the reform of our educational system which . . . (they) demand. . . . Higher education in the future can only be planned for people who serve and fight life's battles, on whatever fighting front, who can see the flame of faith, the rays of thought, the reflexes in acts, all as incarnations of God's works. . . . Other wise the bodies of the young might be slaughtered for the dated ideas of a senile science, or the mature ideas of truth might be butchered by the rash instincts of brutes."
A final word is necessary to forewarn us against the survey type of course in philosophy. The typical introductory course in college is a dreary and sterile survey which flashes one after an other of the great philosophers before the class and produces only a shallow and useless knowledge of men and ideas. We must con tinually remember that even the most modern of philosophers did not anticipate and prepare us for the rise of Fascism and the fury of war. Our generation was born into a world of pragmatic thought in which every aspect of life, from war to worry, was overanalyzed. If the coming age is to find a faith to keep itself going, it must search out and study the prophets who understand our moral, economic, and philosophical needs and bury the "Freethinkers" who called forth such monstrosities.
Philosophy prepares us for one of the simple functions of our service. There are times when any commander must speak to his men with conviction. He must select examples that impress them as being true and as being espoused by him. Rare as these occa sions may be, they deserve a lifelong preparation because they are the decisive moment. The morale of the troops may be ruined by an unconvincing, cynical, ignorant speech at a funeral or a national holiday or before a battle. The most convincing speeches are usu ally those of men who have been immersed longest and most vi tally in history and philosophy. The philosophers to whom an American officer might well turn are the men whose spirit fills and keeps alive our democratic institutions.
The fifth subject in general education of an air officer is the study of languages. Language instruction has been of superficial quality in all phases of American education and until the war it was Historical Highlight not intended to do much more than to allow a student to identify a foreign word when he saw one. Usually, several years of study in a foreign language produced neither the ability to read, speak, nor to understand the language. Some common misconceptions have undermined the possi bility of serious language study in the past. It was commonly felt that languages could not be learned in school. If one would learn French, one must travel to France and live there. When the war made such travel impossible, we found that we could learn at home. Un fortunately, during the war the Armed Forces had to set up their own language schools and cram German, Russian, Japanese, and a score of other languages and dialects into people whose previous immu nity to language seemed absolute. Our success in meeting this prob lem was due to the concentration and seriousness with which it was sponsored. This provides the clue for successful language study. The curriculum at a future Air Academy must be arranged to allow the student exclusive concentration over a period of four or five months in his chosen language. If it cannot be arranged, no time should be wasted on "seeming" to learn the language.
Considering the amount and length of American education, the ignorance that we show of the language and the culture of for eign countries is amazing. This ignorance has made us inept at conference tables, exposed on the battlefield and in enemy territo ries, conceited before foreigners whose customs and culture we cannot understand, and incapable of catching the drift and trend of current political and social changes in other countries. The general and his aide who were responsible in our zone for the German press, schools, and mentality did not know the German language.
The ultimate educational value of knowing a foreign language is derived from the chance it gives us to watch the workings of other people like and unlike ourselves. It opens up their literature, philosophy, and shows their contributions to science and religion. Thus the study of a language becomes the study of a people, and we who make this study adopt a second home which allows us to transcend any narrow local nationalism.
The sixth subject in general education of an air officer is fine arts, including music. As this article said earlier, vulgarity is a bur den today. The fine arts expose the cheapness and shoddiness of radio and movie productions and provide the main fountainhead by which we refresh our sense of proportion outside of nature it self. This study is not ornamental, but absolutely necessary to our health. Sickness is not only caused by the outside attack of disease upon us, but also by the exposure of our bodies to continuous dis sipating influences. The pressure of always "doing" and of never seeing, feeling, singing or experiencing directly the great works of art, exhausts our nervous system. Nowhere is man's ability more evident than in the richness, the diversity, the miraculousness of his expression in music, painting, sculpture, and architecture. The pleasures derived from an understanding of form, balance, ar rangement, variation, design, and harmony are a tremendous re freshment to life. General education in the fine arts is not con cerned with turning out either a performer or a critic. Primarily, it should acquaint the student with the existence and development of visual and auditory languages in which truth is expressed in sound or color better than it could be in any other medium. Fine arts are as much an introduction to passionate feelings and precise expres sion as philosophy is. All art interprets life, determines values, and Historical Highlight shapes our character. The type and quality of art that we favor re veals our inner nature whether we are aware of it or not. The lei sure of an officer will reflect in his performance of duty, and if he develops no deep aesthetic interests, he will turn to cheapness which will weaken his firmness and his influence over his men.
The seventh and final subject of general education of an air officer is literature. All the subjects of general education are inter related; this is especially true in respect to literature, for all sub jects have their classics, and in the teaching of these a tremendous opportunity exists for introducing books that convey ideas of uni versal significance. Everyone is familiar with the scheme of basing an entire college curriculum on one hundred great classics. This extreme imposes such severe limitations on study that it does not seem practical, but this use of the classics does surround them with an aura of importance that is often lacking in the conventional classroom where analysis has supplanted understanding. However, aside from a judicious use of the classics as texts in all courses, literature should command a field of study in itself, for it is only by familiarity with the classics that they are kept alive by each gen eration and made permanent possessions of our heritage. Litera ture provides the common body of stories, phrases, beliefs, heroic lives, imaginative understanding, and drama which accompanies civilization. In the early history of America, a comparatively few books provided the basis for all knowledge. The biographies of the founding fathers continually refer to Pilgrim's Progress, Blackstone's Commentaries, and the Bible. The influence of these books on the thought, the expression, and the values of generation after genera tion is felt in every custom and law of our own period.
In peace, the years rapidly diminish the number of combatexperienced men on active duty, and the lessons that one genera tion had to learn in the fire of battle, the next generation must be lieve on faith. All knowledge that can be acquired in one's own life is experimental, but all knowledge that is acquired from traditions is fundamental and is the knowledge which makes leaders in peace time. The channels which open up this knowledge are enthusiasm, love, and admiration. Only those officers who can inherit from pre vious generations unbreakable, unexperimental standards of be havior, can be entrusted with the lives of men or with grave deci sions. The good staff officer or the accomplished specialist must be at the beck and call of these leaders because only these men have identified themselves with former generations, and they alone have the right to dispose of the lives of future generations. It is the duty of every officer to equip himself with the tools which such a re sponsibility requires.

Congratulations to Maj Dave Blair ("Ten Thousand Feet and Ten Thou sand Miles: Reconciling Our Air Force Culture to Remotely Piloted Air craft and the New Nature of Aerial Combat," May-June 2012) for his audacity in bringing this topic into the limelight. Truthfully, a veritable need exists for a healthy servicewide discussion regarding the role and recognition of remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) or any aircraft without an onboard operator. In my assessment, a noticeable but gradual cultural metamorphosis toward RPA acceptance is occurring within the rank and file. Now, the disquieting question concerns whether the establish ment will fully embrace this "wave of the future" community or simply keep it suspiciously at arm's length.
Although well intentioned, I believe that Blair's thesis loses its footing and, in effect, misses the mark. That said, his article is essentially an opening argument-a starting point-for the larger debate. Major Blair's overall assertion is that since RPA crews assume the same legal respon sibilities, military authorities, and "combat risk" as their manned counter parts, they should be entitled to identical accolades afforded the crews of manned platforms. Although the Air Force acknowledges the contri bution of the RPA community, the service continues to show defer ence-at its own injury-toward the legacy of manned flight, particu larly in terms of recognizing individuals by awarding them decorations. This argument revisits the ageold tugofwar between the Army and Air Force regarding priorities and doctrine. Ironically, the ground com mander, time and time again, has vocally lavished RPA crews with commendation. If the Air Force decides to repeatedly discount the RPA mission, then it risks the underlying peril of steadily abdicating remotely piloted aircraft to another, more interested, military branchchiefly the US Army. The latter has made great strides in building a capable RPA fleet and has demonstrated the desire to further increase its command and control of remotely piloted airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance.
Unresponsiveness to the increasing demand for intelligence, surveil lance, and reconnaissance has not served the Air Force well, especially in the estimation of civilian oversight. When Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates publicly chided air leaders in April 2008, his unsettling remark served as a lucid warning: "My concern is that our services are still not moving aggressively in wartime to provide resources needed now on the battlefield. I've been wrestling for months to get more intelligence, sur veillance, and reconnaissance assets into the theater. Because people were stuck in old ways of doing business, it's been like pulling teeth" (Air Force Times, 21 April 2008). It may have been coincidental that Sec retary Gates's rebuke coincided with the resignation of Gen T. Michael Moseley, the Air Force chief of staff, but the acceleration of RPA capa bility within the area of responsibility was not happenstance.
In defense of Major Blair, Predator crews do have combat responsi bility because of their lawful obligations-the same as any armed com batant. Furthermore, the lethal manifestations of combat-whether by dagger, artillery round, Hellfire missile, or spacebased laser-have the same physical outcome if properly employed: to rain death and de struction upon the enemy. Whether kinetic or nonkinetic, weapons employment is an identifiable threshold for combat. Technology elimi nates the need to witness the effect firsthand. Additionally, the Air Force has struggled to apply a consistent definition of "combat." Insti tutional contradiction was never more obvious than in the aftermath of 11 September 2001 when combat hours were awarded to fighter crews flying within US airspace under the guise of Operation Noble Eagle. Still, Blair mistakenly implies that effectiveness equates to risk. This is not the case.
The intelligence community utilizes an equation to represent the threat from an adversary: threat = intent + capability. That same qualitative principle, correspondingly, serves to better define the situa tionally dependent aggregate risk (cumulative risk) encountered by
any friendly combatant. Thus, combat risk = enemy intent + enemy capability. Under this premise, real differences exist between the risk encountered at 10,000 feet and 10,000 miles-significant differential dangers that we as professionals readily recognize.
To offer that RPA operators encounter the same aggregate risks as combatants physically present in a hostile land is an oversimplification. Moreover, it completely disregards the physical and layered defenses beginning at American borders and ports of entry, and thereby mar ginalizes the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, state and local law enforcement, and even the US Coast Guard, which often falls under the authority of United States Code, title 10. More importantly, it fails to recognize that more civilians than uni formed members have died on US soil from terrorism. Based on his tory and terrorism's countervalue strategy, I would argue that it's much riskier to be a flight attendant on a commercial airline than a military member waiting in line at the installation gate.
Because of the permissive operational environment in Afghanistan, Iraq, Horn of Africa, and even Libya, RPAs have enjoyed heavy utiliza tion. This trend will continue for similar environments in the future. However, in intense combat environments where the electromagnetic spectrum is compromised and not dominated by the United States or its allies, the utilization of remotely piloted assets could be extremely lim ited. In such peerlevel conflicts with China or Russia, manned assets could potentially be the only useful platforms until the electromagnetic spectrum and air dominance are finally established. Sending the manned fighter or bomber the way of the dinosaur would prove impru dent. As has been our mantra for as long as I can remember, flexibilityin this case, piloted and remotely piloted-is the key to airpower.
The most important principle regarding awards and decorations in volves realizing that these items are a vehicle to recognize subordinates as determined by the chain of command. Simply, this is a commander's decision and no one else's. Counter to the sentiment of Major Blair's ar ticle, RPA crews have not been entirely ignored for their work in the Ricochets & Replies combat zone. On the contrary, RPA operators-pilots and sensor special ists-have experienced a windfall of decorations. It is a fact that RPA crews were prohibited after the initial days of Operation Iraqi Freedom from receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross or the Air Medal in accor dance with US Central Command's decorations guide (more than likely at the behest of traditional aircrew advocates). However, in my observa tion, combatmissionready RPA operators can qualify for an Aerial Achievement Medal based upon cumulative sortie count, typically every 60 calendar days, even after squadroninduced limitations. Only three years ago I served as the awardsanddecorations officer in the same squadron as the author, and I distinctly remember completing a 27th oakleafcluster decorations package for a particular veteran MQ1 sen sor operator. Undoubtedly, many readers just gasped at this anecdote, but in a grossly neglected community that has received only a modicum of recognition, our leaders resorted to the only avenue available to them. In many ways, it was their attempt to send a clear message to their superiors and naysayers: we are fighting this war from the air too.
Nevertheless, RPA squadrons that are considered "deployed in garri son" do not receive recognition for campaign contributions like their expeditionary equivalents. The advantage of technology is that it com presses time and space and allows for "reachback." Despite their direct impact and effect within the area of responsibility, RPA operators are denied campaign decorations such as the Iraq and Afghanistan Cam paign Medals. The criteria for these medals mandate a physical pres ence within the geographic theater of operations. Unfortunately, this fails to recognize the effectsbased paradigm shift that technology brings. This is the crux of Blair's argument, and it would behoove the Air Force to equitably move RPA crews into the decorations scheme.
Still, the dispute here is not about "chest candy" or medals. Instead, the comparison between major weapon systems should be based upon standardized metrics or uniform measures of effectiveness. In this manner, the Air Force can truly comprehend the level of effort and contribution that the RPA community is committing to the fight. Fur ther consideration will need to be involved in servicewideaccepted metrics, but they could include basic measurements such as flight hours, mission rates, and/or enemies killed in action. To Blair's point, this would remove the bias of relative performance and set a founda tion for RPA community credentials.
My military professor, Lt Col Kristina Young, retired, observed that "all warfare is asymmetrical." In other words, the intent of warfare is to maximize one's comparative advantage. Americans are particularly ad ept at this concept. If we really wanted a fair fight for the sake of hero ics, as the F22 pilot asserted in Blair's article, then we would limit our footprint in Afghanistan to a small ground contingent armed with AK47s. Fortunately, a "fair fight" requirement is not in our doctrine. The asymmetry with RPAs is the capability to exact certain effects at much lower levels of aggregate risk.
The truth is that the Air Force must get on board the RPA transforma tion from the top down. It represents the incipient stage in a complete paradigm shift to a more automated battlefield. In time, remotely piloted technology, including cyber and space, will envelop the other physical domains. The Air Force is obligated to lead the way. It is our legacy.
Student, National Intelligence University
Maj Christian Senn's incisive critique effectively engages the arguments raised in my recent article, and I truly appreciate his analytical rigor and professionalism in moving this discussion forward. I believe that Major Senn and I, by and large, agree on the fundamentals and differ pri marily on stylistics. As he astutely observes, the article is intended as an entry point into a larger debate over the trajectory of the RPA culture. Toward advancing that debate, I am grateful for the chance to clarify three points: the contrast between combat responsibility and individual
Ricochets & Replies combat risk, the difference between absolute and marginal risk, and the distinction between objective and relative valuation in recognition.
First, the central point I intended to advance is that combat for an aviator is best described in term of in situ collective risk and weapons employment, or "combat responsibility," rather than an atomistic view of individual risk to the aviator. As with officers in our sister services, we are measured by our duties to our comrades and the weight of life anddeath decisions. The idea that I am asserting that RPA crews face the same individual combat risk as manned aviators is mistaken; rather, I argue that individual combat risk is a problematic and incom plete definition for combat. Combat responsibility, which includes in dividual and corporate risk as well as weapons employment, better captures the nature of contemporary aerial combat.
Lt Col Dave Grossman, author of On Killing and On Combat, de scribes a slew of mental and physiological reactions to the weight of these situations.

Second, manned aviators are under more absolute risk in all circum stances than remote aviators; the argument I raised compares mar ginal risk due to combat rather than absolute risk. Major Senn's im pression that I held that "RPA operators encounter the same aggregate risks" as manned aviators is due to a misunderstanding of the term dif ferential risk. His use of the term aggregate implies that I was compar ing the absolute risk of manned and remote aviators, whereas in actu ality I was comparing the conditional increase of risk due to combat duties. However, given the number of sharp and thoughtful individuals that joined him in that misimpression, I must conclude that this is a result of my own failure to communicate, and for that the blame be longs to me alone.
"Differential combat risk" is the marginal effect of combat, the in crease in risk from the baseline of noncombat operations due to com batspecific factors. Hypothetically, if a manned pilot has a peacetime risk of 0.1 percent compared to a remote pilot's 0.0 percent risk and has a risk of 0.11 percent in the course of combat duties compared to a remote pilot's 0.01 percent risk, then the manned pilot's "absolute risk" is higher in both circumstances, but his differential combat risk is an equivalent 0.01 percent. This does not diminish the bravery it takes to "slip the surly bonds of Earth" nor the tragedy of losing friends when the baseline risks of flight manifest themselves. Still, normal flying risks do not constitute combat; hence, only this marginal increase can constitute individual combat risk.

Usefully, Senn's analysis highlights the dangers of cognitive biases in strategic thought. Nobel laureates Daniel Kahneman, Herbert Simon, and Amos Tversky describe how cognitive biases can affect risk per ception and decision making. 
4
As Major Senn states, "All warfare is asymmetrical," and the art of strategy is matching strengths to an enemy's weaknesses. These weak nesses are often hidden behind cognitive biases. In Psychology of Intel ligence Analysis, CIA veteran Richards Heuer describes one of the most pernicious of these cognitive biases: mirror imaging or the "everyone Ricochets & Replies thinkslikeus mindset."

A terrorist's acquiring an advanced missile to attack an aircraft is a risk that fits well with our cognitive biases and therefore is amplified in compari son to the expected value of a hypothesized targeted terror attack. Unfortu nately, this targetedattack hypothesis hit close to home in a recent news ar ticle describing an alQaeda plot against RPA operators in Texas; fortunately, the vigilance of law enforcement thwarted this attempt.

Accordingly, I engage neither the important distinction between valor and achievement in awards nor the discussion over "counter medals."
The lively debate about the proliferation of decorations is an important one, but it is not central to the implications of combat responsibility. "Equivalent actions merit equivalent recognition" is the crucial point rather than what recognition is merited for a given action. For instance, consider a scenario in which Predator crews track a critical highvalue target to a safe house where he is then kinetically struck by a dynami cally retasked F16. In this case, both platforms' crews perform their du ties with excellence and professionalism. Perhaps that excellence merits decorations, or perhaps "doing your job" shouldn't merit decoration. Ei ther way, giving the F16 pilot an award for heroism while excluding the Predator crews from consideration for the same sends a very clear message about what the institution believes is worth recognizing. This message ripples back into commissioning sources and flighttraining pipelines, perpetuating perceptions and relative performance discrepan cies through selection bias.
I hold that Major Senn's example of the veteran sensor operator with a 27oakleafcluster Aerial Achievement Medal supports rather than undermines this principle. This is an example of conflicting institu tional messages. This warrior's frontline leaders enthusiastically recog nized his continuing meritorious achievements while the higherlevel institution decreed that this individual's contributions qualified for only the lowest possible level of aerial award, regardless of effect. As Senn points out, these leaders were trying to cancel out a toxic mes sage by maxperforming the only tool they had available. Knowing this individual sensor operator personally, I believe that his airmanship and situational awareness directly saved the lives of American Soldiers and that his technical expertise guided Hellfire missiles true against our enemies. Rather than absurd amounts of lowlevel recognition in lieu of awards befitting his achievements, a spectrum of recognition seems far more appropriate for this warrior and the other Airmen like him. Senn's recommendation for objective measures of combat effects, or perhaps platformblind qualitative narratives, holds promise toward restoring sanity in this regard.
Major Senn raises a number of additional intriguing points. In short, his vision of manned and remote aircraft in a new synthesis is provi dent, although the nature of this synthesis should evolve from a caste structure to a true partnership. The key, however, is not only a "top down" transformation but also true pride and bottomup respect, rooted first in a selfrespect that comes only from excellence in mis sion execution. "Don't accept broke" very much needs to become a creed of the stillnascent RPA community.
Finally, the crucial point of "Ten Thousand Miles" remains: we must expand our view of combat to consider our comrades, both in the air stack and the joint community. Those causally tied together through their interacting effects on the battlefield should be conceptually tied together in the idea of combat. In this, we decrease everyone's risk by expanding our view of it beyond ourselves-ironically, by constructing combat as corporate responsibility, we reinforce the seriousness of combat duties to the RPA community, which reduces individual risk for manned aircraft operating in close proximity to RPAs. Once again, I thank Major Senn for his excellent comments and look forward to con tinuing the discussion of RPA culture. 2. The idea of "normal risk" or "normal accidents" comes from Dr. Charles Perrow's (Yale professor of sociology) research into complex systems. See his book Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1999).
3. General intheater terror attack / indirect fire risk is broadly a wash between the two platforms because both deploy detachments forward (traditional deployments for manned aircraft; launch and recovery elements for RPAs). Additionally, this analysis does not apply  8. The Monty Hall problem is described in the movie 21: given the choice of three doors, should one change his or her guess if one of the nonchosen doors is revealed to have no prize behind it? Marilyn vos Savant offered the correct answer (yes), but the yearslong dis cussion that followed her answer was so rancorous that she was forced to table it lest it over take her entire column. For further reading on statistical analysis and risk assessment, The theme "never again" runs throughout many commentaries on genocide. Stopping Mass Killings in Africa: Genocide, Airpower, and Inter vention attempts to reinforce the rhetoric with actionable ideas. In this respect, the contributors provide interesting operational concepts that complement an in-depth history of each genocide addressed here. Al though necessary, the historical background may divert the true focus of the book: offering concrete, operational advice on stopping mass killings in a continent often ignored by military and political leaders (p. 127).
Editor Douglas Peifer, an associate professor at the US Air War Col lege who has written on German military history and European secu rity issues as well as mass killings, includes an excellent introduction to the history of genocide studies and the various models used to understand them. The four contributors, all of them graduates of Air Command and Staff College, employ case studies that address geno cide, airpower, and intervention to illustrate operational lessons that can apply to future conflicts. Lt Col Aaron Steffens, a career F-16 pilot, writes about the failed at tempts to intervene in Somalia in the early 1990s and the way those events not only changed American foreign policy but also influenced future African operations. Maj George Stanley, a career A-10 pilot, of fers a cogent history of the Rwandan genocide, exploring how the lack of significant intervention furthered the killing and how it might have been stopped. The case study on Rwanda by Lt Col Keith Reeves, a pi lot with experience in both the B-52 and B-2, suggests an operational concept for preventing genocide. Cdr Timothy Boyer, US Navy, a naval
Intervention is both the crux of the matter and the most difficult is sue Peifer deals with. Asserting the importance of intervening in the early stages of genocide, he maintains that it is far better to avert the causes of genocide than to stop one in progress. In the case of Rwanda, Colonel Reeves observes that any interruption in the killing machine might have saved countless lives (p. 85). Moreover, proper resources and political motivation spurred the timely intervention of air and ground troops, stopping the genocide in C√¥te D'Ivoire and helping sta bilize that country, as noted by Commander Boyer (p. 101).
Although Dr. Peifer does an excellent job of suggesting who should intervene and how, he largely ignores the political consequences. For example, flying close air support makes sound operational sense but carries multiple political implications that may take that option off the table. Additionally, Colonel Steffens deals with Somalia in terms of its serious political repercussions for future operations, emphasizing that selection of the appropriate kind of force, commander, and rules of en gagement all complicate intervention (p. 44). In Somalia these issues doomed the operation and likely affected Western political will to in tervene in future conflicts.
Generally, discussions of genocide, airpower, and intervention in Africa occur only after completion of the body counts. This book, how ever, looks at the successes, failures, and varying approaches taken by different international organizations to prevent genocide from occur ring. Nevertheless, although it successfully presents detailed events and operational concepts, the failure of Stopping Mass Killings in Africa to devote more space to dissecting those concepts makes the book seem more like a history than a critical analysis. What would you do if you were an engineer working for a powerful company that overruled your directive to cancel an upcoming launch due to a faulty part-an action that led to catastrophic results? In Truth, Lies, and O-Rings, Allan McDonald addresses the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) decision to ignore his warnings, re sulting in the destruction of the space shuttle Challenger and the deaths of its crew members. Truth, Lies, and O-Rings is the firsthand account of a man directly involved in the design tests of the rings, Challenger's launch, and the cover-up that followed the catastrophe.
After outlining his career with the Thiokol Corporation (maker of the parts for the space shuttle), McDonald then describes the flaws that he and fellow engineers discovered in the O-ring, explaining why he refused to support NASA's order to launch the Challenger despite those defects. McDonald then details the political and economic conse quences for him and his coworkers (e.g., lawsuits against Thiokol by the families of the Challenger's crew and congressional hearings on the decisions), internal fallout, attempted reprisals, and transfers of the people involved in the decision to different departments. The author concludes by discussing the aftereffects of the tragedy and the end of his career with Thiokol.
Although the book explains the how and why of the designs, tests, management decisions, and events leading up to the shuttle's destruc tion, McDonald not only sidetracks the reader with details about him self and others that are unrelated to the story but also tends to get bogged down in trivial details, such as mentioning people in his de partment who formerly worked for Senator Orrin Hatch (p. 200). Though interesting, such topics have little to do with the story and de tract from its impact.
Furthermore, McDonald and coauthor James R. Hansen include a considerable amount of unnecessary information about the book's sub ject. The reader doesn't need a chapter devoted to the author and his background or a 28-page bibliographical essay that explores books and conspiracy theories concerning the Challenger disaster. Additionally, McDonald and Hansen could have combined several chapters into one or summarized them (e.g., those dealing with the explosion of the Peacekeeper motor, the "Witness" chapter, and the one about his retire ment from Thiokol).
Lastly and perhaps most importantly, the author never explains why he waited so long to write the book. The information he presents could have significantly altered the future of the space shuttle program, yet he remained silent for more than 20 years. The reasons for doing so, enumerated in the preface, ring more than a bit hollow.
Although the space shuttle program has now ended, questions about the Challenger tragedy linger on. Truth, Lies, and O-Rings attempts to explain the how and why but does so long after these revelations might have benefited the program. The book may be of interest to space his torians, but its value to military readers remains fairly minimal. I rec ommend it only to people directly involved in designing, testing, and supervising military flight hardware. normally associate the British with the war against Imperial Japan. Yet Nicholas Evan Sarantakes reminds us that America did not stand alone, presenting in Allies against the Rising Sun a political history of the cooperation among the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand in the final stages of the struggle against the Japanese Empire. Coalition warfare is a complex undertaking, and Sarantakes examines the challenges faced by the English-speaking na tions as they fought together against Japan.
The author asks three important questions concerning British mili tary participation in the Pacific war effort: why did a war-weary United Kingdom want to participate, why did the even more war-weary Com monwealth nations wish to take part, and why did the United States, increasingly able to handle the situation alone, agree to their participa tion? Sarantakes contends that without the British, Americans would have turned their collective backs on Britain, as they had after the Great War. He argues that "high-placed individuals" in both nations be lieved that their best interests called for cooperating in the postwar world-an objective that depended upon Great Britain's "contribut [ion]  to the decisive operations in Japan" (p. 8). The author concludes that, ultimately, each nation had its own reasons for agreeing to join the cause against Japan, whether stemming from the United Kingdom's looking to regain lost colonies, the Commonwealth nations' seeking a closer relationship with the United States, or American politicians' needing to explain to their constituents why they would not allow other nations to share in the shedding of blood.
By beginning his book with the events of 1943, Sarantakes does not dwell on the early Axis victories but focuses on the enemies in retreat and on Allied planning for a postwar world. During his research, the author mined archives of the five English-speaking nations involved not only for official government documents but also for diaries and memoirs that would facilitate his re-creation of the atmosphere of the various Allied planning conferences, correspondences, and exchanges as the principals worked out the details of cooperation against Imperial Japan. Sarantakes Book Reviews attends to both mundane issues, such as dates, numbers of soldiers, and types of ships, and more controversial matters such as Russian participa tion in the final assault against Japan and use of the atomic bomb.
Not simply political history, Allies against the Rising Sun is biographical as well, highlighting not only the decisions made by Allied nations but also the men who made those decisions. Sarantakes introduces the reader to major political and military leaders in each of the Englishspeaking nations, chronicling both their strengths and shortcomings in short biographical sketches that detail their advancement to the posi tions they held during the war. By giving these men personalities, the author allows readers to view their decisions and positions on issues with the understanding that they were not supermen but imperfect human beings. The book's epilogue briefly summarizes the postwar ca reers of 25 of these individuals.
Sarantakes writes in a clear, accessible style, even managing a bit of humor when he tells of a trip Winston Churchill wanted to make to Bermuda to meet with Franklin Roosevelt-a junket that his military chiefs opposed. About the chiefs Sarantakes opines, "Apparently, they had never been to Bermuda" (p. 48). The narrative bogs down a bit into operational history during its coverage of the Okinawa campaign. Granted, the stiff defense of Okinawa surprised the Allies and affected planning for the assault on the Japanese home islands, but the opera tional detail distracts readers from the politics of alliance. Further more, the book ends rather abruptly with the Japanese surrender. Af ter making a case for British participation based on the postwar order, Sarantakes never really talks about how the various participants con tributed to that order. That omission, however, does not detract much from a significant study of the complexities of alliances and coalition warfare. Nations rarely go to war without partners, and Allies against the Rising Sun is an excellent case study for those who ponder the chal lenges of coalition warfare in the twenty-first century. ) in light of the Great Reces sion and the then-recent election of President Obama. The author, an English journalist and former editor in chief of the Economist, has pub lished several earlier books about Japanese business and politics. Rivals uses historical events, personal anecdotes, and economic data to envi sion the future of a region defined by rivalry among ascendant China and India as well as a declining but still powerful Japan.
Emmott introduces his theme with a discussion of the US-India Civil Nuclear Agreement of 2005, in which President Bush agreed to sell nuclear fuel and technology to India outside the framework of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. He compares this departure from Bush's counterproliferation objectives to Nixon's courtship of China as a counterweight to the USSR. Rivals argues that more than the global war on terrorism, "the most important long-term trend in world affairs does indeed remain the shift in economic and political power to Asia" (p. 7). The author supports this contention with a number of economic statistics, the most telling of which is the 6 percent rise in Asia's share of world gross domestic product (GDP) since 1990. (Other regions lost ground or maintained their share.)
The second chapter gives an account of Asian integration-in terms of ideology, markets, and diplomacy-since the nineteenth century. According to Emmott, to the extent that any pan-Asian ideology has succeeded as a motive force, it is "economic development and the ac Book Reviews companying reduction of poverty" (p. 33). He traces the history of Asian economic development through the "flying geese" construct: postwar Japan became an economic powerhouse through export-led trade followed within two decades by the Four Asian Tigers and then Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia-and eventually Deng Xiaoping's China. Chapters 3-5 offer an in-depth look at the recent past and the foreseeable future of China, Japan, and India, respectively. Japan will have to deal with an aging population and increasing pressure to amend its pacifist constitution to permit greater military preparedness. In the cases of China and India, the common denominator is that even if the most optimistic forecasts prove accurate, rapid growth can be as so cially destabilizing as economic decline. Chapters 6 and 7 examine two different pitfalls for the region as a whole-the disputed politics of cli mate change and the long shadow of Asia's own history.
Chapter 8 looks at five potential conflict "flash points" throughout the region. The author emphasizes each major player's incentives for seeking stability, noting that the region is home to four states possess ing nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, unpredictable future events could lead to conflict in one or more of these areas-for example, a crisis re lated to the succession of the Dalai Lama or the next leader of North Korea. Indeed, some commentators attributed the artillery bombard ment of Yeonpyeong Island by North Korea in November 2010 to succession-related saber rattling. Emmott's final chapter offers nine policy recommendations for securing the peaceful growth and integra tion of Asia. They include continued American support for India, greater diplomacy between India and its immediate neighbors, and US support for the East Asian Summit and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Regional Forum as the primary regional vehicles for economic and security cooperation, respectively (in order to supplant several ineffective and duplicative forums).
Rivals is well served by Emmott's extensive experience in the region. Unlike the other works mentioned earlier, Emmott's appropriately em phasizes the importance of Japan. China has passed that country since the book's publication to become the second-largest economy in the world, but Japan remains a close third. More importantly, China and India are still impoverished. They both lag far behind Japan (and the world average) in terms of GDP per capita. Japan will remain an im portant diplomatic and economic player for some time, and the author does a good job sketching out what that country's best-case scenario might look like. The governmental bureaucracy will have to continue to reform (Emmott uses the phrase " 'rule by law' rather than 'rule of law' " to describe the bureaucracy at the height of its power, prior to the financial crisis of the 1990s), with "scarce labour [providing] a new source of discipline" (p. 115) for the private sector. As American influ ence declines, Japan will also have to mend its relationship with South Korea and consider expanding its military.
Readers must understand that Rivals is a work of long-form journalism rather than political science as such. In his discussion of Asia's conflict flash points, Emmott chose not to engage a wealth of theoretical litera ture about the causes of war-an unfortunate choice because some of it (e.g., Charles Doran's Power Cycle Theory) seems tailor made for as sessing potential conflicts between established declining powers and newer ascendant ones. Furthermore, events have already supplanted some of Emmott's analysis. For instance, he argues that a G14 or G20 should replace the G8 to give China and India a seat at the table (p. 264). This has since occurred, but the G20 has proven no more successful at promoting freer trade and financial stability than its predecessors. This well-written book offers extensive insight into a region that is rapidly becoming a central concern to all Airmen. Although Kaplan and Kissinger have trod similar ground in more recent books, only Rivals can claim a career Asia specialist as its author. Its ground-level perspective and economic focus more than earn it a place alongside the others.
Barksdale AFB, Louisiana Book Reviews the book that he occasionally asked questions and took notes during the visit. Several members of McChrystal's team, including the general himself, had their wives fly out to join them during the visit. In fact, the McChrystals' 33rd wedding anniversary added to the festive social atmosphere during meals, travel, and evening hours. Unfortunately for these officers, all this time Hastings was meticulously capturing their social banter for later revelation. In the author's defense, evi dently no one in McChrystal's party had the good sense to characterize these social gatherings specifically as "off the record"; furthermore, some of the questionable remarks occurred during meetings and preparations for briefings.
An unbiased reader is left with several conclusions after perusing Hastings's time with McChrystal and his party. First, General McChrystal was very close to his personal aides, his executive officer, and a couple of other advisers on the trip to Europe. A commander who handpicks advisers he trusts and with whom he feels comfortable runs the danger of becoming too friendly and casual with these sub ordinates and allowing unprofessional fraternization to seep into the daily routine. Moreover, in a deployed environment, the commander and his or her close advisers spend long days together, seven days a week. Throw into this mix a trip to Europe, spouses, and a chance to let off a little steam between official functions, and the further danger emerges of letting down one's guard. Additionally, perhaps fueled by a series of generally favorable profiles published by other writers, McChrystal and his team completely dropped their guard and seemed to assume that this young Rolling Stone writer would jump on board with the team and ignore the occasional "locker-room" trash talking that occurs among the staff, including the occasional disrespectful comments towards officials of the US government and others.
Unfortunately for Hastings, he and his publisher's "gotcha" approach to journalism distracts the reader from the broader and predominantly unrelated message he attempts to convey in the book-that the current COIN tactics employed by US, coalition, and Afghan security forces Book Reviews are folly and doomed to failure. Furthermore, Hastings believes that any actions beyond hunting terrorists are wrongheaded, and he loosely ties his perception of the United States' COIN failures in Viet nam and Iraq to its COIN strategy in Afghanistan. However, to get to his thesis, readers have to slog through tabloid-style hyperbole, starting with the book's covers. Both the front and back covers contain outra geously misleading and disrespectful pictures of a four-star generalpresumably McChrystal, with the head portion conveniently cut off at the top of the page-holding a bottle of booze in one hand and a weapon in the other. Furthermore, the inside jacket speaks of "hotel bars where spies and expensive hookers participate in nation building gone awry," implying some sort of untoward involvement by the McChrystal team with prostitutes and spies-an assertion unsupported by any material in the book. Additionally, The Operators includes a photo of a hand-drawn pornographic sex act from a US combat outpost not mentioned in the text, seemingly serving no purpose other than implicitly shouting, "Wow! Look what these GIs think up in their spare time!" This salacious photo is a cheap shot at deployed Soldiers and their families, adding nothing of value to the narrative's main point and reinforcing the stereotyped image of the immoral Western occu pier soiling the Islamic nation of Afghanistan. Overall, for readers in terested in a balanced portrayal of General McChrystal, his team, and the US strategy in Afghanistan, I suggest they find a different book to read-one that presents both sides of the debate in a more mature fashion and without the tabloid-style journalism that accompanies the narrative in The Operators. Fawaz Gerges is a leading scholar of social movements and a re nowned regional expert on the Middle East. He has established a repu tation as a unique scholar in his unparalleled access to actors in the Middle East region who have been pivotal in influencing the historical jihadist movement and developing foundational theories in the move ment. Gerges's Journey of the Jihadist: Inside Muslim Militancy (Har court, 2006) chronicled the jihadist movement over the span of three generations, focusing on and illuminating differences between intergenerational elites and the evolving emphasis of the movement. The book proved particularly instructive in explaining the shortcomings of the US war in Iraq and against al-Qaeda in terms of attaining stated US strategic goals. Further, the study served as a corrective to some of the excesses and misconceptions of the war on terrorism as defined by US national strategy. The author's keen insight is reflected anew by his understanding and discussion of the diversity within the jihadist movement, a theme in Journey of the Jihadist that has become the centerpiece of his latest book, The Rise and Fall of Al-Qaeda. Gerges explores the important rift inside the movement that burgeoned during Osama bin Laden's reign over al-Qaeda. He develops the central theme that from al-Qaeda's in ception, prominent Islamic thinkers and elites within and outside the movement have viewed it as too extremist and/or unreflective of true Islam. One prominent jihadist, Sayyid Imam al-Sharif Fadl, proclaimed in 2007 that "Al-Qaeda committed suicide on 9/11" (p. 121), that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri were "false prophets" (p. 209), and that al-Qaeda was "an empty shell which lacks a popular base of support and a religiously sanctioned mandate" (p. 122). The schism within the movement meant that al-Qaeda's ability to sway the Islamic world was tenuous from the start and collapsing by the end of the millennium.
Gerges argues that al-Qaeda's excesses in Iraq, including the vio lence and dogmatism of its members and affiliates, were especially harmful to the movement in deepening its negative image among Is lamic elites and throughout the Islamic world. That al-Qaeda has killed innocent Muslims alongside potential enemies of Islam inside Iraq produced revulsion for the organization among many Muslims and de tracted from any perceived legitimate grievance that may have been expressed concerning Western and/or US imperialism. The author carefully traces and explains the collapse of support for al-Qaeda among Muslims throughout the Islamic world. By the time of bin Laden's death, reliable public opinion polls and Gerges's own interviews re vealed that al-Qaeda as an organization and movement was already in deep crisis. From Saudi Arabia to Iraq to Pakistan to Indonesia and Tur key, confidence in bin Laden had plummeted from earlier levels of support. Gerges concludes that "overwhelming evidence . . . suggest[s] that the original menace of al-Qaeda is winding down" (p. 189).
Al-Qaeda remains a factor in Yemen and along the Afghan and Paki stan borders. As to al-Qaeda in Yemen (al-Qaeda in the Arabian Penin sula [AQAP]), Gerges argues that its influence will be decided by the organization's usefulness to the tribes that predominate. The latter will ally with AQAP for pragmatic rather than ideological reasons in con testing the unpopular national government. In keeping with past pre scriptions, the author advises US policy makers against applying only military force to counter AQAP because such a strategy could backfire and actually enhance the organization's popular support. Gerges ana lyzes the situation in Pakistan and Afghanistan as one in which "the current marriage of convenience between the Taliban fighters and al-Qaeda operatives will hold as long as the West confuses and con flates them, and wages all-out war against them" (p. 183). In noting ap provingly a shift in the Obama administration's approach in Afghani stan to one that emphasizes reconciliation between the Taliban and the national government, Gerges reiterates one of his key points: "There is no military solution to the civil strife in Afghanistan" (p. 187).
He concludes by critically commenting on the disjuncture between the reality of al-Qaeda's mortal weakening and the continued inclina tion of US counterterrorism experts as well as the US government to emphasize the organization "as a strategic, existential threat" (p. 192). Gerges elaborates on the theme that both American elites and the public have become captive to the fear of terrorism, which then am plifies any piece of evidence into confirming the narrative. Thus, the reality of al-Qaeda's operational, organizational, and popular decline has not yet diminished the perception of existential threat that has become habituated across the American elite and public, much as Cold War thinking did previously. He prescribes that the United States step out from behind the approach it has taken in the Middle East that has emphasized counterterrorism and stability, and unleash the liberal-democratic universalistic impulses that would enable it to play a constructive role in the democratic movements that have erupted across the region: "The United States can help transform the Middle East" (p. 205). This statement captures the greater strategic vi sion that Gerges presents through his deep analysis of al-Qaeda and its shortcomings. In the end, such movements feed off the effects of au thoritarianism, tyranny, and oppression. The resultant "absence of hope provide[s] the fuel that powers radical, absolutist ideologies in the Muslim world; they are the mother of all ailments that afflict the region, including al-Qaeda, a parasite that feeds on political and social turmoil and repression" (p. 213). The beacon of hope and light that the United States historically has professed to represent in the world should be allowed to glow brightly in its approach to the Middle East and help redirect national strategy and policy toward this mission. Do ing so would redefine US-Israeli relations as well as the ability of the United States to influence the direction of social and political move ments in the greater Middle East.
The Rise and Fall of Al-Qaeda challenges the reader to acknowledge and understand the diversity that has existed within the jihadist move ment and to realize that bin Laden and al-Qaeda never represented majority Muslim or even Islamist opinion. The author's deep under Book Reviews standing of Islamic thinkers and activists enables him to elaborate and chronicle the path over which al-Qaeda and its leadership traversed, ending with bin Laden's failure and death. Gerges's expertise in social movements also enables him to address the strategic environment of change in the Middle East with clarity; moreover, it underwrites the prescriptions he offers for changing the discourse and direction of US policy in the region. Although some readers may consider the book provocative, it should be read by regional analysts of the Middle East, academics who study social movements, policy makers, and individuals interested in Middle East politics and the threat of terrorism. In this expansive assessment of airpower's steady rise in salience from its fledgling days to today's combat involvements, Colin Gray, a prolific strategist of long-standing scholarly repute, has produced an outstanding tutorial for airmen by addressing the air weapon in the context of what he calls its abiding "strategic narrative" (p. 1). His book is not about the tangibles of airpower-the platforms, munitions, and associated support systems-that make up its hardware ingredients. Rather, it is about how one should think about airpower's larger mean ing and significance.
This important new book begs to be read by airpower's doers as well as thinkers-and at all rank and command levels. In explaining why, Gray notes that his intent in writing it was "to contribute to a better strategic understanding of airpower to improve the practice of airpower" Book Reviews (emphasis added, p. 2). Toward that end, he stresses that his purpose was not to indulge in debate over air doctrine but "to help sharpen the ability of readers themselves to engage in such debate" (p. 4)-most notably in the all-important policy arena in which the most intractable cross-service disagreements over roles and resources get adjudicated.
Gray's central theme is that airpower generates strategic effect. More to the point, he maintains, it is a tactical equity that operates-ideallywith strategic consequences. To him, "strategic" does not inhere in the equity's physical characteristics, such as an aircraft's range or payload, but in what it can do by way of producing desired results. From his perspective, a strategic effect is, first and foremost, that which enables outcome-determining results. And producing such results is quintes sentially the stock in trade of American airpower as it has progres sively evolved since Vietnam.
With this unifying principle as his point of departure, Gray improves on Brig Gen William "Billy" Mitchell's definition of airpower by charac terizing it more helpfully as "the ability to do something [strategically useful] in the air" (emphasis in original, p. 9). He further stresses-as his book's title well reflects-that only by producing desired effects can airpower's use in warfare be deemed successful.
In addressing the predominance of today's low-intensity insurgent challenges, in which kinetic air attacks have largely been overshadowed by ground forces in the starring role, Gray takes a long view of airpower's relevance and potential by appraising the air weapon in the broader context in which its payoff will ultimately be registered. His survey of airpower's combat use over time shows convincingly how the relative importance of the air weapon is neither universal nor unchanging but totally dependent on the circumstances of a confrontation.
More to the point here, when viewed operationally, airpower can be everything from single-handedly decisive to wholly supportive of a combatant commander's needs. Because its relative import, like that of all other force elements, hinges directly on how its comparative advan tages relate to a commander's most immediate concerns, Gray reminds Book Reviews us that airpower need not disappoint when it is not the main producer of desired outcomes. Indeed, he rightly notes, the notion that airpower should be able to perform effectively in all forms of combat unaided by other force elements is both an absurd measure of its value and a baseless arguing point. By misguidedly espousing this point over many decades, airpower's most outspoken advocates have done their cause a major disservice.
It naturally follows from this, Gray adds, that whenever airpower has been said to have "failed," it has only been because more was expected of it than it could deliver. After all, any tool can appear deficient if used unwisely or irresponsibly. In this regard, Gray notes how a long his tory of overpromising on the part of airpower's most vocal proponents has needlessly sold the air weapon short for what it is actually able to deliver to joint force commanders today-and not just in high-intensity combat but in all forms of operations across the conflict spectrum.
To be sure, airmen of action may find it trying at times to remain patient with Gray's always purposeful but also often discursive walk through the intellectual thickets of airpower theory. In a frank admis sion of his own appreciation of those readers who will be all too eager for him to get to his point, Gray freely concedes how "theory and theo rists often are regarded with disdain by the people 'out there, doing it,' when in truth the purpose of the theory enterprise is both to reduce the risks to the warriors and to help make their efforts more useful vis√†-vis the operational goals that are set" (p. 41).
Yet were there ever an instance in which patience should have its re wards for mission-oriented airmen of action, it is plainly here, for Airpower for Strategic Effect offers an uncommonly thoughtful application of informed intellect to an explanation of how modern air warfare ca pabilities should be understood. In his last chapter, Gray underscores in this regard the important truth that "airpower theory helps educate airpower strategists," rightly calling it "theory for practice" (p. 275). Furthermore, he instructively adds, it "educates those who write airpower doctrine and serves as a filter against dangerous viruses" (p. 276).
At bottom, the purpose of Gray's treatise is not to extol airpower but to make coherent sense of it by providing informed insights into it and about it that are timeless. For airmen of all ranks, the greatest value that its appreciation of the air weapon can offer is to help them think more reflectively about their calling and to articulate its foundational principles more effectively in the councils of war planning. For woven throughout the book is a compelling explication of what modern airpower entails in its most inner strategic essence. The ultimate aim of that explication is to improve the real-world practice of airpower by op erators at all levels most responsible for its effective use. In Golden Nuggets, Dr. Raymond A. Shulstad identifies performance, professionalism, and professional development as essential to a suc cessful career. Because the path to that objective, however, can present many twists and turns, one must distinguish between the theoretical and practical aspects of those three elements. The author, who retired from the US Air Force as a brigadier general, highlights a number of these struggles in his book as well as ways of overcoming them. Specifically, Dr. Shulstad presents 31 noteworthy principles and practices essential to leadership, management, and personal endeavors. He does so by dividing the book into sections, each one including stand-alone vignettes that address the aforementioned disciplines. Taken collectively, these sketches provide a multifaceted view of the topics, or, if the reader so desires, he or she may easily explore only those that hold the most appeal. Readers should find especially inter Book Reviews digious research in US and European archives, Shooting the Front repre sents a monumental effort to provide an in-depth examination of these important but understudied aspects of the air war as practiced by the major Western allies: France, Britain, and the United States. (Aside from noting the existence of "parallel developments" on the other side of No Man's Land, this study largely ignores aerial reconnaissance and photo graphic interpretation as practiced by the Central Powers.)
As author and retired Air Force intelligence officer Col Terrence J. Finnegan makes clear, the operational impasse associated with trench warfare propelled the marriage of the camera and the airplane. Locked in a static front extending from Switzerland to the North Sea, ground commanders demanded information that could help them break the stalemate on the Western Front-hence their growing dependence on aerial observation and its handmaiden, photographic interpretation, and the rapid maturation of each under the pressure of war.
Both a historical narrative and a comprehensive reference work, Shooting the Front maintains that aerial reconnaissance and photographic interpretation together constituted a military information revolution that "reinvented the way modern battle was envisaged, planned, and executed" (p. 3). In support of that claim, Finnegan argues that aerial photography offered a reliable means to validate what is now known as "fused" intelligence (information drawn from multiple sources), inspired such cartographic innovations as maps composed of numbered and let tered squares (i.e., grid maps), and facilitated an enormous increase in artillery effectiveness by pinpointing the location of ground targets. Few would dispute either these assertions or Finnegan's broader conclusion that aerial observation "created an air of greater confidence for the front line combatant in what often seemed a fruitless and never-ending en deavor" (p. 4). On the other hand, students of World War I aviation will note that the author fails to recognize a more troubling impact of aerial observation on the nature of combat in the Great War: by diminishing the possibility of surprise, air reconnaissance contributed substantially to the murderous stalemate on the Western Front.
That omission aside, this study has many virtues. Chief among them is its detailed examination of the emerging craft of photographic inter pretation. Finnegan's treatment of that subject is further enlivened by his informed appraisals of the exceptional individuals-military men, scientists, and even artists-who promoted the rapid development of this fledgling military specialty between 1914 and 1918. Another key finding involves the close, nurturing relationship between French air men and intelligence personnel and their eager but inexperienced American counterparts. Contrary to the received wisdom that empha sizes the importance of British tutelage, Finnegan convincingly argues that a Franco-American entente cordiale played the largest part in the success of the US Air Service's observation efforts. In turn, this close partnership resulted in lessons learned that established the basic op erational framework for aerial reconnaissance and photo interpreta tion for the remainder of the twentieth century.
In sum, Shooting the Front is a vast storehouse of useful information and cogent analysis on a long-neglected subject. It is well written throughout and graced by numerous period photographs, maps, and drawings. Especially worthy of note is the author's skill at rendering the more arcane aspects of his study comprehensible to nonspecialist read ers. Shooting the Front is highly recommended to anyone seriously inter ested in the evolution of air intelligence or World War I aviation history. Other students of modern warfare will find it a useful reference source.

All of the case studies examine alleviating the causes of genocide be fore they become critical, each one supplying the background and im petus for each event, generally in terms of Gregory Stanton's "Eight Stages of Genocide," and concentrating on the organization, polariza tion, and preparation phases of the model. These three stages, which encompass the forming of groups and organizations to facilitate killing, separating the groups, and then identifying targets and concentrating the victims, warn of a possible impending genocide
The "process" of genocide can be difficult to understand in its terrible complexity. Peifer, however, adroitly explains both the process and the means by which different international organizations fit into prevent ing this horrific act. His definition of genocide-killing people simply because they belong to a specific group (p. 8)-is highly political in na ture since, legally, the United Nations must act upon instances of genocide. This fact became important when the United States deliber ately avoided using the term during the Rwandan episode (p. 6). The authors emphasize that intervention in any of the stages of genocide could save lives, depending on when and how such action takes place.
In terms of using airpower as an intervention tool, all of the contribu tors note the utility of airlift and intelligence, surveillance, and recon naissance in a campaign and of firepower supplied by light attack air craft and helicopters. Major Stanley discusses some of the problems associated with utilizing airpower in Africa, specifically addressing the logistical nightmare of introducing the troops and planes necessary to stop the genocide in Rwanda (pp. 69-71). Colonel Reeves also uses the experience in Rwanda as the basis for calling on airpower to intervene, focusing on an operational concept to target key aspects of the "killing machine" in order to slow or stop it (p. 83). Unfortunately, many ques tions regarding airpower as an intervention tool-including logistics, time, and capabilities-are left unanswered. Gradually, the earlier time frame accelerates, "catching" the later setting, and the book's latter stages summarize General Petraeus's command tenure, the killing of Osama bin Laden, and, finally, President Barack Obama's decision on 24 June 2011 to be gin the drawdown of forces from Afghanistan.
McChrystal was visiting the leadership of several NATO nations. In what appears to be a "perfect storm," the author captures several sala cious quotations, primarily from a small handful of aides, over dinner and other conversations that he openly shares with the reader. It's clear, at least to this reader, that the aides to McChrystal did not expect their comments to appear in an article, despite Hastings's claims in Book Reviews esting the author's own vignette, which offers his personal reflections on leadership and management.
Gratifyingly, Golden Nuggets is written in such a way that one can readily follow Dr. Shulstad's reasoning on various topics. Furthermore, his use of plain, straightforward language facilitates the reader's under standing of the author's practical insights into leadership, management, and a successful career. Indeed, after all is said and done, one wishes for more pages to read. I highly recommend this book to all career-minded professionals. Learning from Dr. Shulstad's experiences is not only en joyable but also essential to advancement in today's competitive world. Leighton Brewer's admonishment notwithstanding, tales of World War I fighter pilots continue to dominate the literature on aviation in that war. In contrast, writers have paid far less attention to the contributions of airmen involved in the less glamorous mission of aerial reconnais sance-or "observation," as it originally was known. And virtually noth ing has been written about the World War I origins and rapid evolution of "photographic interpretation"-the art and science of analyzing aerial photographs for useful information. At over 500 pages and based on pro
