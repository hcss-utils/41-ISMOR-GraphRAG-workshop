Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter has sought to frame an approach to Russia that is "strong and balanced": strong because the United States is making investments in a military capability specifically intended to deter Russian forces and balanced in that he seeks to work with Russia on issues where geostrategic interests "as Putin perceives them" are "compatible."
He also suggested that the U.S. is: continuing to hold the door open in case Putin or his successors decide to go in the direction where I believe Russia's long-term future lies, a future in which there are economic and political opportunities for the people there.
