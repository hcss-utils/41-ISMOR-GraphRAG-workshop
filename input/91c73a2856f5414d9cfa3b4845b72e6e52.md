Russia was suffering from an economic crisis when it attacked Chechnya in the First Russo-Chechen War.
The cost of oil increased during the Second Chechen War, which allowed Russia to put its economy on a good footing and to also take measures against former Soviet states to prevent them from joining NATO.
Russia fought in Georgia in 2008 and began a conflict with Ukraine over Crimea and the Donbas region to prevent such an encroachment of NATO states and prevent the loss of their key Black Sea Fleet bases.
Another benefit of the increase in oil prices was Russia could upgrade its artillery.
This is identified with the production of the 2S35 and Global Navigation Satellite System (GLONASS)-enabled munition.
One can learn much from an adversary through their triumphs and failures over a timeframe as well as learn from one's own triumphs and failures.
Historically, the United States has not gone to war with the country(ies) it has planned to fight but should continually strive to be prepared for such a war with a near-peer adversary.
