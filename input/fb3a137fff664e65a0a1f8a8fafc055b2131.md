The same is true of World War II-that is to say, the war arose out of the complex relationship between Germany and Russia.
On the surface, both of them had a great deal in common in the post-1918 era.
The Tsarist and German Empires were gone, the victims of popular discontent and revolution.
In their place were regimes dominated by modern ideologies-communism for the Soviet Union, first democracy and then fascism for Germany.
Both states had suffered grievous territorial losses as a result of the war, and worst of all, the postwar settlement had resurrected the state of Poland, a fact that neither was inclined to accept in the long term.
Indeed, the Chief of the German Army High Command in the early 1920s, General Hans von Seeckt, had gone so far as to say that Poland's existence was "unbearable" (unertr√§glich) for Germany.
