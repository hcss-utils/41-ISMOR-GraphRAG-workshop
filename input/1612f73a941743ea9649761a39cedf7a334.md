In addition, British national level intelligence organizations would support Dunsterforce.
The British Directorate of Military Intelligence was reorganized in 1916 and for a short time in 1918, intelligence and operations were combined into a single organization (MIO) responsible for all matters "concerning Russia, Rumania, Siberia, Central Asia, Caucasus, Persia and Afghanistan."
