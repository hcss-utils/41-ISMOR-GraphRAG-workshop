There seems to be an instinctive longing among warriors to be part of the decisive elements of the military.
Before World War I, the decisive elements were the infantry units; both reconnaissance and artillery spotting were auxiliary to infantry combat.
However, the notion that airplanes could also be decisive in fighting quickly gained currency.
The idea of bombing had been thought of and actually tried from balloons.
American airplanes fired Lewis machine guns at ground targets in College Park, Maryland, in 9, and bombs dropped from Army aircraft not long after.
The Hague Peace Conference of 899 prohibited the bombing of cities, though that did not last.
The Italians actually used aircraft bombing in Tripoli before World War I. Even aerial evacuation had been conceptualized to rescue political leader Leon Gambetta from the Prussian siege of Paris during the Franco-Prussian War.
Carrier pigeons and balloons had long been used to carry messages out of isolated places.
Thus, we can see that most of the military airpower missions had been envisioned before the first air war started in 94.
