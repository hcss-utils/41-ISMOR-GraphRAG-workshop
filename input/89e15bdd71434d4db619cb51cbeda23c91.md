# Fulltext:
In order to truly deter Russian non-linear warfare in the Baltic States, any US force positioned there needs to be able to hold key terrain, block an armored penetration, and enable the secure and timely flow of follow on forces.
An army division, brigade task force, or a Baltic State-based MAGTF would provide the capabilities required to offset Russian mass at key points, while simultaneously setting conditions and coordinating for the follow on flow of forces.
