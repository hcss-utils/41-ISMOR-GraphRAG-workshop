In support of the conclusions drawn from the case studies, the author presents in brief two additional examples of how Russia uses media, influence agents, and organizations as the basis of its NTW build-up.
The first example is the Catalan independence referendum in Spain in 2017, when, like in Estonia in 2007, Russia interfered in the internal matters of a NATO and the EU member-state.
The second example, which example, RT "[was] using its Spanish-language portal to spread stories on the Catalan crisis with a bias against constitutional legality."
656 Also, it seems that Julian Assange, the founder of Wikileaks, acted as Russia's influence agent because he "[became] the principal international agitator in the Catalan crisis, sharing opinions and half-truths as if they were news."
657 In addition, "automated "bots," including Russian propaganda ones, amplified tweets by Assange and former United States National Security Agency (NSA) contractor-turned-leaker Edward Snowden," 658 and "pro-Kremlin websites including Disobedient Media, News-Front, and Russia News Now spread fake or biased news about the situation in Catalonia."
