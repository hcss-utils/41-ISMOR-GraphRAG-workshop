In the early 1980s, China faced a similar moment, where the arms race between the Soviet Union and the United States was driving rapid innovations and the creation of an entirely new type of next-generation fighter jet exemplified by the Su-27 and the F-15.
These aircraft were fast, maneuverable and could carry a wide range of advanced weapons.
Similarly, in the mid-to-long term, Russia and the U.S. are investing in truly-next generation weapons after the refinement of advanced technologies such as stealth that began to be introduced at the end of the Cold War.
