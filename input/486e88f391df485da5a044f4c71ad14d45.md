The notion that other states have designs on Russian territory is taken as a given among a broad range of senior Russian military and civilian officials.
This includes a long list of supposed territorial disputes with Russia, some of which have long faded into history on the other side of the border.
For example, a briefing on "Threats to the Military Security of the Russian Federation" given by former Chief of General Staff Sergey Makarov to the Academy of Military Sci-ences in early-2011 began with a map slide showing these disputes along almost the entire European periphery of Russia-including such implausible ones as Germany wishing to reclaim Kaliningrad, or Finland, Karelia.
The idea also includes the id√©e fixe that Russia is a rich and desirable country, whose natural resources present a tempting target for potential invaders.
In effect, Russia projects its own history and principles onto foreign partners who have not the slightest desire to march on Moscow.
