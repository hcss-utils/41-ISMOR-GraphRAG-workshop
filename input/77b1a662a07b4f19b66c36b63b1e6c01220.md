The first risk of applying the MDO concept to the ROK military is unnecessary friction with other neighboring countries, such as China and Russia.
Although the ROK aims to primarily counter North Korean hybrid warfare threats with the MDO concept, the US Army MDO concept explicitly seeks to "deter and defeat Chinese and Russian aggression in both competition and conflict.
"2 21 F 222 Thus, adopting the concept as it is might signal to China and Russia that the ROK is willing to be part of the US actions of neutralizing Chinese or Russian A2/AD systems against those countries, and it might create unnecessary friction with them.
Nevertheless, it is possible to mitigate the risks by not blindly adopting the concept but optimizing in the Korean context, for operating in the multi-domain itself is not a new theme, and many countries, including the ROK, are already pursuing the effective operations in a multi-domain environment.
Thus, formatting and reasoning within the concept need to mitigate the risk.
