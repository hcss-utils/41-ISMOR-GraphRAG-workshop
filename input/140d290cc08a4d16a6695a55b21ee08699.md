Russian military operations in Syria exemplify the use of a strategy of limited action to defend and promote national interests outside of Russia's borders.
The military operations in Syria adhered to the strategy's focus on the use of a self-sufficient grouping of forces selected from a branch of the armed forces that has a high degree of mobility and can make the greatest contribution to achieving the objective.
In Syria, Russia developed their grouping of forces around the VKS.
The VKS served as the armed forces branch with the highest degree of mobility and ability to provide the greatest contribution to Russia's campaign to simultaneously establish and secure Russian military bases in Syria, reestablish and retrain the Syrian military, and force concessions from the Syrian opposition forces.
The operations also exemplified the strategy's requirement of attaining and maintaining information superiority, command and control readiness, logistics systems readiness, and the covert deployment of the force grouping.
