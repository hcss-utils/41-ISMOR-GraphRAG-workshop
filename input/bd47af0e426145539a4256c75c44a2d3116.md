The strategic pipeline, Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC), was inaugurated in 2005.
Beginning in Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan, and transiting through the territory of the former Soviet Republic of Georgia towards the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, it was the first major pipeline to bypass Russian territory.
From there, oil is taken by tankers to the world markets.
Having up to one million barrels per day capacity, the pipeline has an even more important strategic implication.
It will strengthen the political and economic independence of the countries of the region from possible resurgent Russian ambitions.
But even before its completion, it had also marked the beginning of the new "Great Game" with global and regional powers such as the US, China, and Russia vying for influence in the area.
Once again the region became very attractive for global geopolitics, enhanced by the discoveries of natural resources in Afghanistan such as natural gas, oil, marble, gold, copper, chromite, etc.
