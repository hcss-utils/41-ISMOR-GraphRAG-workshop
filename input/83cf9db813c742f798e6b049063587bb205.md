The nature of security and warfare remain eternal and are reflected in the beliefs of regional actors.
Technological advances and new tactics fail to alter the basic elements of conflict management and state motivation.
Fear, honor, and interest will always drive state behavior just as they did in Ancient Greece.
Fear, honor, and interest not only explain the security concerns of regional actors, but potential conflicts involving North and South Korea, China, Russia, and the United States.
Despite these similarities, the characteristics of security are evolving and the security concerns of Asian-Pacific actors reflect this growing trend.
Not only are cyber capabilities a concern, but also WMD.
To further America's security interests in the region, the US should mitigate conflict through maintaining an active military presence in the region, while building regional partnerships and cooperating with the Chinese to the extent cooperation is feasible.
