Second, a more proficient Russian military would still be structurally and qualitatively different than the U.S. military.
Although Russia has made progress toward increased contract staffing and improved training, one must avoid the mirror image fallacy in comparisons to American analogues.
Even if Russia ultimately realizes its ambitions for a robust, professional NCO corps, Russian NCOs are still more like enlisted professionals, having a narrow, technical focus on their specific specialty.
651 Russian officers still will be expected to perform many of the roles and responsibilities that Western NCOs fill, and the use of short-term conscripts in many service support roles will continue.
Russia is also making efforts to learn the lessons from recent combat deployments, especially in Syria, to improve real-world decisionmaking and encourage creativity and initiative among officers in a clear departure from traditional Russian military culture.
However, it is unlikely that a maneuver warfare mindset and proclivity for mission-type orders will permeate through all ranks of Russia's Armed Forces in the near future.
