.Although the chances for North Korea's collapse are not great, we need to prepare for those contingencies.
Otherwise, North Korea may exploit our lack of preparedness.
Despite our efforts to reduce North Korean military capabilities, the chances that North Korea might provoke a crisis still remain high because Kim Jong II rules the country based on support from the military.
Because North Korea is well aware that South Korea, the United States, China, Japan, and Russia do not want to escalate a crisis into a war, North Korea will likely exploit our willingness to maintain peace and stability on the Korean peninsula by threatening to go to war as a means to receive more concessions from the external world, as was witnessed in the nuclear crisis of 1994.
