In designing future expeditionary concepts, the Marine Corps should consider the valid points of both views of future war.
The Marine Corps cannot prepare for only one or the other, but must remain capable of responding across the entire spectrum of armed conflict.
While many claim the end of the Cold War has led to a "new world disorder" and the rise of "new wars," regional powers such as China, Russia, North Korea, India, and Iran maintain large conventional armed forces capable of challenging American military supremacy in a MRC.
The Marine Corps must remain prepared to project expeditionary power ashore in a high-tech conventional war, as part of a joint or coalition force, as well as smaller-scale unconventional contingencies fought in deteriorating Third World nations.
