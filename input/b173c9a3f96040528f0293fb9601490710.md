In this Letort Paper, Dr. Andrew Monaghan, a British academic and long-term scholar of Russia based at Chatham House in London, reflects on the view from Moscow.
In so doing, he illustrates the increasingly obvious gulf in how security is perceived in Western capitals and in Moscow.
Importantly, he emphasizes that the Russian leadership faces numerous doubts and difficulties-to include doubting that, in Clausewitzian terms, Russia is able to withstand the test of war.
This is both the root of the emergency measures that the Russian leadership is implementing across the system, from the economy to the political system and the military, and the root of the major investment program to modernize the military that was under way even before the Ukraine crisis erupted in 2014 and led to a sharp deterioration in Russia's relations with the United States and the West more broadly.
