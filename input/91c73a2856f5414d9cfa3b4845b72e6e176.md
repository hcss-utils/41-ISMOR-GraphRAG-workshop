6 The Russian Way of War is a comprehensive study by Dr. Les Grau and Charles Bartles from the Foreign Military Studies Office located at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.
Both are well-renown experts in the field of Russian war and tactics.
Field Manual (FM) 100-2-1, The Soviet Army: Operations and Tactics from July of 1984, provides a baseline knowledge of Soviet tactics and organization during the Cold War and provides an unclassified view of how Russia used artillery in Chechnya.
The National Security Strategies (NSS) of the United States and Russia describe the focus of each country on potential global threats and explains deterrence strategies in preparation for a conflict that may or may not happen.
The NSS further examines what internal and external factors lead to military development.
The researcher will show how the United States NSS relates to the European Command Military Strategy to formulate a baseline with which to focus the importance of artillery to Russia's deterrence policy.
