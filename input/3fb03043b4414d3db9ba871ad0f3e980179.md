Later wars bore out these lessons learned as America and Russia pitted their aircraft against each other, competing for dominance of the skies in wars conducted over proxy states' airspace.
America continued to make advances in both aircraft designs and the ability to deliver accurate weapons while Russia introduced its own new aircraft, antiaircraft AAA and SAMs.
It was not until DESERT STORM, though, that America's air power achieved superior results executing tactics aimed at gaining air superiority.
Once it was gained through the aid of advanced stealth technology, the air assets were then able to focus the bulk of their efforts towards achieving the Combatant Commander's objectives.
This similar strategy also played out in ALLIED FORCE, ENDURING FREEDOM, and IRAQI FREEDOM and continues to be maintained in the latter two operations today.
The USAF has learned that when using technology that is superior to its enemy's ability to deny them access, that air superiority can be quickly gained and at a limited cost to its own aircraft.
America's enemies have learned that their anti-access capabilities need to keep up with the advances in stealth technology to prevent similar courses of action occurring against them.
