Using the cyber means for delivery dispenses with the need for a vast transportation network of ships, trains, or planes, to move goods to war.
In turn, the ability to manufacture weapons of war so quickly and move them at A counter argument to the increased capability of the cyber mode of transportation is the continued need for resources.
While a 3D printer can manufacture items at great speed and distance, the technology still needs a source of slurry from which to build weapons or supplies.
Thus, those nations that have greater resources, the great-power nations of today-the United States, Russia, China, and the nations of Western Europe-will still have much to say about the use of those resources for war.
In either case, as the technological landscape changes, the US should take heed not just of the benefits-more stuff faster to war-but also the impacts to global order.
