The first and last elements of Russia's security strategy, strategic deterrence and internal security, are inherently defensive, although strategic deterrent forces could threaten the United States and its allies.
It is unlikely that the United States would initiate conflict with Russia or intervene militarily to support internal groups.
The United States should, therefore, not see these capabilities as posing an immediate threat to U.S. interests.
Nevertheless, Russia clearly sees threats from the United States and the rest of NATO from NATO enlargement and the enhancement of U.S.-NATO military capabilities on its borders.
Though neither the European Deterrence Initiative nor the NATO Enhanced Forward Presence battalions are likely to trigger a Russian military response, the possibility exists that Russia's view of the threat could increase or a crisis could develop that could lead to unintended military escalation.
U.S. policymakers need to be attuned to Russian perceptions of the threat posed by U.S. force deployments in Europe.
