The second mistake was made on February 23, 2014, when the inexperienced Rada, the Ukrainian Parliament, revoked a law that had protected and given official status to the Russian language, which significantly contributed to Russian-speaking Crimeans supporting Moscow's side against the country's administration.
The third mistake was the Ukrainian government's inability to keep post-revolutionary forces under control and to properly respond when, on February 24, 2014, the leader of a far-right political party publicly threatened to send his paramilitary troops to Crimea to restore public order.
As stated by American military expert Kofman, because of the Ukrainian government's poor reaction, Moscow was able to convince its home audience through propaganda that Russian-speaking residents of Crimea were in serious danger and that Russian intervention in Crimea was necessary and justified.
