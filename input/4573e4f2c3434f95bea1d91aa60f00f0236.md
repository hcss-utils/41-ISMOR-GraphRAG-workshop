Prior to the convention, the parties addressed issues narrowly rather than within a global context or used various strategies of force.
After the convention, many fundamental fears dispersed.
For instance, the written record committed Russia to keeping Afghanistan outside its sphere of influence.
The commitment bound them to not send political agents to Afghanistan, an important distinction since the two Anglo-Afghan Wars started because of Russian envoys in Kabul.
Such new rules diminished British fears about Russia's intentions regarding its vital interests.
