If one considers these four dimensions to include all the different tasks and duties described in the military doctrine, understandably, Russia's main means of deterrence is its offensive capability conferred by nuclear and conventional weapons, which has historically been the country's key deterrent against NATO and the United States (objective 1).
In order to continue to successfully deter Western military power, Russia needs economic and political strength based in domestic and international support (objective 2).
International support comes through extended security relationships with non-Western and peripheral countries, whereas domestic support will come from patriotically educated citizens.
