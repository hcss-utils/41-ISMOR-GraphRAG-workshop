If the United States chooses to engage in GPC in Syria, a recognition of the stakes and commitments of each side should aid in the selection of a strategy.
Given Iran and Russia's commitment to expanding their influence in the Middle East, the United States needs only impose adequate costs and expose the weaknesses of its adversaries to achieve its strategic goal of weakening Iran and Russia in the region.
Should the United States choose a policy of competition, proper application of irregular warfare could present it with additional strategic opportunities and responsibilities to capitalize on the failure of the Iranian and Russian venture in Syria.
