Against the UK, Chinese IRBMs and short-range ICBMs would cover most of the cities and a reasonable percentage of the airfields until MIRVing would allow China to cover UK airfields well.
Still, it is likely that the primary target of this force is Russia as opposed to any European country, and China would not have sufficient missiles in these classes to fully cover both Russia and the military targets in Europe even when China miniaturizes its warheads.
Thus, it seems likely that most of these missiles would be targeted against Russia, but a small portion of these missiles would be retained for strategic coercion of Europe, seeking primarily to deter actions by the European countries rather than seeking to defeat/destroy them.
