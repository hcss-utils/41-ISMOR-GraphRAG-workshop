How did economic and financial factors determine how America waged war in the twentieth century? This important new book exposes the influence of economics and finance on the questions of whether the nation should go to war, how wars would be fought, how resources would be mobilized, and the long-term consequences for the American economy. Ranging from the Spanish-American War to the Gulf War, Hugh Rockoff explores the ways in which war can provide unique opportunities for understanding the basic principles of economics as wars produce immense changes in monetary and fiscal policy and so provide a wealth of information about how these policies actually work. He shows that wars have been more costly to the United States than most Americans realize as a substantial reliance on borrowing from the public, money creation, and other strategies to finance America's war efforts have hidden the true cost of war.

| A century of war
The sinews of war are infinite money.
This book is about the economic causes and consequences of the wars that the United States fought in the twentieth century. Although the general public and professional historians focus considerable attention on wars, economists tend to neglect them. To be sure, there is a small group of economic historians who have diligently worked to increase our knowledge of the economics of war -one of the purposes of this book is to bring their findings to the attention of a larger audiencebut it is fair to say that economists as a whole tend to think of peace as the norm and war as an exception to be ignored. But the idea that war can be regarded as a rare outlier belies the truth: America was at war somewhere in the world during a significant portion of the twentieth century.
The wars that opened the century, the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars, required relatively small fractions of the nation's resources. The two world wars that followed required much larger fractions, and brought in their train far-reaching networks of government control. The post-World War II conflicts in Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq again were "limited wars," similar to the wars that opened the century, rather than to the world wars. Indeed, there is a sense in which we have come full circle: the wars which America is now fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan bear a strong and often unsettling likeness to the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars. Each war presented unique military, political, and economic challenges, but there were many common elements. In this volume I will try to summarize these elements by answering some of the most familiar questions about the economics of America's wars, starting with questions about how the country got into the wars, moving on to questions about how they were fought, and ending with questions How did America fight its wars?
Inevitably, whatever the initial intentions, wars became cruel as financial costs and casualties mounted. When the war in the Philippines began, few Americans would have believed that the "water cure," forced concentration of the population, burning of crops, and other brutal tactics would be used by the United States. When World War II began, few Americans would have believed that it would lead to the firebombing of cities, to two nuclear bombs, and to millions of civilian deaths. Mass bombing of civilian targets was used again in the Vietnam War, and few Americans would have thought that a likely outcome when the war began. Of course, most nations fight wars ferociously. But the number of casualties America inflicted on its enemy's civilian population was often high because America's armed forces employed a high ratio of capital to labor. In other words, the United States at war behaved much like a private firm faced with low interest rates relative to wages and substituted capital for labor.
The twentieth century saw the development of many new capitalintensive weapons, but above all it was the airplane that allowed the United States to exploit its lead in capital and technology. World War I saw the beginnings of air warfare, but aircraft could play only a supporting role; after all, that war began in August 1914, just eleven years after the Wright brothers' first successful flight at Kitty Hawk. But progress in utilizing this new technology was rapid. By the end of the war, as we will see, the United States was producing airplane engines at a rate approaching 50,000 per year. In World War II, of course, the airplane became a major component in America's campaigns against Germany and Japan, and then it was a mainstay of US forces in Korea, Vietnam, and the Persian Gulf War. Unmanned drones have become a major tool in the ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. The airplane is the ultimate expression of America's capitalintensive way of war and the destruction of civilian populations that was a consequence.
There are many ways of financing wars. For example, civilian spending can be cut or the government can rely on gifts: contributions by America's Mideast partners defrayed a substantial part of the costs of 4
A century of war the Persian Gulf War. Indeed, one of the purposes of this book is to explore the ways in which the financing of wars influences and is influenced by almost every aspect of a war economy. Policies that at first sight seem far removed from finance, such as price and wage controls and the draft, I will try to show, are closely tied to the process of war finance. Nevertheless, economists tend to focus on three methods -taxes, borrowing, and printing money -because, typically, these were the most important. Printing money, of course, has a bad name, because it produces inflation. But in World War I, World War II, and during the Vietnam era, America relied in part on the printing press. There were several reasons. One was simply that the wars were costly and the government was reluctant to push tax finance and bond finance to the extent necessary to finance the entire war. The establishment of the Federal Reserve, moreover, hid the process of money creation. In the nineteenth century the connection between the printing press and inflation was visible to the naked eye because new forms of currency were introduced. In the twentieth century the connection was much harder to see: the Federal Reserve would purchase government bonds, creating new balances for the Treasury. When these were spent the additional competition for goods would bid up prices. But it was harder for the public to see the connection. Inflation might well be blamed on war profiteers rather than monetary policy. It was not always necessary to resort to inflation to finance the war.
Most of the smaller wars -the Spanish-American, Philippine-American, Korean, and Persian Gulf Wars -were financed without inflation. Debt finance was an important source of financing for the world wars and the Vietnam War. The American capital market was sufficiently broad, and the credit of the US government sufficiently good, for it to finance smaller wars without having to pay significantly higher interest rates. But in the world wars interest rates might have risen if the Federal Reserve had not stepped in and created additional liquidity in financial markets. Rising interest rates would be a sign to the public that the war was costly. They also might be a sign to enemies that the war was straining the country's resources.
In the world wars the government tried to encourage private purchases of bonds with patriotic campaigns that included bond rallies and now famous posters: "Get in the Scrap, Buy War Bonds Now." How much the campaigns really contributed in terms of broadening the market for bonds and holding rates on them below what they How did America finance its wars? otherwise would have been is debatable. However, they must have had some effect, and they strengthened support for the war, and eased anxieties, by giving people a way of demonstrating their support. They also helped suppress the increase in interest rates that might have signaled the cost of the war.
Finally, the cost of each of the United States' wars was, until the most recent war in Iraq, defrayed in part by raising taxes. It was an honorable tradition. Raising taxes, of course, communicated the cost of the war to the public. So most governments did what they could to mitigate the political fallout. One strategy was to press for a tax bill as soon as a war began. In this way the government could take advantage of the early enthusiasm for the war. In the Spanish-American War the government relied in part on "sin" taxes, such as those on alcohol, tobacco, and chewing gum. In the First World War it increased income tax only for the very wealthy. In World War II and Korea, however, a combination of liberal administrations and broad-based support for the war led to broad-based increases in taxes. Indeed, a kind of high point was reached during the Korean War, when under the indefatigable Harry S. Truman the government financed most of the war with taxes. The Vietnam War, however, was a different story, and marked a return to an earlier form of war finance. President Lyndon Johnson was deeply concerned that a tax increase would reveal the cost of the Vietnam War to the public and undermine support for his Great Society program. Despite rising inflation and recommendations from his economic advisors Johnson refused, for a long time, to call for higher taxes. Eventually, however, he relented and called for a limited tax "surcharge."
The idea that in economic terms wars are "good" because they stimulate the economy derives mainly from the US experience in World War II. However, while the mobilization did play a part in returning the economy to full employment, the idea that it took a full-blown world war to lift the United States out of the Depression is an exaggeration. By December of 1941, when the United States entered World War II, unemployment was close to the 1929 level and falling steadily: 1942 would have been a boom year even in the absence of Pearl Harbor. Other forms of spending, moreover, could have taken the role played 6
A century of war by spending on armaments in the late 1930s and early 1940s. And the highly expansionary monetary policies followed during World War II could have been followed in any case.
Does economics have anything useful to say about wars?
Many scholars, including some economists, reject the idea that economics -based on self-interested consumers, profit-maximizing firms, supply and demand, and so on -is of much value at any time.
For them it is obvious that wartime economies are even less susceptible to traditional economic analysis. They would argue that the idea that people are simple, self-interested, and rational calculators surely does not apply in wartime when national interests borne on waves of patriotism take center stage. Indeed, in empirical studies wars are often treated as "outliers," periods that can be neglected because they have little in common with peacetime. This attitude, I believe, is a mistake. Wars often provide better evidence about how the economy works than peacetime experiences. Milton Friedman put it this way:
The widespread tendency in empirical studies of economic behavior to discard war years as "abnormal," while doubtless often justified, is, on the whole, unfortunate. The major defect of the data on which economists must rely -data generated by experience rather than deliberately contrived experiments -is the small range of variation they encompass. Experience in general proceeds smoothly and continuously. In consequence, it is difficult to disentangle systematic effects from random variation since both are of much the same order of magnitude.
From this point of view, data for wartime periods are peculiarly valuable. At such times, violent changes in major economic magnitudes occur over relatively brief periods, thereby providing precisely the kind of evidence that we would like to get by "critical" experiments if we could conduct them. 
(Friedman 1952, 612)
Economics, moreover, is inevitably brought into the fray when public debate moves on from whether to go to war, an issue often debated in lofty ethical and philosophical terms, to the practical issue of how to pay for war. Economists approached the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars with the tools and values of classical economics. War was a matter of public finance; and public finance, like private finance, meant balancing the budget. The problem for economists was to recommend the fairest and most efficient way of raising the money the government needed. The view of the economists was widely shared. Taxes, such as sin taxes were raised, but little thought was given to monetary policy or explicit wage and price controls. There was no central bank that could stealthily finance the war by purchasing government bonds, and no reason to engage in the actual printing of new money, the policy adopted during the Revolution, the War of 1812, and the Civil War.
The financing of World War I was very different. Taxes were raised, including income tax, which was now in place as a result of a recent constitutional amendment. But despite higher taxes, deficit spending produced a rapid increase in the public debt. The newly established Federal Reserve was able to finance the purchase of a substantial portion of that debt by printing new money. Perhaps most at variance with classical ideas of war finance, the United States instituted a farreaching set of price and wage controls. All of these policies were quickly abandoned after the war ended. Although some economists began to embrace this mix of policies as appropriate in peacetime, most regarded them as a temporary departure from sound policy forced on the United States by the exigencies of war.
The Great Depression, and the analysis of it in John Maynard 
Keynes's General Theory (1936)
A century of war then would be removed afterwards. Keynesian economics, although it was seldom explicitly acknowledged, was simply the argument that these policies would be useful in peace as well as in war. This mix of policies was adopted again in World War II. And the speed with which they restored full employment helped convince most economists of the correctness of Keynesian economics. The influence of Keynesian economics during the Korean War, however, was limited. President Truman held traditional views about finance and demanded and got tax increases that went a long way toward financing the war. And the Federal Reserve, concerned about a temporary surge in inflation, was able to assert its independence, including the right to raise interest rates as an anti-inflationary measure.
World Wars I and II helped establish Keynesian economics, but the Vietnam War undermined it. To be sure, Keynesian economists, including those at the Council of Economic Advisors, recommended tax increases to fight the inflation that began to emerge in the late 1960s as the Vietnam War intensified -tax increases that had been delayed and then limited mainly for political reasons. But inflation still posed a major theoretical problem for Keynesian economics, which by that decade had been augmented by the Phillips Curve, the idea that there was a stable negative relationship between unemployment and inflation. But in the late 1960s inflation began to rise without unemployment falling to the low levels that had prevailed in World War II and the Korean War. Macroeconomists now began to listen more to Milton Friedman and his monetarist colleagues who argued that there was no permanent tradeoff between inflation and unemployment, and that controlling the money supply, a policy considered of secondary importance in Keynesian macroeconomics, was in fact the key to controlling inflation.
In the ensuing years a third school of economics, what might be called the Minnesota School, came to prominence. Sometimes also called the Freshwater School to differentiate it from the Neo-Keynesian views dominant on the coasts, the Minnesota School emphasized the potential negative effects of tax increases on work effort, even in wartime. Lee E. 
Ohanian (1997)
Did the United States rely on central planning to reallocate resources in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War?
It is sometimes assumed that wars prove that central planning is a more efficient mechanism for allocating resources than the incentive system used by the market, at least in national emergencies. In both World War I and World War II, and to a lesser extent during the Korean War, the United States imposed a comprehensive system of wage and price controls, and created federal agencies charged with controlling and maximizing war production. In fact, for better or worse, the United States relied mainly on incentives, "throwing money at the problem," to achieve the desired reallocation of resources from the civilian sector to the military sector. In both World War I and World War II the most celebrated attempts to impose a more centralized system for allocating resources, such as the Controlled Material Plan of World War II, came too late to have much effect on the crucial reallocation of resources.
Wars have produced the most important reorganizations of the world's financial system. The major industrial nations, with the exception of the United States, left the gold standard during World War I. Most returned during the 1920s. But the major industrial nations, including the United States, abandoned gold once again during the Great Depression. After World War II a new financial system, the Bretton Woods system, was established, with fixed exchange rates and the dollar as the world's central currency. As part of this agreement, the International Monetary Fund and World Bank were established to help maintain global financial stability and promote growth. This system appeared to work well for a time. But increases in US inflation and deterioration in its balance of payments, in part consequences of the Vietnam War, led to America's decision to abandon the Bretton Woods system and to adopt the modern system of fluctuating exchange rates.
A century of war How costly were America's wars?
The wars of the twentieth century were extraordinarily costly. World War II, the most expensive, cost the United States more than 400,000 lives and almost one and one-third years of GDP. Smaller wars, of course, were less costly, although expenditure did mount up. The Philippine-American War cost nearly as much as the Spanish-American War. The long period of heightened military spending after the Philippine War -what President Theodore Roosevelt called a "large policy," and what his critics called imperialism -proved to be even more expensive in resources if not in lives. Expenditure on the Cold War was greater than that on World War I and nearly as great (in terms of resources) as World War II.
Ultimately, this book is about war finance, but war finance conceived more broadly than is usually the case. There are discussions of taxes and bonds and Federal Reserve policy, as one might expect in a book on such a subject, but there are also discussions of the draft, price controls, and veterans' benefits. The discussion of all of these issues takes us back to questions of war finance. The draft, to take one example, is a moral and philosophical issue, but it is also a form of war finance. The draftee is taxed, this sum being the difference between what the draftee could earn in the private sector and what he or she earns in the armed forces. Price controls are another example. To the extent that controls suppress inflation, they also suppress one of the indicators that the government is involved in an expensive enterprise. True, controls may produce irritating sideeffects, such as black markets or quality deterioration. But the public's ire may be directed at the black marketeers or the firms engaged in quality deterioration, rather than at the government that made the decision to wage war. The ancient Roman statesman and philosopher Cicero put it this way: "the sinews of war are infinite money." Does America reward its veterans generously?
Veterans' benefits are the largest long-run cost of America's wars, one that is hard to take into account during the march to war. Usually America tries to do the right thing by its veterans, but sometimes concerns about the budget have had a major impact. The veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars were well Does America reward its veterans generously? rewarded in comparison with the veterans of past wars in part because their small number posed few fiscal problems. The veterans of World War I, on the other hand, found many of their claims for a bonus blocked repeatedly because of fiscal considerations. World War II veterans were rewarded more generously. Their benefits included the education provisions of the famous GI Bill. However, the latter were reduced for veterans of the Korean War.

Economics is a very unsatisfactory science. But it would have to be much more unsatisfactory than it is if such an event as a war, however extensive and destructive, sufficed to upset its teaching.

because non-pecuniary motives for human action, such as patriotism, take precedence over mere maximization of income. But as I will try to show here, and in more detail in subsequent chapters, the principles of economics can be extremely helpful in understanding the important economic and financial questions posed by America's decisions to go to war.
The economic causes of America's wars
Untangling the complex forces that have propelled Americans into war has perplexed political scientists, historians, and economists. Nevertheless, it is frequently argued that wars were the result of economic forces. These arguments are usually versions of one of three recurring ideas.
1 One argument is that America was driven into foreign wars by the need to capture foreign markets. John Maynard 
Keynes (1964
Keynes ( [1936]]
In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the militaryindustrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist.
3 As Eisenhower's classic statement reminds us, special interests that favor war may include segments of the public sector as well as the private sector. Members of the armed services have good reason to assume that promotion to higher rank will be expedited by service in war, and this provides them an incentive to lobby for the continuation of old wars or the launching of new ones. Other segments of the public sector may also benefit. Experts on foreign policy may benefit when wars they have promoted are launched in parts of the world where they are experts. In a provocative but convincing paper, Gregory D. 
Hess and Athanasios Orphanides (1995)
Once the decision to go to war has been made -a decision often made in the heat of what is rightly called a war fever -policymakers soon realize that the war will be costly, sometimes far more costly than the initial estimates based on the premise of a quick and easy victory. Soldiers must be paid, munitions must be purchased, and armies must be transported to the field of battle. All this costs a great deal. In other words, the question "how will we pay for the war?" usually follows on the heels of "should we go to war?" There are many ways of financing wars, but economists, as we noted in the first chapter, tend to draw attention first to three: raising taxes, borrowing from the public, and printing money. Typically, tax finance means simply raising taxes that were already in place before the war, for example tariffs or income taxes. But at times new taxes are introduced to take advantage of wartime patriotism, for example, an excess profits tax. Borrowing from the public also may mean simply issuing more of the type of security 16
The economics of war that the government used before the war; but at times new securities may be issued to take advantage of patriotism. While taxes and borrowing from the public are easy to understand, the idea of financing a war by "printing money" requires a bit of explanation. In the Civil War, the term printing money could be understood literally. The United States simply printed the famous greenbacks, declared them to be "legal tender" -acceptable for the payment of taxes (except tariffs) or other debts -and used them to pay soldiers. After the establishment of the Federal Reserve in 1913, however, the process was more complex. The Treasury would sell bonds to the public, acquiring cash. The Federal Reserve would then buy some of those bonds on the open market by writing checks on itself. When these checks were deposited in banks the money supply, defined as the sum of currency and deposits, rose. Not literally printing money -although more paper money would get into circulation if people withdrew some of their deposits -but having the same economic effect: the government has more money on hand with which it can pay soldiers and buy munitions.
The latter method of finance tended to conceal the costs of war. If inflation resulted from printing a new form of money, such as the greenback, it was relatively easy to see that the inflation, and the destruction of value it brought, was a cost of the war, although even in this case, some people might be persuaded that the government was printing more money, and adding more zeros as it did so, because prices were rising. In any case, if the Federal Reserve was purchasing bonds on the open market, the source of monetary expansion and inflation was much harder to see.
The purchase of bonds by the Federal Reserve set in motion a multiple expansion of bank deposits. After the initial purchase of government bonds by the Federal Reserve, banks found themselves with increased reserves. They needed to keep only a fraction of these new reserves against the initial deposit; they could use the rest to make loans or purchase additional government bonds. The amount of government bonds purchased in the first round by the Federal Reserve is usually designated finance through direct monetary creation, the subsequent purchases by the banking system as indirect money finance. Box 1, "The mathematics of the printing press," explains the process in more detail.
Define the following terms.
Cb ¼ currency held by banks Cp ¼ currency held by the public Dp ¼ deposits held by the public in banks M ¼ money ¼ Cp þ Dp Db ¼ deposits held by commercial banks at the Federal Reserve (bank reserves)
Bf ¼ government bonds owned by the Federal Reserve Bb ¼ government bonds owned by the commercial banks Bp ¼ government bonds owned by the public Lb ¼ loans to the private sector held by commercial banks b ¼ the bond ratio ¼ Bb/Lb R ¼ the revenue from creating money Rh ¼ the revenue from creating high-powered money Rl ¼ the revenue from creating low-powered money P ¼ the price level V ¼ velocity y ¼ real income
The relationships among the assets defined above are based on highly simplified balance sheets of the Federal Reserve, the commercial banking system, and the public. The economics of war
If there was no banking system, or with a banking system that held 100 percent reserves, then all of the revenues from creating money would flow directly to the government.
With a fractional reserve banking system, however, the revenue from creating money comes from two sources: the flow from creating highpowered money (sometimes known as "base money") and the flow from the expansion of bank money and the investment by the banking system in government bonds, or the investment by its borrowers in government bonds.
With the help of a money supply equation we can gain a sense of the relative magnitude of Rh and Rl. Combining the definitions of M and H and rearranging terms yields the following money supply equation:
Assuming c and r are constant, assuming all the additional resources of the banking system are invested in government bonds, and combining the derivative of (3) with (1) and (2) yields the following: 
Note that if the banking system holds 100 percent in reserves (r ¼ 1) then equation (4) reduces to equation (1): there will be no additional money creation or revenues from a secondary expansion of the banking system. But normally the secondary effects will be larger than the primary effects. For example, if the reserve ratio of the banking system was 10 percent, and the currency ratio was 5 percent, the amount of revenue flowing from the increase in bank money would be six times as large as the amount created by the direct action of the Federal Reserve: (1 À r)/(c þ r) ¼ 6.
The banking system, however, will not necessarily invest all of its new deposits in reserves and government bonds. It may invest part in new loans to the private sector that may or may not be invested in government bonds. In the case in which none of the additional loans to the public were reinvested in government bonds, the government's share of the additional deposits created by the banking sector would be given by the following equation:
The quantity theory of money helps us understand the ultimate sources of these revenue flows. It can be written as follows:
ð6Þ MV ¼ Py
In percentage change terms it is written as follows:
From equation (1) we can write the revenue from creating money in real terms as the product of the amount of new money created and the existing amount of real money balances.
Combining equations ( 
7
The first term on the right-hand side is the revenue generated by the inflation tax: inflation forces money holders to increase their nominal money holdings to maintain the real value of their money holdings.
The second term on the right-hand side is a voluntary loan to the government (or partly to the private sector if the revenues from inflation are shared) arising from the public's desire to increase its money holdings. This desire may arise either because real income is rising (Dy/y is positive) or for other reasons (DV/V is negative).
The economics of war What is the appropriate mixture of taxes, borrowing, and money creation? What percentage of war expenditures should be financed by taxing, what percentage by borrowing, and what percentage by simply printing the money? Economic opinion about the ideal mixture has changed over the years.
Generally, however, economists through the years have agreed that printing money to finance wars, except in desperate circumstances, is unwise because it produces inflation. The Civil War, when prices more than doubled, and the experience in other wartime economies, shows the danger of the printing press. There are reasons, economists understand, why governments might use the printing press to finance wartime expenditures in certain circumstances. The printing press can be pressed into service quickly, and the administrative costs are low compared with conventional forms of taxing, which requires setting up an administrative network, or borrowing, which requires dealing with the financial community.
Some reliance on printing money has been justified from time to time on the grounds that printing money is simply another form of taxation. Just as an income tax reduces the taxpayer's income or the estate tax reduces the value of the taxpayer's estate, inflation reduces the purchasing power of the money in the taxpayer's pocket or bank account. The inflation rate is the tax rate. Real (adjusted for inflation) money balances are the tax base. During the Revolutionary War Benjamin Franklin made this argument as a way of defending the Continental Congress's heavy reliance on the printing press. Indeed, Franklin argued not only that inflation was a tax, but that it was a very fair tax because almost everyone held money, and the tax was applied for exactly the length of time that the money was in taxpayer's possession 
(Grubb 2007)
Lenin has declared that the best way to destroy the Capitalist System is to debauch the currency. By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not only confiscate, but they confiscate Financing wars arbitrarily; and, while the process impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this arbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at confidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those to whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even beyond their expectations or desires, become "profiteers," who are the object of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has impoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation proceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from month to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors, which form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly disordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of wealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery. 
(Keynes 1920
(Keynes [1919]]
Lenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of overturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency. The process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of destruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is able to diagnose.

In great empires the people who live in the capital, and in the provinces remote from the scene of action, feel, many of them, scarce any inconveniency from the war; but enjoy, at their ease, the amusement of reading in the newspapers the exploits of their own fleets and armies. To them this amusement compensates the small difference between the taxes which they pay on account of the war, and those which they had been accustomed to pay in time of peace. They are commonly dissatisfied with the return of peace, which puts an end to their amusement, and to a The economics of war thousand visionary hopes of conquest and national glory from a longer continuance of the war.

By World War I concerns about equity had begun to play a major role in the thinking of economists. However, these concerns again pointed to taxes as the most desirable means of financing a war. With bond finance a soldier drafted into the army would suffer doubly, once when he was drafted and again when he paid higher taxes imposed to pay off wartime debt after the war. With tax finance the soldier would make the greater sacrifice, possibly his life, but the man who stayed home would pay for the increase in government expenditures.
Economists had always understood that higher taxes in wartime could discourage work effort, especially because they were temporary. Why spend long hours at one's desk or in the factory, if the government was simply going to tax away the financial gain? It might be hoped that patriotism would offset the effects of higher taxes, but if patriotism could not be relied on, it would be better to raise taxes only a little during the war, by enough to assure payment of interest on the debt, and then keep them higher after the war to fund the gradual retirement of the debt. If taxes were plotted against time, they would show a gradually rounded swelling, rather than a sharp peak during the war. Debt should be employed, to use the economists' favorite term, to smooth taxes. Robert J.

The three typical forms of finance -taxing, borrowing, and printing money -are, as I have noted, by no means the only ways that a nation can acquire resources for a war. Resources can also be acquired, for example, through voluntary contributions. The families who brought blankets to their soldiers during the Revolutionary War are an early example. The scrap drives of World War I and World War II, and the financial contributions made to the United States by Saudi Arabia to offset US costs during the Persian Gulf War, which we will discuss below, are twentieth-century examples.
In some cases resources can be taken from the enemy. In the nineteenth century armies often focused on capturing artillery so that it could be turned against enemy troops. In the twentieth century the specialized ammunition and training that would be needed to make use of captured weapons made this a less useful tactic. There were still many ways, however, to make use of resources captured from the enemy. Ships and railroad cars, for example, can be confiscated and used to transport troops and supplies. Once the enemy has been defeated new governments can be installed that impose taxes that can defray the costs of occupation. This was the case in the Philippines, a case we will explore below, and it was a hoped-for result in the Iraq War. In some cases formal reparations can be imposed, as was done with Germany after World War I. Acquiring resources from the enemy reduces the cost of war to the American people. Exaggerated hopes for resources from this source, however, may hide, for a time, the ultimate cost of the war.
Another way to acquire war resources is to reduce government spending on non-military categories or even on military categories not directly related to the war. Governments can reduce the 24
The economics of war amounts spent on maintaining roads, subsidizing the production of agricultural products, undertaking scientific research, and so on. Delayed maintenance of roads and other means of transport is another hidden cost of war. Taxpayers being asked for money to repair roads and highways in the postwar period, sums that may have been magnified because scheduled maintenance was delayed, are unlikely to understand that the sums they are paying are part of the cost of the war. Resources can also be commandeered, that is taken directly from their owners without full compensation. Any type of resource may be commandeered -land for building military facilities, mines that produce raw materials necessary for producing arms, even patents for chemical processes important to the war effort. In practice the draft has been the most important form of commandeering, indeed, the most important non-financial means of acquiring resources. The Spanish-American, Philippine-American, and Persian Gulf wars were fought with volunteer armed forces, but in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and Vietnam War soldiers were drafted.
The draft can be compared to a tax. The individual who is drafted pays the tax which is the difference between what the draftee would earn if he or she chose to serve in an all-volunteer army and what he or she actually receives in a draft army. The idea of a draft as a tax appeals to economists because it forces one to think about the opportunity cost of the resources used in a war, but the concept seems alien to the average citizen. If the opportunity cost of a soldier is the same whether he or she is drafted or induced to serve through high wages and benefits, why do governments resort to the draft? One reason is that the draft hides the cost of the war. We tend to think of the cost of the war simply as the tax bills we pay -income taxes, gas taxes, property taxes, and so on -and not the more exotic taxes conceived by economists.
One of the best ways of understanding the economics of the draft during the twentieth century is to consider the draft used in the Revolutionary War and in the North during the Civil War when draftees were allowed to hire substitutes to fight in their place. One of the most famous examples is Grover Cleveland who served as President in 1885-9 and 1893-7. Cleveland was drafted in the Civil War, but although only twenty-six, he was already a successful lawyer and chose to hire a replacement. Indeed, this was not difficult, aside
The draft and other veiled means of financing wars 2. The draft and the supply and demand for soldiers Figure 
2
The draft lowers the nominal (budgetary) cost of the war. Each soldier is paid only AD. But each soldier in the draft army is in fact paying a tax, DI, which is the difference between the amount that the soldier would be paid in an all-volunteer armed force, AI, and what they are paid as draftees, AD. To the public the military labor budget looks to be ADFC, but properly measured it is AIJC.  26
The economics of war from the cost involved, because a well-functioning market for substitutes evolved during the Civil War. For an economist concerned about efficiency the system of allowing draftees to hire substitutes seems eminently sensible. The draftee pays the tax directly to the substitute.
If the draftee has a high income because he or she is highly skilled -Grover Cleveland is an example -the economy is more efficient than it would be if the draftee was forced to serve. But one can, of course, think of a different kind of example: the prodigal son of a rich landowner. Why should the prodigal son avoid the fight just because he can draw on the resources of a wealthy father? Or as the saying went in the Civil War, why should it be a "rich man's war and a poor man's fight"?
In 1917 after the declaration of war, the United States passed the Selective Service Act, creating a very different sort of draft to raise the huge army needed for World War I. The use of enlistment bounties to attract volunteers and the hiring of substitutes were explicitly prohibited. The mistakes of the Civil War were not going to be repeated.
The crucial decision for the United States, as indeed for any nation at war, regards how much of its resources to devote to the war effort.
Our first reaction is to say that we need to devote as much as necessary to win. But that idea seldom provides a guide for practice. Estimates of how much is needed will differ, and absolute commitment to victory is a seldom realized ideal. Typically, a political group favoring vigorous prosecution of the war will have to contend with other groups that favor compromise or even the admission of defeat. The government's plan for mobilization then will be to allocate enough resources to the war effort to move the country in the direction of victory, but not so many resources that political support for the war erodes. Economists like to describe the tradeoff between war goods and private sector goods, the tradeoff between "guns and butter," with a production possibilities curve such as the one shown in Figure 
2
One value of this analysis is that it shows how macroeconomic conditions affect the tradeoff between guns and butter. If the economy is at less than full employment, as represented by point D, then 28
The economics of war mobilization can take place relatively easily. The economy can move toward the production possibilities curve as shown by the vertical arrow above D, increasing production of guns without reducing production of butter. The most famous case was the United States on the eve of World War II when it could (to some extent) increase production of guns without reducing production of butter simply because there were still unemployed resources resulting from the Great Depression. Indeed, if the economy is at less than full employment when the war begins, the fiscal and monetary stimulus from government spending is likely to push the economy toward the production possibilities curve. The experience in World War II, and in several other cases, of a wartime boom gave rise to the idea of "wartime prosperity," the idea that war is good for the economy. We will explore this idea in more detail as we discuss the histories of individual wars. Given that a decision has been reached about the total amount of resources to be devoted to the war effort, how much will be in the form of labor and how much in the form of capital? The United States has always been a country with a high ratio of wages to the cost of capital compared with other countries, and so, following good economic principles, the United States has always used a relatively high ratio of capital to labor: more cannons, tanks, ships, and airplanes per soldier than in nations with lower wages and higher costs of capital. A large manufacturing sector with the capacity to turn out large amounts of capital for war is likely to have, and in the American case has had, the ability to innovate. Not only have Americans gone to war heavily armed, but they have been able to refine existing weapons and develop new ones, on more than one occasion even as the war has progressed. To be sure, politics has worked to reinforce economics. A democratically elected government is not likely to survive for long if it is not minimizing casualties and magnifying the enemy's casualties with massive firepower. Capital intensity, in short, constitutes an important component of the "American Way of War."
In a market economy prices and profits are the incentives that produce the reallocation of resources to the war sector, that move the economy along the production possibilities curve away from B and toward A. As the order books of munitions makers fill with profitable contracts they are able to bid resources away from firms producing for civilian markets. For a variety of reasons, however, governments may intervene to prevent market mechanisms from working and by substituting alternative mechanisms. This was particularly noticeable in World War I and World War II when elaborate systems of price controls and rationing were introduced.
Why did the United States, a traditionally free market economy, turn to government controls during some of its wars? Several factors were at work. First of all, ideology played a role. World War I, World War II, and the Korean War were fought under presidents who were deeply skeptical about the efficiency and fairness of free markets. The prominence of the military in wartime worked in the same direction. The military is organized in a hierarchical fashion. When the general commands, soldiers obey. It is understandable that when the military comes to the fore, and when military purchasers become one of the leading purchasers in the economy, they would want the private sector to be organized in the same fashion.
Second, sometimes it was hoped that patriotism could substitute for the financial incentives of the marketplace. It was hoped, for example, that workers could be persuaded to work longer and harder for the good of the nation, rather than simply for the reward of higher wages.
A further reason may have been that it was easier, or at least appeared to be easier, to manage the economy centrally, because the ultimate goals of economic activity were clearer in wartime. One of the great strengths of the market system is that it reveals consumer preferences. If people lose interest in movies about cowboys and become more interested in movies about hardboiled detectives, the box office receipts will soon reveal the change in preferences, and induce the appropriate change in output. When the nation is at war, especially when it is involved in the life and death struggle of a world war, consumer preferences are already known. The overarching goal is to win the war and the economic problem is how to allocate resources in the most efficient way to achieve that end. In wartime, moreover, time is of the essence. In peacetime we can afford the luxury of allowing people to delay the performance of a task while we negotiate and cajole them into performing it. In wartime we cannot afford to wait; people must be compelled by government to act immediately. The famous British economist Lionel Robbins explored this argument in The Economic Problem in Peace and War, a book based on his experiences in Britain in World War II 
(Robbins 1947, 85)
Finally, centralized controls may be another way of hiding the cost of the war. One way for the government to deprive a citizen of his or The economics of war her resources is to raise taxes. Then, as Adam Smith pointed out, the cost of the war will be obvious. Consider a different story. The amount of good X that a consumer is allowed to purchase is strictly rationed. This allows the government to purchase a portion of the amount produced of X at a lower controlled price. Will the consumer recognize that it is the government's prosecution of the war that has limited purchases of X? Or will they blame the "shortage" of X on profiteers or, best of all, on the enemy?
Economics also comes into play when we move from the amount of war goods produced to the more specific question of the kinds of munitions. One example is the choice between airpower and ground power. Relying on air power makes sense for a nation, such as the United States, that is capital rich, namely where the cost of capital is low relative to the cost of labor. But what about the choice between tactical bombing (bombing in support of ground forces) and strategic bombing (bombing aimed at crippling the enemy's economy)? This choice will depend upon military considerations, but also on the assessment of the economic effects of the bombing and the connection between the economic effects and the military capacity of the enemy. Our production possibilities curve is useful in analyzing some of the effects of strategic bombing. A campaign aimed simply at the mass destruction of the enemy can be thought of as an attempt to shift the enemy's production possibilities curve in Figure 
2
The most important costs of war from the point of view of the American people were the deaths and non-mortal wounds suffered by the fighters, their fellow citizens. Appendix 2 shows deathsdistinguishing between those in combat and those that occurred while the individual was in the armed forces, but for other reasons such as accident and disease. The table also shows non-mortal wounds by war. Economists have tried to place monetary values on these losses. We could, for example, think of an individual killed in
The costs of wars battle as an amount of human capital, the discounted value of future earnings, and add that value to other costs. And in our calculations of the cost of wars we will include an estimate of veterans' benefits which includes monetary compensation to veterans for wounds suffered and compensation paid to the families of veterans who died. Most people, however, view the loss of life and the grieving of families who have suffered the loss of loved ones in a different light -one that reflects a wide range of philosophical, religious, and political values -from the loss of civilian output when resources are devoted to the production of war goods. As much as we economists might want to reduce all of the costs of war to a single dollar value. It makes more sense to view loss of life and limb, on the one hand, and economic costs, on the other, as distinct and at times incommensurate costs of war. 5  The economic cost of war may be defined as what the resources employed in the war could have produced had they been employed for alternative purposes. The list of alternatives is endless; it is the whole range of goods that could have been produced by the civilian economy (bridges, coffee cups, productions of Macbeth, medical research, butter, and so on) and other goods that could have been produced by the government (lighthouses, highways, medical research, and so on). Perhaps the most important distinction here is between investment goods and consumption goods. To the extent that wars employed resources that would have produced investment goods, then our current standard of living has been affected by past wars. If research in medicine or agriculture was slowed, if plans to build new dams and bridges were shelved, if workers went into the army rather than to technical school, then we are the worse for it. On the other hand, if it was mainly consumption that was reduced then our current standard of living may be much the same as if no war was fought. This 5 Even when we adopt the economic approach there are philosophical choices that must be addressed. Is the goal of economic life to maximize GDP, in which case we would include in the cost calculation the value of all of the output that would have been produced by the fallen soldier; or is the goal to maximize per capita income, in which case we would include only the decrease in the income of the survivors -the externalities that would have been generated by the fallen soldier? This issue is further complicated by the possibility of immigration.
If we focus on the income of the survivors, how do we measure the loss of life in the war when the income of the survivors can be restored by admitting an immigrant with the skills of the fallen soldier?
The economics of war was part of what the Nazi leaders Hermann Goering and Joseph Goebbels were getting at in the 1930s when they said that Germany should have guns instead of butter 
(Birchall 1936, 1)
The opposite problem arises when the war-related spending creates capital that is valuable in peacetime. The synthetic rubber plants created in World War II are a good example. Although the rubber they produced contributed to the war effort, the plants were mainly employed after the war to produce synthetic rubber for the civilian market. In a case like this we may want to deduct the value of the flow of postwar civilian products from the wartime cost of the capital to get at the true cost of the war. In practice, however, such a calculation is hard. For a variety of reasons plants that were sold to the private sector were sold at a price below the discounted value of future profits. One reason was that the private firm that had been operating a plant during the war had an inside track when it came to purchasing the plant. Even when an auction was held, there were few outside bidders.
Human capital may also be created in wartime. A worker may learn new skills that make him or her more productive after the war. For many farm workers, for example, work in war factories in World War I and World War II provided skills that made it possible to continue in factory work after the war. To be sure, many agricultural workers would have made the transition from farm to factory even if the nation had remained at peace. But the high demand for industrial labor during the war may have tipped the balance in favor of making the transition. Similarly, moving can be an investment. Many American laborers made the trek to California during the depressed 1930s, but the ease of finding a job in California during World War II persuaded many others that the 1940s was the right time to make a move they had long contemplated. The cost of moving to do war work should be counted as part of the cost of a war, a cost not included in conventional estimates. But omitting this cost is probably not a major problem because a worker typically recaptured some of those expenses in the form of higher wages or more enjoyable living conditions after the war.
A major issue encountered in any attempt to measure the costs of war, but especially the costs of "minor" wars, is whether we should
The costs of wars include all the costs of the military, or only the additional costs produced by the decision to go to war. It is the classic economic problem of how to allocate fixed costs. There is no single "right way" to make the calculation. As is often the case in economics, the decision about how to allocate the fixed costs of the military spending depends on the question we are asking. Looking at the marginal cost of the war -ignoring the fixed costs of the military establishment altogether -may lead to sensible conclusions about whether to engage in a particular war, given that past spending is a sunk cost. On the other hand, looking at only marginal costs would produce bad decisions about whether maintaining large armies and navies ready to engage in wars makes sense. To answer the latter question looking at the average cost of wars is more useful. Setting the share of fixed costs at zero and computing only the marginal costs of wars, in other words, makes imperial war-making appear less costly than it is. All this is clearer if we take a less politically charged example: the fire department. The marginal cost of fighting a particular fire given the expenditures already incurred to buy equipment, build firehouses, employ firefighters, etc. is normally small. This small marginal cost is the right one to look at if the question is: Does it pay to put out the fire on Mulberry Street in Springfield? However, if we add up the marginal costs of fighting the ten fires that occur annually in Springfield, we will greatly underestimate the annual cost of maintaining the fire department. To address the question of whether Springfield needs a fire department we are better served by looking at the average cost of maintaining the fire department.
When we turn to the interest on the government debt, which in some ways is analogous to veterans' benefits, there is more agreement among economists that to count both the expenditures on the war itself and the interest and principal payments made subsequently is double counting. Again, it helps to consider a less emotionally charged example. When we pay $300,000 for a home, we say that is the cost whether we reduce our bank account by $300,000 or take out a mortgage at 8 percent interest for thirty years. True, the total payments are different. If we pay cash, we write a check for $300,000; if we take out a thirty-year mortgage at 8 percent, we will write checks that total about $790,000. But if we claimed that we were living in a $790,000 home because that was the sum of all the interest and principal payments we would rightly be accused of exaggerating.
The economics of war
The same is true of civilian government spending. We say that a program to finance medical research is the $50 billion we pay now; we do not count future interest payments as part of the cost. To do so would mislead someone who assumed that the normal conventions were being followed.
There is an extreme case worth considering. In Britain it was once a common practice to finance government deficits by issuing consols, or perpetuities, as they were sometimes known. The principal of a consol need never be repaid: a consol promised a fixed amount of interest each year forever. If a war or other government program was financed by issuing consols, and the cost of the program was measured by adding all future interest payments, the conclusion would be that the cost was infinite. After the war taxes must be raised to pay for the interest on debt. Therefore, some citizens have more income and others have less, but leaving aside the distorting effect of the taxes, the size of the economy is not affected. Evidently, it would be misleading when measuring the costs of wars to include interest payments because it means adopting an accounting practice different from the one normally used in measuring costs in the private sector or the civilian government.
As we explore the costs of war in the twentieth century we will need to compare the costs over time. The cost of the Spanish-American War (before adding veterans' benefits) was about $274 million (see Appendix 3). But we want to know how much that is in today's money. Prices and wages have changed a great deal since 1898, so it will not do to simply compare the number of dollars spent on the Spanish-American War with the amount spent on wars being fought today. We must, to use the economists' term, "inflate" the costs of the Spanish-American War to make them comparable to costs incurred today. As usual in economics, there is no single measuring rod that is always the right one to use. We use different measuring rods depending on the question we want to address. A price index is the most commonly used measuring rod. The consumer price index in 2010 was about twenty-seven times as high as it was in 1898 
(Officer and Williamson 2011)
The costs of wars of price indexes one could use. If the cost of the Spanish-American War was inflated using the GDP deflator the figure would be smaller, at $6.5 billion ($274 million Â 23.6). The GDP deflator is broader than the consumer price index; it includes, importantly, investment goods as well as consumption goods. It is probably a better deflator in terms of describing how much it would cost to outfit a similar force today.
One could also use an index of the costs of war goods (labor and munitions), although as far as I am aware there is no index currently available that extends back to the turn of the century. In the case of weapons, technological progress becomes important. The cost of modern weapons has risen greatly since the turn of the century. Rifles, artillery, machine guns, and battleships all cost more than did similar weapons in 1898. Inflating the amount spent on weapons by a price of weapons index that was not adjusted for quality would yield a much larger figure for the amount that would be needed today to equip the military as it was equipped in 1898. Modern weapons, however, are far more lethal than their turn-of-the-century counterparts. To equip an army today that was of equal lethality to the army of 1898, which could, for example, fire the same number of bullets per minute, might require a smaller sum than was spent in 1898. What really matters is the firepower of one army relative to its enemy. We might want to ask how much it would cost today to create an army that had the same edge over the Spanish military as did the US army and navy of 1898.
Wages are another commonly used inflator. The use of wages has a long and distinguished history. This is how Adam Smith justified using wages to compare values at different points in time:
Equal quantities of labour, at all times and places may be said to be of equal value to the labourer. In his ordinary state of health, strength and spirits; in the ordinary degree of his skill and dexterity, he must always lay down the same portion of his ease, his liberty, and his happiness. The price which he pays must always be the same, whatever the quantity of goods he receives in return for it . . . Labour alone, therefore, is alone the ultimate and real standard by which the value of all commodities can at all times and places be estimated and compared. 
(Smith 1976
(Smith [1776]]
In 2010 the wages of unskilled labor were about 124 times higher than they were in 1898 
(Officer and Williamson 2011)
The economics of war inflator, the cost of the Spanish-American War would be $34.0 billion ($274 million Â 124.01). This computation answers a somewhat different question than the previous computations: how much would it cost today to acquire the same amount of labor that was employed in the war in 1898, both as actual combatants and as civilian workers producing goods for the military? GDP is still another, and very different, inflator often used to compare wars. GDP in 2010 was about 810 times what it was in 1898 (Johnston and 
Williamson 2010)
Perhaps one of the most important costs of wars is one of the least visible: the moral cost. Few wars are fought according to rules laid down by philosophers. When people are desperate for victory, savagery often wins out. Typically, a few courageous voices oppose attacks on civilians during war, but opposition is often muted by the overwhelming desire for victory and the fear of reprisals from supporters of the war. In retrospect many people find the means adopted to fight a war troubling. Indeed, the moral costs of the war may grow over time, even as other costs, such as the cost of caring for veterans, diminish. In retrospect, for example, many Americans are troubled when they learn about the savage tactics used against civilians during the Philippine-American War that will be described below. It is natural, and to some degree justified, to be cynical about such feelings. There was considerable opposition to America's use of savage tactics in the Philippine-American War, even as the war was being fought, but support was widespread. Theodore Roosevelt, who after the assassination of McKinley was President while much of the war was being fought, went on to be elected President in his own right, and to win the Nobel Peace Prize (although for his role in ending the Russo-Japanese War -not for his role in the Philippine-American War). In retrospect, to take another example, many Americans are troubled by the use of strategic bombing during World War II. The use of firebombing against Hamburg, Dresden, and Tokyo, and the use of atomic bombs
The costs of wars against Hiroshima and Nagasaki, which will also be described below, are viewed today by many Americans, including some of our best young historians, as among the most shameful episodes in American history. But at the time the goal of minimizing the costs of victory created irresistible pressure for attacks on civilians.
The tendency for sympathy for others to disappear in wartime is, of course, nothing new and nothing uniquely American. As Adam Smith pointed out 250 years ago our sympathy for others declines as our social distance from them increases. In wartime we are concerned mainly with how our fellow citizens feel about our behavior, and so opposition to war or to the more savage methods of waging war is likely to be of little significance. This is how he put it in The Theory of Moral Sentiments 
(Smith 1976
(Smith [1759]]
In the most unjust war, however, it is commonly the sovereign or the rulers only who are guilty. The subjects are almost always perfectly innocent. Whenever it suits the conveniency of a public enemy, however, the goods of the peaceable citizens are seized both at land and at sea; their lands are laid waste, their houses are burnt, and they themselves, if they presume to make any resistance, are murdered or led into captivity; and all this in the most perfect conformity to what are called the laws of nations. 6   Smith would have recognized American behavior in World War II. Sympathy for the plight of German and Japanese civilians (who were often vilified in American propaganda), although voiced by a few individuals, was generally missing. Only after the war, as the fears and passions generated by the war faded, and as America developed productive economic and diplomatic relations with Germany and 6 Smith (1976 [1759], part III, chapter 1) also noted that our lack of sympathy for our enemies is likely to produce a breakdown in the niceties of international affairs:
When two nations are at variance, the citizen of each pays little regard to the sentiments which foreign nations may entertain concerning his conduct. His whole ambition is to obtain the approbation of his own fellow-citizens; and as they are all animated by the same hostile passions which animate himself, he can never please them so much as by enraging and offending their enemies . . . In war and negotiation, therefore, the laws of justice are very seldom observed. Truth and fair dealing are almost totally disregarded. Treaties are violated; and the violation, if some advantage is gained by it, sheds scarce any dishonour upon the violator. The ambassador who dupes the minister of a foreign nation, is admired and applauded.
The economics of war Japan, did large numbers of Americans come to be disturbed by the attacks on civilians carried out during the war. Evidently, it is easier to be upset about actions taken in the past, when all that is called for in response is moral indignation, than to oppose attacks on civilians when war is ongoing and the risks of defeat are real. Nevertheless, even if we are entitled to discount expressions of sympathy and moral indignation that come long after the fact, we must still count the shame produced when war crimes are finally uncovered, as one of the important, if hidden, costs of war.
Wars produce many long-term changes in the economy. The tax system is almost always changed during a war, and these changes persist. The federal alcohol and tobacco taxes levied during the Civil War are still with us, as is the federal inheritance tax imposed during the Spanish-American War. Partly, the long-term effects on the tax system are a reflection of the long-term burdens of interest payments and veterans' benefits that follow wars. Wars have also left their marks on the monetary system. The Federal Reserve's reliance on open market operations was a result of World War I; the collapse of the international gold standard during the Depression and World War II led to the Bretton Woods system adopted after the war. One of the most frequently cited, and most frequently debated, effects of wars is on the status of women and minority workers. The increased demand for labor produced by wartime mobilizations and the decrease in the supply of male workers resulting from expansion of the armed forces, and (in some cases) the decreased supply of immigrant labor, leads to increases in the employment of women and minorities. The question is to what extent these temporary changes become permanent changes. Do they open opportunities in the postwar economy by changing the attitudes of employers, coworkers, and the women and minority workers themselves? Or does the status quo reassert itself after the war is over?
As the last point suggests, wars are often alleged to produce economic benefits as well as costs. Better access to job markets for women, the elderly, and minorities may increase productivity. Defense of the principle of free trade may increase access to world markets. Suppression of Communist revolutions may protect American property. But in each case the benefits are hard to measure. The non-economic benefits of wars, such as protection of human rights, moreover, lie along a dimension different from the economist's usual profit and loss calculations. In the end, when it comes to putting numbers to wars, we will stick, as economic historians usually do, to measuring mainly the fiscal costs of wars. We will address the other economic costs and benefits, but acknowledge our limited ability to measure them.
One of the most important economic legacies of wars was in the realm of economic ideas. The opinions of economists and economic policymakers are strongly influenced by their past experiences: by booms and depressions, inflations and deflations, stock market bubbles and busts, and so on, that occurred when they were forming their basic ideas. With the exception of the Great Depression, no experience has shaped economic opinion as much as war. World War II, as we will see, had an enormous impact on the way economists see the world. Many economists were attracted to the case for spending on public works to cure unemployment in a depression laid out by John Maynard Keynes in the General Theory 
(1936)
(Galbraith 1952, 81)
Veterans' benefits are the expenditures paid directly to men and women who have served in the military, or paid for services provided to them, after their service has ended. Veterans' benefits were an 40
The economics of war important part of the fiscal cost of every war in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, and constituted the largest component of the costs of the smaller wars, except Korea. The vexing problem for economic historians is how to treat veterans' benefits when computing the "opportunity costs" of wars. Almost no one doubts that payments made to the dependants of military personnel killed while in service, or payments made to surviving veterans for medical care for disabilities incurred while in the service, or to compensate veterans for earnings lost after the war as a result of their war-related disabilities, are true opportunity costs of war. Clearly the output of the economy as a whole is lower if a veteran was killed or his or her productivity was reduced by injuries -including, we have finally recognized, psychological injuries. Measures to provide for the care of maimed and sick soldiers and sailors in England date from the first Elizabeth's reign, and were widely adopted in colonial America 
(Glasson and Kinley 1918, 9-18)
(Clayton 1972, 375-95)
The economics of veterans' benefits want to include veterans' benefits as a part of the economic cost of war. Thus we can treat veterans' benefits as analogous, to some extent, to social security benefits, an item that affects the federal budget and through it taxes and other financial variables, but does not represent a using up of GDP in the same sense as current military expenditures.
But it is also important to recognize that veterans have come to anticipate post-service benefits. Benefits, from this point of view, are a form of deferred pay, a bonus for dedicated service. If that bonus had not been offered, the veteran might not have served, or if forced to serve by a draft, might not have served with the same commitment. Without the implicit or explicit promise of veterans' benefits, additional resources would have been needed during the war to fight with the same effectiveness, or the war might not have gone as well as it did, and the postwar product of the economy might have been lower. For that reason, I have followed the practice of including all veterans' benefits as true opportunity costs of war, although also showing them separately so that someone who views the matter differently can see the costs net of veterans' benefits. This focus on injuries and losses, and wages, I should note, ignores the undeniable fact that some veterans acquired important skills, including leadership skills, that increased their productivity in the peacetime economy. In those cases veterans' benefits can be regarded as similar to the subsidies that firms sometimes pay workers for attending school and learning new skills.
Since veterans' benefits are paid over a long period of time we are faced with the problem of how to take the element of time into account. The most natural approach for an economist, and the one usually followed, is to discount veterans' benefits back to the period of the war itself. In effect, this approach asks the following question: suppose the nation was to purchase a bond, the interest from which would have paid the future veterans' benefits, how large would that bond have to be? But, of course, veterans' benefits are never funded in this way. They are, to use the modern jargon, an unfunded liability, another hidden cost of war.
America's twentieth-century wars were the offspring of the wars that it fought in the nineteenth century and, on occasion, of wars that it fought during the colonial era. Military technology, of course,
The economics of war changed a great deal, but the similarities in the political and economic context are striking. In some cases, similarities reflected continuity in underlying political or economic institutions: similar institutions faced with similar challenges produced similar results. In other cases, the similarities between the earlier wars and the wars of the twentieth century reflect the lessons of history -this is what we did last time, so this is what we should do this time -and in some cases the similarities simply reflect the personalities involved: the same generals and the same politicians met the challenges of a new war in the same way they had met the challenges of an earlier war. Space prevents us from considering these similarities in detail, but we can identify the major continuities in the way America fought its wars. Throughout the colonial era and most of the nineteenth century the United States fought wars to drive Native Americans from land that white Americans wanted as white America expanded westward, and to subdue or destroy the Native Americans who remained. The tactics were often brutal. The Philippine-American

The brutal tactics employed against Native Americans and against the native populations of the Philippines were partly the product of racism. Many Americans felt little sympathy for peoples whom they considered different and inferior. Cruelty, however, also was demanded by the economics of war. During the colonial era and the nineteenth century American settlers occupied small homesteads spread over thousands of miles. Protecting all of them from surprise attacks by concentrated forces of Native Americans was prohibitively expensive. It was possible to assemble small armies of volunteers in response to particularly violent attacks or increases in the level of attacks, but how could Native Americans be brought to battle? What was to prevent them from melting into the forest when faced with a concentrated force, only to return later for guerilla attacks? The answer was the punitive campaign. By burning the crops of Native Americans, by destroying their villages, and by killing men, women and children, white armies could intimidate Native Americans, and perhaps bring them to battle where superior numbers and firepower would deliver victory. These were the tactics, for example, that brought success to General "Mad Anthony" Wayne in his campaign against Native Americans in Ohio, where in August 1794 he won a decisive battle against a confederacy of Native American tribes at the Battle of Fallen Timbers.
But cruelty toward civilians, we should remember, is a commonplace of war, and not confined to wars against people of other races or people who employ inferior military technologies. Americans have used brutal tactics against white as well as Native American populations when the cost of alternatives was prohibitive. When Union General William Tecumseh Sherman planned his "march to the sea" during the Civil War, he did not tell his superior, General Ulysses Grant, that he would win the "hearts and minds" of the people of Georgia and persuade them to give up slavery and rejoin the Union; he told Grant that he would "make Georgia howl." The logic was unavoidable. Deep within the Confederacy, faced with an enemy who could retreat for hundreds of miles or turn to guerilla warfare, Sherman needed some way to intimidate the South or bring Southern armies to battle. In World War II, faced with distant well-entrenched enemies the United States turned to aerial bombardments of civilian targets, including nuclear attacks. The purpose was much the same.
Mexico, unlike Native American tribes, could field a Europeanstyle army with units of field artillery. But Mexico was simply too small and too poor to defeat a determined United States. The Mexican War (1846-8) ended with Mexico ceding large areas in the Southwest, including California. The Mexican War was in many respects similar to the Spanish-American War that would follow fifty 44
The economics of war years later. In both cases the United States relied on an army of volunteers to win a quick and decisive victory over a second-tier power. And in both cases the United States won significant colonial concessions. Hunger for land, it is true, was advertised more nakedly in the Mexican War than in the Spanish-American War. President James K. Polk made no secret of his goal of wresting California from the Mexicans. The Spanish-American War, as we will see below, was pushed in part by public concerns about Spanish atrocities committed in the course of suppressing the Cuban independence movement. But the partisans of imperialist expansion, such as Theodore Roosevelt and Henry Cabot Lodge, had their hand in the war as well. Both wars, moreover, spawned opposition by American foes of imperialism. Ulysses Grant, who fought in the Mexican War, regarded it "as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation" 
(Grant 1885, 53)
During the colonial period and the nineteenth century the United States also fought wars against major powers. The French and Indian War was the American branch of the Seven Years War, in many ways a world war. The War of 1812 was fought against Britain, the leading military power of the age. The British blockade of the European continent during the Napoleonic Wars, and the resulting interference with what America saw as its right as a neutral to trade wherever it was profitable, was a major cause. The rallying cry was "Free trade and sailors' rights." The same issue would help propel the United States into World War I. Germany's submarine blockade of Britain, in part a response to the latter's surface blockade of the continent with conventional ships, brought Germany into direct and violent conflict with the United States.
America was a rich nation by world standards in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Wages were relatively high and interest rates low. Heavy reliance on capital made economic sense when America went to war. Firepower, historian David Hacket Fischer tells us, was one of the basic principles of George Washington's army. At the First Battle of Trenton the ratio of guns to soldiers in Washington's army was twice that of the Hessian army it faced 
(Fischer 2004, 374)
The wars of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries raised many of the same financial problems that were encountered in the twentieth century. The Revolutionary War was largely financed with "Continental dollars" and the Civil War was financed in the North, initially, with greenbacks and in the South, throughout the war, with Confederate dollars. "Financed by printing money" was more than an informative analogy; it was the literal truth. Governments also relied on increased taxes and borrowing to finance wars. During the Civil War the United States introduced a personal income tax and a corporate income tax along with "sin taxes" on alcohol and tobacco. The United States also borrowed large amounts of money during the Civil War, turning as it did so to the investment banker Jay Cooke, who marketed war bonds to the middle class. When World War I began the Secretary of the Treasury turned, naturally, to the history of the Civil War for lessons about war finance.
The problem of whether to prosecute a war to victory or negotiate a compromise was felt most strongly during the Civil War. With casualties mounting Lincoln was urged repeatedly to negotiate a settlement with the South. But despite some gestures, in the end Lincoln stuck to the policy of unconditional surrender. This policy, undoubtedly, prolonged the Civil War and cost many lives. Once defeat was on the horizon the South might well have agreed to many Northern demands in exchange for an end to the fighting. But the policy of unconditional surrender laid the basis for "reconstruction" of the South. The South was occupied and the slaves were freed. The Radical Republicans wanted to go much further. They wanted to break up the plantations and give the former slaves the land -forty acres and a mule. They wanted, moreover, to give the former slaves the vote: a democratic society would replace rule by the "slaveocracy." Lincoln and Grant's policy of unconditional surrender had made such reforms possible. The costs of unconditional surrender, in other words, could be seen as an investment in a democratic future based on reconstruction.
The economics of war Of course, things did not go as far as the Radical Republicans had hoped. Land reform was blocked; the Ku Klux Klan, the product of unreconciled Confederate soldiers turning to guerrilla tactics, used terror to maintain white power; and the project of turning the South into a democratic society would have to wait until the second half of the twentieth century. Reconstruction, of course, had and continues to have a contentious reputation. For some, the failures of reconstruction were proof that Lincoln should have negotiated an end to the war. For others, the right conclusion to draw from the failures of reconstruction was that there was a missing ingredient: Lincoln's policy of charity toward the defeated South. Had Lincoln lived, the policy of unconditional surrender followed by "charity for all, and malice toward none" could have proved to be the right policy. In any event, America's conflicted views of unconditional surrender and reconstruction would play important roles in determining the response of the United States to the challenges posed by World War I and World War II.
| The Spanish-American War forcible "opening" of Japan are clear examples of American imperialism in the years before the Spanish-American War. Nevertheless, the war substantially increased America's commitment to controlling territories beyond its borders. The treaty of peace signed in December 1898 transferred Puerto Rico, Guam, and, in exchange for $20 million ($16 billion would have been the same share of GDP in 2008), the Philippines to the United States.

The origins of the war
Cuban independence had been on the American political agenda for several years prior to the outbreak of the war. In 1896 and 1897 sympathy for revolutionaries trying to win Cuba's independence from Spain rose to a fever pitch. In attempting to suppress the revolutionaries Spain had turned to General Valeriano Weyler. Weyler, who took command of Spanish forces in Cuba in February 1896, attempted to crush the rebellion by adopting harsh tactics including the use of concentration camps to separate the general population from the revolutionaries. Stories about Spanish atrocities in Cuba, some accurate, some exaggerated, filled the American press. The Democratic Party platform of 1896 asserted the party's support for the Monroe Doctrine, and declared that: "We extend our sympathy to the people of Cuba in their heroic struggle for liberty and independence." Similarly, the Republican platform, after asserting the party's respect for the right of European powers to maintain their colonial possessions, declared: "We watch with deep and abiding interest the heroic battles of the Cuban patriots against cruelty and oppression, and best hopes go out for the full success of their determined contest for liberty." It went on to argue that diplomatic actions were justified: "The government of Spain, having lost control of Cuba, and being unable to protect the property or lives of resident American citizens, or to comply with its Treaty obligations, we believe that the government of the United States should actively use its influence and good offices to restore peace and give independence to the Island" 
(Wooley and Peters 2008)
Years later the poet Carl Sandburg, who volunteered for service in the war, recalled how he felt at the time. I read about . . . the people of Cuba who wanted independence and a republic . . . I read about Go ´mez, Garcı ´a, the Maceos, with their scrabbling little armies fighting against Weyler. They became heroes to me. I tried to figure a way to get down there and join one of those armies . . . I was going along with millions of other Americans who were about ready for a war to throw the Spanish government out of Cuba and let the people of Cuba have their republic. If a war did come and men were called to fight it, I knew what I would do. (Quoted in 
Perez 1999, 356)
. Field Jr. (1978, 668)
As we will see in subsequent chapters, this event was not unique in the history of America's wars. A galvanizing event, a clear and understandable affront to America's honor, was a part of each march to war. Sometimes, the events were just as they seemed at the time; sometimes subsequent investigation would show that the interpretation of the event that dominated the headlines at the time was in error.
But what of economic motives? Was the war fought, for example, to open markets for American businesses? As is often the case, it is difficult to arrive at firm conclusions because lines of influence are difficult to trace. We can be fairly certain, however, that in general the American business community was opposed to the war at the end of 1897 and in the opening months of 1898, despite the rise of sympathy in the United States for the Cuban revolutionaries. The classic analysis is by Julius 
Pratt (1934)
The origins of the war quotations. 2 The business press, Pratt found, generally denied that the economy as a whole would benefit from a war. The most likely result would be higher taxes and inflation. As Jonathan 
Kirshner (2007, 44-51)
Opposition to the war follows to some degree directly from the balance sheet of financial institutions. Banks and other financial intermediaries, typically, are net monetary creditors: their assets fixed in dollars (reserves, loans, bonds, and so on) exceed their liabilities fixed in dollars (deposits); they will lose from an unanticipated inflation. 3 This is not true of all businesses. Farmers, for example, are usually net monetary debtors. Their assets (land, equipment, and livestock) are not fixed in dollars and their real value can remain constant or rise in the face of inflation, while their liabilities (mortgages) are fixed in dollars and their real value will decline in the face of inflation. 4  Pratt and Kirshner also mentioned some movements in the stock market to support their readings of the financial press. We can follow 2

What about special interests that may have profited from a war? Perhaps the war was not the result of general support from the business community, or the financial community, but rather the result of pressure from individual businesses or sub-sectors that stood to The origins of the war profit from an American victory in Cuba. The literature on the war mentions several special interests that pushed for the war, although it is impossible to estimate precisely how much influence each exerted on the decision to go to war.
One special interest can be divined in Carl Sandburg's recollections: he was inspired by the Cuban revolutionaries when he read about their exploits. The newspapers of the day dwelled on conditions in Cuba. In particular the New York press barons William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer, who were notorious for their "yellow journalism," published sensational stories about the atrocities committed by Spain in Cuba. These stories, based on the work of famous reporters such as William Harding Davis and Stephen Crane, and sketches by famous artists such as Frederick Remington, captured the imagination of the American people. Other newspapers were more circumspect

The first answer is "war". War not only creates a supply of news but a demand for it. So deep rooted is the fascination in a war and all things appertaining to that . . . a paper has only to be able to put up on its placard "A Great Battle" for its sales to go up. 
(Ferguson 2004, 213)
(Pratt 1934, 175-7)
There were also interests that stood to lose from a successful American intervention. Before Congress adopted the declaration of war against Spain it insisted on the so-called "Teller Resolution," according to which the United States disavowed any intention of exercising "sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control" over Cuba. The resolution was sponsored by Senator Henry Teller, a Republican of Colorado. Teller's resolution expressed the strong anti-imperialist sentiment in Congress, but it also expressed, as historian Walter LaFeber

In the end the decision for war was up to President McKinley. And his understanding of and response to the pressures we have outlined above must to some degree remain beyond the reach of the historian, partly because McKinley did not leave voluminous and revealing records, and partly because the interior process by which motives and fears become policy is never fully observed even by the decisionmakers themselves.

Shortly after the outbreak of the war Congress unanimously appropriated $50 million. The equivalent today, as a percentage of GDP, would be about $40 billion. On June 13 Congress passed the War Revenue Act that raised taxes and authorized the issue of debt to finance the war. 
Davis Rich Dewey (1931, 465-6)
Congress still had to be very careful about who got stuck with the bill. At the time, the tariff was the source of about one-half of federal revenues, so raising the tariff had to be considered. But Congress had passed the controversial Dingley tariff in July of 1897 -widely denounced by Democrats as a punishing increase in protection -and neither the President nor the Congress was prepared to revisit the issue. Instead, internal taxes were imposed or increased on a long list of items. Walter LaFeber 
(1993,
145)

Dewey (1931, 466)
There was a small exception to the rule that the tariff could not be touched: the levying of a small tax on imported tea. This duty may have been imposed partly to finance the Board of Tea Experts, which was established on March 2, 1898, to test the quality of imported tea. In any case, the tax on tea like the taxes on chewing gum and pool halls could be avoided, if one had the will power.
There were also taxes that reflected progressive-populist concerns. The taxes on banks and brokers, mentioned above, fall into this category as do the taxes levied on sugar refining and petroleum refining. For many contemporary critics of big business the sugar trust and Standard Oil were the iconic examples of the cartels exploiting the public. Taxing them would be popular. Congress may have been counting on the idea that the public believes that taxes stay where they are placed. A tax on oil pipelines might increase the price of kerosene, but the newspaper reading public might assume that the tax was simply reducing the profits of the oil companies, leaving kerosene prices unchanged: John D. Rockefeller would pay the tax, not John Doe. If the price of kerosene did rise the public might miss the connection between the higher prices they were paying for kerosene and the war.
Another progressive-populist measure was the inheritance tax, a revival of a source of finance used during the Civil War. It was graduated with respect to both the relationship with the deceased and the size of the estate. The surviving husband or wife was not taxed. Lineal descendants and ancestors, and siblings, however, were taxed at a rate of 0.75 percent on their interest in estates ranging from $10,000 to $25,000. This rate increased, according to the size of the estate, up to 2.25 percent for interests in estates 58
The Spanish-American War over $1 million. The rates were higher for descendants of brothers and sisters; higher still for aunts, uncles, and their descendants; and highest for persons with a low degree of consanguinity or "strangers in blood." For the last category, the rate reached a maximum of 15 percent for interests in estates valued over $1 million. If we use the consumer price index as our inflator, $10,000 would be about $250,000 in today's money and $1 million about $25 million. If we used, say, personal income the amounts would be much larger. These were, in short, large estates, and the revenues generated were small. Table

The revenues from the wartime tax levies were somewhat less than expected. Congress had anticipated about $140 million in the first year and the take was actually about $100 million. This rose to about $125 million in the second year, still below initial hopes 
(Shultz and Caine 1937, 452)
That the Congress did as well as it did in raising taxes may have been partly a matter of timing. The tax bill was passed about fifty days after the declaration of war, when patriotic enthusiasm ran high. Had the administration found it necessary to come back later for higher taxes, it is far from clear that the public or the Congress would have been receptive. There is perhaps a hundred-day rule here: Congress must pass a tax increase in the first hundred days following a declaration of war if it expects to capitalize on enthusiasm for the war to overcome the public's normal reluctance to support higher taxes. It was possible, moreover, to rely on sin taxes and taxes on the targets of progressive-populist ire because the resources employed in the war represented only a small fraction of the total economy, 1.29 percent of average GDP for 1898 and 1899. The much larger wars to follow could not be financed in the same way. 
The Spanish-American War
Although Congress did finance the major part of the war with increased taxes, it also covered about a fifth of the cost, $48 million, by issuing debt. The government, however, borrowed more: $200 million. This was through 3 percent bonds redeemable in ten years (the government could pay the principal in ten years if it chose) and payable in twenty years (the government must pay the principal in twenty years). Bond denominations were low, presumably to attract wide support from the general public. And the bonds were popular. Subscriptions (offers to purchase) amounted to $1,400 million, seven times the amount put on sale. The enthusiasm for the bond issue, 
Shultz and Caine (1937, 454)
The latter consideration arose from the nature of the national banks. These banks could issue hand-to-hand notes, that is paper money, provided that they were backed up by government bonds. Bonds that bore the "circulation privilege" sold at a premium, so part of the war was financed by money creation, although it is difficult to say exactly what proportion. In 1898 New England municipal bonds were yielding about 3.35 percent, while US government bonds were yielding about 2.50 percent 
(Carter et al. 2006, series Cj1192 and Cj1194)
Borrowing more than proved necessary for the immediate prosecution of the war was prudent, but created technical problems. 9 Tax considerations, important today, were probably not very important at the time since there were no federal income tax. 10 Another way to think of this calculation is the following. The annual interest costs would be the same whether 100 percent of the gap between spending and taxes was financed by borrowing at 2.50 percent or 75 percent by borrowing at 3.35 percent and 25 percent by printing money.
The sale of the bonds raised Treasury balances, which tended to reduce the stock of money in circulation. The Secretary of the Treasury, Lyman J. Gage, offset this effect by prepaying interest and maturing principal on federal debt and depositing funds in national banks

To fight even this small war, the army had to be expanded in a short time from an active duty force of 27,865 in 1897 to 209,714 in 1898. The navy expanded from 11,985 in 1897 to 22,492 in 1898; the marines from 2,217 in 1896 to 3,806 in 1897

The Spanish-American War failures because of the difficult circumstances facing military planners. The armed forces had to be expanded rapidly. The overall strategic plan, moreover, kept changing: first a substantial period of training was planned, then an attack on Havana, and finally an attack on Santiago, while separate plans were laid for attacks on Puerto Rico and the Philippines. The mobilization was difficult, moreover, simply because the United States had not mobilized for a long time. Although a number of army officers were Civil War veterans, many of the lessons about how to mobilize a large army had been forgotten. Nevertheless, Koistinen gives high marks to the ordinance and commissary departments. The stocks of the latest shoulder arms and the smokeless powder ammunition were limited, but were allocated efficiently until larger supplies became available. Under General Charles P. Eagan the army's commissary department bought large quantities of food including, for the first time, refrigerated beef. A great deal may have been wasted, and the diet was boring, but "No one ever complained that there was not enough to eat" 
(Koistinen 1997, 79)
Brandes (1997, 115)
There were, however, a number of significant problems. The choice of Tampa, Florida as the embarkation point for the major assault on Cuba proved to be a mistake. The facilities, both housing and transport, were inadequate to accommodate a large army, and congestion was a constant problem. The departure for Cuba became chaotic when a rumor circulated that the supply of transport ships was inadequate and the orderly boarding of ships became a mad scramble to avoid being left behind. The troopships, moreover, were crowded and unsanitary, and the disembarkation in Cuba turned out to be as chaotic as the departure.
The largest problem, however, was the slow and inadequate response to the epidemic of tropical diseases -typhoid, dysentery, malaria, and (possibly) yellow fever -that swept through the expeditionary force. The armed forces suffered only about 385 deaths in combat during the war, but perhaps another 5,000 died of disease, most from tropical diseases. Many fell ill aboard ship on the way home and the questions of how to care for the men, and when and where to discharge them from the service, became fraught with controversy. Eventually many of the men were taken to a base at Montauk on Long Island. The facilities there were inadequate, and the army medical service was severely criticized for the conditions under which the army suffered.
11
The cost of the war American battle deaths during the Spanish-American War were low compared with those in subsequent wars. As noted above, about 385 men died in battle or of wounds sustained in battle: 369 in the army and 16 in the navy and marines (see Appendix 2). This figure, incidentally, omits the 260 men lost in the explosion of the battleship Maine. Deaths from disease (mainly tropical diseases such as malaria, cholera, yellow fever, and dysentery) and injury, however, were much higher: according to 
Beebe and DeBakey (1951, 21)
Clodfelter (2001, 287)
The financial cost of the war at current prices -estimated by taking total military expenditures and expenditures on international affairs in 1898 and 1899, and for each year subtracting 1897 spending adjusted for inflation -was about $274 million (Appendix 3). This was about 1.5 percent of average GDP during the war years. The costs incurred in 1898 and 1899, however, were not the largest component of the costs of the war. For one thing, pensions and medical care for veterans came to more than the contemporary costs of the war. We will discuss these costs in the next chapter, on the Philippine-American War, because the veterans of that war, along with the veterans of the Boxer Rebellion, were combined for legislative and reporting purposes with veterans of the Spanish-American War. The Spanish-American War, moreover, ushered in a new era of American imperialism, including the Philippine-American War, military actions in Latin America and the Caribbean, and an enlarged navy. I will also consider these costs after discussing the Philippine-American War.

The US economy was recovering from a recession when the Spanish-American War began. The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) -the organization that has come to be the official timekeeper of America's business cycle -dates the trough of the business cycle in June 1897 and the peak in June 1899.

The statistics show that the expansion of the economy was sufficient to provide for both a war abroad and an expanded flow of civilian goods and services, masking the resource cost of the war from the public. But did the war stimulate the economy or simply ride the wave? In other words, did the increase in government spending stimulate the economy, or would GDP have risen at the same pace in the absence of war spending, but with more production taking place on the civilian side?
It is hard to be sure, but it seems likely that the macroeconomic stimulus produced by the war was small. To begin, a persuasive case has been made by Milton Friedman and Anna J. 
Schwartz (1963, 138-9)
(Friedman and Schwartz 1963, 138)
There was, as noted above, a way to use the printing press, and the government did take it. Debt issued by the federal government could be given "the circulation privilege." National banks could issue bank notes provided they held a requisite amount of government bonds in reserve to back the notes. By giving banks the right to circulate notes on the basis of the bonds issued to finance the war, the government strengthened the market for government debt, increased the amount of paper money in circulation, and concealed the cost of the war from the public. However, the large increases in the monetary base during these years were driven not by increases in national bank notes, but rather by increases in the amount of gold. Between the beginning of 1897 and the end of 1900 the stock of high-powered money (the monetary base) in the United States rose from $1.399 billion to $1.927 billion, a cumulative increase of 32 percent in four years. Of the increase in the base of $528 million, $414 million, 78 percent, was accounted for by the increase in monetary gold. The increase in national bank notes accounted for only 12.5 percent of the increase in the base, and all other factors only 9.1 percent.
The increase in the stock of monetary gold, in turn, was part of a worldwide increase in the supply of gold: discoveries in the Klondike, Western Australia, and most importantly South Africa (the last made possible by the new cyanide process for extracting gold from ore) were 66
The Spanish-American War turning the deflation of the 1880s and early 1890s into an inflation. International trade spread these increases throughout the countries on the gold standard. The largest increase in the United States, $163 million, occurred in 1898. Indeed, this was the largest annual increase in the stock of monetary gold between the return of the United States to the gold standard in 1879 and World War I.

Perhaps the war didn't stimulate the economy through the usual channels, monetary and fiscal policy, but perhaps it did stimulate it over the longer term by winning new markets for American exports in Cuba. Figure

The main reason for the growing trade gap after 1898 was the increase in sugar imports. In 1901 the United States signed a Reciprocity Treaty with Cuba. This treaty presumably represented the economic fruits of America's military effort on the island. Essentially, the treaty reduced the tariff that applied to sugar imported from Cuba, giving the Cubans a leg up compared with producers outside the American sphere of influence.

Suddenly came the Spanish War. Dewey's fleet was at Manila and we were the masters of the Philippines. We were an Eastern power. We held the crossroads of the Pacific at Hawaii, and we had our foothold in the island of Luzon. The master of Manila can make terms with every power in the East, and those vast markets must be held open in the interest of our industry and our commerce, of our farmers and our workingmen to the free competition of mankind -a contest in which the genius of American enterprise need fear no rival.

The Philippine-American War
On November 1, 1898 at the Paris peace conference the United States demanded that Spain cede the Philippines to the United States. Spain resisted, but the final treaty, signed on December 10, called for Spain to cede the Philippines in exchange for $20 million.

Initially, the Philippine-American War was fought along conventional lines, and the Americans went from success to success. The Philippine forces led by Emilio Aguinaldo, who had fought for independence from Spain and who were now fighting for independence from the United States, were quickly driven from Manila and then from Aguinaldo's capital at Malolos. The war had its American critics from the beginning, but most Americans probably celebrated these victories. But when the Filipinos turned to guerilla warfare, and a short war marked by decisive American victories became a long war marked by failures as well as successes, Americans became bitterly divided. Some continued to support the war, but others, repelled by the high costs and the use of torture, scorched-earth tactics, and similar policies, turned sharply against it.
In some ways the Philippine-American War followed the same path, and had the same consequences for the United States, as the nearly contemporary Boer War (1899-1902) had for Britain. Initially, the Boer War was fought along conventional lines. The British suffered some early defeats, but when the weight of their forces began to inflict defeats on the Boers, the British rejoiced. They celebrated the relief of Mafeking (May 1900) in the same way that Americans had celebrated the driving of Aguinaldo's forces from Manila and the capture of Malolos a year earlier. But when the Boers turned to guerilla warfare the story changed. Casualties were heavy and the methods used to quell the rebellion, scorchedearth tactics and concentration camps, were repellant. The Boer War would become the point at which the British lost their taste for empire. The Philippine-American War had a less decisive effect on American attitudes, perhaps because the United States was better able to absorb its costs, but in the United States as well the taste for empire soured.
The American conquest of the Philippines was a part, although not an indispensable part, of the "large policy" being pushed by US expansionists, in particular Theodore Roosevelt, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897 and 1898, and his close friend and ally Senator Henry Cabot Lodge of Massachusetts. 2 Their program included the annexation of Hawaii, the building of an isthmus canal, and the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean and the Pacific. All of this was meant to support, and be supported by, the development of a strong aggressive navy. Roosevelt and his fellow expansionists had been influenced in particular by the writings of Captain, later Admiral, A. T. Mahan. Mahan's thesis was that sea power was crucial to achieving international hegemony, a truth abundantly proved, according to Mahan, by history. In his review of two of Mahan's books for the Political Science Quarterly (1894), Roosevelt wrote that Mahan had shown that it was not enough for the US navy to rely on mere commerce raiders, a cheap defensive device; instead "we must have a great fighting navy."
Much of the expansionist program was embedded in the Republican platform of 1896. The plank on the navy read as follows:
The peace and security of the Republic and the maintenance of its rightful influence among the nations of the earth demand a naval power commensurate with its position and responsibilities. We, therefore, favor the continued enlargement of the navy, and a complete system of harbor and sea-coast defenses.
And the plank on foreign territories read as follows:
The Hawaiian Islands should be controlled by the United States, and no foreign power should be permitted to interfere with them. The Nicaragua Canal should be built, owned and operated by the United States. And, by the purchase of the Danish Islands we should secure a much needed Naval station in the West Indies.
The Democratic platform, by way of contrast, was silent on these issues in 1896 
(Wooley and Peters 2008)

Higgs (2008, 305-6)
The origins of the American conquest of the Philippines Was the large policy an economic policy? The expansionists, it is true, offered an economic justification for their program: imperial expansion was necessary to protect and enlarge America's foreign trade. But the expansionist policy reflected at least to some degree a separable interest in national power and prestige for its own sake 
(Pratt 1932)
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. (1986, 152)
In contrast to the expansionists, the American business community appears to have had little interest in colonies, especially in the Far East, prior to the Spanish-American War. However, the confluence of two events in 1898 led to a radical shift in business opinion. First was the heating up of European efforts to carve up China. In late 1897 Germany seized the Chinese port of Tsingtau and by January of 1898 China had agreed to cede the port and rights to economic development in the surrounding area to Germany. Russian warships then entered Port Arthur, and by May 1898 China had agreed to cede territory in the Lia ´oding peninsula to Russia. It now looked as though America was in danger of being excluded from the China trade by the European powers. The China trade was then a small part of America's foreign trade, but one could imagine that it could be important in the future, provided the door to China was kept open. True, in the end the China trade proved to be more myth than reality 
(Varg 1968
The second event that influenced business opinion about the Far East, perhaps the most important, was Dewey's victory at Manila. In prospect the business community might not have seen the value of a war to capture the Philippines, but now that they had (seemingly) fallen into American hands, and now that the Europeans seemed intent on carving up China, an American presence in the Philippinesan American flag only 500 miles from China -seemed too valuable to throw away. In a short time business opinion in the United States turned 180 degrees. Julius 
Pratt (1934, 195)
Judging opinion as best we can from available expressions of it, it seemed safe to conclude that American business in the winter of 1897 and 1898 was opposed to war and either opposed to colonial expansion or oblivious to the problem. From similar evidence it seems equally safe to conclude that after the battle of Manila Bay American business became definitely imperialistic.
The Philippine-American War went extremely well for the United States -at first. Soon after Dewey destroyed the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay American troops landed near the city, quickly forcing the Spanish army there to surrender. Indeed, the Spanish garrison was ready to surrender -better the Americans than the Filipinos with whom the Spanish had been fighting a bitter and protracted war of independence. The battle with the Americans was largely ceremonial, although not without casualties. 
3
The Americans were triumphant in the battles that followed. The Filipinos, courageous but poorly trained and equipped, could not contain their assaults. Within a short time the Americans drove the Army of National Liberation from Manila. In the following weeks the Americans pressed their offensive, and on March 31, 1899 they entered Malolos, Aguinaldo's capital. Throughout the summer of 1899 American forces pushed into central Luzon and pursued Aguinaldo. Success did not come as easily as it had in the opening phase of the war. Nevertheless, the Americans gradually increased their control of the major agricultural regions of Luzon. By the fall of 1899 it looked to the Americans as though the war was almost over. But it then took a new and disquieting turn. The Filipinos disbanded the Army of National Liberation and began launching small-scale guerilla attacks. American forces were usually successful in setpiece military encounters -superior equipment and training combined with aggressive tactics carried the day -but they had no similarly effective answer for guerilla tactics. 4 It would not be the last time that the United States found thrilling victories over conventional forces giving way to frustrating guerilla warfare.
The anti-imperialist movement, which opposed the annexation of Cuba, the Philippines, and other territories, arose almost simultaneously with Dewey's victory at Manila Bay

William Jennings Bryan, the titular head of the Democratic Party, had opposed annexation of the Philippines from the start. 6 He inevitably became the leader of the anti-imperialist movement. It was not, however, a match made in heaven: many of the leading anti-imperialists, such as Cleveland, Carnegie, and Sherman, supported the gold 4 As the war began to sour the newspaper correspondents covering it became convinced that the army was attempting to paint an excessively optimistic portrait of how it was going.

(Harrington 1935
(Wooley and Peters 2008)
The greedy commercialism which dictated the Philippine policy of the Republican administration attempts to justify it with the plea that it will pay; but even this sordid and unworthy plea fails when brought to the test of facts. The war of "criminal aggression" against the Filipinos, entailing an annual expense of many millions, has already cost more than any possible profit that could accrue from the entire Philippine trade for years to come. 
(Wooley and Peters 2008)
The result of the election on November 6, 1900 was a resounding victory for McKinley. Explaining election results is always an uncertain project, but it seems doubtful that the election can be considered a referendum on the war. The key factors may well have been the prosperous state of the economy and the fear that the election of Bryan would bring monetary experiments and, possibly, a financial crisis 
(Bailey 1937;
Harrington 1935, 227-8)

The intensity of the resistance to the Americans in the Philippines varied dramatically from place to place, as might have been expected in a chain of islands characterized by enormous linguistic, cultural, and religious diversity. In some areas there was no resistance. In other areas resistance was minimal, and soon gave way to cooperation. But in some areas resistance was bitter, intense, and prolonged. American tactics varied too, depending on the nature of the resistance, the political context, and the character of individual commanders.
Overall, the policy has been described as a combination of "attraction and chastisement."
8
Chastisement, on the other hand, was something best kept out of the public eye as far as the military was concerned. Before the election the military was restrained in its use of punitive tactics because of the fear that if their use became widely known it would swing the election to Bryan and end the American project in the Philippines. After Bryan's defeat, however, the army was free to "chastise" the Filipinos. Under General Arthur MacArthur (the father of Douglas MacArthur, the World War II hero) these proved to be brutal tactics. American forces, in some areas, arrested and deported guerilla leaders, burned crops and livestock, limited access to food, arrested men of fighting age, and forcibly relocated and concentrated the population.
The island of Marinduque, about a dozen miles southwest of Luzon, witnessed some of the earliest experiments with punitive tactics. 
9
(Birtle 1997, 262)
In the final phase of the campaign on Marinduque, the army combined internal devastation of the island with "concentration" -forcing the population to live in designated towns garrisoned by the Americans. In this way the interior became a wasteland that could not support the insurgency. On April 15, 1901, as a result of the direct pressure on the Marinduque insurgents, and of events elsewhere in the Philippines, resistance on the island came to an end with the surrender of the most important guerilla leader, Colonel Maximo Abad. The story on Marinduque remained hidden from the American public. As William Howard Taft was to admit in a letter to Elihu Root, the Secretary of War, "The severity with which the inhabitants have been dealt would not look well if a complete history were written out" 
(Birtle 1997, 255)
Similar events on the island of Samar, however, did come to light. On September 28, 1901 insurgents armed with bolos (large knives similar to machetes) surprised a company of Americans at the small town of Balangiga. It was a brutal battle that left 54 Americans dead and most of the survivors wounded, while estimates of Filipino dead range from 50 to 250 
(Boot 2002, 102)
As on Marinduque, the army's response was brutal. General Jacob H. Smith gave Major Tony Waller, the man who would command his punitive mission in Samar, simple instructions: "I want no prisoners. I wish you to kill and burn; the more you kill and the more you burn, the more you will please me" 
(Boot 2002, 120)
(Silbey 2007, 193-201)
The Senate, as a result of these revelations, investigated the campaign in Samar and the conduct of the war in the Philippines more generally, including the use of torture in the form of the "water cure." It was a thoroughly partisan debate: leading Republicans defended the conduct of the war, and the Democrats attacked it. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, a staunch supporter of the war, rose to defend punitive tactics. He pointed out, according to the New York Times report, that similar actions had been taken by Nero against the Christians and by the Tartars against practically everyone in their march across Europe, thus refuting, at least to Lodge's satisfaction, the charge that the cruelties in the Philippines were unprecedented. Senator Rawlins of Utah answered for the Democrats and in a fiery speech blamed not the army, but rather the administration and Senator Lodge himself for the atrocities 
(New York Times, May 6, 1902, 3)
Although the campaign in Samar was the best-known punitive campaign, there were other areas where these tactics were used.
The Philippine-American War
In the Batangas province of southern Luzon, the army again turned to confinement of the population in concentration camps and the destruction of buildings, crops, and livestock outside the camps to crush the resistance. Some 11,000 Filipinos are said to have died in the camps in Batangas, mainly of cholera and malaria. The army attempted to control the diseases, but it is hard to resist the conclusion that the concentration of the population contributed to the epidemics 
(Boot 2002, 124)
Although the resistance in some areas was stiff, the rebellion began to collapse. On March 23, 1901 an American force captured Aguinaldo, an important symbolic blow, which reflected the deterioration of the rebellion in Luzon. In the latter part of 1901 and the beginning of 1902 more and more of the Philippines was brought under American control. By July 4, 1902 President Roosevelt was in a position to announce an end of the war. With three orders -a general amnesty for Filipinos who had fought against the United States, and orders through the Secretary of War ending the role of military governor and commending the performance of the army in the Philippines -Roosevelt announced that, as far as he was concerned, the war was over. The preamble to the amnesty announced the end of the war, but also contained an important caveat (New York Times, 4 July 1902, 1): 10 Whereas the insurrection against the sovereignty and authority of the United States is now at an end and peace has been established in all parts of the archipelago except in the country inhabited by the Moro tribes, to which this proclamation does not apply . . . Indeed, the fighting in the Muslim areas of the Philippines (Mindanao and some smaller islands) would continue for a number of years. Some scholars see this fighting, with some justice, as a different war with different dates, a Moro-American War lasting from 1898 to, say, 1913. Actions in the Moro-American War occurred at irregular 10 Roosevelt's stirring homage to the armed forces contained an oblique reference to criticisms of the tactics used to suppress the rebellion. "With surprisingly few individual exceptions its [the army's] course has been characterized by humanity and kindness to the prisoner and the non-combatant." It also contains a reference to earlier wars that would be unacceptable today: "Utilizing the lessons of the Indian Wars, it has relentlessly followed the guerilla bands to their fastnesses in mountains and jungles and crushed them."
The course of the war intervals and were small by the standards of the major wars to follow, but nevertheless involved fierce fighting. In March 1905, for example, fifteen Americans and six Filipino scouts died in action against the Moros. In June 1913 General John J. Pershing, who would lead the American armies in World War I, lost fifteen men from a combined American-Filipino force while defeating a Moro army which lost about five hundred men. All told, it is estimated that the United States suffered 125 deaths and 323 woundings in actions against the Moros. The peak force engaged was about 12,000 
(Clodfelter 2001, 272)
Why was the US effort in the Philippines successful, at least in the sense that armed resistance in most of the archipelago came to an end after about three and a half years? Historians of the war have pointed to several factors. concentration, destruction of the rural economy, torture, and execution of civilians without benefit of trial -tactics that would never win approval from the American people -or were these merely exceptions to a more benign policy? The controversies about how widely such policies were used and about how much they ultimately contributed to the pacification of the Philippines are likely to continue.
The deaths and non-mortal casualties suffered by Americans in the Philippine-American War seem to have been largely forgotten in the United States. Neither the Historical Statistics of the United States, nor various US military websites that I searched, reported deaths or non-mortal casualties in the war. Yet the Philippine-American War was more costly in terms of American lives lost and wounds suffered than the Spanish-American War. This tells us something, surely, about the nature of our collective memory and its tendency to reinvent the past in a more favorable light. The war we remember was the "splendid little war" in Cuba in which the United States quickly liberated that island from the yoke of foreign domination -however accurate that characterization of the war may be. The war we forget is the long and bitter war in which the United States conquered the Philippines.
To compare the two wars, consider the figures for the army. In the Spanish-American War, 369 army personnel (or by an alternative estimate 379) were killed in action or died of wounds sustained in combat (Appendix 2). By May 1900, the army was reporting that 656 men had died in combat or of wounds sustained in combat in the Philippines: 267 regulars and 389 volunteers. Many of the latter had volunteered to free Cuba, not to conquer the Philippines. 
11
Clodfelter (2001, 272)
What about the financial cost of the war? In early 1902 the Senate called on the naval and war secretaries for estimates of the cost of the Philippine-American War. Both William H. Moody for the navy and Elihu Root for the War Department made determined efforts to comply, and came up with reasonable estimates. The costs for the navy were $20,855,637 at 1897 prices and those for the army $170,408,745.
12
The main uncertainty for Moody and Root was how to treat expenditures that might have been incurred even in the absence of the war in the Philippines, for example food and clothing for troops or coal for the navy, which would have been required even if the army and navy forces were stationed in the United States. In other words, to use the economic jargon, how (if at all) should they calculate the marginal costs of the war? The figure of $211,264,382 includes these fixed costs, but it could be argued that they should be excluded. Root simply noted the problem; Moody estimated that perhaps two-thirds of the naval expenditures that he was attributing to the war would have been incurred in any case. It was natural for Root and Moody to raise this issue. Calculating only the marginal cost of the war would make the war look less costly.
I checked the official figures with a calculation similar to the one made previously for the Spanish-American War. In each year from 1900 to 1903 I computed one-half the difference between total military spending and 1897 military spending adjusted for inflation and then summed the results. The figure of one-half was chosen arbitrarily to split additional spending between the Philippines and other areas, mainly the Caribbean. The result of this "outsider's" calculation was almost identical to the official figure.
In 1912 the House asked President Taft to state "the cost which has accrued to the Government of the United States, from the beginning of and as the result of the occupation of the Philippine Islands by the United States." If anyone could do such a calculation it would be Taft: he had served as the chief American civil administrator in the Philippines and as Secretary of War before becoming President. In a testy reply, Taft insisted that there were relatively few expenditures (about $3.5 million) that had not been recompensed in full by the government of the Philippines. Even these small expenditures, according to Taft, were more than offset by monies spent by the Philippine government on behalf of the United States for military purposes during the period 1898-1900. Therefore, all the costs of the occupation, Taft claimed, had been more than offset by monies received from the Philippines except for expenses resulting from "military and naval operations in and about the archipelago and from the construction of fortifications and naval stations therein" 
(Taft 1912)
The costs of a "large policy"
While it is hard to measure the costs of specific military operations, as Taft and the Secretaries of War and the Navy argued, it is possible to look at the cumulative impact of imperialism on the military budget. Figure

The Philippine-American War between the two lines is a measure of the resource costs of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars, and of postwar imperialism.
The costs of the Spanish-American War (including veterans' benefits) amounted to about $24 billion in year 2008 dollars, 5.5 percent of average GDP during the war. The costs of the Philippine-American War amounted to about $13 billion (year 2008 dollars), 2.6 percent of average GDP. 13 The costs of both wars and postwar imperialism together, Theodore Roosevelt's "large policy," amounted to about $86 billion, nearly 16 percent of average GDP (Table 
4
One way to think about these costs is to compare them with the costs of large civilian government projects. The Panama Canal, the largest government-financed civilian project of the day -which was itself part of America's imperial ambitions -cost about $397 million, including a payment of $25 million made by the Wilson administration to Colombia, about $6.5 billion in year 2008 dollars

about $11 billion per year (at year 2008 prices) from 1897 to 1915. Therefore, the Spanish-American War absorbed about 2.2 years' growth, the Philippine-American War absorbed about 1.1 years' growth, and both wars and postwar imperialism together absorbed about 7.7 years' worth of growth in GDP. War and imperialism came at a high price.
What were the consequences of conquering the Philippines, and more generally of an imperialist military policy, for American trade with Asia and the Pacific? Figure

As I noted in Chapter 2, a number of scholars have argued that one factor behind turn-of-the-century imperialism was the desire of financiers to increase foreign investment. Wall Street, in other words, might have benefited from increased commissions from the placing of foreign securities or arranging direct investments, and pressured the United States into imperialist adventures, even if the country as a whole, or even the business community as a whole, did not benefit. What do the numbers show? America's investments abroad did increase dramatically after 1897. Table

The last column is the increase in a row between 1897 and 1914 divided by the total increase, and expressed as a percentage of the total increase.
Cuba and its neighbors accounts for only 10.2 percent of the total increase, investment in the Philippines and its neighbors for only 0.55 percent of the total increase, and Asia (recall that conquering the Philippines was supposed to prop open the door to China) accounted for only 7.9 percent of the increase. Canada, Mexico, and Europe gained the lion's share of increased US foreign investment. It is hard to believe that the new form of American imperialism had much to do with these increases. Much of the investment in Asia, moreover, was the result of increased investments in Japanese securities. These investments, associated mainly with the Russo-Japanese War, reflected the rise of Japan as a military and industrial power, more than rising US imperialism. The direct investments in Cuba and in the Philippines are linked more directly to US imperialism. But in both cases American economic policies tended to divert investment from other areas. Legislation, as I noted above, lowered the tariff barriers on Cuban and Philippine sugar. It made sense to expand production in Cuba and the Philippines, but the investment may simply have been diverted from regions that did not enjoy the benefits of favored status under the tariffs.

Friedman and Anna Schwartz (1963, 142-8)
Wilkins (1970, 70-217)
There may be non-pecuniary benefits from imperialism that, at least to some, justify the expense. The Republicans continued their support for the Philippine intervention for years, offering such justifications. In 1904 the Republican platform hailed the end of the war in the Philippines:
In the Philippines we have suppressed insurrection, established order, and given to life and property a security never known there before. We have organized civil government, made it effective and strong in administration, and have conferred upon the people of those islands the largest civil liberty they have ever enjoyed.
And suggested a tangible strategic benefit for the United States: By our possession of the Philippines we were enabled to take prompt and effective action in the relief of the legations at Peking and a decisive part in preventing the partition and preserving the integrity of China.
To be sure, one could debate how important control of the Philippines was to the relief of Peking. It may have been possible to negotiate coaling stations and a naval base in the Philippines without conquering the islands. The strategic value of the Philippines to the United States could not in any case be given a dollar value to set against the cost of the war.
The Democrats in 1904, however, saw only crude attempts by special interests to benefit from American control of the Philippines.
The endeavor of the Secretary of War, by pledging the Government's endorsement for "promoters" in the Philippine Islands to make the United States a partner in speculative exploitation of the archipelago, which was only temporarily held up by the opposition of Democratic Senators in the last session, will, if successful, lead to entanglements from which it will be difficult to escape.
In their 1908 platforms the parties were at it again.
In the Philippines insurrection has been suppressed, law is established and life and property made secure. Education and practical experience are there advancing the capacity of the people for government, and the policies of McKinley and Roosevelt are leading the inhabitants step by step to an everincreasing measure of home rule. 
(Republican platform 1908)
The costs of an imperial policy after 1898, to sum up, were high; they were the equivalent of net additions to real GDP for six years. Economic benefits in the form of substantial increases in trade with Asia and the Caribbean, the most frequently cited potential benefits, are hard to find. But there were potential benefits along another dimension that must be acknowledged even while they are hard to measure. Imperialism helped build the US military: new ships for the navy were constructed, and men and officers in the army were trained. When the United States entered World War I General Pershing was recalled from the campaign he was leading against the Moros in the Philippines and given command of America's expeditionary force. In 1918 many Americans thought that their military services, especially the army and the army air force, were woefully unprepared, and that the government should have been spending more, not less, on the military in the years before 1918.
The Philippine-American War
The veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars
The veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars received benefits greater than those received by veterans of earlier conflicts, as might be expected given the rise in per capita income, and, perhaps somewhat more surprising, benefits comparable to those received by veterans of later wars. Indeed, by some measures, the veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars were the best rewarded of all of America's veterans.
The veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars formed several organizations immediately after the wars (they later merged to become the Veterans of Foreign Wars) that lobbied on behalf of the veterans. Success came in 1920 when a combined disability and service pension bill was passed. Thus, the veterans of the Spanish-American War had to wait only eighteen years for a service pension compared with the veterans of the Civil War who had to wait twenty-eight years, and the veterans of earlier wars who had to wait even longer. Under the 1920 act disabled veterans were entitled to between $12 and $30 per month, depending on their degree of disability. Under the old-age provision, a veteran was eligible for a pension of $12 per month at age 62, rising to $18 at age 68, $24 at age 72, and $30 at age 75 
(Weber and Schmeckebier 1934, 53)
(Carter et al. 2006
The case for a pension was based, first of all, on precedent. The soldiers of all previous wars, including the Revolution, had received both disability payments and service pensions. Indeed, the granting of pensions was so well established by 1897 that it could be said that the promise of a pension was implicit in the call for volunteers. The veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars, and their supporters, also made a number of additional arguments for a pension that were unique to these wars. The veterans it was claimed, with some justice, had undergone especially terrible hardships while fighting overseas. True, the losses from combat were low compared with the Civil War: deaths averaged 8 per 1,000 for men serving in the Spanish-American and Philippine-
The veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars 95 American wars, compared with 165 per 1,000 for Union soldiers and sailors in the Civil War. Death rates were also higher in the Mexican War 
(Carter et al. 2006, series Ed1-5 and Ed2)
Death rates and similar statistics, however, do not tell the whole story. Living conditions in Cuba and the Philippines were often horrible, and many soldiers contracted tropical diseases that the military medical services were unable to recognize and treat. Richard 
Severo and Lewis Milford (1989, 187-228)
The Philippine-American War also took a heavy toll. Again, tropical diseases were the main cause of death and disability. The guerilla war, moreover, added psychological costs that were new to Americans. Soldiers stationed in the "boondocks" -an Americanization of a Tagalog word for mountain -suffered from long periods of boredom interrupted by short and dangerous encounters with the guerillas. And some veterans suffered when they were asked to carry out actions against civilians that violated their ethical values.
Supporters of a pension also pointed to the success of the "splendid little war." Through the efforts of these veterans the United States had gained an empire and become a global power. It was accomplished quickly and at relatively low cost because of the great courage displayed on the battlefield. Shouldn't the veterans be rewarded for accomplishing so much? Does that mean that the pension should have been smaller if the American effort had met with disaster, if the brutal war in the Philippines had failed, and the United States had been forced to leave the Philippines? The question seems to have a simple answer: the pension should not be based on the success of American arms. History, however, suggests that there could be a connection between the success of arms and the willingness of Americans to award a pension. It may be that part of the problem the veterans of the War of 1812 had in securing a pension was the result of the 96
The Philippine-American War perception that the troops had not performed well. It was also said that the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars had soothed the psychic scars left from the Civil War because Northerners and Southerners fought on the same side.
17
The small number of troops involved also worked in favor of the veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars. Only about 0.42 percent of the population served in the Spanish-American War and only 0.16 percent in the Philippine-American War, compared with 6.87 percent during the Civil War or 4.58 percent during World War I

Further liberalizations of the pension for the veterans of the Spanish-American War in the form of relaxation of the eligibility requirements and increases in the pension rates occurred in 1926 and 1930. The liberalization of 1930 was passed over a veto by President Hoover. Hoover objected to eliminating the requirement that a disability not be due to the "vicious habits" of the veteran, objected to a reduction in the minimum service from ninety to seventy days, and objected to the lack of a means test on the grounds that it was unfair to tax the poor in order to pay a pension to a well-off veteran 
(Weber and Schmeckebier 1934, 236-7)
The veterans of the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars, to sum up, were, by some measures, the best rewarded of all veterans. They had everything going for them: these were small wars, so the additional tax burden associated with rewarding the veterans was small, and American arms were successful in producing a new empire and global standing for the United States.

World War I would require the largest mobilization of resources in the United States since the Civil War. Although America's losses would be small compared with those of the European nations, they would nonetheless be traumatic for the United States. About 53,000 Americans died in battle, and another 63,000 from injury and disease, many from the influenza epidemic that ravaged the American forces alongside everyone else at the end of the war. About 204,000 suffered nonmortal wounds.
On June 28, 1914 in Sarajevo, Bosnia, Gavrilo Princip, a young Serbian revolutionary, shot and killed Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife, Sophie. This set off a deadly chain reaction that produced an explosion of astonishing violence. First, the Austro-Hungarian empire, perhaps motivated in part by a desire to annex Serbia, presented that country with a list of demands. When Serbia failed to meet them, the empire attacked it. Russia mobilized. Germany entered on the side of Austria-Hungary.
France entered on the side of Russia. And Great Britain entered on the side of France. Two bullets fired by a single revolutionary had launched what was to become, up to that time, the bloodiest war in human history. As Niall

One economic factor that has often been singled out is the scramble among the Great Powers at the end of the nineteenth century for colonies in Africa, Asia, and other parts of the world. 1 This scramble, it is said, intensified tensions among the European powers and contributed to the arms race, particularly the naval arms race.

Recently, however, trends in macroeconomics have weakened the foundations of the argument that imperialism was a product of the goal of maintaining full employment. Traditionally, Keynesian economists emphasized the tendency of market economies to fall below full employment and the need for government policies, such as deficit spending on public works, to maintain aggregate demand and full employment. In this sort of model, a policy of imperialism to expand export markets made sense. It may have been a second-best solution compared with using deficit spending to build hospitals and universities -but it made economic sense. In recent years, however, first monetarist models and then real business-cycle models, which emphasize the tendency of economies to recover from shocks and return to full employment, have displaced the Keynesian model. In the newer models the logic of imperialism as a means of generating aggregate demand is questionable.
Economic historians, moreover, by uncovering additional data and exploiting new types of data have challenged other parts of the "it was all about economics" interpretation of the war. 
Davis, Huttenbach, and Davis (1986)
It may be that the race for distant colonies was as much a product of the arms race, including the naval building race, as a cause. During peacetime nations can buy resources -coal, iron ore, petroleum, or whatever one deems crucial -on the open market. They can lodge their ships and refuel at ports around the world. There was always a fear, however, a fear frequently reiterated by the military, that access to these resources might be cut during a war. The military logic then was to secure political control over the areas that produce crucial raw materials, and over points where those resources could be transferred to the navy. The arms race, moreover, tended to push countries toward war, encouraging dreams of victory and fears of defeat. Each nation was engaged in a complex game with other nations. If the coalition to which one belonged fell behind in spending, the fear that war and defeat lay ahead would spur additional spending. Jari

Although it is likely that investors who anticipated the war would sell their long-term government bonds, there were considerations that would make them hesitate. After all, where else could they put their money? Cash? But cash itself was subject to many of the same problems as bonds: it would lose value from wartime inflation. Investors who had chosen the stability of income and principal provided by long-term government bonds, moreover, might be reluctant to move to the private bond market or the private stock market, with its
The origins of the war and American involvement reputation for violent fluctuation. Stocks of private firms, moreover, while they might profit from higher wartime prices, and might therefore be a hedge against inflation, might be affected by disruptions in the supply of raw materials and by heavy taxation. It is therefore worth looking at how the stock market, which might reflect the views of a different class of investors, moved in the period leading up to the war. Figure

In fact, the entry of the United States brought a downturn in the stock market in general, and, surprisingly, in the war-related stocks in particular. Perhaps investors believed that the disruptions caused by the war would offset the demands placed on these firms by the mobilization. Or perhaps the threat of taxation, especially an increase in the excess profits tax, outweighed the expectation of additional spending on war mate ´riel. The Wilson administration had included an excess profits tax in its 1917 emergency revenue bill 
(New York Times, February 12, 1917, 14)
While the Europeans may have been naı ¨ve in 1914 about the destructive forces they were unleashing, there could have been no such naı ¨vete ´when the United States declared war in April 1917. By then the awful destructiveness of the war was abundantly clear. Why then did the United States enter the war? The causes were complex. One factor, surely, was that Britain and France were reeling under the weight of German attacks, and there was considerable sentiment in the United States for coming to their aid. The insistence of the United States on its trading rights was also important. Soon after the war began the Entente Powers set up a naval blockade of Europe. Even food was considered contraband. The Wilson administration complained bitterly that the Entente actions violated international law. US firms took to using European neutrals, such as Sweden, as intermediaries. Surely, the Americans argued, international law protected the right of one neutral to trade with another. The Entente responded by extending the blockade to include the Baltic neutrals. The situation was similar to the difficulties the United States experienced during the Napoleonic Wars, which drove it almost to war against France, and actually to war against Britain.
Ultimately it was not the Entente's use of conventional surface vessels to enforce its blockade that enraged American opinion, but rather the German use of submarines. To be sure, the British blockade created substantial opposition in the United 
States. In 1914 and
1915

In the months that followed further sinkings brought more angry warnings from President Wilson. For a time, the Germans gave way and agreed to give warnings before attacks and to save passengers. In February 1917, however, the Germans renewed unrestricted submarine warfare in an attempt to starve Britain into submission. The loss of several ships led President Wilson to break diplomatic relations with Germany in February 1917 and to ask for a declaration of war in April. There were other issues, such as the "Zimmermann note," in which Germany offered to support Mexico if it undertook military actions against the United States, and conceivably, other concerns may have been at work below the surface, but Wilson's war message focused almost exclusively on Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare.
From a dollar and cents point of view it is hard to justify the war based on the trade lost to the United States because of the German blockade. US exports to Europe rose from $1.479 billion in 1913 to $4.062 billion in 1917. Exports hit a peak of $5.188 billion in 1919. To be sure, some of this increase was the result of inflation. Over the period 1913-17 the unit value of exports rose from 100 to 177. Nevertheless, it is clear that exports to Europe rose substantially in real terms. If we use the unit value of exports as a deflator the increase was from $1.479 billion in 1913 to $2.295 billion in 1917 at 1913 values. Suppose the United States had stayed out of the war, and that as a result all trade with Europe was cut off. Suppose further, that the resources that would have been used to produce exports for Europe were able to produce only half as much value when reallocated to other purposes such as producing goods for the domestic market or exports for non-European countries, surely an extreme assumption. Then the loss of output at 1917 prices would have been $2.031 billion. How large an amount was this? It was about 3.7 percent of GDP in 1917, and about 6.25 percent of the total US cost of the war.

The first decision that the United States had to make upon entering the war was about the size of the army. In 1917 the US army stood at approximately 200,000, hardly enough to have a significant impact in Europe where giant armies numbering in the millions were slugging it out. But a draft was imposed and the numbers were rapidly increased. Overall some 4,791,172 men would serve in the US military in World War I. Some 2,084,000 would reach France, and 1,390,000 would see active combat. This was a remarkable achievement given that the United States was only involved in active fighting for a year and a half.
The arrival of this army rapidly changed the course of the war. On March 21, 1918 the Germans, with a temporary superiority of numbers on the western front, had launched a massive offensive on the Somme battlefield and were successful in pushing back the British and French. In May and early June they followed up with fresh attacks that brought them within fifty miles of Paris. Although some Americans fought in these battles it was mainly the old war: the Germans against the British and the French. The Battle of Belleau Wood fought from June 6 to July 1, 1918 was the first in which significant numbers of Americans fought. And it was a victory for the Allies. The turning point was the Second Battle of the Marne fought between July 18 and August 6. Here the Allies, bolstered by American forces, halted a German offensive.
The initiative now passed to the Allies. The Germans were driven back in a series of attacks in which American troops played an important role. The first distinctively American offensive was the Battle of the St. Mihiel Salient fought from September 12 to 16, 1918 in which more than half a million US troops participated. The last major offensive of the war, the Meuse-Argonne Offensive, was launched on September 26, with British, French, and American forces pushing back the Germans on a broad front. The Germans now realized that their military situation was deteriorating rapidly and that they would have to agree to an end to the fighting. The Armistice was reached on November 11, 1918 -at the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month.

The United States was again faced with the classic problem of war finance: taxes, borrowing, or simply printing money? On the eve of America's entry into the war, Oliver M. W. Sprague -a professor at Harvard and one of America's leading monetary economists -was given the task of discussing the optimal means of financing a major war at the annual meetings of the American Economic Association. Sprague, in line with the classical tradition, made a strong case for taxation. Borrowing, according to Sprague, was unjust.
The injustice of treating those who furnish the funds for war more generously than those who risk life itself will not be questioned. Consider for a moment the contrast under the borrowing method of war finance of a soldier in receipt of an income of $2,500 before a war and his neighbor who remains at home in continued receipt of a similar amount.

World War I reduces his expenditures in every possible way and subscribes a total of $4,000 to war loans. He is rewarded with a high rate of interest to which his soldier neighbor must contribute his quota in higher taxes if he is fortunate enough to return from the front. 
(Sprague 1917, 204)
Taxation on this onerous scale [sufficient to finance a major war] would virtually eliminate the ordinary economic motives for effort and sacrifice.
What would be the effect on production? There is no experience whatsoever on which to base a judgment. I venture to think, however, that no serious difficulties would be encountered when millions of men were fighting in the trenches in a great war in which a people believed that its vital interests were at stake.

financed by the appropriation of all incomes over $10,000 per year. The Wall Street Journal, as might be expected, advocated reducing the income tax exemption from $4,000 to $1,000. The Journal, moreover, thought that considerable reliance should be placed on bonds. It was a matter of equity: "It is not right that the present generation should bear the whole burden of a conflict fought for the freedom of our children's children."

Davis Rich Dewey (1931, 506-7)
When it came to practical details about what the types of instruments to market and how to market them, and what rate of interest to pay, the economists were less helpful, although they did offer some advice. Arthur Cecil Pigou was the leading British economist of the day and after the war he offered what he considered to be three decisive objections to allowing interest rates to increase in wartime 
(Pigou 1941
(Pigou [1921]]
(1) Higher rates, in particular rates that rise above rates in enemy countries, might be seen as a sign of weakness. (2) Higher rates might not stimulate much in the way of additional savings, and in any case would store up problems for future finance ministers. (3) Higher rates, like loans themselves, may be viewed as inequitable, as allowing the rich to "make a good thing out of war." It seems likely that concerns such as these, although not necessarily derived from economists, explain the determined effort made in the United States and in Britain to keep rates down during the war and to disguise rate increases.
Irving Fisher was perhaps the leading American economist of the day, certainly the one that we know best today. He accepted the need for issuing bonds, and made three points about how patriotic citizens should respond 
(Fisher 1918)
1
(3) It was important that poor people invest in bonds so that after the war the government wouldn't be in the position of taxing the poor in order to pay the interest and principal on bonds owned by the rich. All of these points were stressed in the campaigns to sell what would be called the Liberty bonds.
Support for higher taxes, to sum up, was widespread, including among economists and, to an extent, business leaders, as well as the general public. The debate in Congress over how to raise taxes was divisive, but on October 3, about four months after the declaration of war, Congress passed the War Revenue Act. This Act introduced a sharply progressive surtax to the income tax, a graduated excess profits tax on corporations and individuals, higher postal rates, and higher taxes on alcohol, tobacco, assorted luxuries, and other items. The tax on alcohol, tobacco, and other luxuries was an old story. These taxes had been used during the Civil War and the Spanish-American War. The income tax was a less familiar resource. True, there had been personal and business income taxes during the Civil War. But a Supreme Court decision had taken them off the table, and as we have seen, they were not used during the Spanish-American War. But the sixteenth amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1913, had created a legal basis for an income tax. The income tax amendment, although a cherished goal of populists and progressives, owed its final adoption, as shown by 
Baack and Ray (1985)
One potential source of revenue that had broad public support was an excess profits tax simply because abhorrence of wartime profiteering was widespread. Something resembling an excess profits tax had been imposed in the South during the Civil War, but not (as far as I am aware) in the more business-oriented and Republican North 
(Shultz and Caine 1937, 275;
Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 31-2)
The Wilson administration, a progressive Democratic administration, found an excess profits tax more congenial. The Revenue Act of 1916, passed during the period of US neutrality, included a tax on munitions manufacturers 
(Shultz and Caine 1937, 520;
Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 55)
(Stamp 1917)
(Lent 1951)
Liberal legislators favored the high profits tax because it reflected their belief that even in peacetime profits beyond some maximum were objectionable and that as a practical matter continuing a high profits tax after the war would be straightforward. A high profits tax, moreover, was already implicit in some legislation regulating public utility rates. The high profits approach, however, suffered from some practical deficiencies. Capital was hard to measure. A firm with low measured capital because it had remained in the same hands for many years could end up paying more in taxes than a similar firm whose measured capital had been augmented in frequent mergers and acquisitions. Conservative legislators favored the excess profits tax because it was tied more closely to the war and less likely to survive it. But the excess profits tax also had practical problems. Firms that had made large prewar profits during a prewar arms buildup would pay less tax during the war than a comparable firm that had not joined in the prewar "profiteering." Moreover, how would one tax firms that had not existed, and therefore earned no profits before the war? Both the excess profits tax and the high profits tax reduced the incentive to convert to war work.
The "Special Preparedness" Tax of March 3, 1917 included a high profits tax 
(Shultz and Caine 1937, 521;
Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 55-7)
(Shultz and Caine 1937, 528, 532;
Lent 1951;
Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 64-5)
Although the presence of the excess profits tax during the war has been noted frequently, its importance in financing the war has not been appreciated. Part of the reason is that it is hard to reconcile various Treasury figures on an annual basis. This is not as surprising as it sounds. Taxes, for example, can be listed according to the time when the income that is subject to taxation is accrued, the time when the taxes are paid to Treasury agents, or the time when the officials who keep the accounts at the Treasury are notified of the payment, and taxes can be listed gross or net of refunds. If one aggregates over the whole course of the war, however (as in Appendix 4, which shows the sources of federal tax revenues in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War), these problems tend to net out, and the importance of the excess profits tax becomes clear. If we simply add all dollars together without paying attention to the price level we can see that the excess profits tax was the most important source of taxes Financing the war during World War I, producing about 30 percent of all tax revenue; more than the individual income tax. If we adjust for inflation and make an allowance for prewar receipts to identify the tax revenues available to finance the extra spending occasioned by the war, then the contribution of the excess profits tax to total taxes approaches 40 percent, substantially more than any other form of taxation.
Relying on the excess profits tax helped maximize political support for the war. The average voter was not paying; "they" were -that is, the "war profiteers." And it may very well be true that the excess profits tax was paid by the shareholders of firms paying that tax. A strong economic case could be made against an excess profits tax on economic grounds: the tax discouraged the transfer of resources into areas of the economy where they were most needed. Why stop producing civilian good X and start producing military good Y, if the profit would be no higher in Y than in X? Moreover, as economists stress, the burden of taxation can (sometimes) be shifted to others, and it can be extremely difficult to figure out who actually pays. The classic case of shifting the burden is a tax on a single commodity paid by the producer. Producers write the checks, so from a legal point of view producers are paying, but if the price of the product rises, part of the burden falls on consumers of the product. Something like that may have happened in this case, but it is hard to know whether shifting actually occurred. Producers tried to game the system. Money spent on advertising raised costs and reduced excess profits, but might result in higher profits after the war. Money paid to executives during the war reduced excess profits, and might reduce the size of postwar salary increases 
(Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 67)
Taxes were an important source of finance for the war, but they were not sufficient. The government would have to turn to the bond market. Secretary McAdoo studied the record of Salmon Chase, his Civil War predecessor, and concluded that while Chase had done a good job, especially in hiring investment banker Jay Cooke to sell bonds to middle-class investors, his policy could have been pushed much further. Britain and Germany had already undertaken noisy "drives" aimed at selling bonds, especially to middle-and working-class investors

The most controversial feature of the bonds was their exemption from taxes. The first issue was exempt from normal (peacetime) income taxes and from the wartime surtax which would be, it was hoped, temporary. The exemption drew considerable criticism: the Financing the war Source: 
Kang and Rockoff (2006)
Wilson administration, nominally a progressive Democratic administration, was raising taxes on the wealthy with one hand, and then creating a huge loophole for them with the other. The surtax exemption for the second and third bonds was therefore limited to the interest on the first $5,000 worth of bonds at face value. When it came to planning the fourth issue, however, concerns about finding a market led to backtracking. The limit to the exemption from the surtax was raised to $30,000, and provision was made to extend the surtax exemption to interest on the second and third issues, provided specified amounts of the fourth issue were purchased. The history of the surtax exemption is telling: evidently, prosaic tax considerations could not be swept aside, even while calling on the powerful force of patriotism to help market the bonds. A study of the yields on the bonds also suggests that the ability of McAdoo to increase the demand for bonds through the bond campaigns was limited 
(Kang and Rockoff 2006

This last source of finance was particularly troubling for the British 
(Burk 1979

Fears about the potential effects of a selloff of foreign-owned securities in New York (by private or government owners), and the resulting withdrawals of deposits from American banks as funds in the form of gold were repatriated, had created a small financial panic at the outset of the war, a crisis that the newly established Federal Reserve was not well prepared to meet head on. Fortunately, the crisis was contained by the issue of an emergency currency, the so-called Aldrich-Vreeland currency, and the temporary closing (by the federal government) of the New York stock exchange 
(Silber 2007)
Had the Federal Reserve been a well-established institution with a large portfolio of domestic securities it could have "sterilized" the gold inflow. That is, it could have sold securities equal to the gold inflow, thus offsetting the effect of the inflow on bank reserves and the money supply. However, the Federal Reserve, which had only recently gone into operation, was not ready either in terms of its balance sheet or in terms of its understanding of monetary policy to attempt to offset the gold flow.
Once the United States entered the war, this state of affairs changed. The US government now made loans to its allies, relieving them of the immediate constraints on arms buying, although laying the groundwork for future conflicts over repayment of the loans. The Federal Reserve, moreover, was now prepared to play a major role. It still might have based its policy on constraining the growth of the stock of money and prices, but instead it made every effort to help the Treasury sell its bonds without producing a substantial increase in interest rates. As we have seen, an increase in rates over prewar levels was seen as a very bad thing, in part because it might be taken as a signal of a weak economy or a lack of support for the war. Hence the Federal Reserve used its discount rate and its open market operations to support the bond market. Despite increased taxes, sales of bonds to the American capital market, and the broadening of that market through appeals to patriotism, the Federal Reserve directly or indirectly monetized a substantial portion of the new wartime debt. Milton Friedman and Anna J. 
Schwartz (1963, 216)
The Federal Reserve became to all intents and purposes the bond-selling window of the Treasury, using its monetary powers almost exclusively to that end. Although no "greenbacks" were printed, the same result was achieved by more indirect methods using Federal Reserve notes and Federal Reserve deposits.
How much was involved? Between June 1916 and June 1919, the federal debt increased by $24.3 billion (from $1.2 billion to $25.5 billion). Highpowered money (which includes mainly Federal Reserve notes and deposits) increased by $2.1 billion, according to 
Friedman and Schwartz (1963, 801-2)
Since the amount of bonds purchased with newly created money was not matched one for one by bonds held by banks, we cannot form an accurate estimate of how much of the debt was monetized by examining the balance sheets of the banks. We can get an upper 124
World War I bound, however, by looking at the increase in the total stock of money and assuming that all of the money that was created was backed directly or indirectly by government bonds. I follow this procedure in Table

Once the United States entered the war it was clear that it would have to field a massive army and mobilize the economy on a huge scale. The European powers already had huge armies in the field and the United States, if it was to change the course of the war, would have to do likewise. Congress had already taken some actions toward mobilizing the economy before the US declaration of war. On August 29, 1916, a Council of National Defense, an advisory commission charged with coordinating industry, was established, and on September 7 the US Shipping Board was established, with the power to build or lease ships through an Emergency Fleet Corporation capitalized at $50 million. After the declaration of war Congress went into high gear. On April 14, 1917 it established the Committee on Public Information to create propaganda for the war. On April 24 it passed the Liberty Loan Act authorizing the issue of debt. On May 18 the Selective Service Act creating a draft was passed and on June 15 the Espionage Act to suppress seditious or treasonable activities. On July 28 the War Industries Board replaced the Council of National Defense, and was given the task of coordinating and increasing production. On August 10 Congress passed the Lever Food and Fuel Act to control food and fuel prices and maintain supplies. Herbert Hoover, the future President, became the food administrator, and Harry Garfield, the son of President James A. Garfield, became the fuel administrator.
Taxes proved to be one of the most contentious issues, but as I discussed above, on October 3 Congress passed the War Revenue Act. This Act introduced a sharply progressive surtax to the income tax, a graduated excess profits tax on corporations and individuals, higher postal rates, and higher taxes on alcohol, tobacco, assorted luxuries, and other items. Overall it was an impressive performance, at least in terms of sheer activity. The United States would not see a similar flurry of legislation until Franklin Roosevelt's "100 days."
Where did all these ideas come from? How did a country that had not fought a major war for more than fifty years take action so quickly? Some ideas, as we have seen, came from looking back at US experience. Treasury Secretary McAdoo, for example, reexamined the policies followed in the Civil War. But the examples of Britain and Germany were also very important. Presumably they had learned something. Following suit, moreover, made sense strategically. The United States had a larger population and economy than Germany. If it organized the economy in the same way as the Germans, then superior US resources would tell, and it would win. If it organized differently, there was always the chance, however remote, that the country would use its greater resources less efficiently, and lose. Following suit was the course of prudence.
Although the basic structure of the war economy was in place by the end of October, several important pieces of legislation followed. On December 18, 1917 Congress passed the Prohibition Amendment to the Constitution which, when ratified, outlawed the production and sale of alcoholic beverages. Prohibition had been gaining in strength for some time: by 1917 nineteen states had banned the sale of alcoholic beverages. The war strengthened the "dries" and weakened the "wets." How could America allow drunken workers in war factories making arms for its boys at the front? How could it allow grain, desperately needed as food for its allies, to be made into alcohol? On December 26, in the midst of a national coal crisis -caused by a hard winter and the disruption of rail schedules by the war -Wilson placed the railroads under government control. His Secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, was placed in charge. 
12
Did this flurry of activity leave a permanent imprint on the institutional structure of the economy? Were institutions created during the war that lived on after their original raison d'e ˆtre had disappeared? It is sometimes claimed that once institutions are created for any reason, even a war emergency, they create a constituencycustomers, suppliers, workers, politicians -who work to keep them going indefinitely at the taxpayer's expense. For the most part, however, the institutions created during World War I were unwound afterwards. Partly this was the result of changing political tides: conservative Republican administrations in the 1920s were keen to scale back wartime expansions in the role of government.
The railroads were typical. They and other carriers that had been seized by the government were returned to private ownership on March 1, 1920. The Railroad Administration itself survived somewhat longer, but only for the purpose of winding up all of the accounts. The War Finance Corporation, however, lasted much longer. It was used to aid agriculture during the 1920-1 contraction, and this function was moved in 1923 to the new system of Federal Intermediate Credit Banks. The affairs of the War Finance Corporation were not finally wound up until 1929. Its director, Eugene Meyer, would serve as the chair of the Federal Reserve Board during the fateful period 1930-3. In 1932 he, and men who had served under him at the War Finance Corporation, were instrumental in pushing for the establishment of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation to meet the challenge of the Depression. The Reconstruction Finance Corporation in turn was used to help finance industrial expansion in World War II. The Small Defense Plants Administration created in 1951 was assigned to the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and its activities in turn were continued in the Small Business Administration created in 1953. So, in a sense, the Small Business Administration, still active today, is a descendant of the War Finance Corporation.
How many men were required in the military? This was the first key question, and the one from which all else flowed. The decision ultimately belonged to the man Wilson picked to head the American Expeditionary Force, General John J. Pershing. Pershing, who had served, as I noted, in the Philippines, and was just back from chasing Pancho Villa in Mexico, quickly came to some basic conclusions.

The troops came in record time, and American war planners were justifiably proud of what they accomplished. In January 1918 Secretary of War Newton Baker reported on the rapid increase in the size of the armed forces.

In response to these contracts the flow of materials began to mount. Table

Inevitably, there were complaints that the production program was moving too slowly and was mired in confusion and corruption. The aircraft program was a prominent example. In 1903 the United States had been the first in flight, but by 1917 it lagged far behind the Europeans in military aircraft. Once the war began, however, the push was on. The Aircraft Production Board was established in May 1917, with Edward A. Deeds, a prominent industrialist, in charge. Preliminary investigations suggested that the United States should not attempt to build its own fighter planes because it lagged so far behind the Europeans. Instead, it should focus on supplying raw materialssuch as the fast-growth clear spruce that was ideal for building airframes -to the Europeans and on mass-producing an airplane engine that would allow the Allies to dominate the skies in the years to come. European aircraft engines such as the Rolls-Royce and the Hispano-Suiza were very good, but they were essentially handcrafted. The American experts were convinced they could mass-produce aircraft engines even though the precision required was much greater than for the automobile engines with which they were familiar. Deeds, now Colonel Deeds as the result of a military commission, soon developed plans for mass-producing a powerful new engine, the Liberty engine.
The initial reaction to the Liberty engine program was favorable. The economist John Maurice Clark responded to a September 1917 newspaper story about the program by declaring that it proved that "there are great unused possibilities for immediate advancement in private industries" 
(Clark 1917, 779)
Brandes (1997, 163)
The aircraft program had, critics charged, not only been a failure in terms of output, but it had also been corrupt. Several years before the war, while at National Cash Register, Deeds had been convicted of violating anti-trust laws, although the conviction was overturned. More to the point, his claim that turning over his stock holdings to his wife during the war had constituted a divestiture was thin, to say the least. The critics also charged that Deeds had steered contracts to his friends in Dayton, Ohio. The de Havillands, for example, were built by Delco, a Dayton company he had helped to organize; some were tested on Deeds's private airstrip. There were a number of investigations. Perhaps the most important was a Justice Department investigation headed by Charles Evans Hughes that recommended prosecution. Deeds, however, survived the criticisms and investigations. He had vociferous critics, but also staunch defenders. Isaac F. Marcosson's admiring biography, Colonel Deeds: Industrial Builder (1948), takes on the critics point by point. Yes, Deeds did steer some contracts to friends in Dayton, to take Marcosson's strongest point, but the "cronies," to use the modern term, included outstanding men such as Charles F. Kettering, who had developed the self-starter for the automobile among many other inventions, and Orville Wright who had developed the airplane itself.
If we take a step back from the personalities, we see two problems that in some measure afflicted all of the procurement programs. First was the lack of prewar planning and development. When it entered the war the United States simply did not have the military and industrial infrastructure to support, or the plans to guide, a major mobilization. The Aircraft Production Board, like other government procurement agencies, started from scratch. Second was the assumption that the war would last for several years after American entry. The Americans who developed the Liberty engine knew that it would take time to develop an engine that could be mass-produced. They assumed that the Liberty engine would help the Allies dominate the skies as the war dragged on into 1919 or even 1920. When the war ended quickly and unexpectedly the investment in mass-production had no time to pay off. Had they known that the war would end as soon as it did, they might have concentrated to a greater extent on simply producing Europeandesigned engines.

Although stories about individual programs and industries may give us a sense of what was going on, they may also mislead us about the overall picture. Figure

proportion after the war. After World War II things would be different.
(2) The production of non-war goods plummeted during the war.
Although the United States increased total production, it was also forced to reduce production of non-war goods. Again World War II would be somewhat different. In World War II the USA was able to expand total production to a greater extent, and therefore it did not need to reduce civilian production as much.

There is a still more fundamental question: should we include war output in GNP at all? Simon Kuznets wrestled with this question in National Product in 
Wartime (1945)
20
Kuznets argued, however, that in a total war, such as World War I or World War II, society had changed. Producing consumer goods was no longer the be all and end all of economic activity. There were now two end goals of economic activity: producing war goods and producing civilian goods. Consequently in an all-out war both war goods and non-war goods should be included in national product. Most economists, however, have not been willing to follow Kuznets's lead and exclude war goods from peacetime GNP. The official statistics that we rely on include government spending on war goods as part of GNP. Ultimately, how we treat war goods depends to some extent on the question we are trying to answer. If our focus is on the amount of demand for workers, a GNP estimate that includes war goods would be best; if our focus is on the satisfaction of consumer wants, a GNP estimate that excludes war goods would be best.
Is it right to describe World War I as an era of prosperity? After all, the figures show that the flow of goods that could produce human satisfaction declined in the war, declined in fact more than in 1920-1, the first and rather severe postwar recession. But prosperity is not simply a function of the flow of goods and services. The security of full employment, and the understanding that one's employment is contributing to an important national effort, may also contribute to the sense that the nation is prosperous.
Students of World War I are fortunate: the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace financed numerous scholarly studies of the war undertaken when memories were fresh and documents readily available. The task of estimating the costs of the war to the United States fell to John Maurice Clark, one of America's leading economists. The result, The Costs of the World War to the American People 
(1931)
Clark then made a series of adjustments to bring the total closer to the opportunity cost of the war. The bulk of the changes came from five sources.
1 Clark subtracted interest on the increase in the federal debt from the Treasury estimate because the interest was simply a transfer from taxpayers to bond holders that did not add or subtract from the resources available to the economy either during or after the war. 2 Clark also subtracted part of the deficit of the Railroad Administration. The railroads, as we noted, were nationalized during the war and operated at a loss which was made up by the federal government. This payment represented real resources -the labor, capital, and fuel used to run the railroads -but only part of it represented the cost of the war. Some of the government subsidy went for resources that were carrying civilian products, and this portion, Clark argued, should be deducted from the Treasury's estimate of the cost of the war. 3 Clark added an estimate of the difference between what soldiers drafted for the war could have earned in the private sector and what they actually were paid. The former is clearly a better estimate of the opportunity cost of the draftees.
4 The Treasury's estimates only covered expenditures made by the federal government. These constituted the overwhelming bulk of war costs. But state and local governments and private organizations such as the Red Cross, YMCA, and so on also made expenditures that contributed to the war effort. Clark estimated the total from these sources at $800-900 million, the latter something over 3 percent of the costs borne by the federal government. 5 Clark's largest addition to the Treasury's estimate was the value of US loans to its allies. The expenditures made as a result of these loans diverted resources from the production of civilian goods to the production of war goods just as did expenditures by the US government. But what about the interest and principal repayments made after the war? If these repayments were made as scheduled they could be deducted from other ongoing costs of the war. It was possible that the present value of the future interest and principal payments would equal the wartime value of the loans. But these obligations had been scaled back substantially in the 1920s. Under the Young Plan (1929-30) the United States' allies agreed to a reduction of reparation payments from Germany in exchange for a reduction in their debt to the US. And as Clark was writing, the Hoover plan for a temporary moratorium on international reparation and interest payments was under consideration. Clark strongly supported the Hoover moratorium and thought that a permanent moratorium would be correct.
And the whole situation increases the uncertainty as to whether it will prove practicable for us to collect the full amount of payments due us under the terms of the Young Plan. There can be no question that full collection would be an evil for the civilization of which our country forms a part. 
(Clark 1931, 280)
(Clark 1931, 280)
The cost of the war as a potential reduction in the costs of the war, we are looking at things, it should be noted, from the point of view of the United States.
From the point of view of the world economy, the loans are rightfully considered part of the opportunity cost of the war, and the subsequent interest and principal payments are transfers from taxpayers in Europe to Americans that don't in the first instance alter the total of resources available to the world economy. The addition of the war loans added nearly 28 percent to the Treasury's estimate of the costs of the war. Altogether, Clark estimated the cost of the war, as shown in Table

World War I expenditures for loans to the Allies and then, expenditures by federal emergency agencies and corporations. Expenditures by the navy came fourth. The contribution of state and local governments and private organizations, although important, added only marginal amounts to the total cost of the war. All of these numbers were first computed in nominal terms. Prices, it is true, were rising rapidly during the war and in the early postwar years, so a computation in constant dollars would produce a somewhat different total. But since much of the inflation came in 1919 and 1920 when expenditures were being cut back, the effect is not as great as one might imagine. In constant 1917 dollars the cost of the war would have been about $27 billion, rather than the $32 billion shown in Table

Legacies: a new role for the USA in the world economy
Americans would have liked their involvement with Europe to have ended when the war ended, but the peace treaty, the Treaty of Versailles, and the problem of German reparations that it createdand the problem of the debts owed to the United States by its wartime Allies which was entangled with the problem of reparations -would continue to vex them for a generation. These problems were closely tied to profound changes in the international financial system.
President Wilson sailed for Paris on December 4, 1918 to take part in the negotiations that would decide the fate of Germany. Ultimately, the decisions would be made by the "Big Four": Wilson, Georges Clemenceau (France), David Lloyd George (Great Britain), and Vittorio Orlando (Italy). The basic economic issues were straightforward: Britain (and the other members of the British empire), France, and Italy wanted cash, land, and other resources from Germany. 
22
23
For economists, thinking about the Treaty of Versailles begins with John Maynard Keynes. Keynes had served as an advisor to the British Treasury during the war and to the British delegation to the Paris peace conference. But he returned to England before the end of the conference to write The Economic Consequences of the Peace 
(1920 [1919]
Keynes's criticisms of the treaty covered a broad front, but there were two main points. First, the bill for reparations that the Allies were presenting to the Germans was simply too large. A major part of the bill was for separation payments for military personnel, pensions for veterans, and compensation and pensions for veterans and their families. Germany had agreed to the Armistice based on Wilson's promise that it would be required to pay for damages to civilians but not for military expenditures by the Allies or for punitive damages. As Keynes himself pointed out, a woman who loses her soldier-husband suffers just as much as a neighbor who loses her factory-worker husband. But Keynes argued that separation payments, pensions, and widows' compensation had been excluded by prior commitments to the Germans. The damage to the civilian economies where the war was actually fought, Keynes agreed, was horrendous. But the damage he argued, was confined to a surprisingly thin and stable band where trenches were dug and artillery fire exchanged. On either side of that band farmland and industrial capacity remained intact.
In practice it was impossible to persuade the Allies that Germany should not pay for veterans' benefits (mustering out pay, compensation, and pensions), which it was easy to see would be the largest source of postwar expenditures by governments resulting from the war. According to Niall 
Ferguson (2004, 264)
24
The second point was that Germany, according to Keynes, lacked the capacity to pay the reparations that were to be set by a separate commission. The final figure was about $56 billion in gold, about $550 billion at today's (2010) prices, a substantial sum for a country devastated by war. There was, to be more precise, an insurmountable problem that Keynes later referred to as the "transfer problem," a term that became standard among economists. In order to pay $56 billion in gold Germany would either have to sell assets or run a large balance of payments surplus. The treaty, however, stripped Germany of most of the assets, such as the merchant marine, that could be easily carried away. And sustaining a large balance of payments surplus over many years would be an impossible task. Policies would have to be put in place that significantly reduced imports or raised exports. But import reduction simply wasn't possible: a prostrated Germany would need to maintain or even increase imports of fertilizer, railroad rolling stock, and other forms of capital just to get back on its feet. There was a greater possibility of expanding exports. But it would not be easy, Keynes thought, to reorganize German industry to focus all its energies on export markets. And would producers in other countries allow themselves to be drowned by a flood of cheap German exports of steel, chemicals, and electrical products, or instead would they insist on tariff barriers that kept the flow of German goods to a trickle? Would newly empowered working classes stand idly by while jobs were lost to Germany, the deadly enemy of a few years past? In short it was simply not possible for Germany to make the transfers it was being called upon to make. Forcing Germany to pay would result in privation, and possibly in open debt repudiation and Bolshevism.
Keynes was later criticized for being excessively pessimistic about Germany's capacity to pay the reparations. The most famous criticism was E ´tienne Mantoux's The Carthaginian Peace; or The Economic Consequences of Mr. 
Keynes (1952
Keynes ( [1946]]

Mantoux's (1952
Mantoux's ( [1946]]
The huge transformation involved in the building up of the German war machine did not only mean "a radical change in the kind of work performed" [a quote from Keynes,] the goods thus produced were very literally and very materially "transferred" and "exported" abroad. Is it to be seriously maintained that even the vast increase of production of exportable peacetime goods implied by the Reparation scheme would have met with greater [Mantoux's italics] difficulties?
A long technical debate over the transfer problem followed which eventually generated contributions from many of the leading macro and international trade theorists of that generation including Paul Samuelson, Harry Johnson, Lloyd Metzler, Fritz Maclup, Bertil Ohlin, and many others. To go into the details of this debate would take us beyond the scope of the current discussion. Here we can note that Keynes's book also helped produce a belief in the United States that the treaty was too harsh and that the solution to European problems involved a reduction in the excessive claims of the victors.
In The Economic Consequences of the 
Peace (1920

But the depiction of the United States as unsympathetic to claims for relief, and blind to the consequences of debt and reparation payments for the international economic and political system, is overdrawn. President Coolidge is alleged to have said, "They hired the money didn't they?" But no one knows for sure that he did, and in fact the Americans made important efforts to deal with the problem of Allied war debts 
(Rhodes 1969)
World War I financier -further reduced and extended Germany's reparation obligations. To administer the reparations payments this plan also created the Bank for International Settlements, which still survives and plays a role in international bank supervision. But the assumptions that underpinned the Young Plan were dashed by the stock market crash and the onset of the Great Depression.
Once the Depression started President Hoover proposed a moratorium on all payments on Allied debts and on German reparations. It is unlikely that the moratorium had a major impact on the Allies, but it may have made a more expansionary policy possible in Germany, suggesting that had the reparation payments been cancelled earlier, the Depression in Germany would not have been as severe as it was 
(Fleisig 1972
The international gold standard reached the high tide of its prestige in the years before World War I. All of the major industrial countries -Britain, the United States, France, and Germany -and many other nations were on the gold standard, meaning that their currencies could be converted into fixed physical quantities of gold. The US dollar, for example, was the equivalent of about 0.05 ounces of gold (0.0484 to be more exact). The British pound, however, was heavier, about 0.25 ounces of gold (0.2353). Therefore the exchange rate stayed in the neighborhood of $4.86 to the pound. The great advantage of the gold standard was that it insured that exchange rates among nations on the standard would be fixed within narrow limits. Fixed exchange rates simplified and facilitated international trade. One could buy raw materials in one part of the world, process them in another, and sell the final product in a third, without worrying that a sudden change in exchange rates would undo all the careful calculations on which the ultimate profit was based. Long-term investment was facilitated by the fixed exchange rates of the gold standard, and by the ideology of the gold standard which held that nations had to be prepared to defend their exchange rates even when the costs of doing so were extremely high. Under the "rules of the gold standard game," as John Maynard Keynes styled it, with some irony, a nation that was running a balance of payments deficit, and hence was losing gold, was supposed to raise its domestic interest rate, tightening money and credit, and thus reversing the flow of gold. Investors in capital-rich Britain could buy stocks and bonds or make direct investments in the United States without having to worry that the value of interest payments or profits brought home in later years would be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates. Indeed, London became the center of a worldwide capital market that sent capital out in all directions to build railroads, dig mines, create telephone networks, and so on. Rapidly developing, relatively highincome nations such as Canada, the United States, and Australia were the major recipients, but the flow of capital reached less developed nations in Europe, Africa, Latin America, and Asia.
The gold standard provided another important dimension of economic stability: price stability. Under the gold standard increasing the money supply required an increase in the amount of gold backing the money supply. Normally, that meant mining gold domestically or acquiring gold from abroad by running a balance of payments deficit. Some monetary gold could be had by diverting gold from artistic or industrial uses, but that was a costly process. A money supply tied down by a "golden anchor" simply could not grow as fast as a pure fiat (paper) money system. Indeed, in the 1880s and early 1890s, the gold standard had produced deflation. The demand for monetary gold rose with the growth of economic activity, and as more and more countries adopted the gold standard. The demand for monetary gold exceeded the supply and as a result the real value of monetary goldthe nominal value divided by the price level -rose. Deflation did not stop economic growth in the United States or other countries on the gold standard: real GDP per capita continued to rise. But deflation produced considerable political tension. Farmers felt particularly 146
World War I aggrieved. Typically, farmers are debtors and debtors tend to suffer during deflations. Interest rates may adjust (fall) to reflect deflation, but the adjustment may be slow, and does nothing for those who entered into contracts before the deflation became evident. In the United States western farmers were especially upset, because many of them had purchased farms on the frontier based on optimistic projections of crops and prices. They were the heart of the populist movement that roiled American politics at the end of the nineteenth century.
After 1896, however, prices in countries tied to gold turned up. The reason was an increase in the supply of gold. New discoveries in the Klondike, Western Australia, and most importantly, South Africa (where the new cyanide process for extracting gold from gold ore could be used) added to the flow of gold and turned a mild deflation into a mild inflation. The change in the trend of prices quieted opposition to the gold standard. The years leading up to World War I were the golden years of the classical gold standard. In The Economic Consequences of the Peace, Keynes memorably described the functioning of the prewar gold standard.
The inhabitant of London could order by telephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the whole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or even trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy or information might recommend. He could secure forthwith, if he wished it, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate without passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the neighboring office of a bank for such supply of the precious metals as might seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign quarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs, bearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself greatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference. 
(Keynes 1920
(Keynes [1919], 11-12) ], 11-12)
After the war there was, naturally, considerable sentiment for reconstructing the gold standard, a system that had worked well in many ways before the war. But there were several obstacles. The main problem was the inflation. At higher price levels the world needed larger money supplies to finance transactions. Larger money supplies meant, under the gold standard, more gold to back the money supply, but the physical quantity of gold had not expanded in nearly the same proportion as the world money supply. Currencies would have to be devalued, that is made equivalent to smaller quantities of gold, or prices would have to be reduced through restrictive monetary policies, generally a painful process involving temporary periods of high unemployment. A uniform international devaluation would have been possible if prices had risen at the same rates in different countries. But they had not: traditional trading partners had often experienced very different rates of inflation during the war. If every country went back to gold at the prewar exchange rates, but at some common devaluation in terms of gold, some countries would find themselves with overvalued currencies and balance of payments deficits. Each country separately then had to decide the exchange rate at which it would return to the prewar gold standard.
The decisions to be made about the return to the gold standard, moreover, were compounded by the rise of political parties representing the working class. Under the gold standard maintenance of fixed exchange rates and stable prices had taken precedence over the use of monetary policy to stimulate economies in recession. Note that the famous description of the system by Keynes, quoted above, describes the world from the point of view of a middle-class Englishman. Keynes described the condition of the working class before the war in these terms: "The greater part of the population, it is true, worked hard and lived at a low standard of comfort, yet were, to all appearances, reasonably contented with this lot" 
(Keynes 1920
(Keynes [1919]]
Nevertheless, attempts were made to reestablish ties to gold during the 1920s. France went back to gold at an undervalued rate (a rate that made it attractive to holders of other currencies) and as a result enjoyed a balance of payments surplus during the 1920s. Indeed, France accumulated a substantial fraction of the world's monetary gold. Some observers at the time, and some subsequent scholars, have blamed France for accumulating so much gold that other countries were forced into restrictive monetary policies that contributed to the onset of the Great Depression 
(Irwin 2010)
(Wolcott 1990)
However, it seems unlikely there was any policy that Britain could have followed after the war that would have altered the fate of the pound, which had to surrender its top position as an international reserve currency to the US dollar 
(Eichengreen 2011
New York, moreover, supplanted London as the world's most important capital market. The United States had gone from being a debtor nation, the normal condition for a developing nation, to being a creditor nation, the normal condition for a mature economy. British citizens had surrendered a part of their overseas holdings of securities. Developing nations trying to raise capital had to go where the money was, and that was Wall Street. London did not, of course, disappear as a financial center. And there is no reason why it should have. After all, there are many examples, such as Switzerland, of small nations that have been successful in nurturing financial centers. Nevertheless, World War I had produced a shift in financial power from an exhausted Britain to the United States. The benefits of providing the 150
World War I world's reserve currency and housing its most important financial center were benefits to the United States and costs to Britain, not necessarily benefits to the world as a whole. The international financial system had been well served by Britain before the war, and US financial houses would make mistakes in the process of learning how to make international investments.
Veterans' benefits proved to be the largest long-term cost of the war and the source of the biggest political headaches. When the United States entered World War I the idea of a general pension for veterans was in bad repute because of the excesses (or so they were perceived) produced by the Civil War pension system. William  
(Glasson and Kinley 1918, vii)
In line with the idea of compensating the veteran for losses, and perhaps with the idea of avoiding the corruption inherent in
The veterans cash payments, the legislation emphasized several in-kind benefits:
(1) government-subsidized life insurance (or as it was more accurately termed "death compensation"), (2) vocational education, and (3) free medical and hospital care. The actual cash compensation for total disability, $360 per year, was, as a later President's Commission noted, "a low rate of compensation" (US President's Commission on Veterans 
' Pensions 1956, 28)
Shortly after World War I ended, veterans led by the American Legion, which had been formed in Paris after the end of the war, began campaigning for a cash bonus. 
26
(Bodenger 1971, 199-201)
The plan was popular, but it ran into trouble when the costs came into view: more than 3 million men would be eligible. In 1921 a bill for immediate payment of a bonus passed the House by a large majority. Before his election President Harding had said that he supported such a bill. However, once in office he was swayed by Secretary of the Treasury Mellon's argument that a bonus would damage the economy by undermining Mellon's policy of tax cutting and retrenchment. First Harding moved to the position that a bonus would be proper if there were new taxes, for example a national sales tax, to finance it. Eventually, he vetoed the bonus. Harding's policy was followed by his successors. In 1924 Coolidge vetoed another bill that would have paid an immediate bonus to the veterans. However, legislation was passed and signed that would pay a bonus, but not until 1945.

We must be the great arsenal of democracy. For us this is an emergency as serious as war itself. We must apply ourselves to our task with the same resolution, the same sense of urgency, the same spirit of patriotism and sacrifice as we would show were we at war. 
Fighting World War II would require the largest mobilization of resources in the history of the United States. The Civil War required a massive mobilization of the labor force -and in the end would leave more men dead (North and South together) -but World War II would require the mobilization of industry on an unprecedented scale. Although America's losses would be small compared with those of many other nations, they would nonetheless be traumatic for the United States. About 292,000 Americans died in battle or from wounds suffered in battle, and another 114,000 died from disease and injury, a total of 406,000; and about 672,000 suffered non-mortal wounds (see Appendix 2). Since the population of the United States has more than doubled since 1945, an equivalent loss today might, in a sense, be the equivalent of more than 800,000 deaths and 1.4 million non-mortal wounds. It was, clearly, a staggering price to pay for victory.
World War II was a product of the imperial ambitions of Germany, Japan, and Italy. In all three countries militarists believed that first power status ought to be the overriding national objective and could be achieved only by building an empire. Sources:

Versailles by defeating France, and provide the German people with room to expand by conquering the Soviet Union and destroying Communism. Japanese militarists, such as Hideki Tojo who would serve as Prime Minister during the war, wanted to achieve first power status by carving out an empire in Asia. Mussolini also had imperial ambitions, but they were limited initially to winning an empire in Africa by defeating less technologically advanced nations. For some people in these countries territorial expansion and first power status was an end in itself. For them it was worth making material sacrifices to bask in the reflected glory of a powerful and respected nation. For some government officials it meant new worlds to rule. The capture of territory, however, also promised material benefits for the average citizen, or so it was said. Hitler promised that by conquering territory in the east and driving off or killing its inhabitants he would win Lebensraum (living space) for the German people. Conquering territory, to put it simply, would make Germans -especially the German farmers who would replace the peasants of eastern Europe -richer. War, in short, promised empire, and empire promised glory and material gain.
There was an economics that underlay this worldview, but it was not the classical liberal economics of Adam Smith, John Stuart Mill, and Alfred Marshall that had long dominated the economics profession, but rather the older economics of the mercantilists. Classical liberals identified the maximization of consumer utility as the ultimate goal of economic activity and argued that free trade was the best means of achieving that end. An interventionist state, in their view, could do little to raise incomes, and much to lower them. Mercantilism, on the other hand, emphasized the important role the state could play in economic activity and the importance of military power.

"World War II ended the Great Depression." There is a good deal of truth in that commonplace, but it sometimes leads to the mistaken conclusion that Pearl Harbor was the beginning of the end of the Depression. But the recovery that began in June 1938 (according to the NBER chronology), long before Pearl Harbor, was what lifted the United States out of the Depression. Unemployment fell steadily, especially in 1940 and 1941. By the time the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the US economy was close to full employment. There were still discouraged workers and pockets of unemployment, so the United States was able to increase employment still further during the war, but the idea that the Depression lasted unabated until Pearl Harbor is a mistake. For many American industries, including the auto industry and other makers of consumer durables, 1941 was a banner year. Figure

The outbreak of the war in Europe set in motion three forces that ended the Depression. First, there were increases in US military spending, especially for the navy, after the war began in Europe. The public was uncertain about a large ground force, but it was willing to build ships to protect its shores and merchant fleet. Second, there were vastly improved profit expectations that encouraged private investment. The period of US The entry of the United States created an enormous fiscal challenge that was met in part by raising personal income taxes repeatedly. Figure

War II. For a family earning the equivalent of $50,000 in 2010 dollars, for example, the marginal rate went from 0.04 in 1939 to 0.29 in 1944.
Everything else in the twentieth century was second order by comparison. The smaller movements, however, are worth noting because they were the objects of intense political controversy. Rates increased in World War I, and were cut back in the 1920s, the famous cuts pushed through by Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon. However, they were not cut back to the pre-WWI level because some costs of the war, mainly interest payments on the debt and veterans' benefits, were ongoing. Rates were also raised in the early years of the Depression, reflecting fears about the growth of the federal debt, a fear shared by Republicans and many Democrats, including, at least initially, Financing the war President Roosevelt. World War II produced a major increase in rates, with only a small cutback after the war. The ongoing expenditures -for interest on the debt, for veterans' benefits, for military spending to counter the Communist threat, and to pay for New Deal programsargued against major cuts. Rates were raised again during the Korean War, but then cut afterwards. In the late 1960s and 1970s there were increases in marginal rates due to "bracket creep." Inflation caused nominal incomes to rise even when real (adjusted for inflation) incomes were unchanged. But higher nominal incomes forced people into higher tax brackets which subjected them to higher rates: you earned the same real income but had to pay more in taxes. To some extent, the inflation in these years can be blamed on the Vietnam War, so these bracket-creep increases can also be viewed as partly a product of war. Rates were brought down under President Ronald Reagan, as part of his effort to increase incentives to work and invest, and further cuts were made under President George W. Bush. For families earning $50,000 in 2010 dollars the marginal rate was somewhat lower than it had been at the end of World War II, but for families earning $100,000 there was little change from the rates reached in the wake of the war.
As in World War I the case for an excess profits tax was, first of all, a moral one. In a fireside chat delivered on May 26, 1940 President Roosevelt spelled out his loathing for wartime profits.
Our present emergency and a common sense of decency make it imperative that no new group of war millionaires shall come into being in this nation as a result of the struggles abroad. The American people will not relish the idea of any American citizen growing rich and fat in an emergency of blood and slaughter and human suffering.

Despite an impressive willingness to increase taxes, a substantial gap quickly opened up between federal government spending and revenues, as shown in Figure

As in World War I, the government and private sector engaged in a vigorous campaign to encourage the public to buy bonds 
(Samuel 1997)
(Samuel Financing the war 1997, 53)
To some extent the issue of bonds, as we have emphasized, also served to hide the full cost of the war. The individual buying bonds probably had a clear idea of the uses to which they would be put after the war. Taxpayers, on the other hand, may not have fully absorbed the fact that they would be paying higher taxes after the war simply to pay interest and principal on a larger national debt. John Maynard Keynes's proposal for war finance, in his famous tract How to Pay for the War (1940), had a similar goal, but would have achieved it through different means. Part of wages would have been "taxed" and paid into blocked accounts in savings banks. There they could be released en masse by the government in the event of an economic downturn, or could have been accessed by individuals in personal emergencies. Wartime and postwar inflation reduced the value of the bonds. But they still helped finance the postwar boom and ease the transition to a peacetime economy. The postwar economy thrived on sales of consumer durables and houses financed by assets accumulated during the war, partly in the form of war savings bonds.
In the end, however, the government was unwilling or unable to raise all of the funds needed for the war effort by raising taxes and borrowing from the public. As in the great wars that preceded it -the Revolution, the Civil War, and World War I -the government turned to the printing press. In the Revolutionary War and the Civil War, the term "printing press" was more than a useful metaphor; it was an accurate description of how it was done. The government hired companies that printed notes -the continental dollar and the greenback -that could circulate from hand to hand. These notes were used to pay the expenses of the government including the wages owed to soldiers. In World War I the process was more complex, although the metaphor was still meaningful. The Federal Reserve lent newly created reserves to banks. The banks then made loans to private individuals who used the loans to buy Liberty bonds. In World War II the Federal Reserve went into the bond market directly and purchased government debt. You and I cannot write checks upon ourselves and expect the world to take them, but the Federal Reserve can and did.
There was never any doubt that the Federal Reserve would use its power to create money to stabilize the government bond market. On the Monday following the Sunday attack on Pearl Harbor the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve released a statement which made clear the System's commitment to the war effort:
The System is prepared to use its powers to assure that an ample supply of funds is available at all times for financing the war effort and to exert its influence toward maintaining conditions in the United States Government security market that are satisfactory from the standpoint of the Government's requirements. 
(Chandler 1949, 407)

To explain the latter figures, let me recall, if I may, the reason for distinguishing two types of money creation. When the Federal Reserve acquired and held government bonds (direct money creation) few would disagree with the conclusion that the money that ends up in the Federal Treasury came from the printing press and not from private savings. But this is only part of the story. When the recipients of government spending deposited their payments, the banks found themselves with more reserves. The increase in reserves in turn produced a multiple increase in bank lending. Suppose that the borrowers used the proceeds of the loans to purchase government bonds for their portfolios. In that case we can again see that the money that ends up in the US Treasury was really created by the banks -really came from the printing press. To estimate the amount of this sort of finance, however, is difficult. The assumption in Table

Things did recover to an extent, but by the end of the decade, the economy, as Table 
6
But things changed dramatically when the USA entered the war. The public no longer paid attention to either the deficit, a major political issue in the 1930s, or monetary policy. The deficit soared to 23 percent of GNP, the stock of money more than doubled, and unemployment, already close at the time of Pearl Harbor to peacetime norms, fell to 1.2 percent in 1944, the lowest rate on record. So which factor propelled the United States out of the Depression and produced the super low rates of unemployment during the war itself: large deficits or a big increase in the stock of money? The wartime experience can't answer the question. Both occurred. Indeed, the usual distinction between fiscal policy and monetary policy is problematic in a war economy in which one branch of the federal government, the US Treasury, is making large expenditures and financing them by selling government bonds at a fixed price to another branch of the government, the Federal Reserve.
Although the combined force of fiscal policy and monetary policy during the war was unprecedented, it is not sufficient to provide a Source:

The unemployment rate that prevailed during the war is evidently not comparable to unemployment rates in peacetime when these men are still in the labor force. There was, moreover, a unique set of expectations that prevailed during the war. Many workers must have expected a return to the Great Depression after the war. World War II was a unique opportunity to learn new skills and save money that would be valuable after the war, savings that would rise in real terms if there was another run of deflation. Discrimination against women and minorities also decreased during the war 
(Goldin 1991;
Collins 2001)
Given the enormous inflationary pressures created by expansionary monetary and fiscal policies it is no surprise that prices began to rise even before Pearl Harbor. The United States then turned to wage, price, and production controls to restrain price increases and to allocate resources. Controls had been used, as we have seen, in World War I and were being used in the countries already at war. Controls, moreover, had gained considerable intellectual stature. Some of the glory of the US victory in World War I had rubbed off on controls, as on most policies adopted during the war. Indeed, a number of people involved in World War I controls, such as the economist Frank W. 
Taussig (1919)
Baruch (1936)
Price controls moved through a series of phases during World War II. These phases and the associated rates of inflation are shown in Table 
6
6
If prices were held down in one sector, what was to prevent demand from shifting to the uncontrolled sector? And if prices in the uncontrolled sector rose faster than prices in the controlled sector, wouldn't that send exactly the wrong signal? Wouldn't it encourage entrepreneurs to move resources from the production of goods in the controlled sector, goods which had been selected for control because of their importance to the economy and to the war effort, to the production of goods in the uncontrolled sector, goods which had been left uncontrolled because they were unimportant? A consensus quickly formed among the administrators of controls that across-the-board controls were needed. The General Maximum Price Regulation -affectionately known as General Max -attempted just that. Firms were ordered to set the price of each item they sold based on the price of that item in a base period with an allowance for subsequent cost increases. The rate of inflation subsided somewhat during the General Max period, but new problems emerged. Labor was now subject to wage control, and workers felt that the rates of inflation that prevailed under General Max were reducing their standard of living. And the decision to leave the computation of prices in the hands of private firms opened the door to some "creative accounting." For example, if a firm had not sold an item during the base period, it was instructed to use the price at which the item had been sold by a competitor. The temptation was to choose the highest price at which the good had been sold by any firm. A clothing store selling a particular shirt on Main Street could look to the price at which the shirt had been sold in the base period on New York's Fifth Avenue.
In April 1943, then, a new system was introduced. Now most prices and wages would be frozen, and the prices would be set by the Office of Price Administration. It was called "dollar and cents" pricing. The Office of Price Administration would simply set the price of shirts and ties, hammers and nails, tomato soup, and other items affecting the Wage, price, and production controls cost of living, and it was up to the sellers to obey or face the penalties. President Roosevelt called his executive order a "hold-the-line order:" To hold the line we cannot tolerate further increases in prices affecting the cost of living or further increases in general wage or salary rates except where clearly necessary to correct substandard living conditions. The only way to hold the line is to stop trying to find justifications for not holding it here or not holding it there. 
(New York Times, April 10, 1943, 16)

Measured unemployment, moreover, averaged 1.8 percent during this phase (NBER Macrohistory Database, series 08922).

(Galbraith 1981, 170-5)
(Galbraith 1952)
There were, however, some features of the wartime utopia that might give one pause when thinking about adopting it as a permanent model for a peacetime economy. For one thing, there was the possible, although hard to measure, role of patriotism. Some people probably complied with price and ration controls because they thought it was their patriotic duty to do so. Is this what motivated the technocrats at the large corporations, who Galbraith thought had complied so readily with wartime controls? And there were several problems in civilian markets that make the comparison of prices in controlled markets with prices in free markets problematic. 
11
How much these problems would have grown had controls been continued into the postwar period is hard to know because once the war ended, controls unraveled. The main problem was strikes. There had been few strikes during the war: labor had agreed to a no-strike pledge and employers had agreed to no lockouts. Although there were a few strikes in the coalfields, for the most part these pledges were adhered to, a good example of how patriotism had encouraged compliance with controls. But as a practical matter these pledges were "for the duration." Once the war was over many union leaders felt that their workers deserved wage increases, in part because the hidden price increases discussed above had depressed real wages. There was a wave of strikes, and now a peculiar dynamic took hold. Employers were in a position to say "we are willing to grant the union a wage increase that will meet their demands and end the strike, but of course, the Office of Price Administration must grant us a commensurate price increase." The Office of Price Administration did not want to make these exceptions to the overall price freeze. But when the public saw the supply of goods interrupted by strikes that the Office of Price Administration could end, the pressure to make exceptions became overwhelming. In effect strikes that on the surface appeared to be classic confrontations between labor and capital had in fact become collaborations between labor and capital working against the government agencies controlling wages and prices. As more and more exceptions were made, the system became untenable.
Once controls were removed, there was a burst of inflation. As shown in Table 
6
The Phony War ended in May and June 1940 with the successful German attack on Belgium and France. The Roosevelt administration then began to gear up for the war by creating a plethora of new federal agencies to control the war economy. The models were the New Deal and World War I. In this case, unlike in World War I, the United States would not wait until war was declared to take action. On April 11, 1940, even before the German advance on France and Belgium, Roosevelt created the Office of Price Administration and Civilian Supply to limit inflation and regulate civilian supplies. On May 25, he created the Office of Emergency Management to provide him with information and advice. On May 28 he created the Petroleum Coordinator for National Defense to oversee the production and distribution of petroleum. On June 28 he created the Rubber Reserve Company to buy natural, synthetic, and scrap rubber, and the Metals Reserve Company to buy metals and subsidize their production. On August 29 he created the Defense Plant Corporation to finance war industries, and on September 16 he created the Selective Service System to draft men for military service. More agencies were created in 1941. Most importantly, on August 28, 1941 Roosevelt reorganized the basic control apparatus by creating two agencies: the Office of Price Administration to set prices and the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board to determine production priorities.
All this was before Pearl Harbor. After Pearl Harbor the system was reorganized. On January 12, 1942 Roosevelt created the National War Labor Board to oversee wage rates and labor supply, and on January 16 he replaced the Supply Priorities and Allocation Board with the War Production Board which would be the primary agency overseeing munitions procurement and production during the remainder of the war. Table

This stream of new agencies, many of them created before Pearl Harbor, must have struck many observers, including those in Germany and Japan, as preparation for war. The institution of a military draft in September 1940 was a clear signal. I have excluded from the table many joint domestic and international committees, but the formation of these committees must also have added to the expectation that the United States was going to war. On June 17, 1941, for example, the United States and Canada (which had already entered the war) formed a joint economic committee to, in the words of the US Bureau of the Budget's The United States at

Between the world wars, Bernard Baruch, who enjoyed immense prestige based on his leadership of the War Industries Board in World War I, Notes: In most cases when an agency was terminated, some residual activities and personnel were transferred to other agencies. For that reason, the decision on whether an agency survived often involved a judgment call. In 1941, twenty-eight agencies were created prior to Pearl Harbor.

Baruch.
In May 1940 Roosevelt established the National Defense Advisory Commission. More representative of the economy, it included William S. Knudsen, President of General Motors, Sidney Hillman, of the United Ladies Garment Workers, and representatives of other interest groups. Its purpose was to expedite the awarding of contracts for munitions and to plan future policies. The members of the Commission, although nominally advisors, quickly built up staffs that became the nuclei of succeeding agencies. The deteriorating situation in Europe increased the pressure on Roosevelt to create a more powerful agency. In November 1940 he created the Office of Production Management, which began operations in January 1941, taking over the functions and personnel of the National Defense Advisory Committee. Roosevelt stoutly resisted pressures to appoint a single executive to head the agency, insisting that there was no need for a "Poobah, Czar, or Akoond of Swat." Instead he appointed Knudsen as Director-General and Hillman as Associate Director-Generalinsisting that the question of who was the head man was irrelevant. Putting someone from either the management side or the labor side in a position to become the boss of the war economy would have created political headaches.
The most important problem that the new agency faced was the priority system

In 1942 Ferdinand Eberstadt, an investment banker during peacetime with considerable experience in government, was brought to the War Production Board from the Army-Navy Munitions Board. He immediately went to work on what would become the final plan for allocating scarce resources: the Controlled Materials Plan (CMP). I will discuss the CMP in detail below, but first I should note that as a result of its apparent success Eberstadt emerged as a hero of the mobilization. In most retellings of the war mobilization he was the man who saved the day by installing a system of central planning, but did not get the promotion to head of the War Production Board that he deserved because of the conniving of Nelson. This narrative is similar in some respects to the standard narrative of German war production. Mobilization went slowly at the start of the war under armaments minister Fritz Todt. But when Todt died in a plane crash in February 1942 and was replaced by Albert Speer things turned around. Speer centralized authority over production and achieved miracles; under Speer production of munitions continued to rise despite massive bombing. The "great man" theory of mobilization can also be seen in the story of Max Aitken, Lord Beaverbrook, who has been credited with accelerating aircraft production in Britain. In the Soviet Union the successful evacuation of industry from the front after the German attack has been attributed to the formation of powerful government agencies: the State Defense Committee under Stalin, and the Council for Evacuation, initially under Lagar Kaganovich 
(Lieberman 1983)
While Eberstadt is the hero in most narratives of the mobilization, Robert R. Nathan, an economist who served as chair of the War Production Board's planning committee, garnered praise for his supporting role. He is said to have pressed for an early end to the production of consumer durables, especially refrigerators. More generally he is credited with cutting through red tape and constantly pushing subordinates at the War Production Board to maximize production. A colorful man, it is said that he liked to drive around Washington on Sundays in a red Pontiac convertible and heckle slow-moving trucks, presumably to speed up the war effort (obituary, New York Times, September 10, 2001).
The Controlled Materials Plan, although complicated in detail, was essentially a system for rationing three important raw materials: steel, copper, and aluminum. The system, although modified over time, went ahead for the most part according to an outline issued in November 1942 when the plan was announced (US War Production Board 1942). The idea was relatively straightforward, at least in comparison with earlier plans. (1) Each "claimant agency" was to submit estimates of its requirements for controlled materials to the War Production Board. Initially, there were seven claimant agencies: the War Department, Navy, Maritime Commission, Aircraft Scheduling Unit, Office of Lend-Lease Administration, Board of Economic Warfare, and the Office of Civilian Supplies. (2) The Board would then evaluate these estimates in the light of its estimates of existing supplies. (3) The Requirements Committee of the Board would then decide on monthly allotments of controlled materials for each of the claimant agencies. (4) The claimant agencies would then be notified of their allotments, to which they would have to adjust their programs.
(5) Each claimant agency would then divide its allotments among its major contractors. Each sub-allotment would be accompanied by an allotment number, in effect a ration ticket, showing the program and month. (6) These allotment numbers would then move from contractors to subcontractors, accompanying orders for raw materials, eventually reaching the mills where they would be honored. ( 
7
The plan was, as the preceding history should make clear, a retreat from the attempts at micromanaging production that preceded it. This plan was restricted to three materials, steel, copper, and aluminum; the Production Requirements Plan, by way of contrast, tried to control a much longer list of materials, including a wide range of chemicals. The Controlled Materials Plan left decisions about how much major contractors would get to the claimant agencies, and how much subcontractors would get to the major contractors; the Production Requirements Plan centralized these decisions in the War Production Board. In principle, moreover, the Controlled Materials Plan specifically excluded attempts to expedite the supply of controlled materials to individual projects 
(Novick, Anshen, and Truppner 1949, 170)
A basic problem in the mobilization -the cause of unfinished projects, hoarding, bribing of suppliers, and so on -was believed to be the excessive demands placed on the economy by the huge number of contracts being issued by the military. This is what was known as the "feasibility problem." It may have been first identified in a March 1942 memo written by Simon Kuznets 
(Edelstein 2001
188
(1951,
316)
Janeway's enthusiasm carried along generations of historians. But his "proof" that the plan produced a jump in munitions production is flawed. Figure 
6
Kuznets (1949, 90)
Janeway is right that annual production in 1943 was much higher than in 1942, but when we look at the quarterly estimates it is clear that production of munitions was already leveling off by the time the CMP went into effect. Indeed, production of raw materials was also peaking by the time the CMP was put in place because of cutbacks in procurement. Steel production peaked in March 1944, eight months after the plan became mandatory; aluminum production peaked in October 1943, only three months after it became mandatory; and copper production peaked in June 1943, while the plan was being put in place 
(Dewhurst and Twentieth Century Fund 1947, 778)
(Hunter and Hogan 1950, 78)
During the time that the Controlled Materials Plan was being put in place, tensions between Nelson and Eberstadt, and more fundamentally between Nelson and the military, had been growing 
(Koistinen 2004, 334)
(Nelson 1946, 383-4
If the activities of the War Production Board (in particular the oftenheralded Controlled Materials Plan) and other government agencies do not explain the success of the mobilization, what does? I would suggest that historians have been using the wrong metaphor. They have viewed the war economy as an example of central planning. William H. McNeill is typical. After taking note of the early "quarrels over the allocation of scarce resources and raw materials" 
(McNeill 1982, 355)
Production tripled between 1941 and
1943.
Janeway (1951, 172)
Bret Harte, who won fame for his stories about the gold rush ("The Luck of Roaring Camp"), would have recognized the scene. Although established firms had obvious advantages, it was often outsiders who were the first to take advantage of new opportunities. Richard C. Reynolds, for example, used his political connections to secure a Reconstruction Finance Corporation loan and enter aluminum refining 
(Smith 1988, 217)
(Adams 1997)
(Rhode 2004
In 1849 the government's policy of a fixed price for gold created and sustained the boom; in 1942 it was the government's willingness to purchase munitions production that created and sustained the boom. There was even a parallel in the way the gold rush of 1849 and that of 1942 were financed. Gold production was financed ultimately by increases in the demand for money and by a tax on cash balances as inflation eroded the real value of existing money holdings. Similarly, munitions production was financed partly by selling bonds to the Federal Reserve, creating new money that satisfied increased demands for money at current prices and produced inflation. A gold rush was not the only way of producing gold in California in 1849. One can imagine, for the sake of argument, gold being produced by federal employees in nationalized mines, or by tightly regulated and coordinated private firms. And one can imagine munitions being produced in 1942 in nationalized arsenals or by tightly regulated and coordinated private firms. But this was not the way it was done in 1849 -or in 1942. Although the actions of the War Production Board, the Office of Price Administration, and many other government agencies did not cause or determine the shape of the boom in munitions production, they did help solve problems, and may have made a positive overall contribution. People picked up and moved to war production centers during the war because there was money to be made -in this respect the war boom was like a nineteenth-century gold rush. In the nineteenth century the gold miners were on their own, but during the war there were various agencies working on labor problems and at least some of their programs made positive contributions. George Q. 
Flynn (1979, 69)
The best way to obtain a broad-brush picture of the way economic forces influenced the war is through the statistics on annual war production. Table

First, both Germany and Japan spent more on arms during the second half of the 1930s than did the United States. Military leaders in Germany and Japan realized that if they hoped to alter the world's international political order by force they had to win quick victories based on surprise, careful planning, and a cache of arms built up before the war. Germany and Japan could not win a war of attrition
The course of the war against an alliance that included the United States; their economies were simply too small. Creating a temporary superiority in munitions was a plausible strategy because opposition to military spending in the United States, Britain, and France was strong. Many Americans believed that their country's policy of remaining aloof from European wars had served it well in the nineteenth century -the Atlantic had provided nearly free security -and that the decision to become involved in World War I had cost America dearly. In Britain the threat of German expansionism was seen more clearly than in the United States, but in that country as well as in the United States, opposition to military spending prevented it from keeping pace with the Germans.

Goldsmith (1946, 75)
Harrison (1998, 1-42)

Second, the Soviet Union, although it had not stockpiled as many munitions in the 1930s as Germany, had nonetheless been far more active than the United States or Britain. In 1939 the Soviet Union produced more military aircraft than Germany; in 1940, nearly as many; and in 1941, substantially more. The total expenditure figures tell a similar story. In 1941 through 1943, production of war goods in the Soviet Union, despite the German attack, exceeded production in Germany. To be sure, there are many uncertainties in these statistics, but the overall success of the Soviet munitions program cannot be doubted. This is well known now, but because of the secrecy of Stalin's regime, the Germans underestimated the quantity of munitions possessed by the Soviets. The difficult time that the Soviet Union had in its war with 
Finland (1939-40)
Third, in the long run the German and Japanese gambles failed. German forces overwhelmed France in a blitzkrieg (lightning war) and drove British forces off the continent. In June 1941 Germany launched a massive attack on the Soviet Union. Initially, the Germans experienced the same sort of success that they had enjoyed against France, but their attack stalled before Moscow. Japan too enjoyed a series of initial successes. Pearl Harbor was successfully attacked in December 1941; Manila, the most important urban area in the Philippines, was captured in January 1942; and the last remaining forces in the Philippines, on the Bataan peninsula, surrendered in April. But in June 1942 the Japanese navy suffered a major defeat at Midway. Blitzkrieg victories by the Axis had given way to a war of attrition. Tables 6.5 and 6.6 show how little time Germany and Japan had to make their blitzkrieg strategies work. In 1939 Germany produced more aircraft than the United States, and Japan about three-quarters as many. But in 1940, with the United States getting its war production in gear, both fell far behind. In 1942, the first year of US involvement in the war, the United States produced more military aircraft than Germany, Italy, and Japan combined. The more comprehensive spending figures in Table 
6
The course of the war advantage continued unabated into 1943 and 1944. Indeed by 1944 the Americans were beginning to talk about cutbacks in spending and the problem of disposing of surpluses. Winning the war still required fighting and dying, and it was always possible that the Allies might decide that the price of victory was too high and give up the fight, but it was clear that in the end they could win the war of attrition with the Axis.
Fourth, despite an unrelenting air bombardment and a fearsome naval blockade, Germany and Japan managed to increase production until very near the end of the war. Military aircraft (Table

The Pacific War was the first, and perhaps the last, in which the aircraft carrier reigned supreme. Figure

To be sure, carrier-based planes were not the whole story. There were also conventional naval vessels to consider: battleships, cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and so on. Here, however, the US advantage was even greater. Japan's naval construction had been limited by the naval agreements of the 1920s. Indeed, this was one source of humiliation for the Japanese that could be reversed with victories over Britain and the United States. It is doubtful, however, that even in the absence of the treaties the United States would have allowed Japan to get very close in conventional naval strength. Money would have been found to

Ellis (1993, 293-4)
match Japan battleship for battleship. The possibility that aircraft, especially carrier-based aircraft, were more potent than traditional ships could give some solace to the Japanese. Their near equality in carrier-based planes might bring them close to the Americans in overall strength, despite their gap in terms of traditional ships. And the carrier fleet could be supplemented with island airbases. Occupying an island and building an airbase was like building (at relatively low cost) a giant (but immobile) aircraft carrier. Here then was what would seem to be the most rational account of Japan's strategy 
(Toland 1970;
Overy 2010

(Ellis 1993, 293-4)
Although the Japanese continued to launch new carriers, they were not able to make up for battle losses, let alone keep pace with the Americans who were offsetting losses and then adding to their fleet. Indeed, as Figure

To its defenders strategic bombing was an unfortunate but necessary measure needed to defeat Hitler and Tojo; to its critics strategic bombing was a barbarism, ineffective and immoral. The ethical debate centered on strategic rather than tactical bombing. Tactical bombing targets the enemy on the battlefield. The airplane is used as a form of artillery, throwing heavy shells and explosives at the enemy; or as a form of cavalry moving rapidly behind enemy lines, observing the disposition of enemy forces and attacking targets of opportunity. Strategic bombing, on the other hand, targets the enemy's economy. The purpose is to destroy the enemy's ability and will to fight by destroying factories, farms, railroads, oil refineries, and so on -and perhaps the people who work in them. The idea of destroying the enemy's economy and will to fight has been a part of warfare since ancient times. William Tecumseh Sherman's march to the sea was a classic American example as were many campaigns waged against Native Americans in which villages and crops were burned. Naval blockades often served a similar purpose. The airplane simply offered a new means for carrying out a time-honored strategy.
When the war began, the case for strategic bombing was largely theoretical. To many military observers it was self-evident that "the bombers would always get through" and that the destruction they would bring would devastate the enemy both materially and spiritually. General Giulio Douhet, an Italian air power theorist, is often cited as the author of this view and the father of strategic bombing 
(Brodie 1955)
(Davis and Engerman 2006, chapter 5, 159-238)
The Spanish Civil War (1936-9) provided the best evidence about the potential effect of bombing. It was a large-scale conflict and the first in which aircraft played a major role. Both sides enlisted outside support.
Stalin supplied the leftist government, whose supporters were known as the Loyalists, with air power, while Hitler and Mussolini supplied the insurgents under Francisco Franco, known as the Nationalists. Strategic bombing, it must be said, did not win a great reputation in Spain. Picasso's masterpiece Guernica, which depicts the bombing of the Basque city of that name by the Germans on April 26, 1937, illustrates the ultimate horror of a modern air war. But there is little evidence that this or other examples of the bombing of cities in Spain destroyed production or morale as the advocates of strategic bombing had predicted. The bombing of Barcelona in March 1938, ordered by Mussolini on the theory that it would undermine civilian morale, was, according to 
Corum (1998, 329)
For the Germans, Italians, and Soviets, and to some degree the French, the lesson learned in the Spanish Civil War was that strategic bombing was ineffective -the damage done to productive facilities was limited and civilian resolve might actually be strengthened -but that tactical bombing, based on close coordination of the air forces with ground forces, paid huge dividends. The Germans tried out the Junkers Ju-87 dive bomber -the brainchild of Colonel Ernst Udet who had been an airplane stunt rider in the 1920s -and found it to be a devastating weapon, at least in Udet's estimation

The United States and Britain allocated considerable resources to strategic bombing. According to 
Overy (1996, 128)
200
Werrell (1986, 707)
During the Korean War, conducted after it had become a separate service, the air force absorbed about 20 percent of all military spending, so Werrell's figure seems reasonable. Of course, only part of the expenditure by the air force during World War II was for strategic bombing: the US air forces also engaged in tactical bombing, reconnaissance, transport, and so on. 
Overy (1996, 128)
The initial idea when considering how to conduct strategic bombing was to aim at "sensitive points" in the German and Japanese economies. If one could find a material that was a crucial input in a wide range of industrial processes, but produced in few places, one could cripple the enemy's war machine by concentrated bombing of those points. The Allied air attacks on the German ball-bearing industry at Schweinfurt and Regensburg in the late summer and fall of 1943 are a good example of this idea in operation. Relying on attacks against sensitive points, however, proved difficult, especially for the British. The Germans protected such sensitive points with fighters and rings of anti-aircraft artillery, and exacted heavy tolls on the British, who began the war with slow-moving bombers and without fighters that could protect them all the way to their targets. The Germans, moreover, dispersed munitions factories, built them out of the range of Allied bombers and fighters, and constructed them underground. For the British, the realization that striking at sensitive points was too costly came early. The only feasible way to use their air force, it seemed, was to bomb at night and to use area bombing. On May 7, 1941 the British cabinet formally agreed to a plan to destroy fiftyeight of Germany's largest towns and cities 
(Tooze 2007, 510)
The course of the war it possible to hit enemy targets precisely, continued daylight bombing and the attempt to strike at sensitive points. It was a pragmatic decision, not an ethical one. The Americans saw daylight bombing as the best way to use their bombers. And they understood and approved of the idea of a one-two punch: Americans bombing by day and the British bombing by night.
How effective was strategic bombing in World War II? Was it worth the cost in men and machines? As the war was coming to an end, President Roosevelt established the United States Strategic Bombing
Behind the philosophy of seeking sensitive points was the idea that resources must be combined in fixed proportions. It assumed, to use the economic term, a fixed-coefficient production function. In fact, however, the Germans found numerous ways to substitute for materials affected by bombing. The formula for making hardened steel, for example, was changed to economize on alloys in short supply, such as tungsten, and the technique of quenching hot steel to make it harder was used.
When substitutions are possible, a better model of the economy is a production function that allows for substitution among forms of capital and among forms of labor, and for substitutions between capital and labor. This sort of aggregate production has become standard for economists studying peacetime economies, but the implications for strategic bombing are sobering. Suppose the aggregate production function for Germany was Cobb-Douglas: Q ¼ AK (1Àa) L a , where Q is total output, A is an index of total productivity, K is total capital (including land), a is the share of labor income in total income output, and L is total labor. Then, to reduce aggregate German output by 10 percent, the Allies would have to destroy 10 percent of the German capital stock and 10 percent of the labor force. Since the Germans could maintain production by shifting capital and labor from the production of civilian goods to the production of war goods and by exploiting capital, labor and raw materials from conquered territories, the Allies would have to destroy far more than 10 percent of the total capital and labor in Germany to reduce output of German munitions by 10 percent. Strategic bombing, in other words, would have to be horrific to achieve its ends.
World War II Survey to investigate the effects of the bombing. 
14
A factory building might be completely destroyed, leading US aircrews, and bureaucrats relying on their reports, to conclude that the factory had been destroyed, while the equipment housed inside had survived with repairable damage. But the survey concluded that some attacks had been effective. Attacks on oil refineries toward the end of the war produced a severe fuel shortage that hampered German military operations. John Kenneth Galbraith, who would emerge as one of the most prominent American economists of the postwar era and win public recognition as part of President Kennedy's "brain trust," was one of the civilian directors of the Bombing Survey. He arrived at this position by a circuitous route. At the start of the war he was recruited from Harvard to the Office of Price Administration, where he served as deputy director. He was forced to resign when Republicans pushed through legislation requiring price controllers to have five years of experience in business. He then moved to Fortune magazine and from there to the Bombing Survey. To Galbraith, the ultimate lesson of the Strategic Bombing Survey was that strategic bombing did not work; it was barbarism to no purpose. Bombing, Galbraith maintained, had failed to reduce German munitions production or German morale. Indeed, production had increased well into 1944.
The Allied attack in July 1943 on Hamburg, Germany's second city, a port and manufacturing center, was a classic lesson in the problematic value of strategic bombing. Bombing created a firestorm, a tornado of super-heated air, which multiplied the destruction. The tornado, it was said, literally sucked its victims from the streets of Hamburg. It is estimated that 45,000 people died, 37,000 were injured, and 1 million were made homeless 
(Lowe 2007, 294)
(Lowe 2007, 295)
The Allies followed up the success, as they saw it, of the attack on Hamburg with attacks on other cities with the intention of creating firestorms by using incendiary bombs. Particularly devastating were the attacks on Dresden in Germany and on Tokyo and many other cities in Japan. The attacks on Dresden in February 1945 left perhaps 135,000 dead

Bombing of rail lines and synthetic oil plants in Europe had been somewhat effective, Galbraith and the Bombing Survey conceded, but had come rather late in the day. For the most part, bombing had been a costly failure. Table

Production of tanks and self-propelled guns increased from 12,063 to 19,002 in these years, and aircraft production increased from 25,527 to 39,807. Oil production, however, did fall. To be sure, one could argue that production of munitions would have been still higher in the absence of the bombing campaign. But the postwar revelation of German production achievements in the face of Allied bombing came as a shock to many Americans. My former colleague Sidney Ratner, an economic historian who had been involved in target selection during the war, told me that he cried when he read the report of the Strategic Bombing Survey. He knew, of course, that many American flyers had died on missions that he had supported -casualty rates among the bombing crews were extraordinarily high -but he thought that they had died bringing German production to a standstill. Learning that production had been increasing despite the bombing was devastating. Figure

World War II are somewhat misrepresented by the term "management" with its connotation of MBAs applying the latest academic theories. The Germans were desperate, and we now know they were willing to use any means, however horrific, to increase production. Slave laborers, including inmates from Auschwitz, were worked to death to maximize production in Germany's final, futile push 
(Tooze 2007, 630-1)
One early and important challenge to Galbraith's view that strategic bombing had been ineffective came from Walt W. Rostow. Like Galbraith, Rostow could claim to be an expert on strategic bombing: in World War II he had served in the Enemies Objectives Unit of the Office of Strategic Services, the forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency.

Although it may not have been relevant to the Vietnam War, at least one part of Rostow's argument, that strategic bombing worked by forcing German planes into the air where they were destroyed, thus giving the Allies air superiority and making possible the advance of Allied armies, has won support from subsequent students of the war

World War II Union. But the picture soon changed. Despite ramping up their production of aircraft, the Germans were unable to increase the size of their air force on the eastern front, while the Soviet air force kept expanding. The Luftwaffe was fighting on too many fronts and losing too many planes and pilots. By July 1943, when the great Battle of Kursk began, the Soviets enjoyed a marked numerical air superiority.
Even though the Allied bombing policy had, in Rostow's view, been successful in World War II, he maintained that the Allies had made mistakes. In the months before D Day they had stressed attacks on railroad marshalling yards. Rostow believed that if more attacks had been carried out against bridges and oil refineries, as he and some of his colleagues had recommended, the war could have been shortened 
(Rostow 2003, 45-50)
George Santayana was right to claim that "those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." But the lessons of history are seldom clear. For Galbraith, who opposed the bombing campaigns undertaken by the United States in the Vietnam War, the important points to remember about strategic bombing in World War II were that bombing had failed to prevent the Germans from significantly increasing arms production and it had failed to undermine the support of German civilians for the war effort. For Rostow, an architect of the bombing campaigns in Vietnam, the important points to remember were that bombing had helped to win the war, and that it would have won the war sooner if only Eisenhower had listened to the advice from the academics -including, of course, Rostow.
Strategic bombing, perhaps more than any other aspect of the war, raises troubling moral issues. If the attacks on German production facilities were ineffective in reducing German munitions production, and reducing munitions production was the whole point, then the huge loss of civilian life that occurred as a result of strategic bombing -600,000 people died and 800,000 suffered non-mortal wounds 
(Hewitt 1983, 263;
Werrell 1986, 709
In some ways the change in attitudes toward strategic bombing is understandable. We can look back and see that hatred toward Germany and Japan was deliberately fostered. We can see that the advocates of strategic bombing claimed major successes without sound evidence. What seemed obvious at the time, that bombing would destroy the ability and will of Germany to fight, turned out to be wrong. But we can also question how large the opposition to bombing would have been if more accurate estimates of its effectiveness had been available at the time. History shows that when people feel fundamentally threatened, they fight murderously. It is possible that even if the lightness of the destruction of industrial damage and the heaviness of the loss of civilian casualties had been known, the public would have overwhelmingly supported strategic bombing. The fate of civilians in times of war was an old story even in Adam Smith's day. Recall his description of how civilians are treated in wartime in his Theory of Moral Sentiments 
(Smith 1976
(Smith [1759]]
World War II
The morality of bombing becomes even more problematic when we turn to the ultimate form of strategic bombing: the atomic bomb.
By the late 1930s a number of scientists had concluded that an atomic bomb could be built and that a nation that possessed the bomb would have an enormous military and diplomatic advantage over any nation that did not.

World War II utilizing such a small share of its resources, illustrates the advantage the United States had in terms of the size and sophistication of its economy.

The commitment to unconditional surrender, however, was an unchallenged goal of Allied war policy. It was first stated at the Casablanca Conference -Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin, and the Free French leaders Generals de Gaulle and Giraud were present -in June 1943. Unconditional surrender appears to have originated with Roosevelt and was connected in his mind to the Civil War policy of Grant and Lincoln. After the conference some of Roosevelt's advisors opposed unconditional surrender because they believed it would prolong Axis resistance, but Roosevelt was firmly committed to the policy 
(Chase 1955)
Another alternative was to explode a nuclear bomb over some lightly inhabited area to demonstrate its power. Once the Japanese understood the devastating weapon now in the hands of the Allies they would probably surrender. If they didn't there would still be an opportunity to use the weapon later against civilian targets. Alternatively, the first bomb could have been used against Hiroshima alone. If enough time had been allowed for the Japanese to understand what they faced -a weapon of unparalleled power that the Americans were wishes being granted when a thousand paper cranes are folded. Children around the world still fold paper cranes and send them to Hiroshima in her memory.
prepared to use against civilians -they would surely have surrendered. At least the horror of Nagasaki might have been avoided.
But these alternatives were rejected. The reason for doing so has been the subject of bitter controversies among historians. Some maintain that the decision to use the atomic bomb against civilians was mainly the product of momentum

The human costs of the war to the American people, as I have already noted, were heavy, second only to the Civil War: 406,000 deaths and 672,000 non-mortal wounds. The financial costs were also staggering. The largest component was the money spent by the federal government on the armed forces. In 1938 defense spending was only 1.4 percent of GDP, a level typical of the 1930s. But that would change.
In 1940 spending was 1.6 percent of GDP, and in 1941, 5.1 percent. The latter was a record for the United States in peacetime (although it would be typical of the troubled post-World War II years). But then in 1942 military spending reached 16 percent of GDP and during the period 1943-5 it averaged more than one-third of GDP. The peak year was 1945 when spending on the armed forces was 37 percent of GDP. Altogether, as shown in Table

As in World War I, the draftees were "taxed": the difference between what they could have earned in the private sector and what they earned in the military. Some personnel served voluntarily, and in those cases the difference between what the individual earned in the military and what they could have earned in the private sector can be viewed as a voluntary contribution to the war effort rather than a tax. A crude estimate of the amount of these taxes and contributions hidden in the draft is reported in the fourth row of Table

State and local governments, private firms and charitable organizations, and individuals, also made contributions to the war effort, although their contributions were less important relative to those of the federal government in World War II than in World War I. The New Deal had greatly strengthened the role of the central government and prepared it to take control of the war economy. Spending money and creating agencies -the main efforts required of the federal government in World War II -were things with which the Roosevelt administration had plenty of experience. Indeed, it appears that spending at the state and local level fell in real terms during the war. Real spending by state governments on highways -one of the few time series on state

World War II Looking back, most Americans would agree that the war was worth it. Allowing the Fascist powers to have control over great swaths of the earth, a likely possibility had the United States remained neutral, would have been a catastrophe. Had the threat of war not arisen, the United States might well have continued on the path it was on, gradually recovering from the Depression. But we can at least imagine another possibility. The United States might have administered a powerful dose of monetary and fiscal stimulus, but one focused on domestic spending, which restored full employment in the same way that the war did. In that alternative world the resources used to build the war machine would have been used to build highways and hospitals, lighthouses and airports, and a thousand private investments, making the United States a far richer economy in 1945 than it actually was. In other words, there is an important sense in which the United States paid a high economic cost for the war, even though it emerged more prosperous at the end than it was at the beginning.
The list of economic advances that have been attributed to World War II is impressive: higher labor force participation of women based on a wider array of opportunities in the labor market, major breakthroughs in race relations, major technological advances, greater equality in wage rates, increased capital formation, and increased financial stability. The reasons for attributing so much to the war are clear. The war was a dramatic event that profoundly altered the lives of millions of Americans. Economic conditions during the war years and the years that followed, moreover, represented a stark contrast with the depressed conditions of the 1930s. Finally, there was an ideological dimension: it is natural for liberals to attribute positive postwar developments to the enlarged role undertaken by the federal government during the war. Whatever the motive, the tendency to attribute postwar advances to the war itself also tends to lower estimates of the cost of war, and to some extent to lower our expectation of the costs of future wars. There is hardly sufficient room here for a discussion of all of these conjectures. Here I will briefly discuss three: (1) the new international financial order in which the United States would play a key role, (2) the transformation of the role of women in the American economy, and (3) the synthetic rubber program. As you will see, in some cases the war
The legacies of World War II did indeed produce important changes. In others, the changes attributed to the war were more heavily influenced by long-run trends.
Perhaps the most important legacy of World War II was the new international economic and political order in which Germany, Japan, and Italy would play positive roles. All three would recover rapidly and become major economic powers. During the war few Americans could have anticipated that the "reconstruction" of these nations would follow with such speed and success; few Americans of the war generation could have believed that their children would be driving Volkswagens and Hondas. Indeed, when the Allies adopted their policy of "unconditional surrender," the future of the Axis looked bleak -a future of total destruction and poverty. Nevertheless, Roosevelt's policy of unconditional surrender laid the basis for the reconstruction of the economies and polities of Germany and Japan. Shortly after surrendering, Germany was divided into four zones controlled, respectively, by the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, and France. The Soviets, of course, imposed a Communist system on their zone. In the Allied zones, however, a capitalist course was followed which led eventually to Germany returning as a powerhouse on the world's economic stage. Initially, some thought was given to forcing Germany to give up its strong industrial sector and to rely primarily on agriculture: without an industrial base Germany could not rearm and threaten the world again. This idea had been pushed, notably, by Roosevelt's Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau. But this idea was inconsistent with the view that unconditional surrender should be followed by a magnanimous peace, Lincoln's intention in the Civil War. It soon became clear, moreover, that a reinvigorated Germany could be a valuable ally in the fight to contain Communism, so the Morgenthau plan was shunted aside 
(Gareau 1961;
Kimball 1976;
Morgenthau et al. 1995)
The political reconstruction of Germany began in November 1945 with the Nuremberg trials of leading Nazis. A dozen Nazi leaders received the death penalty and several others were imprisoned. But three were acquitted. One of these last was Hjalmar Horace Greeley Schacht. Schacht had been a supporter of the Nazi regime in the 1930s, when he had served as Minister of Public Works and as head of the Reichsbank, the German central bank. As head of the Reichsbank Schacht had developed the system of exchange controls that the Nazis used effectively in their preparation of the German economy for the war 
(Ellis 1940)
Rapid economic recovery of Germany was promoted by the European Recovery Program, popularly known as the Marshall Plan. It was first proposed by General George C. Marshall, the American Secretary of State, in a commencement address delivered at Harvard University on June 5, 1947. The essence of the plan was financial aid to help get Europe back on its feet 
(Milward 1984;

DeLong and Eichengreen 1993;

Shortly after the US Congress voted to fund the Marshall Plan the German Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, introduced a new currency, the Deutschmark, and removed wage and price controls. Erhard's reforms addressed West Germany's currency "overhang" head on. During the war the inflationary pressures generated by heavy reliance on the printing press had been held in check by wage and price controls; if controls were lifted without addressing the currency overhang, a substantial inflation would result. Erhard also lifted many controls on foreign trade. His bold moves have been widely credited with setting Germany upon a path of rapid recovery. By the 1950s, the level of per capita income in West Germany was such that observers were talking about the "German economic miracle" 
(Wallich 1955)
The American occupation authorities also attempted to remake the economic and political systems of Japan, initially with the goal of preventing a resurgence of Japanese imperialism, and later with the goal of creating a bulwark against Communism. At the start of the occupation the Americans targeted the "zaibatsu." These were large, tight-knit conglomerates, basically family-owned holding companies, combining finance, mining, and manufacturing. Partly, the zaibatsu were targeted simply because they represented concentrated economic power which the New Dealers thought exploited consumers and workers. True, in the first part of the New Deal there was some sympathy for monopolies and oligopolies because they seemed to bring stability 
(Hawley 1966)
(Rotwein 1964)
The war led to a thoroughgoing restructuring of the world monetary system. During World War I, as we noted in the previous chapter, most of the warring nations except the United States were forced off gold. Government demands for revenue were enormous and heavy reliance was placed on the printing press. Using the printing press to finance wars was not consistent with the gold standard's basic requirement that each unit of paper money be backed by a fixed quantity of gold. Attempts were made after World War I to return to the gold standard. In 1925 Britain returned to gold at the prewar par, a rate that may have overvalued the pound. The 1925 British pound contained the same amount of gold as the prewar pound and exchanged at the same rate for the US dollar (which had not been forced off gold during the war). But the British price level had risen more than the US price level, so the old exchange rate made British exports relatively more expensive. In 1926 France returned to the gold standard at a rate that undervalued the French currency. Despite these strains, it could be said that the gold standard was in the process of being rebuilt in the 1920s, but the efforts to rebuild it collapsed in the Great Depression. Nations were determined to stimulate exports by devaluing their currencies, even if this meant abandoning traditional commitments to gold.
Finance in the United States during World War II, and in the other belligerents, was similar to World War I: huge demands by governments for revenues financed in part by printing money. Inflation and exchange controls were the order of the day. But during the war sentiment grew among policymakers for constructing a new international monetary system for the postwar world. The hope was that the new system could preserve the fixed exchange rates of the gold standard, which had encouraged international trade and investment, without the rigidities and lack of control by governments that had frustrated the attempts to reconstruct the gold standard during the interwar years. An international conference to establish the postwar system was held at Bretton Woods, New Hampshire from July 1 to 22,  1944. 28 The British delegation included the economist John Maynard Keynes, the author of The General Theory of 
Employment, Interest and Money (1936)
The most important issue to be determined at Bretton Woods was the role to be played by the dollar in the postwar international financial system. Keynes proposed the formation of a new international currency, the "bancor," to be issued by a world central bank. The bancor would not circulate from hand to hand, but would be used to settle accounts among central banks. It would play much the same role that gold had played before the war, but it would cost nothing to create -it would be a "paper gold" -and its growth rate could be monitored and controlled. The seigniorage from creating the bancor would be available for use by international financial institutions. This imaginative proposal was not adopted owing to American opposition, but was frequently referred to in subsequent years as a possible path for international monetary reform.
The Americans proposed, and won acceptance for, a more UScentric system. Since the United States, unique among the major industrial nations, would emerge from the war with an enhanced industrial system, and would be called upon to finance reconstruction, it was almost inevitable that the American proposals would win acceptance. Exchange rates would be fixed in terms of dollars. Gold would still play a role, although an attenuated one, because the dollar would still be fixed in terms of gold. Instead of Keynes's world central bank, two international agencies would also be created. The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, usually known as the World Bank, would make longer-term investments. The International Monetary Fund would monitor the system of exchange rates and the balance of payments, and would make loans to countries running temporary deficits. Permanent deficits would, however, require adjustment of exchange rates. Under the gold standard as it had been reconstructed after World War I deficit countries were forced to contract their money supplies (as they lost gold) and surplus countries might choose to sterilize the inflows. Even under the classical gold standard, the effects appeared to be asymmetric: the contractions forced on the deficit countries caused more pain in the form of high unemployment than the expansions forced on the surplus countries caused in the form of inflation. The plan was for the International Monetary Fund to oversee a more balanced approach to adjustment.
Both international banks were to be financed, initially, mainly by the United States. The substantial investments that the United States made in the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank were properly part of the cost of the war to the American people. But the United States also received a hidden benefit. The Bretton Woods system, as it came to be called, strengthened the role of the US dollar as a reserve currency. The United States was able to run larger international deficits than would have been possible under a gold or bancor system because foreigners were more willing to hold dollars or dollardenominated assets such as Treasury bills as reserves. In effect, the world had asked the United States to make an investment: money now in the form of direct aid and endowments for international financial agencies in exchange for seigniorage to be earned later by issuing dollars for use in international trade. The Bretton Woods system survived from the end of World War II until the late 1960s. In the end, it was brought down by persistent US inflation and balance of trade deficits, which, in turn, were partly the result of the war in Vietnam.
Although women had always participated in America's wars, in World War II women entered the military services on an unprecedented scale. In all, about 200,000 served. The largest number served in the Women's Army Corps (WAC) and the Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Services (WAVES), with smaller numbers in the Marine Corps, Coast Guard, and the Women's Auxiliary Ferrying Service. They also entered the civilian labor force in large numbers to take advantage of high wages and job opportunities, and to help win the war. Many women served in clerical positions -the typewriter had become an important weapon of war -but it was those who were doing factory jobs traditionally done by men who made the most indelible impression. Propaganda encouraging women to aid the war effort was churned out by both the government and the private sector 
(Rupp 1978)
What happened to Rosie the Riveter after the war? The simplest answer goes like this. During World War II women rolled up their sleeves and went to work in the nation's factories, turning out the guns and ammunition, the ships and planes, needed to win the war. After the war, they did not go back willingly to unpaid household labor. Some, it is true, quit their jobs or were forced to leave; others, however, stayed. Some employers, moreover, learned an important lesson: women could be as productive as men. The result was a revolution: more women went to work in the paid labor force.
Although there is some truth to this story, the reality was more complicated. Many women did join the paid labor force during the war, and attitudes about women, especially about married women working in the paid labor force, did change.

We cannot leave the discussion of the role of women without addressing the so-called "baby boom." The story that dominates the public imagination is the stuff from which movies are made. A man and a woman have been separated through the long and dangerous years of the war. The husband returns, triumphant but conscious of the costs of war; the job has been done. They embrace; at last they can begin their life together.

There is a popular notion, one that is occasionally reiterated by knowledgeable historians, that WWII produced a large cluster of crucial technological advances: computers, jet engines, atomic energy, radar, and synthetic rubber are the most prominent. It would seem to follow that the war produced major improvements in the standard of living by creating new technologies -another example, some might claim, of how World War II proved to be a net economic benefit rather than a cost. In most of these cases, however, the war did not produce new technologies; it merely accelerated the deployment of existing technologies because they were useful given the changed economic conditions created by the war. Synthetic rubber is the most compelling example of what seems like a technology brought into being by the war because mass production of synthetic rubber for civilian uses was solely a result of the wartime program. The synthetic rubber program is also of interest because it could be viewed as a successful precedent for a massive government investment in some sort of green technology. Before the war the United States consumed only tiny amounts of synthetic rubber in specialty uses; after the war synthetic rubber supplied a large share of America's rubber needs. Before the war, to be more specific, the United States relied on rubber produced from trees on plantations in Southeast Asia. When the war began, the supply was cut, and the United States began a frantic effort to find substitutes.

that rubber could be extracted from guayule, a desert shrub that yielded substantial amounts of latex, which could be grown in the American Southwest. None of these alternatives, however, proved to be practical; they were, at best, a long-run solution. The real substitute for plantation rubber from Southeast Asia would be synthetic rubber.
As shown in Table

It would be a mistake, however, to jump to the conclusion that the war led to the discovery of synthetic rubber. The molecules that could be used to replace natural rubber had been discovered in the 1920s and 1930s. What the war did was create the economic conditions when it made sense to produce these molecules on a commercial scale. There were several candidates for mass production. One, neoprene, was an American creation. The earliest version was discovered by Father Julius Nieuwland of Notre Dame. With further refinements by Wallace Carothers and Elmer Bolton at DuPont, a commercially viable product was introduced in 1931. The slump in the market for tires and in the price of natural rubber caused by the Depression, however, scotched efforts to market it as a general purpose rubber. Neoprene was economically viable only in a small specialty market based on uses for which its physical properties made it especially useful. The possibility of a shortage of natural rubber, perhaps as the result of another war, was, however, on people's minds. In 1934, to fulfill an army request to build tires entirely out of materials produced in the United States, tires were successfully made from neoprene by the The legacies of World War II Dayton Rubber Manufacturing Company (New York Times, June 23, 1934, p. 1). Neoprene made good tires, but required large amounts of electricity to produce it 
(Wolf 1952)

Work on so-called methyl rubber had been undertaken by chemists in a number of countries before World War I. But the increasing supply of natural rubber from plantations in Southeast Asia, and the resulting decrease in its price, diminished interest. For Germany, however, World War I changed everything. Britain controlled the sea lanes, and Germany was soon desperately short of rubber. Renewed research led to the production of a series of methyl isoprene rubbers, including one that could be used to make (not very satisfactory) automobile tires. By the end of the war the Germans were making about 150 tons of synthetic rubber per month, and plants for making more were under construction 
(Wolf 1948)
After World War I work on synthetic rubber continued, especially in Germany and the Soviet Union, because of the fear that a future war could lead to a cutoff of supplies of the natural product. During the 1920s chemists at Germany's I.G. Farben developed a number of synthetic rubbers, including one designated Buna S, which was an acceptable substitute for natural rubber in tires, and another, Buna N, which was an acceptable substitute when oil resistance was important.

(Howard 1947)
Meanwhile, in Germany political pressure and subsidies set I.G. Farben on the road of production of Buna rubbers 
(Tooze 2007, 227-9)
(Herbert and Bisio 1985, 35)
In September 1939, as a result of the outbreak of the war in Europe, Standard Oil bought I.G. Farben's interest in their joint company for the development of Buna S in North America. Along with other firms, business leaders, and government officials, it then began a campaign to win government funding for experimental factories to produce Buna S. However, it was not easy going: there were many voices that cautioned against going too fast. The United States was not at war, and the war that was going on was in Europe, not the Far East, the USA's source of rubber. The United States, moreover, was building up a reserve of natural rubber that might see it through a future shortage. Then, too, synthetic rubber was a new, expensive product, and the government might end up financing a white elephant. Eventually, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation took responsibility for financing a small synthetic rubber program. By mid-January 1941 Standard Oil, DuPont, and the major tire-makers had submitted bids to build plants producing 40,000 tons. Bending to pressures to go slowly, however, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation came up with a new, smaller 10,000 ton plan. This decision was reversed in May 1941 and the 40,000 ton program was reinstated. In retrospect, of course, the long period of debate and delay was a mistake. Once the war began, the synthetic rubber program was rapidly expanded, from 40,000 tons per years to 120,000, to 400,000, and after the fall of Singapore on February 15, 1942 to 600,000, and finally to 800,000. There was also
The legacies of World War II a plant in Canada 
(Bellamy 2005)
These agreements, however, were voided in March 1941 when Roosevelt's famous trust-buster, assistant attorney general Thurman Arnold, who had charged Standard Oil with violating the anti-trust laws, obtained a decree forcing the company to give up its royalties and control of its patents for the duration of the war (New York Times, March 26, 1942, 1). Standard Oil consented, but claimed that it was doing so only in order to allocate all its resources to the war effort, and maintained that its actions prior to the war had furthered American preparedness. In particular, it argued that the patents it had obtained from I.G. Farben had contributed to the American war effort by making it possible to produce 100 octane aviation fuel, large amounts of TNT, and Buna S. The next day Arnold testified before the Truman Committee, arguing that the attempt by Standard Oil and I.G. Farben to monopolize the world market for synthetic rubber was the main reason for the current shortage in the United States. After Arnold's testimony, Senator Truman told reporters that Standard Oil's actions "constituted treason" (New York Times, March 27, 1942, 1). The issue continued to simmer -there was, for example, a civil suit against Standard Oil -but with the eventual success of the synthetic rubber program, the case against the company faded from the headlines. The charges must have hurt deeply. Extremist language, including charges of treason, is frequently a cost of the march to war, and World War II was no exception. Frank A. Howard, a vice president of Standard Oil and the president of its research and development corporation, was named as a defendant in the criminal portion of 234
World War II Arnold's suit. After the war he wrote Buna Rubber, the Birth of an Industry (1947), a detailed account and defense of his and Standard Oil's roles in the synthetic rubber program. Whatever one's view of Howard, the book is of considerable value to historians. At the time that Standard Oil was under attack for its relationship with I.G. Farben, the rubber program was also being attacked from other directions. A politically important debate concerned how to produce butadiene, one of the key ingredients of Buna S. Butadiene could be made from oil and this is what the chemical engineers who had first laid out the plan for the synthetic rubber program planned to use. However, it could also be made from alcohol, and alcohol soon had strong support in the farm states. If oil was needed to fuel planes, ships, and tanks, why not use the abundant products of American agriculture to produce alcohol and from alcohol, butadiene? This pressure produced a bill to create a new agency dedicated to producing synthetic rubber from butadiene made from alcohol. Roosevelt vetoed the bill, and on August 6, 1942 appointed a committee consisting of Bernard Baruch, who headed the War Industries Board in World War I, Dr. James B. Conant, President of Harvard University, and Dr. Karl T. Compton, President of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, to look at the rubber situation. Baruch would be the chair. In what must be something of a record, the Baruch Committee issued its report on September 10, 1942.
The committee's report (US Special Committee to Survey the Rubber Situation 1942) made a number of recommendations. First, the most important recommendation, at least from the public's point of view, was nationwide gasoline rationing. The recommendation was not made, as the committee emphasized, to conserve gasoline, which was not in short supply except in certain areas, but rather to conserve tires. Second, it recommended a 35 mile per hour speed limit for the same reason. Third, when it came to the technical choices the committee endorsed the existing program. Indeed, the committee argued that it would be a mistake to try to introduce new and untested synthetic rubbers. Major reliance would be on Buna S. Neoprene, it noted, was the best substitute for natural rubber in heavy-duty and combat tires. However, it was simply too costly to produce for use in general tires, in part because its production required large amounts of electricity. Fourth, the committee made a gesture to the advocates of alcohol. There should be a new 30,000 ton Buna S plant in the The legacies of World War II grain-producing area, and a 100,000 ton alcohol plant, also located in the grain-producing area. However, with this, and a few other minor exceptions, the committee essentially endorsed what was already being done. Somewhat surprisingly, the alcohol-to-butadiene plants were finished quickly and produced above their rated tonnages. Converting distilleries from production of spirits to production of industrial alcohol for butadiene quickly provided an adequate supply of alcohol. Throughout 1943 and through the first three quarters of 1944 this was the major source of butadiene 
(Howard 1947, 298)
Although it seemed to Americans at the time that progress on synthetic rubber was agonizingly slow, in retrospect the industry was created with amazing speed. The first plant went online in April 1942. By the second quarter of 1944 the industry was producing at an annual rate of more than 800,000 tons per year: the rubber shortage had been solved.
The synthetic rubber program is a good example of what can be accomplished when government is able to funnel large amounts of resources into a clear, technologically feasible, goal. In other words, it shows what can be accomplished by gold rush economics. As

The United States decided to provide more help for the veterans of World War II than it had for the veterans of World War I. The most important factor behind this generosity was simply that the entire nation had been united behind the war, and the armed forces had achieved a clear-cut victory. They were conquering heroes. There were, moreover, a great many veterans. More than 16 million men and women had served in the armed forces, about 11 percent of the 1946 population, and thanks partly to the draft, the veterans had been drawn from every part of the country and from every rank of society. No politician could ignore the veterans.
Providing generous benefits for such a large number of veterans raised the specter of higher taxes or a larger deficit. The federal budget had been in deficit since 1930, and the deficit at the end of the war was huge even by the standards of the 1930s. The threat to the federal budget had been a major obstacle for veterans' benefits after World War I. In the 1920s, as I noted in Chapter 5, Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon opposed immediate payment of the WWI veterans' bonus mainly because economic prudence, as he saw it, demanded low taxes and a balanced budget. Ideas about spending and deficits, however, had changed. Now the Keynesian idea that large government expenditures and, under some circumstances, large budget deficits were good things had replaced the balanced-budget orthodoxy of Mellon's day. Full employment during the war had, seemingly, confirmed Keynesian ideas, as least as far as many top economists were concerned. Many people, of course, clung to the old orthodoxy, but for many others veterans' benefits were no longer a fiscal negative, a charge on the taxpayer; they were now a fiscal positive, a path to full employment.
A report published in 1950 by a committee of the American Economic Association that included future Nobel Prize winners Milton Friedman and Paul Samuelson among its authors documents the new consensus. Government expenditures including veterans' benefits, "taken by themselves," tend to increase employment or raise prices 
(Despres et al. 1950, 519)
The veterans unmatched by taxes might be appropriate depending on the state of the economy. Generous benefits were seen not as something like unemployment benefits that would be in place permanently to act as an "automatic stabilizer" -after all, the number of veterans would gradually diminish -but rather as a good way to protect the economy from the depression that was expected to return after the war was over. 34 With wartime spending being cut, it was widely assumed that unemployment would rise. The educational provisions of the GI Bill (the legislation laying out the benefits for World War II veterans), which would keep returning veterans out of the job market during the postwar depression, made good Keynesian sense.
The perception that the United States had failed the veterans of World War I was another factor behind the support for generous benefits for the veterans of World War II. As Democratic Senator Ernest McFarland put it:
We cannot afford to have our boys wandering over the country as they did after the last war. We must meet this problem now and prevent a recurrence of that unfortunate situation. The stark tragedy of Anacostia Flats [where the bonus army was encamped in the Depression] must not be reenacted. We must and are facing this problem today in this GI bill of rights.
(quoted in US President's Commission 1956, Part 1, 54) 35   When veterans' groups, in particular the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the American Legion, began approaching Congress with proposals for generous veterans' benefits, they were met with an enthusiastic reception. The Servicemen's Readjustment Act, known popularly as the GI Bill of Rights, or simply the GI Bill, was passed in 1944. Its purpose was to help veterans readjust to civilian life by providing four types of assistance: (1) education and training; (2) guarantees for loans 34 There was, however, an attempt to use the loan program (intended mainly for housing) in the GI Bill as a stabilizer. The loan provision required a down payment by the veteran. When the Korean War began in 1950 the down payment was raised to offset expected inflationary pressures; when a recession developed in 1954 the down payment was reduced; and in 1955 when a building boom loomed, the down payment was raised again (US President's Commission 1956, Part 1, 59). 35 McFarland seems to be arguing that the high unemployment experienced by veterans in the 1930s was the result of a lack of sufficient help with readjustment after the war rather than an independent result of the Depression. Unemployment rates in general were fairly low during the 1920s. I am not aware of a study of the postwar employment patterns of World War I veterans.
for the purchase of homes, businesses, or farms; (3) unemployment compensation; and (4) job counseling and employment services. The most famous provisions were for education and training. Any veteran who had served ninety days and had received a discharge other than dishonorable was eligible for one year of training. Service beyond ninety days entitled the veteran to additional education up to three years. This remained the basic structure of the law in future years, although a number of changes were made in response to perceived abuses. Requirements were added, for example, that the school where the training took place was in existence one year before the war (to prevent the money being used in fly-by-night schools set up simply to take money from veterans) and that schooling not be used for avocational courses.
The lending provision initially guaranteed a loan to a veteran of up to $2,000 at a maximum interest rate of 4 percent. This provision was gradually liberalized in the early postwar years. The maximum amount of the loan, for example, was raised to $4,000 in 1945 and to $7,500 ($60,000 in 2010 dollars) in 1950. The maximum interest rates were also raised in response to market conditions. The other provisions were less controversial. The law provided fifty-two weeks of unemployment compensation for veterans who could not find work, and it set up a veterans' employment service to provide job counseling. The veterans were also entitled to certain benefits that derived from other legislation. Mustering-out pay of $100 per month up to $300 depending on rank was provided under a separate act, and veterans were entitled under certain circumstances to return to their old jobs. Reemployment rights, as they were known, were a new element in veterans' benefits.
The GI Bill has been widely praised by economists and historians of all political persuasions. To liberals it is an example of how government can do good by redistributing income. Millions of young people, liberals like to point out, were able to attend college who would have been unable to do so without the GI Bill, and went on to highly successful lives. Staid east coast universities, it is said, were democratized as they adjusted to an influx of mature students from lower income backgrounds. To conservatives, such as Milton Friedman, the great thing about the GI Bill was that it was a voucher system. The money went first to the veteran. The veteran could then choose the institution he wished to attend and pay the voucher to it. Figure

The financing of the Korean War was unique in American experience in the twentieth century. Taxes were raised substantially while the Federal Reserve followed an anti-inflationary policy. There was an initial surge in prices, and price controls were imposed, but by the end of the war prices were stable.
President Truman favored pay-as-you-go taxation. He acknowledged that there could be "emergency conditions" that would make a deficit necessary, including "maintaining the economy on a high level," but he concluded that "there is nothing sacred about the pay-as-you-go idea so far as I am concerned, except that it represents the soundest principle of financing that I know"

The personal and corporate income taxes were expected to be the major revenue generators. But sin and luxury taxes were also utilized, in an echo of the Spanish-American and earlier wars. The excises on furs, jewelry, and coin-operated gambling machines were increased, and new levies were imposed on televisions and household freezers. The latter, in addition to being luxuries, represented goods that used materials and manufacturing facilities that might be important to the war effort. There was also an excess profits tax during the Korean War, as there had been in World War I and World War II, but it was not a major source of revenue. In World War II the excess profits tax produced about onequarter of all tax revenues (after adjusting for prices and prewar taxes); in the Korean War it produced, by the same measure, less than 5 percent (Appendix 4). The small impact of the excess profits tax was partly a matter of timing. The first tax bill that Truman sent to Congress did not include an excess profits tax, presumably because he was concerned that debate over the excess tax provision would slow passage of the bill. When Congressional liberals tried to add an excess profits tax, the Speaker of the House, the legendary Sam Rayburn, told them flatly that they could not have it in the emergency tax bill 
(Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 115)
Congress. There, however, it did receive widespread support, perhaps because the deterioration in the military situation in Korea had underscored the need for additional revenues 
(Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 120)
The excess profits tax was justified first of all on moral grounds: it was wrong to make extraordinary profits from the war; fairness required that the fat cats, who were staying at home while young men were drafted and sent to Korea to fight, pay a heavy price. There were also economic justifications for the tax. An excess profits tax, like other taxes, would remove purchasing power from the marketplace and reduce inflationary pressures. There was, however, another macroeconomic justification, although one that appealed more to the public than to economists: the excess profits tax would fight inflation by taxing it. After all, this line of thought went, if inflation was caused by war profiteers raising prices, taxing the profiteers would reduce the incentive to raise prices. That ideas such as this were in the wind was the reason that during the war Milton

There would be further tax increases under the Revenue Act of 1951. The Revenue Acts of the Korean War were not sufficient to prevent a deficit in the federal budget, but they did a good job. As shown in Figure

The most important issue for the Federal Reserve during the Korean War was whether it should simply continue its prewar policy of setting a floor under the prices of government bonds -pegging the price of government bonds, as it was known -a policy that dated to the early days of World War II, or whether it should allow bond prices to fall, in order to restrict the growth of money and credit, and thus restrain inflation. President Truman and his Treasury Secretary, John W. Snyder, strongly favored pegging. Truman remembered having bought Liberty bonds during World War I only to see their price sag in the postwar period because the Federal Reserve had failed to maintain it. He considered pegging to be a policy that helped the little guy, and he felt that given the challenge of Communism it was crucial to maintain the credit of the government 
(Stein 1996, 272)

also believed that the job of the Federal Reserve was first and foremost to support the Treasury by pegging government bond prices and he was confident of Truman's support; he was a close personal friend of the President, a fellow Missourian, and had served with him in World War I. The Federal Reserve, however, saw things differently.
It had a duty, as it saw it, to promote macroeconomic stability, and in the current environment that meant fighting inflation. As shown in Figure 
7
As the Federal Reserve saw it, the nation was in the midst of an inflationary crisis, and the Federal Reserve was duty bound to do something about it, even if that meant an increase in the interest rate on government bonds. The fight between the Federal Reserve and the Treasury over which philosophy of war finance should prevail, or to put it more crudely, but perhaps just as accurately, over who should be the boss of monetary policy, was a classic case of bureaucratic infighting. 
Herbert Stein (1996, 272)
The Korean War "a masterpiece of deliberate misunderstanding." The President tried to pin the Federal Reserve to the Treasury view by releasing a letter that interpreted the meeting as one in which the Federal Reserve had agreed to continue pegging. The Federal Reserve, however, resisted this tactic, and in the end was able to assert its independence from the Treasury. On March 4, the famous Treasury-Federal Reserve "Accord" was reached. The announcement to the public was brief and to some degree cryptic.
The Treasury and the Federal Reserve System have reached full accord with respect to debt-management and monetary policies to be pursued in furthering their common purpose to assure the successful financing of the Government's requirements and, at the same time, to minimize monetization of the public debt.
The last phrase was critical. To place a floor under the price of public debt the Federal Reserve had to be ready to purchase all of the excess supply of debt, even if that meant creating new money to do it; that is, it had to be ready to monetize the debt. The Accord, in other words, recognized the right of the Federal Reserve to stop purchasing government debt. The Federal Reserve had reasserted its independence after nearly a decade of subservience to the Treasury. Viewed in a long historical perspective, the ability of the Federal Reserve to stand up to the President in wartime was remarkable. When the Second Bank of the United States had "gone to war" with President Andrew Jackson in the 1830s it had lost badly.

The outbreak of the war produced a wave of buying of items that had been in short supply during World War II.

Another reason for the moderation in the rate of inflation was the price freeze introduced on January 26, 1951. An across-the-board freeze was adopted because the World War II policy of gradually tightening controls over a long period had done more harm than good. Michael V. DiSalle, the director of Price Stabilization, told Senator Taft that it was better to cut off all of the cat's tail at once. If you do it an inch at a time, "you always have a sore tail -and a mad cat" 
(New York Times, January 2, 1951, 15)
From the outbreak of the war to the start of the price freeze, prices rose at an annual rate of 11.1 percent; but from the price freeze to the termination of controls prices rose at an annual rate of only 2.1 percent. There was some evasion of price controls during the Korean War, although not on the scale seen during World War II. The market for steel was especially problematic. Demand was strong, and steel was rationed, but some was diverted into so-called gray markets. (Presumably, the participants believed, or hoped, that although they were evading price controls and rationing, their actions were not illegal.) Large steel producers engaged in a game of chicken with the government, refusing to grant increases in wages unless the government granted increases in the price of steel, the tactic which had undermined controls after the end of World War II. President Truman became so incensed that he seized the steel mills in April 1952. This action was blocked by the courts, and led to a long strike that was eventually ended with a concession on wages by the steel producers and a concession on prices by the Office of Price Stabilization. Smaller producers evaded controls by selling steel through long "daisy chains" of intermediaries.
Thus some of the price stability observed after the price freeze (and the tax increases and the Treasury-Federal Reserve Accord) may be misleading: a failure of the price indexes to accurately reflect the true level of prices. There can be little doubt, however, that the general impression conveyed by Figure 
7
Price controls and rationing did not significantly alter the cost of the war in the sense that they did not in the first instance reduce the amount of resources that had to be shifted from the private sector to the public sector, but they did alter the way those costs were perceived. Consider the steel situation. The government could simply have allowed steel prices to rise freely and then have purchased as much steel as it required on the open market, raising taxes as needed. Such a policy would have succeeded in acquiring the requisite amount of steel. But the cost of the war would have been transparent to taxpayers. Price controls and rationing limited the financial cost of acquiring steel for the war, and the need to raise taxes, but created other difficulties such as the threeway tug-of-war among labor, management, and the government described above. This tug of war and its outcome, the seizure of the steel mills by the President and the constitutional crisis that ensued, were costs of the war. But it seems unlikely that costs that have been transformed from simple increases in taxes to complicated questions about compliance with regulations can be part of a rational calculation in which a citizen tries to decide whether a war is "worth it."
The cost of the war About 34,000 Americans were killed in action, and about 2,800 died from disease and injury during the Korean War. Total US casualties (dead, wounded, missing in action) amounted to 139,860 (Appendix 2). South Korean casualties have been estimated at 320,000 and those of other US allies at 14,000. The combined casualties for the North Koreans and Chinese are estimated to have been as many as 1.5 million. The number of civilian deaths caused by the war has "been put as high as 1 million" 
(Koh 1971, 478, n. 9)
When the Korean War began military spending in the United States was already elevated because of the ongoing tensions with the Soviet
The Korean War
Union, but it was pushed even higher by the war. If we project real defense spending forward from 1950 to 1955 at a constant rate, and then subtract these projections from actual military spending, we obtain estimates of the marginal costs of the Korean War. They sum to $415 billion in 2008 dollars, about 17 percent of average real GDP during the war. This calculation is relevant when we consider the point of view of a policymaker deciding whether the Korean War was a "worthwhile" investment given the high level of spending dictated by the ongoing commitment to contain Communism. If we look at the war as part of the process of maintaining this commitment we should include some part of the cost of maintaining Cold War levels of military spending. In other words, we would want to include some part of the fixed costs. An alternative calculation that includes all military spending during the war in excess of the post-Cold War norm would be $1,119 billion in 2008 dollars, about 47 percent of average real GDP during the war. If we add veterans' benefits, the total cost of the war increases to $1,186 billion in 2008 dollars, 48.2 percent of average real GDP at the time. These estimates exclude some smaller costs: costs of civilian war agencies, the cost of the draft to the men who were drafted, the longrun costs of stationing forces in South Korea, and so on. It does not appear that the addition of these costs would change the overall picture sufficiently to justify the time needed for these refinements, but it is clear that $1,335 billion in 2008 dollars is a lower bound.
The estimate of half a year's GDP is less than the equivalent estimate for the two world wars, but more than for the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars. Was it worth it? Unfortunately, economic accounting cannot furnish a persuasive answer. While economists can measure the costs, the benefits -preventing the expansion of the territory controlled by the Communist powers, maintaining international law, and so on -lie on other dimensions. We can say, however, that the American people soon became discouraged with the war. In August 1950, shortly after the Inchon landing, a Gallup poll asked Americans the following: do you think the United States made a mistake going into the war in Korea, or not? At that time total battle deaths stood at 4,631 and 66 percent of the respondents answered no. But this consensus was quickly eroded. Mounting casualties, lack of progress on the ground, and higher taxes levied under the Revenue Act of 1950 quickly took their toll
The cost of the war on public support for the war. By December 1950 total battle deaths stood at 13,991 and only 39 percent answered no; most Americans in other words, either were not sure or thought that the war had been a mistake 
(Larson 1996, 109)
The "Korean War GI Bill" became law in 1952. Eventually it covered veterans serving between June 27, 1950 and February 1, 1955. 3 It included the same portfolio of benefits as the WWII GI Bill and associated legislation: mustering-out pay, financial support for education, guarantees for home and business loans, unemployment compensation, and job placement. This bill, however, was less generous in a number of ways than that for World War II. This was especially true in the provisions for education. The WWII GI Bill provided twelve months of financial support for education plus one additional day of support for each day of service in the war, with a limit of forty-eight months. The Korean War GI Bill, however, provided for education equal to one and a half times the amount of service with a limit of thirty-six months. In essence, a year of service in WWII entitled a veteran to two years of education, while a year of service in the Korean War entitled a soldier to only one and a half years of education. At two years the rewards were the same, but longer service in WWII was rewarded, while longer service in the Korean War was not. Thus, to take the iconic example, a high school graduate who served three years in WWII could complete a traditional four-year college education under the WWII GI Bill, but a high school graduate who served for three years in the Korean War would have to pay for the fourth year of college himself. To be sure, the Korean War was shorter than World War II, but it was conceivable that a veteran of the Korean War who had faced more danger in Korea than a friend who had served in World War II would receive less in educational benefits.
The formula determining the amount of educational benefits paid to the veteran was also changed. Under the WWII GI Bill the government paid the tuition up to $500 directly to the school while the veteran received a monthly subsistence payment of $50 if there were no dependants, with additional amounts payable if there were dependants. Under the Korean War GI Bill, the veteran received $110 per month if there were no dependants, but the veteran was responsible for paying tuition. What did this mean? A Korean War veteran who paid $500 in tuition for nine months of schooling (the maximum tuition benefit under the WWII GI Bill) was left with only $54 per month for nine months. The Korean War veteran would be equal in nominal terms to a WWII veteran under the 1948 version of the law only if he chose a school that charged $315 for nine months of schooling. Since prices had risen about 10 percent between 1948 and 1952, the veteran attending school under the Korean War GI Bill would have to choose a school with tuition of about $250 for nine months to remain equal in after-tuition real payments to a veteran going to school under the 1948 version of the World War II GI Bill. The Korean War GI Bill, to sum up, left the Korean War veteran with less money in real terms, unless he was fortunate enough to find a school that met his needs and charged a modest tuition.
In addition, the Korean War GI Bill altered unemployment benefits in a way that hurt some veterans. The payment was raised from $20 per week under the WWII GI Bill to $26 per week under the Korean War bill, but the maximum period covered was halved from fifty-two weeks to twenty-six weeks. The Korean War bill, in other words, reduced the maximum amount from $1,040 to $676 despite the rise in prices. Figure

(Longo et al. 2005)
Several factors probably account for the change in the level of benefits between the WWII and Korean War GI Bills. One was the The veterans perception that some veterans had abused the generosity of the WWII bill. Veterans had gone off to college, some critics charged, simply to enjoy a vacation at government expense rather than to prepare themselves for the future. Requiring the veteran to pay for a larger share of his education would save money and would be good for society and for the veteran. In addition, the macroeconomic picture had changed dramatically. When the WWII GI Bill was written it was widely assumed that the Depression would return after the war. Spending on education for GIs was a way of keeping them out of a crowded labor market, and of injecting additional purchasing power that would partly offset the decline in war spending and help prop up the economy. The feared postwar depression, however, failed to materialize. By 1952 inflation rather than unemployment had become the major concern of policymakers. As a consequence, restraining government spending, including spending on veterans' readjustment benefits, now seemed the course of fiscal prudence.
There is another possible factor, one that is not susceptible to definitive confirmation, but which is worth considering. The Korean War ended differently than World War II: in a struggle for an armistice rather than an unequivocal victory. Perhaps Americans unconsciously 258
The Korean War felt less enthusiastic about rewarding veterans because they had not "accomplished" as much; they were not conquering heroes. It would be hard for us to see ourselves in this way, and there is not enough experience to judge for certain. But there are certainly other examples, such as the War of 1812, whose veterans seem to have been less well rewarded than the more successful veterans of the Revolution and the Mexican War

The Cold War
The Cold War resembles the period of increased military spending that followed the Philippine-American War and Theodore Roosevelt's "large policy." Casualties were few during the Cold War, but it was punctuated by two hot wars, in Korea and Vietnam. However, the financial cost of the Cold War was substantial, although it often faded from view in the political arena -accepted to some degree as part of the normal background of economic and political life. Over the long run, however, the Cold War was costly, more costly in financial terms than the hot wars in Korea and Vietnam, and indeed, more costly in terms of total resources used than World War II. What might be called the War against Communism -thus encompassing Korea, Vietnam, and the Cold War -was by far the longest, and in terms of financial resources the costliest, war in American history. True, politically minded leftists believed that the lesson of the war was that it was important for the United States to stand against Fascism and to stand with its wartime allies, the Communists. But to most Americans the lesson of the war was that it was important to stand up to aggressive dictatorships. "Isms" were the problem, and it didn't matter whether it was a right ism or a left ism. Thus, many Americans were sympathetic to the idea of containment, even many who knew little about Communism, and who in past times would have been opposed to the taxes that would be needed to finance containment. Isolationism, with its low military burden, and "appeasement" had been discredited by World War II.
The outbreak, or more accurately a perceived renewal, of a Communist insurgency in Greece proved an important accelerant to the Cold War. The civil war in Greece had its roots in the German occupation of the country during World War II. In March 1946 elections were held which were won by the right. The Communists, who had boycotted the election and who had the support of Marshal Tito in Yugoslavia, then resumed their war against the government, which was backed by Britain and the United States. In March 1947 President Truman asked Congress for $400 million in economic and military aid for Greece and Turkey. Truman's message to Congress was straightforward. The Communists represented only a minority in Greece, but they were trying to overthrow a democratically elected government by force.
Truman put it this way:
The Government of Greece is not perfect. Nevertheless it represents eightyfive per cent of the members of the Greek Parliament who were chosen in an election last year. Foreign observers, including 692 Americans, considered this election to be a fair expression of the views of the Greek people. 
3
The United States contributed $341,000,000,000 toward winning World War II. This is an investment in world freedom and world peace. The assistance that I am recommending for Greece and Turkey amounts to little more than 1 tenth of 1 per cent of this investment. It is only common sense that we should safeguard this investment and make sure that it was not in vain. 
4
There is no precise starting date for the Cold War. Some historians date it from Churchill's "Iron Curtain" speech, but many others date it from Truman's request for aid for Greece and Turkey. The government of the United States was now committed to, or at least one could say, was in the process of taking on the commitment of, containing Communism. From 1945 to 1949 the United States was the only nuclear power, and the possibility of threatening the Soviet Union and China with nuclear strikes encouraged American hardliners who wanted to push the Communist powers back. But the explosion of an atomic bomb by the Soviets in August 1949 meant that containment had become the only feasible policy. If a war between the Communist powers and the Western powers erupted, both sides would face mass destruction of the type visited upon Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
The explosion of an atomic bomb by the Soviet Union was a severe shock to the United States. It had assumed that it was far ahead of the Soviet Union in nuclear physics and would enjoy a nuclear monopoly for many years. A natural question was whether the Soviets had developed a nuclear bomb on their own or whether atomic secrets had been stolen. It soon emerged that the Soviet Union had penetrated the British and American nuclear research efforts. In March 1950 Klaus Fuchs, a German who had worked on nuclear research in Britain and the United States, was convicted in Britain of spying for the Soviet Union, and soon after, there was a sensational case in the United States. On July 17, 1950 Julius Rosenberg, an American, was arrested for passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union; his wife, Ethel, was arrested in early August. The Korean War had begun only a few weeks before their arrests. Many people were convinced that Stalin had given the green light for North Korea to attack South Korea, and that he did so because he possessed the atomic bomb, making the Soviet Union and its allies safe from retaliation. The conclusion from this line of thinking was that the Rosenbergs and other nuclear spies were directly responsible for the deaths of American military personnel in Korea. This was one of the considerations cited by the judge in the Rosenberg case when, on March 29, 1951, he sentenced them to death. 
5
The Cold War was punctuated by a series of confrontations, each of which had the potential to escalate into a hot war, and on two occasions, in Korea and Vietnam, did so. The Berlin blockade was the first major confrontation. Berlin, traditionally Germany's capital, lay entirely within the zone controlled by the Soviet Union. In June 1948 the Soviets blocked ground access to the city. Their goal was to force the Western Allies to recognize Soviet authority in Berlin. Accepting the newly introduced Soviet currency as the sole legal tender in Berlin was an important component of their demands. The Western Allies did not attempt to break the blockade by force, an action that might have led to a war between them and the Soviet Union. Instead, they chose to bring in needed supplies by air: the famous Berlin airlift. The airlift continued for nearly a year. Supplying a large city with food, fuel, and other supplies by air was a major challenge that had never been accomplished previously. But with the help of newly introduced large transport planes the challenge was met. The Soviets made some attempts to harass Allied flights, but did not attempt to shoot down the planes: neither side was prepared to go to war to decide the fate of Berlin. By the spring of 1949 the Soviets found themselves on the losing end of a propaganda war and abandoned the blockade.
A year later the "free world," led by the United States, and the Communist world were confronting each other once again. On June 25, 1950 the North Korean Communists invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War. The United States entered on the side of South Korea and in October 1950 Chinese forces crossed the Yalu River, attacking the US forces and those of its allies. Two of the world's most powerful nations, Capitalist America and Communist China, were at war. The Korean War is treated in detail in Chapter 7; here I want to note that it was part of the long series of conflicts that constituted the War against Communism. There were more confrontations with Communist China. Twice -in the summer and fall of 1954 and again in 1958 -the United States and the People's Republic of China nearly went to war over the disputed islands of Quemoy and Matsu. These are small islands that lie in the strait separating mainland China and Taiwan (a non-Communist ally of the United States). The Communist regime claimed all of China including Taiwan and on these occasions was prepared to shell the islands, which had been fortified by Chiang Kai-shek's government on Taiwan. The islands had little economic value, but both sides believed that a Communist takeover of Quemoy and Matsu would have undermined the credibility of the Taiwan regime. In the end, however, neither the United States nor China was prepared to let this conflict escalate into full-scale war.
Tensions rose once again when, in the following year, 1959, Fidel Castro took power in Cuba. After some early denials of Communist leanings, Castro moved quickly to establish a Communist economic system and to establish close relations with the Soviet Union. It was a major breakthrough for the Communist powers: a base in the new world. Both Communists and their opponents thought that the Cuban revolution might lead to revolutions throughout Latin America. In response to the revolution the United States provided military aid and support for Cuban exiles who hoped to reclaim the island by force and embargoed US trade with Cuba.

In October 1962 the Soviet Union and the United States came very close to going to war over Cuba. 8 The Kennedy administration became alarmed when reconnaissance photos showed that the Soviet Union had been installing on the island missiles capable of hitting the United States. On October 22 Kennedy made this threat known to the public in an address broadcast by radio and television. He also announced a "quarantine" of Cuba. The term, with its medical associations, was carefully chosen. "Embargo" would have conveyed a more menacing, warlike intention. Ships bound for Cuba would be stopped and searched: missiles would be prevented from entering Cuba, but civilian goods would be allowed to continue. Nevertheless, there was a real possibility of a naval confrontation on the high seas that would escalate into a fullscale war, conceivably a nuclear war. Some historians claim, with some justification, that the world came closer to a nuclear war during October 1962 than it had before or has since. Furious negotiations followed the imposition of the quarantine, and on October 28 Nikita Khrushchev, the leader of the Soviet Union, announced that he had agreed to remove Soviet missiles from Cuba, ending the crisis. In return, the United States promised not to invade the island. US missiles in Turkey, another issue, were subsequently removed.
Two years later, the United States would become embroiled in the Vietnam War. It would occupy the United States, at a minimum, for eight and a half years -from the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution passed in August 1964 until the Paris Peace Accords were signed in January 1973. This conflict is discussed in detail in Chapter 9. The substantial costs of the Vietnam War -the loss of life, the economic costs, and the 7 Hufbauer, Elliott, and Schott (1990)  The final conflict took place in Afghanistan. 10 In 1979 the Soviet Union sent its forces into that country in order to shore up a Communist regime already established there. This was a full-scale military deployment involving air and armored ground forces, perhaps 100,000 troops in all. At first the Soviets were successful when opposition forces attempted to fight conventional battles. But soon the opposition, known as the Mujahidin, developed effective guerilla tactics. The Soviets were able to assert control over major cities and roadways, and could temporarily assert control over any particular target they chose, but they could not maintain effective control over the countryside. As was often noted, the Afghan war turned out to be the Soviet Union's Vietnam: the war they could not win despite control of the air and a vast advantage in firepower on the ground. In 1989, after suffering 25,000 deaths and numerous casualties, worn out by the seemingly endless effort to prop up their Afghan allies, the Soviet Union withdrew. The United States had aided the Mujahidin directly by supplying them with arms -as had other, mainly Islamic, governments and private individuals such as Osama Bin Laden -and indirectly by imposing an embargo on the sale of wheat to the Soviet Union. The latter, although it imposed some costs on the Soviets, was more symbolic than real because the Soviets were able to turn to other suppliers.
The end of the Cold War came soon after the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan. Throughout the Communist world there was a rising chorus of demands for political and economic liberalization. The response differed from country to country depending on the flexibility 9 At the time when trade with China opened, the idea that the country would become a major trading partner of the United States was widely ridiculed. China simply did not produce anything Americans wanted to buy. 10 There is a large literature describing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Three sources I found helpful are

The Vietnam War proved to be one of the most controversial in American history. The closest precedent in the twentieth century was the Philippine-American War. In both wars Americans found themselves far from home attempting to defeat an enemy that often resorted to effective guerilla tactics. In both wars a strong anti-war movement developed, based on concerns about the costs of the war to the American people in terms of lives and resources, concerns about the costs being imposed on the countries where the US was fighting, in particular the civilian populations, and in some cases sympathy for the political goals of the people whom the US was fighting.
America's involvement in Vietnam had deep historical roots. Chinese rule of Vietnam began before the Christian era, but Chinese rule was always a source of resentment and sometimes of active resistance. Finally, in 1426 under the legendary emperor Le Loi, the Vietnamese won their independence, a condition they sustained under his dynastic successors for four centuries. However, while united in their opposition to the Chinese, the Vietnamese became bitterly divided between the Trinh clan that held sway in the north and the Nguyen clan that was dominant in the central and southern parts of the country. Indeed, the conflict between North Vietnam and South Vietnam in which the United States became embroiled can be seen in part as a continuation of this ancient conflict. Sources:

The Vietnam War became emperor with the aid of French military advisors and troops. This would be the beginning of a series of interventions that took place over the course of the nineteenth century. Although often thwarted for a time by local resistance movements, the French, by relying on their superior military technology, including their navy, which was effective on Vietnam's long coast, gradually established full control. American expansionists in the 1890s could point to European control of far-flung colonies, including colonies in Asia such as Vietnam, as a reason why the United States had to join the game or be left behind -a reason why the United States needed an outpost in the Philippines. Nguyen Tat Thanh, better known by his nom de guerre Ho Chi Minh (sometimes translated as "bringer of light"), was born in Vietnam in 1890. In 1911 he left Vietnam for a long sojourn that took him to France, the United States, the Soviet Union, and China among other countries. In 1941, Ho, now a convinced Communist, returned to Vietnam to organize the Communist Party and lead the resistance to the Japanese who were attempting to replace the French as colonial masters. The end of World War II, perhaps inevitably, brought a period of chaos to Vietnam. The Japanese had been defeated, but who would replace them: the French or the Vietnamese nationalists? The economy, moreover, was deranged: famine was widespread. In the midst of this chaos Ho Chi Minh announced Vietnam's independence on September 2, 1945.
The French were determined to regain control of Vietnam, and a long war ensued between their forces and those led by Ho Chi Minh. The climactic battle was Dien Bien Phu which was fought from March 13 to May 7, 1954. It was a major defeat for the French: not a smallscale ambush typical of guerilla wars, but rather a full-scale battle typical of a war between well-armed nation-states. More than eleven thousand French soldiers were taken prisoner. A peace conference was arranged in Geneva, which provided for the temporary division of Vietnam until elections could be held to determine the government of the nation as a whole. The Communists under Ho Chi Minh then began consolidating power in the North, while an American-backed regime under Ngo Dinh Diem began consolidating power in the South. The election to unify Vietnam was never held; neither side was interested in an election that they might lose.
Like most US wars, the war in Vietnam began, or more accurately accelerated, with an "incident" that could be used to rally US public The agreement to end the war was finally reached on January 27, 1973, when Kissinger and Le Duc Tho signed the Paris Peace Accords. The main provision was that the United States and its allies would begin an immediate withdrawal of their troops from Vietnam. In return the North Vietnamese and Vietcong committed themselves to a reunification through peaceful elections. Once American and allied forces left, the war was renewed. The North Vietnamese and Vietcong then gradually reduced the area controlled (or partially controlled) by the South Vietnamese to Saigon and its environs. Possibly the United States would have reacted more vigorously to the North Vietnamese violations of the treaty if it had not been for the multitude of unprecedented challenges it faced in other arenas: the Yom Kippur War, ongoing negotiations with the Soviet Union, and most importantly, the final acts of the Watergate affair. But then again, the American people had grown tired of the war, and they might have permitted the fall of Saigon even without the distractions.
The end for the Saigon government came in the spring of 1975. On April 21 President Nguyen Van Thieu of South Vietnam resigned.
On April 29 American personnel were evacuated by helicopter from the roof of the American embassy in Saigon. On April 30 the city fell to the North Vietnamese and their Vietcong allies.
Prior to the Vietnam War, inflation had been the result of major wars: the Revolution, the War of 1812, the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. The smaller foreign wars -the Mexican War, the Spanish-American War, the Philippine-American War, and the Korean War -had not produced much inflation, and with a few exceptions, peacetime had been free of inflation. 1 But during the 1960s and 1970s the United States experienced a substantial inflation. The "Great Inflation" was not confined to the era of the Vietnam War. It lasted almost two decades. From 1962 to 1980, prices (the GDP deflator) rose about 5.11 percent per year.
The Vietnam War, clearly, was not the only cause of the Great Inflation, but it was a contributing factor, especially important for the takeoff of inflation. The path of the Great Inflation is shown in Figure

1967 to 1970, from 1972 to 1974, and from 1976 to 1980
When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961 the economy, at least as far as President Kennedy and his economic advisors were concerned, was in the doldrums. A contraction had begun in April 1960 (according to the National Bureau of Economic Research chronology) and the rate 1 There had been several mild peacetime inflations. From 1833 to 1836 prices (the GDP deflator) rose about 4.25 percent per year as a result of an influx of silver from Mexico, a period known as the "Jacksonian inflation." From 1851 to 1855 prices rose about 4.09 percent per year as a result of the discoveries of gold in California and Australia. From 1897 to 1913 prices rose about 2.15 percent per year as a result of the discoveries of gold in South Africa and other parts of the world.
people saw it, protected the interests of the rich and chose a point of high unemployment and low inflation on the Phillips Curve. The Democrats would choose a point reflecting the interests of the poor and the middle class, a point corresponding to higher inflation and lower unemployment. The Kennedy program began with increased spending. Some of this was for civilian purposes. For example, the Area Redevelopment Act provided loans for economic development in regions suffering from high unemployment.

Unemployment fell over the next few years and Keynesian economists celebrated the effects of the tax cut. Heller, an academic economist from the University of Minnesota, had quickly become the leading figure among the economists advising the Kennedy and Johnson administrations. On June 8, 1962 his picture appeared on the cover of Time magazine (his second appearance on the cover) because of his advocacy of the tax cut. In an article published in 1965 Heller confidently summarized the Kennedy and Johnson administrations' successful management of the economy: "in the four years since 1960 we have seen . . . that with a proper mix of consumption and investment stimulus an expansionary fiscal policy can move us toward full employment and faster growth and at the same time further the ends of price stability and payments equilibrium" 
(Heller 1965, 235)
When the war began in earnest there were, of course, estimates of how costly it would be. Robert McNamara, the Secretary of Defense, put the cost of the war for fiscal 1967 at $10 billion, probably a deliberate underestimate designed to allay fears about the expansion of the war and discourage attempts to roll back the Great Society programs

As economists of every stripe quickly realized, the politics of Keynesianism was not as smoothly symmetric as its economics. Keynesian economics called for tax cuts and spending increases when the economy was in the doldrums, and for tax increases and spending cuts when the economy was overheating. The first part, the tax cuts and spending increases, were wildly popular and could sail through Congress; the tax increases and spending cuts were a hard sell.
However, continuing inflation -despite a temporary drop caused by restrictive monetary policies put into place by the Federal Reserve in 1966 
(Meltzer 2009, 499-512)
(Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 136)
Johnson might have won support for a tax increase earlier, and perhaps for a larger increase, had he promoted it simply as a "war tax." Wilbur Mills, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee, suggested that if the surtax proposal were labeled a "war tax" it would "meet few obstacles in Congress." But Johnson was unwilling to admit that he had taken the nation into a full-scale war because it would undermine support for his Great Society programs. How could the nation be expected to increase spending on domestic programs if the nation was at war? Johnson therefore attempted to sell the tax increase as a purely economic measure, and so it took longer to get the measure through Congress, and he obtained less than he asked for. Usually, we see administrations attempting to hide the cost of war to maximize support for the war; in this case, ironically, there was support for a war tax, but the administration wanted to hide the cost of war to maintain support for domestic programs.
The surtax, at least as finally passed, was insufficient to stem the inflationary tide, which, as shown in Figure 
9
Friedman (1957)
Johnson, facing the uprising of anti-war sentiment in his own party described above, chose not to run for President in 1968. Richard Nixon was sworn in as President in January 1969 and in March called for an extension of the surtax to fight inflation. Congressional Democrats responded by demanding a set of tax reforms as the price for extending the surtax. Eventually, a compromise was reached. Nixon signed the Tax Reform Act of 1969 on December 31. And in a separate bill the surtax was extended for six months at 10 percent and for another six months at 5 percent -again a temporary extension unlikely to have a major effect on spending. The Tax Reform Act incorporated a number of changes in the tax code, some of which enhanced revenues, but others, such as an increase in the standard deduction, reduced revenues. There is a wide margin of error around any estimate of the effects of a complex tax measure, but the consensus is that overall the Tax Reform Act reduced taxes, a tax reduction in time of war. Much later President George W. Bush would be criticized for cutting taxes during the Iraq War. Ironically, the Tax Reform Act of 1969, a liberal Democratic initiative, was a precedent. In defense of the Tax Reform Act one could say that its purpose was fairness, even if the effect was to reduce taxes, and one could add that had the extension of the surtax been in the same act as the reforms, the net effect would have been to increase revenues 
(Bank, Stark, and Thorndike 2008, 140)
Monetary policy was considered to be of secondary importance by the New Economics: a supplement to the main instrument, fiscal policy. Basic interest rates, the Keynesian economists believed, were sticky.
In the extreme case, a "liquidity trap," monetary policy would have no effect on interest rates. Interest rate changes, moreover, could influence the economy only by influencing investment spending, and research had shown that the effect was small. Thus, monetary policy was weak medicine. Nevertheless, it was clear how monetary policy should be used during the first phase of the Kennedy-Johnson administration. Monetary policy should focus on reinforcing the tax cuts by keeping interest rates low and thus increasing investment to the limited extent possible.
In principle the Federal Reserve was independent of the executive branch, and it need not have followed the administration's lead, but as Mr. Dooley might have said, "the Federal Reserve reads the lection returns." The Federal Reserve made an effort to fall in line with the New Economics with "Operation Twist:" it would sell short-term securities and buy long-term securities. The idea was to "twist" the yield curve, the relationship between yields on bonds and their term to maturity. Higher short-term rates (the other side of lower prices for short-term securities) would encourage foreigners to hang on to their dollar accounts, while lower long-term rates would encourage US businesses to invest. Some debate occurred among economists about whether Operation Twist succeeded in influencing the term structure. But there was considerable skepticism 
(Ross 1966;
Holland 1969)
What was behind the relentless rise in the monetary base? Part of the explanation was simply the need to finance government deficits. The federal budget would be in deficit throughout much of the 1960s and the Federal Reserve was poised to purchase some of that debt. Another part of the explanation, especially relevant in the first half of the 1960s, was the consensus among policymakers inside and outside the Federal Reserve that the Federal Reserve should be helping to reduce unemployment. The Federal Reserve discount rate, the rate at which banks could borrow from the Federal Reserve, which was then considered to be a key indicator and instrument of monetary policy, was lowered from 3.50 percent to 3.00 percent in 
August 1960, 290
Policy errors also contributed to the start of the Great Inflation 
(Meltzer 2003, 538-56, and passim)
There was a third string to the Keynesian bow: direct controls over wages and prices. Aggregate demand increases were unlikely, in the Keynesian view, to cause inflation before the economy had reached full employment. But there were other sources of inflation. Powerful unions could push up wages even in slack markets for labor, which in turn would produce higher prices (cost-push inflation), and powerful corporations could push up prices even in slack markets for final Financing the war products (administered inflation). The two together, powerful unions negotiating with powerful corporations, was a formula for inflation. It was important, therefore, to take direct measures to rein in these forms of inflation, which could prevent the economy from reaching the best combination of unemployment and inflation.
Free market economists, led by Milton Friedman, argued that the idea of cost-push or administered inflation was flawed. Firms that maximized profits and unions that maximized some combination of wages and employment wouldn't choose to gradually exploit their market power, thus producing steadily rising prices. Instead they would use their market power as soon as it was won to raise their prices or wages as much as necessary to achieve their long-run goals. Continuing increases in wages and prices were produced by rising aggregate demand. But the Council of Economic Advisors under Walter Heller, and leading Keynesian economists such as Paul Samuelson, Robert Solow, and John Kenneth Galbraith, contended that federal guidelines for acceptable wage and price increases were an important supplement to the fiscal and monetary policies. 
4
The Council didn't call for legally binding wage and price controls similar to those imposed during World War II and the Korean War. Perhaps the lack of consensus supporting the war made extreme measures politically untenable. Instead it suggested something much less disturbing to ordinary business practice: norms of good price and wage behavior to be enforced by the desire of business and labor leaders to be seen as good citizens. Indeed, Walter Heller told the journalist William Safire that he chose the term "guideposts" for use in the Council's reports because it sounded less constricting than guidelines 
(Safire 2008, 297)
(Economic Report of the President 1962, 185-90)
The next few Economic Reports reaffirmed the guidelines and argued that they had contributed to the strong macroeconomic performance of the economy. By 1966, however, the Council was beginning to notice exceptions to guidelines and, seemingly, endorsed more vigorous responses by the government to violations (Economic Report of the President 1966, 78-93). In the 1967 Report the Council 5 A basic principle of economics is that the real wage should equal the marginal product of labor. And under certain assumptions, for example a Cobb-Douglas production function, that means that the real wage will be a linear function of the average productivity of labor. Let W ¼ the wage rate, P ¼ the price level, Q ¼ the amount output, L ¼ the amount of labor, and a ¼ the share of labor in the value of output. Then the real wage W/P ¼ a(Q/L). In terms of constant percentage changes, W% -P% ¼ Q% -L%. For prices to remain stable, P% ¼ 0, and for equilibrium to remain in the labor market, then W% ¼ Q% -L%. This formula also implies, as leftist critics of the policy pointed out, that the share of labor in total income would remain constant.
acknowledged that the guidelines were being violated regularly (Economic Report of the President 1966, 124) and documented the steps that it had taken to enforce them. By 1968 the Council was acknowledging that its guidelines were regularly ignored (Economic Report of the President 1968, 125). The conversation among liberal economists was turning to mandatory forms of "incomes policies" to restrain inflation.
The "New Economics," although rooted in Keynesian economic theory, was, truth to tell, wartime economics, or more exactly, world war economics: deficit spending, cheap money, and wage and price controls to contain inflationary pressures. Of course, adaptations had to be made to peacetime. Spending would be for public works and poverty programs as well as munitions and the wages of military personnel. Price and wage guidelines based on (hoped for) voluntary compliance would be used rather than binding legal constraints. The proof that war economics worked, namely, the then recent experiences of World War II and the Korean War, appeared irrefutable to a generation of Keynesian economists.
Which contributed more to the inflation: the escalation of the war in Vietnam or the new domestic spending initiatives? The spending figures suggest that both contributed but that the war was more important. Between 1960 and 1968 total government spending increased from $92 billion to $178 billion, an increase of 66 percent. Of this increase, 42 percent was the result of civilian spending -new programs and increased spending on existing programs -and 58 percent the result of increased military and international affairs spending.
Vietnam was the fourth bloodiest war in American history, after the Civil War, World War I, and World War II. Some 47,415 Americans died in battle or of wounds sustained in battle; another 10,785 died of diseases and injuries; 58,200 in all (Appendix 2). Australia, New Zealand, the Philippines, and South Korea fought as allies of the United States, and suffered losses as well; South Korea lost more than 5,000 fighters. The losses for the Vietnamese, North and South, were catastrophic. The exact numbers will never be known with certainty. In 2009 the War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh City put the losses for all of Vietnam at 1 million fighters and 2 million 294
The Vietnam War civilians killed, 2 million fighters and civilians injured, and 300,000 missing.

by about $1,163 billion in year 2008 dollars between 1963 and 1973, so the war used up about 47 percent of the growth in the economy. As pointed out in previous cases, the marginal cost calculation is appropriate for answering some, but not all questions about the resource cost of the war. The Vietnam War was part of the larger War against Communism, and it is appropriate to attribute some of the fixed costs of military spending in those years to the Vietnam War, if we want to address the question of whether fighting wars to contain Communism made economic sense. The cumulative difference for the years 1967-74 between actual spending and baseline spending, where the latter is defined as the amount projected on the basis of the share of military spending in the post-Cold War era, was $1,697 billion in year 2008 dollars, 35 percent of average real GDP, and 165 percent of the growth in real GDP. The economy, in other words, grew during the years of the most intense fighting in Vietnam, but all of the increase, and then some, went into the war effort.
The Vietnam War contributed to another problem that plagued the United States during the 1960s: the deterioration in the balance of payments. Partly this was the result of the general fiscal and monetary effects of war spending described above. Rising prices in the United States, combined with a fixed exchange rate, meant that American goods and services were less attractive to foreigners, and it meant that foreign goods were increasingly attractive to American buyers. But the Vietnam War contributed in another and more direct way to the deterioration in the balance of payments: purchases had to be made abroad for transport, food, and other supplies and services that could not be brought from home. Although the balance of trade and services deteriorated during the 1960s, it was always positive. The problem was that the declining balance of trade and services was insufficient to offset the increased outflow of dollars produced by the war. According to a memo from budget director Charles Shultze to President Johnson, all of the increased outflow of dollars in 1966 and 1967 could be accounted for by spending in Southeast Asia on the war 
(Meltzer 2009, 700)
The Vietnam War would encourage foreigners to buy American goods and assets while discouraging Americans from purchasing foreign goods and assets. But the classic remedy was unavailable because American policymakers were committed to full employment. As Alan 
Meltzer (2009, 279)
(Meltzer 2009, 418-20)
Meltzer (2009, 420)
Other countries could have helped the United States solve its balance of payments problems, as was contemplated by the Bretton Woods agreement. One way was by allowing their price levels to rise. Higher foreign prices would increase sales of US goods, which would then be relatively cheaper compared with alternatives produced abroad, and they would also discourage Americans from purchasing goods abroad because the American-made alternative would then be relatively cheaper. Foreign governments could achieve something similar by revaluing their currencies in terms of dollars, that is, by making each unit of a foreign currency equal to more dollars (or since gold was still the intermediate good in these transactions, by raising the price of gold). Foreign central banks that were considering the conversion of The balance of payments and the end of Bretton Woods some of their dollars into gold, as was their prerogative under the Bretton Woods agreement, could also decide to simply hold on to their new dollar reserves. The German and Japanese central banks were persuaded to do so, effectively ending free convertibility of dollars into gold 
(Meltzer 2009, 719
(Meltzer 2009, 363)
Richard Nixon was inaugurated in January 1969. The balance of payments had continued to deteriorate and there was now considerable fear of a run on the dollar. The long economic expansion of the 1960s came to an end in December. The recession was brief, ending in November 1970, and partly as a result of the recession, the rate of inflation began to decline. But the decline was gradual, and an inflation that seemed to be resistant to the normal ebb and flow of business activity remained a major public concern. Things came to a head in the summer of 1971. The balance of trade moved into the red, and internationally, frustration with the United States grew exponentially. Many nations were experiencing inflation and currency problems that were universally assumed to be emanating from the United States. In October 1969 Germany floated and then revalued its currency. In May 1971 seven European nations closed their foreign exchange markets. A number of central banks, moreover, exercised their right under the Bretton Woods agreements to convert their rapidly accumulating dollar reserves into gold. France had converted nearly $200 million into gold and in July 1971 Switzerland converted $50 million. These losses were part of a long-term trend. In 1957 the US stock of monetary gold had stood at $22.9 billion, not far below the postwar peak. But then the gold stock began to erode. By the end of 1970 it had fallen to $11.1 billion 
(Carter et al. 2006, series Cj1)
In the summer of 1971 President Nixon, who would soon face a new election, was suffering from a low standing in the opinion polls because of both the ongoing war in Vietnam and the inflation and related problems at home. Economists had floated various proposals for dealing with the balance of payments problem and the inflation. Some thought that the balance of payments could be addressed by adopting a "crawling peg" which would produce a slow and controlled devaluation of the dollar. Others, most notably Milton Friedman, proposed a flexible exchange rate determined exclusively by market forces.

Eventually, President Nixon, on the advice, mainly, it is said, of his Treasury Secretary, John Connally (a conservative Democrat and former governor of Texas), decided to "go big." From Nixon's point of view it made perfect sense: a bold initiative might renew the economy and his flagging political fortunes. In August 1971 Nixon introduced his "New Economic Policy." It was a four-part plan. First, he "closed the gold window." The United States would no longer convert dollars held by foreign central banks into gold on demand. Second, he placed a temporary tariff on imported goods. Third, wages and prices would be frozen for ninety days. And fourth, he announced a number of tax increases and spending cuts. The narrative supporting these actions portrayed them as temporary measures that would relieve the symptoms while more fundamental reforms were put in place that would return the United States to price stability without controls, a dollar convertible at a fixed rate into gold, and balanced international trade. The price and wage controls were eventually lifted, although only after passing through a series of phases, and after four years, not ninety days. The fixed exchange rate system that had prevailed since the end of World War II, the Bretton Woods system, would never be revived. The system, I should be clear, did not disappear instantly when Nixon adopted his new policy. A commitment to some form of fixed exchange rates survived for another year and a half. In December 1971 the so-called Smithsonian Agreement (the conference was at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington) was reached that continued fixed exchange rates with the leading currencies revaluing against the dollar. This system limped along through succeeding crises until March 1973 when the attempt to maintain fixed exchange rates was finally abandoned. As the monetary historian Anna J. 
Schwartz put it (1987, 350)
The Vietnam War would drag on, as discussed above, until a final peace treaty was signed in January 1973. But President Nixon's policy of reducing the number of Americans on the ground in Vietnam and turning over the fighting to the South Vietnamese while increasing the bombing of North Vietnam and the supply routes to the south -"Vietnamizing" the war -made possible a decrease in the amount spent on it (Figure

It turns out, then, that the current international financial system is a byproduct of war. Before World War I the gold standard reigned supreme. The inflations of that war led to abandonment of the gold standard during the conflict. There were fitful attempts to restore it during the 1920s but these were largely discontinued in the 1930s. The inflations of World War II led to the abandonment of what was left of the old gold standard, and the attempt to establish a new system, the Bretton Woods system, that would produce some of the benefits of the gold standard, while avoiding the costs. International cooperation through agencies such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank was the byword of the day. The inflations of the Vietnam era led to the discontinuance of the Bretton Woods system and the establishment of a new international financial system based on flexible exchange rates.
The Vietnam War led to the end of conscription. This was a return to the nineteenth-century norm. The United States had drafted soldiers in major wars, but relied on volunteers to fight smaller wars or to provide a peacetime force. Soldiers were drafted during the Revolutionary War and an attempt was made to establish a draft during the War of 1812, but it failed. Volunteers made up the expeditionary force that fought the Mexican War, many of them drawn to service by substantial land grants. Both the North and the South imposed a draft to fill the ranks during the Civil War. After that conflict, however, the United States relied on volunteers to fight the wars with Native Americans, the Spanish-American War, and the Philippine-American War. It again imposed a draft during World War I, but returned to a volunteer army in the 1920s and 1930s. A draft was used again in World War II. The United States might well have returned to a volunteer army after World War II, but things were different in 1950 when the Korean War began. That war followed closely on the heels of World War II, so it was natural to utilize the system that had been in place a few years earlier. Moreover, while the war was being fought at that moment only against North Korea, there was a distinct possibility that it would escalate into a Third World War against the Soviet Union and China. After Korea, the draft remained in place as a warning to the Communist powers that the country was prepared for war. The Vietnam War, like the Korean War, was a limited war fought with drafted personnel.
The draft stirred up a hornet's nest of opposition, especially on college campuses. In May 1966 students at many colleges across the nation staged "sit-ins." They were protesting the war, and especially the role of their colleges in facilitating the draft. The draft was seen by the young protesters as a political enabler of war-making, a source of cheap "cannon fodder." Ironically, during the Afghanistan and Iraq wars the opposite argument was made: the draft increased political opposition to the war by making a wide range of young people eligible; a volunteer armed force minimized opposition to the war.
The anti-draft and anti-war movements were closely entwined and it was hard to know how much of the opposition was to the war and how much to the draft.

Oi had already (1967)
The draft, as the Gates Commission contended, imposed three kinds of costs on draftees. Consider, first, the case of a volunteer whose opportunity costs in the private sector are less than what he earns in the military.
9
Consider next the reluctant volunteer or draftee who would not serve in the absence of a draft simply because his opportunity cost in the private sector was higher. He could earn, say, $30,000 in the private sector, but earns only $25,000 in the military. If we make the usual assumption that the individual's wage equals his or her marginal product, then society is forgoing $30,000 in output, but counting only $25,000 in increased government spending. The difference of $5,000 is not a transfer; it is a true loss of output, again a cost that is hidden from the taxpayer.
Finally, consider the reluctant volunteer or draftee who has a strong distaste for the military, perhaps based on the rigors of military life, or perhaps based on moral concerns about a particular war or about war in general. This individual pays a heavy price when he is drafted because he is not being compensated for his distaste for military service. Military pay of $25,000 may represent his opportunity cost, but he would require a salary of $40,000 to compensate for his loss of income in the private sector and the "disutility" of military service. In this case the measured output of the economy is not reduced by more than $25,000, but the total "utility" produced by the nation's resources is clearly reduced.
One famous case that illustrated some of these costs was that of the champion heavyweight boxer Muhammad Ali. In 1967, then at the height of his boxing career, he was drafted, but he refused to serve on the grounds that he was a conscientious objector to the war. Ali's case threw both the economic and ethical dilemmas of the draft into sharp relief: he could earn far more as a boxer than as a soldier, and he didn't believe in the war he was being drafted to fight.
The draft was continued for two more years. In the interim, military pay was raised and aggressive television advertising to attract army recruits was begun. In January 1973 Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird announced the end of the draft.
Although the draft was ended as a result of the Vietnam War, there were still veterans who had to be rewarded for their service.

The Vietnam War
This conflict started August 2nd when the dictator of Iraq invaded a small and helpless neighbor. Kuwait -a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations -was crushed; its people, brutalized. Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait. Tonight, the battle has been joined. The United States and a large group of allies were at war with Iraq between January 12, 1991, when the US House and Senate authorized the use of force against Iraq, and March 3, 1991, when Iraq accepted a ceasefire. The purpose of the war was to expel Iraq from Kuwait, which the former had invaded and conquered in August 1990. In some ways the Persian Gulf War resembled the Spanish-American War, the first phase of the Philippine-American War, and the first phase of the Korean War: an aggressive and well-planned American strike overwhelmed the forces of a smaller nation trying to fight a conventional war against the United States. Approximately 2.2 million Americans served in the war, employing massive amounts of munitions.

The Persian Gulf War its neighbor. The Iraqis claimed that Kuwait was historically part of their nation, and also, with some truth, that it had been created as a separate country after World War I by Great Britain to further British strategic interests. The Iraqis also claimed that Kuwait was violating the quotas on oil production authorized by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to which both Kuwait and Iraq belonged. Violation of the quota by Kuwait, Iraq alleged, had contributed to the fall in world oil prices that was hurting Iraq, whose major export was oil. Iraq, moreover, was desperately short of funds after fighting a long and destructive war with Iran. Indeed, Kuwait had lent its neighbour substantial sums during that war, and Iraq wanted the relatively rich Kuwaitis to forgive the debt. It also claimed that Kuwait had stolen oil directly from its territory by drilling wells that slanted across the border 
(Halliday 1991, 226-7)
Attempts to mediate a non-military resolution failed. On August 2, 1990 Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait. After several days of hard fighting they overwhelmed the Kuwaitis and took full control. Hussein then installed his first cousin, Ali Hassan al-Majid, as governor. Ali Hassan had been dubbed "Chemical Ali" by the Iraqi Kurds because he had authorized the use of chemical weapons against them. The attack on Kuwait was an act of aggression that would have angered the United States even if both Iraq and Kuwait had been resource-poor nations. But the United States had a strong economic motive for being especially concerned: Iraq was the fourth nation in proven oil reserves after Saudi Arabia, Canada, and Iran. Add the massive Kuwaiti reserves and Iraq would be second. And if it were to go on and take the Saudi oil fields that lay close to Kuwait, Iraq would emerge as an immensely powerful economic actor on the world stage, controlling about 40 percent of the world's proven oil reserves.
Immediately after the invasion the administration of George H. W. Bush began a diplomatic offensive to expel the Iraqis. On August 6, 1990 the United Nations Security Council authorized economic sanctions against the country. The sanctions banned most trade with Iraq, including in oil; only humanitarian aid was permitted. On August 12 President Bush ordered a naval blockade to enforce the sanctions, an action that met some resistance within the United States, from other countries, and from the United Nations. Since Iraq's oil reached the rest of the world by ship from ports in Iraq, Turkey, and Saudi Arabia, a naval blockade was a credible threat,

Engerman 2003, 2006;
Hufbauer et al. 1990
In the months that followed Americans debated the effectiveness of the blockade. Supporters of continued reliance on the blockade pointed to concrete signs that it was imposing costs on the Iraqis, simple things like breadlines and the failure of elevators to work in Baghdad. But skeptics maintained that sympathetic neighbors -Jordan, Syria, and Turkey -provided a link to the outside world that was bound to grow stronger over time. Even if these countries were unwilling to trade openly with Iraq, they would provide the crucial links to the rest of the world by allowing smugglers to function unchecked. And the skeptics pointed out that because Saddam Hussein wielded dictatorial powers, he could isolate his regime and his armed forces from the pain being imposed on Iraqi society at large. Even if some Iraqis went hungry, the army would not.
President Bush, growing impatient with Iraqi intransigence and concerned about his ability to hold his military coalition together, threatened to use force to expel the Iraqis from Kuwait if they did not leave by January 15. He then sought an authorization for this from Congress. For supporters of the President the time for action had come. Former President Richard Nixon, typifying the hawkish view, argued that with the vast oil wealth of Iraq and Kuwait behind him, Hussein would go on to larger and larger wars of aggression. Fighting now would save lives in the long run (New York Times, January 6, 1991, E19). Opponents, many of whom were concerned about the costs of the war in life and treasure and about American relations with other countries in the Mideast, urged that more time should be allowed for economic sanctions and diplomacy to work. On January 12, 1991 the US House, by a vote of 250-183 and the US Senate by a vote of 52-47, authorized the use of force to expel Iraq from Kuwait, effectively a declaration of war. It was the narrowest margin of victory for a declaration of war since the War of 1812.
The United States, although contributing the bulk of the forces, formed a substantial Coalition. Some were America's traditional allies: Britain, which contributed some 43,000 troops, and (next in order of troops committed) France, Australia, New Zealand, the Netherlands, South Korea, and Canada. The Coalition also included a number of states from eastern Europe that could not have joined with the United States during the Cold War: Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and 308
The Persian Gulf War Romania. Importantly, the Coalition also included a number of Middle Eastern and North African states: Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Egypt, Qatar, Morocco, Syria, Turkey, and the United Arab Emirates.
The marginal costs of the Gulf War (costs in excess of normal military expenditures) incurred during the period of active fighting were relatively low. For the most part, the United States relied on munitions accumulated over the course of the Cold War with the Soviet Union and China which was ending at the same time as it was going to war with Iraq. Total military spending was only $25 billion higher in fiscal 1992 than in fiscal 1991. The Department of Defense placed the total cost of Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm at $61 billion (US Department of Defense 1992, 60). Much of this was offset by contributions from five allies as shown in Table 
10
Operation Desert Storm began on January 16, 1991 with a massive aerial bombardment of Iraqi forces and supporting bases in Iraq and Kuwait. 2 Thus the war opened in a way reminiscent of the Spanish-American War, with which we began our story of America's twentiethcentury wars, which began with a naval attack at Guantanamo Bay. Just as the Spanish navy and naval fortresses were unable to cope with the larger, technically advanced navy of the United States, Iraq's air force and ground-based air defenses were unable to cope with the Coalition air force. The United States and its allies were able to hit the Iraqis with attack helicopters, drones, B-52 long-range bombers firing cruise missiles, naval vessels firing Tomahawk missiles, electric jamming support aircraft, and a variety of jet aircraft firing missiles and dropping laser-guided and conventional gravity bombs. The Iraqi air force could do little in reply. It tried as best it could to protect its capital by dispersing aircraft (including placing them near archaeological sites), by secreting aircraft in hardened shelters (which proved vulnerable to Coalition munitions), and eventually by flying some to safety in Iran. The only offensive operation undertaken by the Iraqis was an attempt by two Iraqi jets to (possibly) attack Coalition ships in the Persian Gulf, but they were shot down by Saudi aircraft 
(Keaney and Cohen 1993, 37)
Keaney and Cohen (1993)
The Persian Gulf War put pressure on predominantly Islamic states to quit the coalition.
In late February a Scud warhead hit a US barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia killing twenty-eight and wounding ninety-seven. Despite a major effort by the Coalition air forces, however, the Iraqis were able to continue to launch Scuds throughout the war. Most of the 100,000 sorties flown by US planes were against targets that most observers would probably agree were legitimate military targets 
(Keaney and Cohen 1993, 184)
(Keaney and Cohen 1993, 22)
Pressure therefore mounted for an immediate ground assault. Coalition forces led by US General H. Norman Schwarzkopf launched a full-scale ground attack on February 23. Schwarzkopf sent a large Coalition force around the right side of the Iraqi lines, a powerful and decisive "left hook." The Iraqi forces were overwhelmed with a great loss of life. On February 26, they began to retreat from Kuwait City and many were killed by Coalition air strikes on what became known as the "Highway of Death." On February 28, President Bush declared Kuwait liberated. Coalition forces, of course, might have continued the attack, destroyed the remnants of Hussein's armed forces, and
The course of the war deposed Hussein. But the Bush administration, mindful of the opposition to the occupation of Iraq by US allies, especially its Arab allies, and of the difficulties that would ensue if Coalition forces attempted to occupy the country, instead offered a ceasefire. This was accepted on March 3, bringing a short and decisive war to a close. A victory parade was held in Washington, DC on June 8.
There were only 147 battle deaths of Americans in the Persian Gulf War. The closest analogue is the war that began our story, the Spanish-American War, when the United States suffered 385 combat deaths (Appendix 2). America's allies also suffered relatively few battle deaths. The small number of casualties resulted from a number of factors: the technological superiority of American and Coalition arms and the training and skill of American and Coalition enlisted troops and officers. The clear skies and barren deserts of the Middle East, moreover, gave full scope to America's advantage in air and tank power. Unlike North Korea and North Vietnam, which had the backing of the Soviet Union and China, Iraq was going it alone. And the United States had the initiative: the ability to plan and coordinate the counterattack against the positions the Iraqis had taken after occupying Kuwait. The Persian Gulf War resembled the phase of the Korean War that followed the landing at Inchon when American forces were able to drive back the North Korean forces. Unlike North Korea, however, the Iraqis had no allies like the Chinese who would enter on their side and reverse the tide of war. Chess players strive to prepare their opening moves and surprise their opponent with a "technical novelty," a move not known to the experts that they have carefully analyzed beforehand. The Coalition was in a similar position when it launched its counterstrike against the Iraqis.
The 147 battle deaths, to be sure, were only part of the story. There were another 235 deaths from injuries and disease, and there were other deaths outside the theater of war. Some of the latter would have occurred in any case, but some, such as accidents caused by the pressure to move supplies quickly, were the result of the war. Some of the deaths due to rushing occurred outside the war zone. Coalition partners also suffered relatively small numbers of casualties by historical standards. Britain, next after the United States in terms of 312
The Persian Gulf War casualties, lost 47 soldiers. The loss of life in Iraq, however, civilian as well as military, was substantial. The exact number will probably never be known. The Iraqi administrative bureaucracies broke down during the war, and the United States, chastened by the bad publicity stemming from its emphasis on "body counts" during the Vietnam War, refused to count enemy losses. Aerial bombing, moreover, can produce large losses that are hard to measure. And the Muslim tradition which emphasizes the rapid burial of the dead may also have influenced knowledge about Iraqi losses.
In the wake of the war there was considerable controversy about the long-term consequences for the health of the veterans. 
3
From the first, Persian Gulf War veterans reported that they were sick, and suspicion fell on various toxic substances to which they had been exposed, but the variety of symptoms, and the failure of initial medical and epidemiological studies to pinpoint a culprit, produced frustration and, in some quarters, skepticism about whether Gulf War Illness was a real phenomenon. Since most veterans were exposed to multiple toxins, unraveling the cause of Gulf War Illness was particularly difficult: if exposure to toxin A was highly correlated with exposure to toxin B, a study that considered only A might conclude that A was the cause, when the true cause was B. Over time, however, research gradually clarified the nature of the illness and the role of various potential causes. One early theory was that Gulf War Illness was a form of post-traumatic stress syndrome, variants of which have been observed after most conflicts, although the name has changed: after the Civil War there was "Da Costa's syndrome;" in World War I, shell shock; World War II, battle fatigue; and the Vietnam War, posttraumatic stress syndrome. The Persian Gulf War was no exception. Veterans suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome, although in smaller numbers than did veterans of the Vietnam War. However, wartime stress did not turn out to be a major cause of Gulf War Illness.
Another concern was exposure to depleted uranium. This is an extremely dense and heavy metal that is used in armor plating and armor-piercing shells. Not only do shells incorporating depleted uranium penetrate armor, but they also burst into flames after contact, potentially igniting fuel and ammunition, and making shells containing depleted uranium particularly effective as an anti-tank munition. The Persian Gulf War was the first in which significant amounts of depleted uranium were used. It is not the only material useful for these purposes -ceramics can be used in armor plating and tungsten can be used in armor-piercing shells -but depleted uranium is very effective and substantial amounts are available as a byproduct of the production of nuclear weapons and fuel for nuclear reactors. The long-term problem is that depleted uranium is toxic and radioactive, although it is not as radioactive as naturally occurring uranium. In the course of the war, many soldiers on both sides were exposed to the substance, raising health concerns, for example increased rates of kidney and brain cancer. Since the depleted uranium remained on the battlefield, civilians were affected after the war. However, the evidence, so far, seems to be that exposure to depleted uranium was not the primary cause of Gulf War Illness.
As they left Kuwait, Iraqi forces allowed oil to drain into the Persian Gulf from the Sea Island Terminal near Kuwait City; they also released oil from oil tankers and ignited more than six hundred oil wells. The result was an environmental disaster. This was not the first case of environmental damage in wartime: the destruction of farms and forests in World War I, the use of atomic bombs in World War II, and the use of chemical defoliants in the Vietnam War, all produced extensive environmental damage. But growing concern about the environment focused public attention on this wanton destruction in a way that perhaps previous violations of the environment had not. Igniting the oil wells 314
The Persian Gulf War and despoiling the Gulf served little military purpose beyond reinforcing the credibility of the Hussein regime's most violent threats. It was suggested, moreover, that exposure to the smoke from burning oil wells might have been a cause of Gulf War Illness. But again, although personnel exposed to burning oil fumes suffered from long-run health effects, such as increased rates of asthma, fumes from burning oil wells did not appear to have been the major cause of Gulf War Illness. Instead of the candidates on which attention first focused, two toxic chemicals appear to have caused Gulf War Illness: pyridostigmine bromide pills and pesticides. Pyridostigmine bromide pills were given to soldiers to protect them against nerve agents that it was thought that the Iraqis were prepared to use against Coalition troops. Soldiers deployed in Iraq regularly sprayed their uniforms with pesticides, and insect repellants such as DEET. The best evidence currently is that these two agents were the primary cause of Gulf War Illness. It also appears that there was an interaction effect: use of both pyridostigmine bromide pills and pesticides produced a larger effect than the sum of the separate effects.
As with the Spanish-American and Philippine-American wars, the incremental cost of the Persian Gulf War was small compared with the likely cost in terms of veterans' service benefits. The measure included in Appendix 3, of course, is conjectural, and the reality may be very different. But if 
Edwards's (2010)
| The American economic way of war
There is a great deal of ruin in a nation.
War played a major role in shaping the American economy in the twentieth century.
1
If we include only the major hot wars, and use the official dates, then the United States was at war for roughly a quarter of the twentieth century. If we include the long Cold War, the figure rises to 55 percent. If we were to include the many smaller conflicts, the proportion of years in the twentieth century when American forces were fighting somewhere in the world would be still higher. To be sure, wars have produced many benefits. Few Americans would have been willing to contemplate the success of the Fascist nations, the most likely outcome had the United States remained neutral in World War II. The long war against Communism encompassing the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War remains far more controversial. But here too, one can count benefits from the decisions to go to war. But wars have also been extremely costly, perhaps more so than is generally realized because politicians often do the best they can to hide the costs of war. The loss of life and limb, however, cannot be hidden, and it is this cost that explains why it is so hard to persuade the American people, who ultimately hold the reins of power, to go to war. As much as a political elite might believe that going to war is in the national interest, and as much as special interests might push for it for pecuniary reasons, ultimately if there is to be a war, the American people must be persuaded that war, and the human costs it brings, are justified by the need to protect people who are in danger in some other part of the world or to avenge a direct attack on the United States, a casus belli. The explosion of the battleship Maine before the Spanish-American War, the sinking of American ships by German submarines before World War I, Pearl Harbor, the attack by North Korea on South Korea, the Tonkin Gulf incident, and so on were more than mere historical markers, they were crucial to enlisting public support for war. In his recent book Empire (2004) historian Niall Ferguson argues that the United States has replaced Britain as the world's imperialist hegemon. It is America's role, whether it wants it or not, to impose its view of the correct world order, American-style democratic capitalism, on the rest of the world: always by example, usually by trade, and occasionally by war. Ferguson sees this as a good thing. The British empire, he argues -despite slavery, the slave trade, and other brutalities visited on peoples around the world -was better than the alternative empires would have been. But Ferguson's argument is designed to persuade an elite. Persuading the American people to take on such a role will not be easy; the American public demands an honorable reason for taking up arms.
Once the decision to go to war was made, the question of how to pay for it soon followed. And wars turned out to be far costlier in economic terms than was acknowledged during the time when the decision to go to war was being debated in the lofty languages of chivalry and honor; during the period when, as it is rightly put, the nation was caught up in a "war fever." On first thought, it might seem that for a rich nation such as the United States the answer about how to finance wars would be simple: raise taxes sufficiently high to pay for the war. And taxes were raised, as shown in the preceding chapters, in most of the wars of the twentieth century, an honorable tradition. But tax increases make the cost of war painfully obvious to the general public and undermine support for it. So governments typically resorted in part to means of finance that concealed the economic cost of war from the general public. The first choice for this purpose was debt finance. Issuing debt may alarm the cognoscenti who anticipate higher future taxes and may observe changes in interest rates on different types of debt, but debt finance for a rich nation with considerable credit may not be well observed by the ordinary citizen. Adam Smith's splendid statement of how debt finance hides the cost
The American economic way of war of war from the average taxpayer, although written with Britain's eighteenth-century colonial wars in mind, is still timely:
The ordinary expense of the greater part of modern governments in time of peace being equal or nearly equal to their ordinary revenue, when war comes they are both unwilling and unable to increase their revenue in proportion to the increase of their expense. They are unwilling for fear of offending the people, who, by so great and so sudden an increase of taxes, would soon be disgusted with the war; and they are unable from not well knowing what taxes would be sufficient to produce the revenue wanted. The facility of borrowing delivers them from the embarrassment which this fear and inability would otherwise occasion. By means of borrowing they are enabled, with a very moderate increase of taxes, to raise, from year to year, money sufficient for carrying on the war, and by the practice of perpetual funding they are enabled, with the smallest possible increase of taxes, to raise annually the largest possible sum of money.

During World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War the government turned to wage and price controls, rationing, and production controls to suppress inflation. These devices made it easier to draw resources into the war sector. To the extent that controls were effective in suppressing inflation they served to further conceal the costs of the war. At times, controls produced the usual (and some not so usual) symptoms of suppressed inflation: quality deterioration, black markets, and forced uptrading (the elimination of low-priced, lowprofit lines of merchandise). Such symptoms were a sign of the costs of the war, but they were not likely to produce a clear appreciation of the tradeoffs implicit in the decision to go to war. These developments could always be seen as the product of the poor administration of controls or a lack of patriotism, rather than as an inevitable result of the decision to allocate a substantial fraction of the nation's resources to the war effort, and to finance the transfer by borrowing from the public or creating money rather than raising taxes.
The draft, which was used during World War I, World War II, the Korean War, part of the Cold War, and the Vietnam War, also served to conceal the full cost of war. The public, it is true, saw the disruption of the lives of the young people who were drafted, but when the tax bill arrived they were unlikely to reflect that it would have been higher had they agreed to compensate the draftees at a rate equal to what they could have earned in private markets, let alone a rate that might have compensated them for the dangers they faced, or the skills that they did not develop when they were at war.
True, the tradition of rewarding veterans with compensation and pensions had been well established since colonial times and could be expected to continue. As we have seen, veterans' benefits often amounted to a substantial portion of the costs of war, sometimes more than the costs incurred during the years of conflict. But veterans' benefits were "unfunded liabilities;" no taxes were dedicated to these expenditures, and these future costs were not likely to have had much of an impact on public debates when the decision to go to war was being made.
The wars of the twentieth century trace an arc of violence. 3 The century began with small, colonial wars in Cuba and the Philippines. America's enemies had limited resources and few allies, and could be defeated by devoting a small but significant share of America's resources to fighting them. The war in Cuba produced some opposition in the United States. But it was widely viewed as just because of the sinking of the battleship Maine and the violence of Spanish attempts to maintain control in Cuba, and the victory was quick. The Philippine-American War, however, produced far more opposition. Its purpose was less easily defended, and the tactics employed to suppress the Philippine revolutionaries were often as brutal as those that had aroused so much opposition when employed by Spain in Cuba.
America then experienced the world wars, wars that required extensive mobilization of the economy. Both, however, garnered considerable public support. This was especially true of World War II, which was widely regarded as "the good war." Pearl Harbor provided a clear casus belli, and the Fascist governments were an enemy on which almost everyone could agree. After World War II America began its long war to contain Communism: the Korean War, the Cold War, and the Vietnam War, in terms of resources the most expensive in American history. Costs were heavy and outcomes unclear. Opposition to the Vietnam War was especially intense.
At the end of the century America undertook distant colonial wars that remind us of the wars that began the century. The Persian Gulf War (1991) reminds us of nothing so much as the Spanish-American War. The cause was justified by sympathy for the Kuwaitis. America's chivalrous instincts were aroused. The war was short, battle deaths and wounds were few, on the same order as those incurred in the Spanish-American War, and the outcome was a clear victory: another "splendid little war." But the wars in which the US is engaged as this is written (2011) in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya, bear more of the hallmarks of the Philippine-American War that followed the Spanish-American War. During this later war opposition mounted as Americans found themselves enmeshed in a long war against insurgents using guerilla tactics, and one in which American forces employed cruel tactics to extract information and bring the enemy to battle. The history of the wars in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Libya is still being written. A few years ago Joseph E.

Were America's wars fought for economic reasons?
There are, of course, many other important questions about the impact of wars on the American economy. It has been suggested, for example, that wars have produced important scientific and technological breakthroughs, that they have improved the status of women and minorities, and that they have fundamentally expanded the role of the federal government in the economy. In this book, in the discussions of individual wars there is considerable material that relates to these questions, but they are not covered in detail.

Perhaps the most important factor favoring the Americans, most historians agree, was the naval blockade. This restricted the access of the insurgents to weapons and food, and prevented insurgents on different islands from cooperating, even when differences in language and religion did not. Sometimes the insurgents had to rely on the bolo. Even when they had rifles, perhaps captured from the Spanish or the Americans, their ammunition was often locally made and ineffective.
2 The insurgency had a number of homegrown problems. Aguinaldo had sought to inspire the insurgents by stressing that Bryan and his supporters favored independence for the Philippines. He may well have believed that Bryan's triumph was likely. While this may have been an effective strategy for a time, Bryan's defeat then undermined morale. Many of the leaders in the insurgency, moreover, were drawn from the wealthy landowning class. Therefore, the insurgency lacked the promise, explicit in later Communist revolutions, that a successful war would produce a redistribution of land and an improvement in the standard of living of the
peasantry. 3 It also appears that "attraction and chastisement" was effective. It is the latter part of the equation that is the most controversial. Did the United States succeed because it employed brutal tactics such as

Veterans' organizations, and their ability to lobby for pensions, were nothing new. The Grand Army of the Republic, a veterans' organization for Union veterans of the Civil War, had been instrumental in pushing for an enlargement of the Civil War pension. The Veterans of Foreign Wars had worked hard on behalf of the veterans of the Spanish-American War and the other conflicts of that era. The veterans of World War I, of course, were well aware of these precedents.

By "perpetual funding" Smith was referring to the issue of consols: bonds that did not promise redemption on a particular date but rather promised a fixed rate of interest each year. The alternative that he had in mind was a funded debt, in which the debt was due in a certain number of years, and taxes were raised sufficiently high not only to cover the interest, but also to gradually pay down the debt before the final redemption date. Conceivably, the government could have perpetually funded itself by continually "rolling over" short-term debt, but this might have risked disruptions of the capital market when debt was refunded.

The Korean War
When World War II ended, Americans breathed a collective sigh of relief: the war was over -the job was done. Five years later, however, they found themselves at war again. It began as a war against a second-tier power, like the Spanish-American War. But in the background was the potential that it would become a war against one of the major Communist powers, a fear that was realized, and the potential even for it to become World War III.
The Korean War erupted with unexpected fury in the summer of 1950: Communist North Korea invaded non-Communist South Korea on June 25, 1950, capturing Seoul, the capital and most important urban area, three days later. There was a history behind this attack: North Korea and South Korea had long been on a collision course. In 1948 the Communists in North Korea adopted a constitution which they claimed applied to all of Korea, while elections were held in US-controlled South Korea. The following year, the United States, convinced that the situation in Korea had stabilized, withdrew most of its troops. Sources:

The postwar fate of Vietnam is determined at a conference at Geneva: Vietnam will be temporarily divided in two parts and an election will be held to determine the final form of government. The Vietnam War of unemployment stood at 6.6 percent. The right medicine, according to Kennedy's economic advisors, was a strong dose of fiscal stimulus in the form of increased spending or tax reductions and an accommodating monetary policy. This was Keynesian economics, the "New Economics" as the media was to style it (for example, New York Times, January 29, 1965, 28). Pushing the economy to a lower rate of unemployment might, it was true, raise the rate of inflation. But the tradeoff, known as the Phillips Curve after economist A. W. Phillips, a New Zealander, was permanent: a permanently lower rate of unemployment implied a permanently higher, but not rising, rate of inflation. And in the circumstances then prevailing the Kennedy economists were certain they knew which way the economy should be moved. If the rate of unemployment could be permanently lowered from 6.6 percent to, say, 4.0 percent at the cost of raising the rate of inflation, which then stood at 1.4 percent, to, say, a permanent 3 percent per year, surely that was worthwhile given the much greater social cost of high unemployment.
