The overwhelming success of the US-led coalition in the 1991 Gulf War provided lessons for China and Russia.
Following a slow build-up of massive military might, the coalition rapidly dismantled Saddam Hussein's air defenses, liberated Kuwait, and destroyed the Iraqi armed forces.
The US military appeared to hold an unchallengeable, all-domain, military superiority.
For decades, they could deploy forces globally and operate uncontested.
Chinese and Russian planners took this as a compelling illustration of how not to fight the United States and set about developing alternative strategies.1 7F
