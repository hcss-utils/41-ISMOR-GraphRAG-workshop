Indeed, while many of its European neighbors have almost completely disarmed, the Russians have begun a military buildup, in part to redress the desperately lean years of the 1990s, when the collapse of the post-Soviet economy devastated its military forces.
Since 2001, they have quadrupled their military budget with increases of over 20% per annum over the past several years.
In 2007, the Russian parliament, with Putin's enthusiastic support, approved even greater military appropriations through 2015.
Russia cannot recreate the military machine of the old Soviet Union, but it may be attempting to make up for demographic and conventional military inferiority by modernizing its nuclear forces, including warheads, delivery systems, and doctrines.
It is also exploring and fielding strategic systems based on what it terms "new physical principles" including novel stealth and hypersonic technologies.
With their vast and increasingly capable nuclear arsenal, the Russians remain a superpower in nuclear terms, despite their demographic and political difficulties.
