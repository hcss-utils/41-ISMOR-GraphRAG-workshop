As the United States enters the 21st century and recovers from the devastating attacks on its homeland on September 11, 2001, it must reevaluate and determine what its true strategic interests are in the world and where best to focus its military capabilities.
Throughout history the United States and its allies have built mutually supporting relationships that have offered stability and security throughout several regions in the world.
US forces stationed abroad play a large role in securing US vital interests in historical zones of conflict.
In particular, the nexus of US vital interests in Asia is Northeast Asia because of the presence of five traditionally warring powers there: North and South Korea, Japan, Russia and China.
