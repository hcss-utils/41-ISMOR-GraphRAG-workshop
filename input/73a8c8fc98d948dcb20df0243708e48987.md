The invasion of Georgia served multiple purposes for Russia.
For one, it allowed the conventional forces to exercise their forces and gain pride and confidence after they were an organization of such little expectation less than a decade earlier.
It also prevented Georgia from becoming a NATO member.
Ten years after the 2008 war, Russia continues to emphasize that "NATO is encroaching on and surrounding Russia; and if Georgia becomes a member, this could provoke a terrible conflict."
88 Arguably the most significant result of the invasion is that it highlighted concerns of the legitimacy of partnerships with western powers, and as Mark Galeotti highlights, "no one was willing to go to war for Georgia."
89 In today's diplomatic environment, the lack of western response to Russia's actions discredits the United States and the legitimacy of their partnership.
These military actions create significant messaging for Russia and their allies, to maintain their status within great power competition.
Putin's use of these privatized contractors, in conjunction with information operations and diplomacy, are consistent with an active measures strategy.
