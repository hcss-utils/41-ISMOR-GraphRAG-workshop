The annexation of Schleswig-Holstein by Prussia induced a chain of events that inevitably led towards war with Austria and the sovereign duchies of Bavaria, Hanover, Saxony, Hesse-Cassel, WÃ¼rttemberg, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt and Nassau.
Prussia continued to improve and to build up its army, and by 1866 its armed forces comprised of nine army corps or 335,000 men under arms and an additional 265,000 men in the Landwehr.
All soldiers were equipped with the needle-gun breech loader rifle and the artillery had received 6-pounder and 4-pounder steel breech loading guns.
