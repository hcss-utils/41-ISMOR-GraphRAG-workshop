The next factor that influenced the Russian operational approach was the asymmetries in conventional capabilities between Russia and Western countries.
The 2008 war indicated that Russia would be at a disadvantage in a conventional war with a Western army.
The question that probably arose in the minds of Russian strategists after this war was how could Russia conventionally confront a Western military of a much bigger size and equally or better trained than Georgia?
In a potential confrontation with NATO, Russia would not have such a numerical advantage to overcome capabilities asymmetries.
Nuclear weapons served well as a deterrent.
