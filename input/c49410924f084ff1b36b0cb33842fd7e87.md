In conjunction with an effective cyber campaign, the Russians took full advantage of local discontent among Russian speakers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia to promote internal opposition that diverted national governments and created a permanent (internal) front, very similar to the partisans of World War II who operated behind German lines.
Through these partisans, Russia empowered the regimes in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and pursued aggressive information operations in both territories to create Georgia as an enemy among the local population.
Russia also attempted to change the ethnic landscape in Abkhazia by bringing Russian military personal and their families to reside in Abkhazia, therefore creating the basis for long-term influence.
