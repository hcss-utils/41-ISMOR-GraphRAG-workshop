159 "Thermobaric munitions are those munitions that, by design produce more heat and overpressure than conventional explosives by exploding a vapor in the blast zone.
Their main use initially was in airborne fuel-air explosive bombs.
Whilst the United States has concentrated on airborne weapons, Russia has produced thermobaric weapons and warheads, from airborne bombs to rifle grenades."
Additional information on the history and medical effects of thermobaric munitions (to include the above quote) can be found in David Anders article. "
Thermobaric Munitions and Their Medical Effects," published in the Australian Military Medicine.
