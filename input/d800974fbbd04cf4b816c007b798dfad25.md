As a consequence of the retrogressive policy and the decision to go to war only after Russia and Austria were already beaten, the Prussian Army lost the war against France and was occupied by Napoleon Bonaparte.
The defeat led to the Peace Agreement of Tilsit in July 1807, which was a heavy burden.
The Prussian territory shrank from 5,570 square miles with 9,752,731 inhabitants to 2,877 square miles with 4,938,000 inhabitants.
