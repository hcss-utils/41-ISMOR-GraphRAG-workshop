The Russian military is experienced, trained, equipped, and well-positioned to fight in the Arctic.
The country's investment in Arctic operational capabilities will enable its military forces to operate and sustain themselves for extended periods of time, year-round, in isolated locations in the Arctic-particularly in the Russian Arctic.
Increased infrastructure interconnectedness between northwest Russia, Norway, and Finland will facilitate sustainment of forward-deployed Russian ground forces should a conflict occur.
Multiple formations are permanently stationed in the Arctic and other units train in the Arctic yearround.
High-latitude rotations are routine, rather than exceptional.
Investment in icebreakers, primarily meant to support economic interests, also means Russia will be able to challenge or exert sea control year-round, as well as project and sustain power across Arctic waters to a significantly greater extent than any of its rivals.
Consequently, Russia would have significant advantages within its territory and against any individual European Arctic country because of force strength, prepositioning, purpose-designed equipment, and extended ability to communicate and maneuver.
