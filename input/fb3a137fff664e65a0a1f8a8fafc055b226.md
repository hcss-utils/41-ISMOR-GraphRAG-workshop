The rivalries studied in this work that de-escalated over time did so as a result of the rise of a more dangerous threat, exempting, of course, those rivalries where one side was totally defeated or eradicated.
It helped if the rivals shared a common outlook as to the nature of the world order and its political order.
For instance, it was much easier for Britain to put aside its rivalries with France and the United States as the German threat arose, for all three nations-Britain, France, the United States-shared civilizational bonds dating back to their Greco-Roman heritage, as well as a collective Judeo-Christian outlook.
On the other side stood the Hapsburgs.
Long after the Ottomans had ceased to be a serious military danger, the Hapsburgs found it difficult to refocus their attention toward the perils in the West, the far more serious threats from Prussia and France.
At least some measure of this reluctance must be based in the profound cultural and civilizational differences between the Hapsburgs and the Ottomans.
