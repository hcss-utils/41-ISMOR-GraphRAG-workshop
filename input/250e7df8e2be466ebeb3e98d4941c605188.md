23 Theo Farrell and Terry Terriff extol culture as a causal factor of military innovation in The Sources of Military Change: Culture, Politics, Technology.
Farrell and Terriff describe cultural norms that influence how military organizations react to "strategic, political, and technological developments."
24 Dima Adamsky asserts culture is at least equally as important as access to technology in Culture of Military Innovation as a military's unique strategic culture explains why and how technological opportunities are leveraged.
25 Ultimately, technology only constitutes an innovation if an organization possesses the strategic and organizational culture to exploit it to improve military effectiveness.
