In the last 15 years particularly, Russia has demonstrated its willingness to take increasingly aggressive actions on behalf of its national interest.
These actions bear even more resemblance to Athenian ideas of power.
The Russo-Georgian War in 2008, the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and current power projection in the Black Sea and Syria are the most notable examples.
The most important characteristic of these Russian actions has been the ability to conduct their operations without provoking any significant international response.
By a large measure, Russia does not have the military strength to directly combat that of the US or NATO and has effectively developed strategies to tailor its wars of interest in such a way as to avoid direct confrontation with other great powers.
