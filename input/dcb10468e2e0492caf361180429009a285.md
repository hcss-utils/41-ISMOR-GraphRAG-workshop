States recently entered a new era of aggressive competition with an old rival, Russia.
Russia previously pioneered the development of ever bigger and better atomic and hydrogen bombs in a race to gain dominance.
Both the U.S. and Russia participated in proxy wars worldwide to gain leverage and influence.
The emerging competition analogously still involves proxy conflict and incorporates second strike capability.
However, the current clash is much colder than the first, lacking many of the kinetic aspects of physical engagements.
While the threat of nuclear warfare still persists, the current conflict focuses on the technology that now permeates every aspect of our lives.
The U.S. is involved in a new era of cyberwarfare conducted at a national level.
During the Cold War, the U.S. used its economic and military prowess to overpower the Soviet Union.
Throughout the current clash, military might is as important as ever.
As such, the U.S. Army must arm itself to overcome cyber threats from the strategic to the tactical level.
In this competition, the Army must synergistically integrate cyber awareness, capability, and capacity to the pinnacle of tactical operations.
