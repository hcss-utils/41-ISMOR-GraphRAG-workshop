The archetypical view of warfare internalized by this generation of Americans is derived from our revolutionary, civil and world wars.
These were struggles for territory conducted by massed armies delivering body blows against one another.
Propaganda, aimed at troops and civilians, was deemed to be worth some effort, but the commitment of national populations-for example, America, England, Germany, Russia, Japan in World War 11-was largely unquestioned.
Psychological warfare was a secondary effort, intended to soften the primary target: military forces.
Wars were won on battlefields.
Desert Storm fit this mold.
But the enemies in the next century's warfare may not choose to fight on battlefields; America's advantage is too large in that setting.
