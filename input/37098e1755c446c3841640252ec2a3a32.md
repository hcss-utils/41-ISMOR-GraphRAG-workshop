Near peer adversaries such as Russia and China understand that they cannot compete and win a traditional conflict with the United States (US).
For Russia and China to be victorious against the US, they developed new means and capabilities through technological advancements to be victorious on the battlefield.
One of the primary capabilities under development is low yield battlefield nuclear weapons (LYBNWs) to win against the United States in future conflicts.
The American near-peer adversaries will launch an LYBNW on American maneuver forces to eliminate them from the battlefield and not elevate the conflict to the all-out nuclear war threshold.
