Yet, in comparison with other European countries what stands out in regard to the Second World War is that, in the end, it did not impinge physically upon British society to anything like the degree that it did on France, Germany, or Russia.
Much of Britain's poor economic and social performance since the war, compared with that of both France and Germany, can be attributed to the way in which, in the matter of social expectations, Britain had not been reduced to a minimal level as had the two continental countries;6' in addition, there was a general British complacency over "having won the war."
Thus the destructive dimension, in its negative as well as positive aspects, was particularly important for continental Europe.
But the participation dimension has particular relevance in connection with the social reform programs of the European resistance movements which, illuminatingly, tended usually to incorporate references to the British Beveridge Report.
