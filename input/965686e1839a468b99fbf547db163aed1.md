Russia's 2014 aggression against Ukraine, Moscow's subsequent efforts to destabilize and divide Western allies, and its continued military modernization prompted a marked shift in NATO's security posture.
For much of the post-Cold War period, the NATO Alliance focused predominantly on cooperative security and crisis management operationstwo of NATO's three core tasks-in and around Europe, as well as in Afghanistan and later Libya.
