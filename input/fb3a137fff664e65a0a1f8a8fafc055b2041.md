Germany and Russia's "enduring strategic rivalry" lasted almost exactly seventy-five years and embraced two world wars.
Within that time frame, there were occasional periods of rapprochement and even strategic cooperation between the two, first as common guarantors of monarchical stability and solidarity in the late nineteenth century (1873-79, 1881-94), then as bitter opponents of the post-1918 Versailles settlement (1921-33), and then, for a relatively brief but terrifying period, totalitarian partners standing against the western alliance (1939-41).
These periods of calm were not the same as friendship, however, and the two never dropped their mutual attitude of wary suspicion.
Their enmity culminated in the two world wars, and indeed, was a principal cause of both conflicts.
In both world wars, Russia and Germany fielded the largest armies, fought the greatest campaigns, and spilled more blood against one another than any other combatant powers.
