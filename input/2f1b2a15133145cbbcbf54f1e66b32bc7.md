This paper will answer the question how did the Russian General Staff react to and subsequently learn from the operational challenges posed by its involvement in irregular wars in Afghanistan (1979 -1989) and Chechnya (1994 -1996 and 1999 -2010)?
From this main question, several minor questions arise.
What level of influence did the Russian General Staff have over the forces conducting operations in both Afghanistan and Chechnya that would allow it to drive institutional change?
What lessons did the Russians take from their operations in Afghanistan?
To what degree did the Russians employ these lessons in the development of the Chechnya operation?
Did the fall of the Soviet Union change the manner or level of influence the General Staff had with regard to the development and management of military operations?
