Given the size of its armed forces, government support for military spending and reform, and its central position between Germany and Russia, Poland is the most important of the new NATO members.
While similar in size to Spain, Poland will soon dwarf most other NATO allies (new or old) in strategic importance and military contributions to the alliance.
In 1997 Poland embarked on a 15-year modernization plan, focused on improving personnel and equipment earmarked for NATO's rapid reaction forces.
The plan consisted of reducing army strength from 220,000 to 180,000 soldiers, shortening conscription to 12 months, and providing a stable defense budget pegged at 2.4 percent of GDP.^^ That same year Poland was the single largest contributor to United Nations Peacekeeping forces worldwide.
^ One commentator concludes: Few experts doubt Poland's ability and determination to become a valuable and salient member of the Alliance, given also the very high level of Polish public support and readiness to bear increased defense spending.
The Czech Republic and Hungary are in a different league-further behind the NATO targets, with a weaker public support and shakier government determination to reach the targets of military modernization.
'^ Given increased U.S. assistance in the form of a useful and visible presence in the country, Poland has the capability of becoming one of America's most valuable allies in operations not just in Europe, but, given its demonstrated commitment to peacekeeping operations, worldwide as well.
