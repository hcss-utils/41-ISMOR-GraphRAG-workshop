For the past fifteen plus years, U.S. Armed Forces were focused on the conflicts of Iraq and Afghanistan, including Special Operations.
While U.S. service members fought and supported the war on terrorism, great Russian military thinkers, such as General of Army Valeri Gerasimov, were reviewing works from Clausewitz, Isserson, and Svechin.
They were studying Russian military history to garner lessons learned from past conflicts, both good and bad.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to amalgamate the former Soviet satellite countries into the Soviet Union and become, once again, a world superpower.
While Putin certainly wants to be on the world stage, realistically and for the time being he is content with being a regional power.
Currently, Putin lacks the manpower and resources to make Russia what it was at one time during the Soviet Union.
