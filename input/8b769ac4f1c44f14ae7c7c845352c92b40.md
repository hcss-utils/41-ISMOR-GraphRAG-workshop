Most images of war are linked to destroying an enemy, controlling resources, maintaining sovereignty, and rearranging territory.
Yet wars are won or lost, begun and ended, and conducted in time as well as space, with time normally the more important factor.
Had Germany won a victory over Russia sooner and not had to wage a winter campaign, had American aircraft at Midway not found the Japanese just prior to turning back to their carriers, and had Israel not learned to evade SAMs in the Yom Kippur war, the outcomes of those conflicts would have been vastly different.
But  we have come to appreciate the role that time plays in war and the importance of cyclical time in the nature of conflicts.
