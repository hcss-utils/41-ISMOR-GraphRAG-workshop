From the point of view of the army, one solution was to take over Manchuria and establish a puppet government willing to meet Japan's economic and resource needs.
However, the creation of Manchukuo in 1932 did not solve Japan's economic problems and created the potential for armed conflict with Russia and China.
The tensions within the government over how to address each threat came to a head once full combat operations were initiated between China and Japan in July 1937.
The Second Sino-Japanese War all but assured Japan would not be able to become economically self sufficient, especially as the country mobilized industry and capacity to conduct full-scale war production. "
During the frenzied debates of mid-1937, most army officers maintained that operations in China would amount to no more than a short-term affair requiring relatively small forces."
