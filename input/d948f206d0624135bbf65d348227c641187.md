As civil unrest continues in Ukraine, the Black Sea fleet and the Southern Military District could conduct a joint exercise with 150,000 ground forces along the eastern border of Russia.
Unfortunately, as this hypothetical situation takes place, there would be little that Ukraine could do to stop this Russian-backed military incursion and the annexation of multiple districts and municipalities.
In these regions, the Ukrainian armed forces are not equipped with proper anti-tank armor, indirect fire weapons systems, intelligence, or air cover to match the Russian backed forces.9 0F
