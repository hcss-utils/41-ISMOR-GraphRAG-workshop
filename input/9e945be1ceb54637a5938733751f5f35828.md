In his book, The Franco-Prussian War.
Michael Howard explores the reasons for the disastrous defeat of the French Army, widely considered the best in the world in 1870, in France's war with Prussia.
By the standards of its past campaigns, the French Army was ready for war in 1870.
By 1860, the French military establishment had been victorious in battle against two of its chief European adversaries, Russia and Austria.
Inadequate as French military logistics, administration, leadership, training and organization may have been, that of the Russians and the Austrians was demonstrably worse.
Consequently, the French Army of 1870 was ready to fight successfully, but only against armies constituted and trained like itself or against ill-equipped, second rate military opponents like the Mexicans or the Berbers.
It was the tragedy of the French Army and of the French people that they did not realize in time that military affairs had entered into a new age. "
The lines of French military organization had to be drawn within the narrow limits of what was politically possible for a people which grudged every penny spent on the Army, distrusted its own rulers and was deeply divided in itself."
