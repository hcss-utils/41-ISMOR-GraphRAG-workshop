Staging Base: an advanced air base, usually with minimum facilities, where aircraft prepare for impending air operations.
Strategic: generally this signifies support of broad national objectives, and often contrasts with tactical (support of specific battlefield objectives in a region of surface combat). Strategic is defined here in a very narrow sense with reference to offensive air power-direct aerial attacks on the enemy homeland.
Chapter 1
On the morning of 16 January 1991, the eve of the Gulf War, seven SAC bombers took off from Barksdale Air Force Base (AFB) in Louisiana, laden with weapons for use against Iraq. After fifteen hours of flight, which included two hours of air refueling by each plane, they arrived at launch points in northern Saudi Arabia and released thirty-five cruise missiles at eight target complexes in the Mosul area, then returned to the United States. This flight lasted over thirty-five hours and covered fourteen thousand miles-the longest time and farthest distance of any combat mission in aviation history.

Overseas Bases: Problems of Projecting American Military Power Abroad. The historical context provided by these authors is well developed, and they view the 1950s as the prime, then waning, days of an American "containment ring" of bases around the Soviet Union. They find that the rationale for seeking overseas military installations throughout this early post-war period was to position American military strengths (global mobility and strategic air power) as a counterbalance for Soviet military strengths (geographic location and land armies). A strong point of the book is its assessment of political risks to American access around the world, but the argument has a strong naval slant as the authors often overlook the role of air bases while advocating naval facilities. They also proclaim that the United States sought remote locations, such as Greenland and Iceland, not so much to aid American strategy but to deny use of the sites to the Soviets; a point that the present study refutes.

The next major grouping within the historiography of American overseas bases concerns studies of specific countries. Simon Duke's United States Military Forces and Installations in Europe is the broadest and discusses the historical background, formal and informal basing agreements, and future expectations within each country. This work is valuable as a reference for American bases in the European area, details abound with charts, maps, and figures depicting locations, units, equipment, and personnel in each nation. Duke's book is also notable for its insightful and thorough assessment of treaties and operational restrictions (such as storage of nuclear weapons) for bases in Greenland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. In regards to SAC bases though, I take issue with several of his findings. In a broad overview and again in his summary, Duke holds that America established a "haphazard pattern" of European bases in the late 1940s and 1950s, which gained a "raison d'etre, almost independent of significant political and military changes." Within my narrower field of study, this claim is untrue. SAC bases were built and occupied in many countries discussed by Duke at a precise time and for an express purpose~and all of these were closely attuned with military and (London: SAGE Publications, 1977), (hereafter cited as Cottrell and Moorer, Problems). The naval slant should be no surprise: Cottrell is a former Professor of Foreign Affairs at the Naval War College and Moorer is the former Chief of Naval Operations. Their book was an advocacy piece which sought to persuade the Carter Administration away from overseas bases (especially air bases) and towards increased reliance on floating naval assets. political changes which occurred throughout the decade. This theme will be further developed in the following chapters.
The largest collection of studies of American bases in a particular country concern the United Kingdom, a convenient point for this analysis as fifteen of SAC's thirty overseas bases were in Britain. Another book by Duke, United States Defence Bases in the United Kingdom: A Matter for Joint Decision?, analyzes the bases and holds that they have always been primarily for American benefit, without the full knowledge of the British government or population. This is a thorough assessment, especially of the period from 1945 to 1950, as the wartime relationships between Anglo-American air leaders resulted in covert military-to-military agreements to develop British bases suitable for American bombers and nuclear weapons. The book focuses on the role of these bases during international incidents, such as the crises over Berlin and the Suez Canal.
Duncan Campbell, an investigative reporter for the New Statesman, uses the post-war development of American military bases in the United Kingdom to launch an attack on the Tory government and administration of the 1980s. Campbell's book is meant as an expose of what he views as an extensive and shrouded American military base network throughout the United Kingdom. The "nuclear axis" running through these post-war British bases is traced through war plans and world crises, as Campbell recounts SAC operational practices with an emphasis on the political ramifications, such as overflights of Britain with nuclear weapons. Campbell primarily registers the extent 
13
14
of the American presence, so the policies and practices at these bases are only presented superficially to support his larger premise: America has militantly taken advantage of British goodwill by unilaterally developing these bases, all the while keeping information, decisions, and practices away from the British public. And, the Tory government allowed this all to happen. Two other authors counter the views of Duke and Campbell. Patrick E. Murray, historian of the United States Third Air Force which is based in Britain, examines the foundations of the American bases in "An Initial Response to the Cold War: The Buildup of the US Air Force in the United Kingdom, 1948-1956." For Murray, the   cooperation between the two nations was one of respectful partnership and mutual consent throughout this period. Murray lists all the American air bases, as had the others, but further delineates command lines to the facilities as well. Likewise, Michael Bowyer's title underscores his theme, Force for Freedom: The USAF in the UK since 1948.

The final group of literature concerns SAC bases abroad, and collectively these works are either outdated or too narrow. Martin Packman, in a 1957 article, recounts in   great detail problems then emerging with American overseas strategic air bases.
Packman assembles a wide collection of evidence, then predicts that the use of these bases will soon decline. This article illuminates many facets of the overseas air base system: Soviet reactions, diplomatic difficulties, costs, host nation concerns, and American political opposition. Packman examines routine problems, such as newlyindependent Morocco demanding large rental payments, as well as problems particular to nuclear weapons, such as intense public and political opposition against American bases in Japan.
There is one book which specifically examines SAC bomber bases in a single country, Gerald Adam's A History of US Strategic Air Bases in Morocco. 1951-1963.   The chronology offered by Adams, a retired Air Force colonel and former commander of one of the bases, begins with "the hasty build-up" from 1951 to 1953 and ends when the Air Force left Morocco in 1963. This book was published by the (USAF) Moroccan Reunion Society and is primarily a social history, exceedingly rich with details, photographs, and personal reminisces.
In addition to these published sources, several doctoral theses provided information relevant to my topic. The structure and content of these dissertations were 
18

helpful, but none directly addressed the topic of overseas strategic air bases in the 1950s. 20
Many previous works treat overseas bases merely as an inventory to be listed, rather than an issue to be analyzed. As is evident from the above discussion there exists no systematic, comprehensive analysis of the development, strategy, and demise of SAC overseas bomber bases of the 1950s. These sites have never been split out from other American overseas bases to reveal their purpose, risks, costs, challenges, and special contributions of the American strategy of the period.
Many previous studies stress the continuity of American overseas bases from World War II to the late 1950s, yet little attempt has been made to actually appraise the details of this continuity, or any breaks in it, which signaled significant changes for these facilities. The overall impact of Korea on American strategy has been noted by most authors, but unexamined is why and how this war became the decisive impetus for pursuit of SAC overseas bases. Many unasked questions also exist about the process by which SAC gained direct control of these facilities and the rationale for seeking specific 
20
The present study will consider overseas bomber bases as but one alternative among many means of projecting strategic military power. I shall analyze the overall American strategy of the period, with an emphasis on strategic options which developed over the course of the decade. Separate chapters will assess the evolution of the American strategic arsenal, to explain the need, use, and demise of the bomber bases.
An entire chapter is dedicated to SAC aircraft development, and another concentrates on alternatives to the bases which became operational late in the 1950s. Most of the existing studies describe the close-down of these sites, but the reasons given lean toward technological determinism, simply stating that the appearance of missile systems and long-range bombers replaced overseas bomber bases. I shall go much deeper into the nature of this complicated process of bomber bases closure which occurred about 1960.
Additionally, I will also go into more detail than previous works in two major areas: the costs of overseas bomber bases, and the international politics necessary to gain access to these sites.
There still remain several important perspectives that are not examined here.
The views of the host nations and the effect on the Soviet Union are both touched upon, but largely through the filtered lens of American documents. NATO warplans and related operational concerns are not specifically analyzed, but are discussed only as SAC bases contributed to these topics. Nuclear weapons are not a prominent issue, and the reasons for this will become clear in subsequent chapters. These issues are integrated into this history of SAC overseas bases, but they do not receive systematic treatment.
My level of analysis stays primarily within the highest echelons of the United States Air Force, thus several additional levels are not fully addressed: the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the National Security Council, the Department of Defense, the Presidential Cabinet, the State Department. I will touch upon many concerns expressed at these other levels, but constantly return to the views, concepts, and plans expressed within the Air Force chain of command. The logic of base decisions made by SAC and Air Force leaders are fully traced. The resulting policies supported by officials beyond the Air Force are apparent, but not followed in detail.
Primary sources are the foundation of this analysis, and those used here come mainly from government records, government service organizations, and Air Force records. As mentioned above, I will concentrate on the decision-making process within the Air Force command structure, so appropriate internal documents and reports receive the greatest attention. An initial assessment of the key bodies of documents is in order, to reveal my selection criteria and value of these items to this study. The following information is organized by repository, to show the current location of evidence used in Frank C. Nash to lead the assessment. Nash obtained cooperation from the highest levels of the American government, including interviews, reports, and data from the Secretaries of Defense and State, the Secretaries of each military service, the Chairman and all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the chief of the US diplomatic mission in every country with an American base, and all unified and specified military commanders responsible for overseas forces. Nash and his assistants made four trips abroad as part of this fourteen month study, which was complete in December 1957. Titled simply 'United States Overseas Military Bases,' it is known as the Nash Report in accordance with American governmental policy of naming a report after its chairman (although Nash died shortly before finishing the final version). The report runs over three hundred pages and consists of two parts, the main body of findings and an appendix of country studies for each host nation. The report offers a wealth of detailed information concerning overseas bases: negotiating processes, costs, recurring problems, force structures, formal agreements. SAC bases are only a portion of this study, but are treated as the overriding element of the American base system. By Eisenhower's request, the Nash Report was distributed throughout the American government and appropriate agencies implemented many of its recommendations. The report arises in discussions at several NSC Meetings for the remainder of the decade.
In October 1959 Eisenhower requested a follow up to the Nash Report. William Lang, from the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), conducted the study aided by three members of the Joint Staff. In December 1959 members of the National Security Council requested that this report, then in progress, specifically address the basing implications of ballistic missile development.
The Lang Report, formally titled 'Review of United States Overseas Military Bases,' was finished in April 1960 and focuses on recent changes to the overseas base structure and those expected to occur in the near future. Although primarily a military assessment, and thus not nearly as extensive as the Nash Report, it serves as a milestone to mark major implications of newer weapons systems on the overseas bases,
particularly those bases used by SAC bombers.
The Eisenhower Library holds several collections which helped place these Presidential base reports in context, revealing the thinking behind them and the decision-making process which sprang from them. The Ann Whitman Files contain two pertinent collections, the first being the NSC Files which include detailed minutes of meetings in which these bases reports were presented, subsequent discussion among council members, as well as related topics such as nuclear weapons, air defense concerns, Soviet capabilities and perceived intentions, and the status of SAC. The second valuable collection from the Ann Whitman Files is the Admin(istrative) Files, which has extensive collections categorized under the titles of air bases, Air Force, nuclear weapons, and prominent figures involved in basing decisions. Files from the White House Office of the Staff Secretary (Eisenhower's answer to a Presidential Chief of Staff, a position held by General Andrew Goodpaster the entire time) hold extensive notes of meetings and private conferences held with the President. Files from the White House Office of the Special Assistant for National Security Affairs provided

The US National Archives in Washington, DC, and Suitland, Maryland, contains record groups with information specifically related to overseas bases. Record Group 218 (Joint Chiefs of Staff) is a massive collection, but it is somewhat disorganized and rather difficult to work with. Additionally, during my three visits over the course of several months, this collection was still undergoing a move from Washington to Suitland. Luckily though, many documents concerning the Joint Strategic Plans Committee, the Soviet threat, and custody of nuclear weapons were found. Especially useful was the 570 series of documents, known as the "Basing Bible." Record Group 330 (Secretary of Defense) and Record Group 349 (US European Command) contain military evaluations of NATO nations throughout the 1950s, which reveal some of the military rationale for seeking SAC bases in particular countries. The latter record group also holds memos of base visits by high-level American officials and summaries of foreign military aid provided during the decade, containing information about the political rationale for seeking certain countries and the economic incentives offered as part of the process. Record Group 46 (Congress) holds Congressional travel reports as well as correspondence to and from members of the Senate Committee on Real Estate and Military Construction; these greatly aided the political and economic picture of the overseas bases. Record Group 341 (Headquarters USAF) and Record Group 340 (Secretary of the Air Force) were disappointing and sparse concerning this subject, and several seemingly promising inventories revealed little useful information, the one exception being formal reports of overseas air base construction.
Two published Congressional hearings from Record Group 287 (Congress) were particularly valuable. The 1952 "Hiring for Work at Overseas Bases" before the Preparedness Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee shows the tremendous scrutiny given to cost overruns at SAC bases in French Morocco. And most illuminating was the 1956 "Study of Airpower" before the Subcommittee on the Air Force of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Chaired by Senator Stuart Symington, formerly the Secretary of the Air Force, this was a successful effort to rally political support for increased Air Force spending amidst ongoing defense cuts by the Eisenhower Administration. Over one hundred witnesses were called, including the Secretary of Defense, all service secretaries, all members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired and active duty general and flag officers who controlled aviation assets, and various civilian experts. The published report and summary run over two thousand pages, revealing a wealth of information about the course of American military aviation.
The interviewee comments are the most useful part, because it is readily apparent that Symington used these hearings as a public forum to paint a bleak picture of the status of American air power, so to gain a larger share of future defense funds for the Air Force. Force-sponsored research institution in Santa Monica, California. Bernard Brodie, Herman Kahn, Leo Rosten, and Charles Hitch are but a few of the prominent individuals who worked at RAND in the 1950s. A plethora of formal reports was examined across a range of topics relevant to overseas bomber bases: air strategy, nuclear weapons considerations, strategic targeting, and Soviet military progress. These RAND reports are excellent sources, but care must be taken to discern their underlying assumptions.
The typical methodology involves operations research, seeking to quantify decisions and other vague elements of military strategy. Assumptions are clearly noted at the beginning of each report, but the numerical details tend to cloud this, and conclusions generally present only clear, distinct options. The findings of these reports will be cited as they arise, but one of these many RAND reports deserves special mention. RAND Report R-266, "Selection and Use of Strategic Air Bases," was led by a young scholar named Albert Wohlstetter. The Air Force commissioned the report in 1951, received numerous presentations on interim findings over the next few years, and obtained the final version in April 1954, at the midpoint of SAC's development of these bases. This 383 page report caused a stir within the Air Force community, for rather than merely chronicle past pursuits of these sites, Wohlstetter and his three colleagues used it as an advocacy piece for seeking changes to SAC operations abroad. RAND R-266 is a logical tour de force, presenting a massive amount of data on military and economic issues surrounding these bases, along with assessments of emerging Soviet threats to the facilities.

No currently classified documents or closed record sources have been used in this analysis, although most of the documents mentioned above were previously labeled Top Secret, Eyes Only, or NOFORN (No Foreign dissemination). Several declassification requests were quickly and graciously granted by the National Archives (Record Groups 340 and 341) and the Library of Congress (LeMay Papers), but the resulting information was of only minor value. It was readily apparent at the outset that the open documentary record of nuclear weapons in the early Cold War still possesses wide gaps, even after almost half a century. The strategic war plans of the era are still highly classified, as are some key aspects of the American nuclear stockpile. This study seeks to work around much of this by addressing other, more readily available elements of overseas bases. Any speculations based on partial information are noted in the text.
This study is entirely based upon American sources. This was a conscious decision to restrict the scope of my analysis, but it is also justified due to the nature of my topic: SAC bases belonged only to the United States, and answered only to American leaders, a theme that will be fully explored in ensuing chapters.
The remaining portion of this dissertation separates along a mix of thematic and chronological lines. The following is a brief description of later chapters, to provide an overall outline and to show the goals sought for each part of this work.
Chapter Two, "Lessons from the Past," develops three distinct lines of historical continuity, all of which will later play an important role in the development of SAC overseas bases. The first part is a brief account of the long history of American overseas bases, to place the bomber bases in context with other eras and other bases. The second is a short exploration of some prominent tenets of air power theory, which form the intellectual basis for Air Force officers to seek SAC control abroad. The third part examines the American bomber bases of World War II, to note their placement and use throughout the conflict. The chapter ends with wartime lessons which strongly influenced the later acquisition of overseas bomber bases.
Chapter Three, "Development of SAC Overseas Bases, 1950-1957" analyzes   changes in American national security policy during these years, with the goal of discovering how these changes affected overseas bomber bases. The issue of exclusive SAC control of bases abroad is specifically traced. The purpose of obtaining these bomber bases is presented, with particular emphasis on the motives of American leaders for seeking these sites. The chapter ends with a detailed analysis of the military considerations entailed in the selection of these overseas sites, to determine the military rationale for seeking facilities in specific locations.
Chapter Four, "Politics of Foreign Bases," is the longest chapter and bears out many of the themes mentioned in previous chapters. The goal is to undertake a systematic approach to the international politics of these sites. Some of the more prominent topics addressed are the American negotiating tactics, the precise terms of access rights secured, and growing retention difficulties.
Chapter Five, "Economics of Foreign Bases," analyzes the costs associated with the sites. This aspect of overseas bases has generally been shunned by historians, and upon examining the historical record, I can now see why. These are only shards of evidence, partial and incomplete, compounded by governmental practices which were intentionally deceptive. Here I have sought a new synthesis through primary documents of the era, but can only further the issue, not fully analyze it.
Chapter Six, "Wars and Crises," is very short and seeks to appraise the overseas bomber bases through prominent international incidents of the decade. The emphasis is upon turning points which occurred with the use of these sites. This chapter is a broad analysis which remains on the high level of American national security policy.
Chapter Seven, "Aircraft Issues and Implications," is in many respects the core of this study. It is an detailed analysis of SAC aircraft and their capabilities during the early post-war period. The goals are to assess why the bomber bases were needed and attempts to replace the sites by extending bomber radii of action.
Chapter Eight, " Alternatives and Withdrawal, 1957-1960" examines the waning period of the overseas bomber bases. American national security strategy is examined, with particular emphasis on alternatives to the bases which became available late in the decade. The emerging strategic systems are presented separately, and then their collective impact on the bomber bases is analyzed.
Chapter Nine, "Final Assessment," is the concluding chapter which ties together all the previous chapters and consolidates the major themes. In addition, I specify five new findings that this work makes and place these within context of previous base histories. I end by placing overseas SAC bases into a much broader context.
We have won this war, and I am no longer interested in it. I do not think we should spend time debating whether we obtained the victory by sheer power or by some qualitative superiority. Only one thing should concern us: What is the future of air power and aerial warfare?
General Hap Arnold, 1944   The bomber became the predominant strategic weapon in the early Cold War period. Many attribute the dominance of this aircraft, and then the subsequent pursuit of overseas strategic air bases, primarily to nuclear weapons, and previous base histories of this era fixate on aspects of these weapons. 
2
American air leaders adroitly and successfully used these reasons to seek independence for the Air Force and to channel funding to SAC. Hap Arnold, in his final report as the Army Air Forces (AAF) Commanding General, proclaimed: "The influence of atomic energy on air power can be stated very simply. It has made air power all important... through SAC, to reach the pinnacle of the American military force structure in the early Cold War period.
But the atomic bomb was not the primary cause for the ascendancy of the bomber or the build-up of overseas bases. The argument for these aircraft and their placement abroad runs much deeper, and here is where the alleged causality of nuclear weapons errs. Nuclear weapons were used, so to speak, as a tactic for magnifying the unique capability of strategic bombardment, and thus the Air Force. Nuclear weapons heightened this position, but did not change the reasons for seeking overseas bases.
Even before nuclear weapons, strategic bombardment possessed unique characteristics and overseas bases allowed these characteristics to be realized. I am convinced that had nuclear weapons not existed in the 1950s, the United States still would have sought bomber bases in the same locations, at the same time, for the same purpose. The strategic bomber had the longest reach, the sole means of strategic access. Nuclear weapons did not alter this. The change with these weapons was the magnitude of striking power, not method.
Overseas bomber bases of the 1950s did not simply appear, they were founded on historical precedence; specifically, these sites were influenced by the American conception and experience with other overseas bases, air power theory which endorsed bombers, and strategic air bases of World War II. These elements merged in the 1950s and SAC overseas bases were one product of this convergence. The bomber bases fit the overall goals of the United States: a distant power could be contained from the air, threatened in peace or reduced in war. The bomber could reach an enemy and get there quickly, if the United States had overseas bases.
This chapter aims to take a long view of the SAC bomber bases of the 1950s, to place them in context with other periods and other bases. Distinct lines of historical continuity fed into the development of SAC bases abroad, and these will be analyzed to glean their later influence. The bomber bases which appeared in late 1950 were firmly rooted in these lessons from the past.
Overseas bases allow the projection of military power abroad, and are a manifestation of larger foreign policy aims. Guiding all of this is grand strategy, the assessment of military threats from abroad and the policies developed to maintain international commitments. Whereas military strategy is generally based upon war or conflict, grand strategy precedes this and looks beyond it, to the broader international environment.

For over a century after its founding the United States interest, or lack thereof, with foreign bases seems guided by a policy of isolationism. Since the nation's beginning, several generations of American leaders sought to avoid entangling alliances around the globe, and because of this, the nation had scant experience with foreign outposts prior to the end of the nineteenth century. This was primarily a reflection of geography, the United States was distant, secure, and largely unaffected by shifts in the world balance of power. Europe and Asia were thousands of miles away across vast oceans, and the British Navy guarded the seas. American leaders had little desire to seek military or political involvement beyond the insulation of North America. During this time, there were only a few instances of America seeking or using foreign military sites. In the early nineteenth century, a few small overseas ports allowed American warships to guard against Barbary pirates off the coast of North Africa, a mission which President Thomas Jefferson opposed for "nothing should ever be accepted which would require a navy to defend it."
5
The Spanish-American War was the turning point for American grand strategy and, correspondingly, its attitude towards overseas bases. Events in the Pacific Ocean exposed the precarious American position and highlighted the need for strong diplomatic ties and wartime base commitments with other nations-latent lessons which would be relearned half a century later.  States declared war on Austria-Hungary). In the spring of 1917, there was a possibility that Germany might achieve victory and then dominate Europe, for each of its three major opponents was in a dire position. By March 1917 the Russian army had been 
9
The United States still kept only minimal forces in the region, no more were needed to insure the balance of power. Six major base networks sprang up, through the Central Pacific, North Atlantic, Southwest Pacific, Latin America, North Africa, and China-Burma-India.
But the United States abandoned the vast majority of its overseas sites after the conflict. Access rights were also cast aside, so that by 1947 the United States had only three formal overseas base agreements: a ninety-nine year lease with the United Kingdom for naval bases in the North Atlantic, another ninety-nine year lease for base sites in the Philippines, and a continual lease for a facility at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba.
American troops served with occupation forces in Germany, Austria, and Japan, while a limited number remained in seven other locations. This was not another retreat to 
15
isolationism, but rather a recognition that there was no longer a need for a large American military presence abroad. At the direction of the Truman Administration, American forces returned to the United States, forsaking their overseas sites in the 16 process.
Strategic air power began to emerge as a distinct basing concern in this immediate post-war period. Prior to this American overseas bases meant primarily naval facilities, and the Navy served as the most visible element of American military power projection. But overseas bases for bombers now became a separate element of American power projection, although potential facilities abroad were then unavailable.
This relegation of overseas sites did not go unnoticed by some members of Congress. was not enough money to support a large assortment of overseas bases. More importantly, there was not a perceived need to acquire and use these facilities. The war i o had been won, relative peace was at hand, Germany and Japan had been defeated.
But this last point, combined with the difficulties of colonial powers (particularly Britain) to retain their pre-war commitments abroad, eventually led to a resurgence of American overseas bases to counter the Soviet threat. American interests in military sites abroad returned with the Korean War, when the fear of a communist hegemonyinternationally lead by the Soviet Union, regionally sponsored by China, specifically executed by North Korea-led to a global base build up by the United States. Through these sites American leaders, this time, sought not merely to counter the perceived hegemonic aspirations of the Soviet Union, but to fill the void that had allowed this situation in the first place. A 1953 report to the Senate Armed Services Committee, prepared by the Subcommittee on Real Estate and Military Construction, examined the developing American bases and underlined the rationale for these sites:
We have the bases and we have the industrial capacities and we have the transportation. And we do have the friends. The imbalance of world power, the vacuum that was created by the 'unconditional surrender' status forced on Germany and the destruction and full demobilization of Japanese military strength is being corrected.

As the newest form of military power, aviation borrowed much of its employment theory from the other military services. Many of the employment principles for aerial forces came from the classic military theorists, such as Sun Tzu, Antoine Henri Jomini, and Carl von Clausewitz. 
24
The emerging tenets of air strategy borrowed from naval strategy as well. In many respects, strategic bombardment is merely an extension of traditional naval roles at increased speed across a greater distance: coastal bombardment moved farther inland

The golden age of air power theory occurred in the interwar period, when a host of theorists emerged around the world. Many of these men were military officers intimately involved with aviation, whose published articles and books span several decades.

were the key to air strategy. These targets fueled the enemy war effort, and destruction of them would disable support for the war. The targets suggested by these air theorists varied, were usually vague, and generally rested on many assumptions. The specific targets ranged across the gamut of air forces, military forces, industry, and population But all of this was, to borrow a phrase from Marshall John Slessor of the RAF, "an article of faith." In these days before radar, before integrated air defense systems, when bombers generally flew higher and faster than fighters, the prevailing maxim was "the bomber will always get through."

for seeking victories such as this, without direct frontal assaults), that nation's military forces could be undercut and rendered ineffective. Many air advocates seized on this theme of military capability and political will, and the concept is still prevalent today.
Theorists made several controversial proclamations for this nascent form of military power. The following issues led to continuous internecine struggles among the American military services and frame many of the major issues surrounding SAC overseas bomber bases. Strategic air power could fight first and best at the strategic level, within the enemy nation. In order to properly do this, a strategic air force should be independent from other military forces. With independence, bombers could fulfill their unique strategic role, not be used as mere long range artillery in the battlefield area.
Strategic air power should be directed by airmen, freed from the confines of the tactical arena, so as to fight on the strategic level and focus on strategic objectives. This was, in a nutshell, the claims made by the early air power theorists. The extremists took it even further: strategic air forces would eventually become the predominant component of military power, and might achieve victory largely unaided by the other services. This theory placed leaders of the traditional military services on the defensive, relegating their forces to mere support roles-the army to seize and hold forward bases and the 37 navy to transport supplies-and expectedly was received as polemic. 
36

39
This promotion of the strategic bomber was ingenious, yet the claims were unproven. Nonetheless, the aviation portion of the trickle of military funds went towards development of bombers. On the eve of the Second World War, the strategic bomber was the core of American air power, a position that would last for the next two decades. 
41
The strategy, chronology, history, and outcomes of the wartime strategic air campaigns have been ably told by others. 
42
Between 1939 and 1940 the Army Air Corps placed production orders for only eighty-seven four-engine bombers, but by June 1941, a massive build-up was underway, and over three thousand were in production.

bombers, and all the equipment necessary for strategic air warfare. All of these American bases were between London and the Wash, in the Huntingdon and East Anglia region of England. These American bomber airfields displaced forty thousand 48 acres of farmland, all in an area that could have fit within the state of Rhode Island.
These American bases, along with those nearby of the RAF Bomber Command, held the greatest concentration of bombers ever assembled, over three thousand aircraft.
The United States portion consisted of forty-one bomb groups with 2,100 heavy bombers-almost ten times the number in the current Air Force inventory. These bases in England were four hundred air miles from Berlin, well within the radius of action of theB-17andB-24.
More American bomber bases developed in Italy, opening a southern air route into Germany. Following the Italian surrender in September 1943, bombers of the Fifteenth Air Force moved to the spur of eastern Italy, around Foggia and Manduria.
With the end of the North African campaign, all Fifteenth Air Force bombers left Tunisia for these forward bases. At its height these bases held twenty-one bomb groups and 1,100 bombers, about half the size of the American force in England.

Specifically the China bases were: Kiunglai, Penshaw, Hsinching, and Kwanchan. The logistics chain to support these sites went the long way around the world, with the last link by air across the Himalayas, aptly named Operation MATTERHORN. Craven and Cate, AAF in WWII. vol. V, pp. 65-73; Robert W.  Coakley and Richard M. Leighton, Global Logistics and Strategy, 1943-1945 commitment was much smaller, involving one-third the bomb groups, one-tenth the sorties, and one-seventh the bases. But the bombing of Japan was much more concentrated and the target sets much more susceptible. Using only twelve percent of the bomb tonnage, the overall results of the bombing campaign against Japan were remarkably similar to those against Germany: sixty-three cities destroyed, 330,000 killed, 476,000 wounded, and nine million homeless. The bulk of these damages came from incendiaries, which comprised over sixty percent of the Twentieth Air Force bomb weight and were shockingly effective against the paper and wood structures of Japanese cities.

Three base lessons came from the war, and these would continue to apply well in to the next decade. These lessons lay dormant through the five years following World
War II, world tension certainly rose, but the actual prospect of global war remained somewhat distant. But American leaders perceived the potential of another global conflict in the summer of 1950, and it was then that these lessons became paramount.
First, without overseas bomber bases no American military forces had direct access to a distant enemy. Until the late 1950s, the only means of effectively delivering weapons on strategic targets was with Air Force bombers, and to do this, aircraft required bases within striking distance of prospective targets. The bomber was the first, and the only, vehicle for strategic air operations. A decade after the war, three-fourths 
55
of the SAC bomber inventory was medium bombers, with a radius of action of merely two thousand miles. The remaining aircraft were heavy bombers, which could fly about three thousand miles-enough to reach only a handful of prospective foreign targets from North America, for the average distance from SAC bases in the continental United
States to designated Soviet targets was 4,100 miles.
Second, obtaining wartime bases was costly. Political costs were most evident when the United States sought air bases in small semi-independent areas, such as Iceland, Greenland, and the Azores. These sites remained vital in American warplans of 57 the 1950s, and the political strains from the war continued into the following decade.
The economic costs of overseas bomber bases is difficult to measure due to extreme variances among location, labor, aircraft, commands, specifications, international agreements, and time periods. The tally in China can be specified though, for the United States provided one hundred million dollars to the forces of General Chiang Kai Shek for construction of four B-29 bases near Chengtu. 
58
Bases and forces within striking distance of an enemy nation allowed strategic bombers to enter combat, but there was a price. Several years after the war, in a speech at the National War College, LeMay reflected on the early air war in Europe:
There were many competing requirements for the resources of our nation which hindered the development of a strong strategic bombing force during the last war It required three dangerous years for the United States to build and deploy a bomber force capable of bringing decisive blows to bear. The results during the first three years were discouraging. In my opinion about all we did during that time was to provide operational training for the Luftwaffe, unfortunately at the cost of many of our best airmen.
Statistics from American strategic air campaigns confirm LeMay's notion of "three dangerous years" and show that bomber crews were fighting, and dying, in the enemy country long before any other forces could reach it: 
60
Continually through the post-war period Air Force generals, seeking to avoid a recurrence of the heavy wartime losses, sought to position a massive collection of combat-ready forces at overseas bases. Recognizing the political and military value of having these sites, and acknowledging the human cost should they ever be used, prompted these leaders to seek "forces in being at their primary operating locations."
This phrase appears continually in basing documents of the post-war period.
All of these lessons are simple and straightforward, and they form the logical foundation for the future development of SAC overseas bomber bases in the 1950s.
Wartime experience underlined the importance of host nations, countries in key locations that would allow the construction and occupation of American bomber fields.
The central element in each of these lessons was the bomber, the only viable strategic vehicle in the American inventory.
There was a fundamental caveat with all of these lessons, though: they only applied until the appearance of other strategic weapons, less cumbersome politically, economically, and militarily. Once some future weapons systems could be accurately launched at a target thousands of miles away, the logic underlying all these lessons vanished. When strategic access could come from North America or neutral waters, America would no longer depend on forward sites for the projection of strategic air power and costly wartime bases would not be needed. When other weapons could travel at supersonic speed, bombers would no longer be the first to attack. The demise of these overseas bases was thus built into the thinking that preceded them. Intercontinental capability would be reached, no one doubted that, but the issue was: when? Until that time, SAC overseas bases would serve as America's strategic frontier.

American leaders continually rejected any notion of roll-back of communist successes, and dismissed the prospect of preventive war. As Colin Gray notes, the "master concept" of American post-war strategy was stability.

American leaders realized the political potential of strategic air power and its military limitations during the Korean War period, defined here from June 1950 to September 1953. 
5
The administration's strategy was clear: wage limited war in Korea; prepare for a global conflict; and utilize the growing military capabilities of the United States to furnish the backdrop for an aggressive foreign policy aimed at creating a favorable balance of power in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. This was a significant break with previous American policy, and signals one of the most important turning points of the entire Cold War.
As part of this American build up, the Air Force rapidly expanded. In June 1950 the Air Force consisted of forty-eight wings (and SAC possessed zero overseas bases).

refused to broaden the war, but he did speed preparations for a possible global conflict. The President's approval of NSC-68/4 in December 1950 moved up military force goals two full years, and through this, the Air Force was to expand to eighty-seven wings by June 1951, ninety-five wings by June 1952. 
24
SAC gained control of overseas bases as a response to frustrations encountered with bomber employment in Korea. Overseas bases under SAC control ensured that America's main strategic assets could focus on strategic objectives, and would not be relegated to a mere adjunct support role by theater commanders. In the first six months

Analysis of this subject begins within the high echelons of the Air Force chain of command, to uncover the rationale for seeking control of these sites, and the tactics used to gain it. The matter can be traced very precisely and in great detail through the document collections of the two primary actors, SAC Commander LeMay and Air Force Chief of Staff Vandenberg. 
26
The impetus for SAC control of overseas bases came from the Far East, but rather indirectly. The frustration exhibited by Vandenberg and LeMay over bomber operations in Korea would eventually lead these generals to seek to obtain SAC overseas bases. Cables sent to and from Vandenberg and LeMay reveal the conceptual development for SAC to command its own overseas bases.
When war broke out on 25 June 1950, the American bomber force in the Far East consisted of a single unit, the 19th Bomb Group, which flew B-29s from Okinawa. This unit was unusual, for it was part of the Far East Air Forces (FEAF), commanded by Lieutenant General George E. Stratemeyer; all other American bombers belonged to SAC. On 3 July 1950 Vandenberg obtained approval from the Joint Chiefs of Staff to send two additional B-29 groups, both from SAC's Fifteenth Air Force, to the Far East.
Vandenberg's guidance to Stratemeyer read: As primary consideration in making these additional groups available is the vital necessity of destruction of North Korean objectives north of the 38th parallel. While I do not presume to discuss specific targets, it is axiomatic that tactical operations on the battlefield cannot be fully effective unless there is a simultaneous interdiction and destruction of resources behind the battlefield.
The next day both SAC units left the United States, bound for prepared American air fields in the Far East: the 22nd Bomb Group went to Kadena Air Base on Okinawa, and the 92d Bomb Group went to Andersen AFB on Guam. Both of these bases belonged to the FEAF and had been in constant use since the Second World War. 
28
Burchinal, a SAC commander at many levels during this period, commented:
I think there was one thing learned: that SAC could deploy fast, that forces could be brought from the United States if there were bases prepared for them. Bombers could be brought to bear very rapidly. I believe that led to bases in North Africa, bases in England, and the rotation concept.
Only nine days after the deployment began, SAC bombers were flying combat missions over Korea.
These two deployed bomb groups, and two more that would follow, were a major force commitment from SAC. Vandenberg requested the units for Korea, but LeMay could choose which ones to send, and he selected "the low-priority outfits, the lowest ones on the totem pole...the outfits that were not fully manned and not combat ready for the overall strategic war plan." He later stated in an interview that, "I did not want to destroy the capability that we had built up for a strategic war if we had to go to war [against the Soviet Union]." 31 LeMay's rationale was in line with American 32 national priorities: fight a limited action in Korea, and prepare for global war.
Vandenberg directed FEAF Commander Stratemeyer to form a new unit to control the rapidly building bomber assets, and selected Major General Emmett "Rosie" O'Donnell to be in charge of this FEAF Bomber Command (Provisional) at Yokota Air Base, Japan. This organization was under the direct operational control of the theater 29 Base information from Fletcher, Bases Outside, pp. 2-3, 62-64. Quote from Richard H. Kohn and Joseph P.

The FEAF-controlled bombers conducted 21,328 combat sorties and dropped 167,000 tons of bombs during the conflict, but despite these numbers, it was a frustrating experience for SAC commanders. Due to the small number of strategic targets in North Korea and a ground-oriented air campaign, bomber commanders held that strategic air power had not been used to its full potential. Reflecting on this, LeMay stated "we never did hit a strategic target in Korea," and SAC's experience with the FEAF showed "how not to use the strategic weapon." 
40
LeMay chose his fight very carefully. He accepted the command arrangements of former SAC bombers in Korea, yet at the same time, sought to ensure this would not be repeated.
Korea was not the major strategic focus of the United States, and SAC deployments clearly show this. By late September 1950, there were two SAC bomb groups in the Far East, both units were relatively lowly, and none of these bombers had message Power to

LeMay used logistics as the initial justification for seeking full operational control of SAC overseas forces. On 22 August 1950 he sent a package to Lieutenant General Howard A. Craig, the Inspector General of the Air Force, soliciting help. The package contained correspondence received at SAC Headquarters, which LeMay's cover later explained "will serve to bear out the point I make to you regarding the theater command problem. It is apparent to me, at this time, that we will not get sufficient priority assigned to the strategic air offensive to ensure all-out support by theater commanders." 44 Craig agreed with LeMay's assessment, and on 2 September LeMay 42 SAC did station the 43d Bomb Wing on Guam, they flew the B-50 and were atomic capable. This unit remained under the operational control of SAC, through SAC X-Ray in Japan.

Each of these was in a region controlled by a separate theater commander. But LeMay stressed that SAC forces, unlike all other American military commands abroad, were under the direction of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and only by consolidating control of these forces could they be properly directed.

Chairman in 1957). Shortly thereafter, LeMay wired several subordinate SAC commanders, to clarify their position in the chain of command. He announced that those at the meeting were in complete agreement about establishing the command lines to SAC's deployed bombers, and hereafter, SAC forces-regardless of their location-- Their objections, I felt sure, were not based upon personal reasons but upon a conviction that a Tactical Air commander, who is primarily responsible with the support of front-line troops, could not be expected to appreciate properly the true role and capabilities of Strategic Air Forces and would therefore misuse them. A broader contention was that these great bomber units, with their ability to strike at any point in western Europe, should never be confined, even temporarily, to a role wherein their principal task would be to assist in a single ground  LeMay's motives sprang directly from air power theory and the Korean War.
The SAC commander vigorously defended his command's overseas bases amidst posturing by several theater commanders to gain operational control over these sites.
One message from the middle of the decade is particularly relevant and ties together many of the concepts developed in this chapter. In an extensive message to General
Twining (now, Vandenberg's successor as Air Force Chief), LeMay began by assessing the outcome of a recent exercise, which showed "many of the top field commanders still feel they must have direct control over a portion of the offensive air power... [and]   "Message Vandenberg to LeMay, 13 April 1951, LOC MRR, LeMay, box 197.
consider themselves air tacticians better qualified than professional airmen to direct offensive air actions in their respective areas of responsibility." LeMay appears contemptuous of the qualifications and capacities of these field commanders in regards to the strategic air mission, yet he also recognizes their desire to gain control of strategic bombers. Continuing, the SAC Commander expresses more specific criticisms, which shall be quoted at length, to convey a more thorough context:
The employment of three medium bomb wings under the operational control of the Theater Commander in the Korean conflict is an example of top US military decisions in the relatively recent past which have reflected a trend of thinking contrary to the best interests of the AF and the nation as a whole... I am unalterably opposed in principle to the transfer to or operational control of medium or heavy bombers by theater commanders. One of the salient principles involved in the long fight to raise air power to its proper position has been resisting the tendency to use air power piecemeal. The medium and heavy bomber force is designed to do a job, and under SAC it has the capability to do that job. This capability is still increasing. The bombardment force...should be one organization under direct control of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.
LeMay wanted SAC to control the strategic mission, the bases were merely a means of achieving this. In principle, SAC had enjoyed independence since its inception, but in practice-due to the limitations of bomber combat radii-no such status existed unless the command controlled its own assets overseas. SAC bases were a means of gaining control over strategic assets, and through this, the strategic mission.
The end of the Korean War in 1953 saw a redirection of American military strategy, largely due to the Eisenhower Administration's concerns over the legacies of 58 Letter LeMay to Twining, 28 May 1955, LOC MRR, LeMay, box 207. the conflict. Korea had been a frustrating war, with limited aims and no measure of victory, and the new administration sought to prevent another such conflict.
Additionally, as candidate and president-elect, Eisenhower had promised to rein in military spending and balance the budget. 60 Thus, the central problem faced by the new administration was, in the words of one scholar, "the reconciliation of security with solvency." For several months after the Korean armistice, the Eisenhower Administration solidified its national security policy, which formally emerged in October 1953 as NSC-162/2, "the New Look." In an early meeting with the Joint Chiefs the President explained his rationale for this shift in strategy: I stressed that the United States would not employ the same policies and resources to fight another war as were used in the Korean conflict. I saw no sense in wasting manpower in costly small wars that could not achieve decisive results under the political and military circumstances then existing. I felt that this kind of military policy would play in the hands of a potential enemy [the Soviet Union] whose superiority in available manpower was obvious. We should refuse to permit our adversary to enjoy a sanctuary from which he could operate without danger to himself...the Communists would have to be made to realize that should they be guilty of major aggression, we would strike with means of our own choosing at the head of Communist power.

From FY 1950 to FY 1953 the percent of gross national product allocated to defense had tripled, from 4.6% to 13.8%.

This quote builds on a statement made by Eisenhower during his election campaign. One of the most tiiorough assessments of the New Look policy remains Glenn H. Snyder, "The New Look of 1953," in Schilling, et al, Defense, p. 379-524, quote p. 384 (hereafter cited as Snyder, "New Look."); also see Gaddis, Strategies, Chapters 5 and 6; Duane Windsor, "Eisenhower's New Look Reexamined: The View from Three Decades," in Joann P.

The New Look period, as defined here, lasted from October 1953 to October 1957. The resulting policy followed an examination of the national security tasks required by each military service (a process Eisenhower called a "horizontal analysis").
Through this, the Air Force emerged the clear winner, as a breakdown of Eisenhower's first military budget shows: 
63
64
Bundy,
Danger,
The New Look built upon the progress made by NSC-68, but rejected its tenets of deficit spending, high military budgets, and balanced forces. In essence, this policy was a recognition of limited economic means which forced a reliance on nuclear weapons. 
68
In the face of the developing Soviet threat, the broad aim of US security policies must be to create, prior to the achievement of mutual atomic plenty, conditions under which the United States and the free world coalition are prepared to meet the Soviet-Communist threat with resolution and to negotiate for the alleviation under proper safeguards.
The New Look codified American strategy. The report defined the focus and the purpose of American strategic policy: "The major deterrent to aggression in Western Europe is the manifest determination of the US to use its atomic capability and massive one. SAC bombers had been deployed abroad in 1946, 1947,1948,1950, and 1953 in response to international incidents.
73
74
Nuclear firepower, of all kinds, could buttress allied defenses and reduce manpower requirements; they were the only viable recourse at the time. Additionally, these weapons lowered associated defense expenditures and allowed, according to Dulles,
"maximum deterrence at a bearable cost." 78 Comparably, their effects were very cheap:
one thousand tons of TNT cost $1,700, whereas fissionable material needed to produce a 70 kiloton blast cost only $23.
It is too simple to equate the New Look and massive retaliation, a distinction must be drawn to separate two elements of the policy: tactical nuclear weapons and strategic air power. 
80
It would be a mistake to view the Eisenhower Administration's "New Look" strategy as revolving around that [massive retaliation] concept...the central idea was that of asymmetrical response-of reacting to adversary challenges in ways calculated to apply one's own strengths against the other side's weaknesses, even if this meant shifting the nature and location of the confrontation. The effect, it 81 was believed, would be to regain the initiative while reducing costs.
This asymmetry is the essence of SAC bomber bases abroad.
The common distinction among forces of this period, nuclear and conventional, is unsuitable to this study. A more appropriate demarcation is between strategic and tactical forces, with a line drawn at the battlefield. Tactical forces, regardless of weapons, would fight to support the immediate battlefield action, while strategic forces went beyond it, to the sources of enemy support for the war. Tactical nuclear weapons would make up for manpower shortages, serving as a great equalizer along the potential battle zones around Europe. Strategic air power would offer this "asymmetrical response" in which American strengths rested with the speed, accuracy, and weapons of SAC bombers. The weaknesses of the Soviet Union lay with its vastness, and at the time, its lack of strategic weapons. The United States, through its SAC bases,
possessed unequaled and unrivaled access to the Soviet Union.

In these days of near-supersonic speeds, the depth of penetration necessary to reach some of her vital centres is offset by the size of the area to be defended and the fact that it can be attacked from almost all round the compass." Strategy for the West, (London, 1954), p. 34.
The primary purpose of SAC overseas bomber bases was to gain time, thereby consolidating allied resistance against the Soviet Union and constructing American forces for a shift to a polar strategy. Under the coverage of these sites, efforts could be made-particularly by governments in and around Europe-to further their economic health, political solidarity, military integration and forces build up. SAC overseas bases, and the forces they held, served as a strategic umbrella, to allow time for all of this to take place. As Secretary of State Dean Acheson testified to Congress in 1951:
The best use we can make of our present advantage in retaliatory air power, is to move ahead under the protective shield to build the balanced collective forces in Western Europe that will continue to deter aggression after our atomic advantage 85 has been diminished.
There was to be an overall build-up of forces, for no single service or weapons system could fulfill Western security requirements. But even at this early date, it was apparent that Western allies could not possibly equal the massive manpower of the Soviet forces.
The SAC sites are generally included as a portion of the American nuclear umbrella covering Europe, and certainly, that was part of their role. But the distinguishing feature, and unique element, of these sites was not their nuclear The exclusive feature provided by these bases, and only these bases, was their strategic capability. Through most of the decade, only SAC bombers could reach the heartland of the Soviet Union. Through these sites, America could threaten a truly asymmetrical response. The Soviets could not be matched "man for man, tank for tank," their military presence in Europe (which stayed relatively constant at 175 divisionsalthough the strength of these units varied considerably, from about three million to six million soldiers). A direct military counter would entail raising a comparable army, and where would this army have come from? The Senate's "Great Debate" in the winter of 1950-1951 showed the divisive, controversial nature of sending more American troops to Europe. The "Fortress America" contingent, led by former President Herbert Hoover, rallied for the traditional American strategy of non-entanglement. In the end, the Senate by a close vote approved the deployment of four additional divisions to NATO, a token oo force meant to show American commitment and bolster European morale. The NATO rearmament program, begun in 1949 and primarily funded with American dollars after mid-1950, was predicated on the expectation that European nations would develop their strategy" in which thirty front-line divisions possessed tactical nuclear weapons under US control. See Robert E. Osgood, NATO: The Entangling Alliance, (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1962), Chapter 5. For the movement to this nuclear strategy, see Thomas H.

The purpose of deterrence is to dissuade enemy action by engendering a fear of attack. 
92
93
The chief quality of this extended deterrence in the early 1950s was formidability, and 94 to attain this, SAC bombers needed only to endanger Soviet targets. 
92
94
The NATO powers were induced to make the precedent-shattering commitments ofthat alliance only upon our promise that the United States SAC stood ready at all times to implement it. The NATO alliance was the means by which our partners could avail themselves ofthat kind of support, and it was the only way in which the United States could bind them, if attacked, to defend themselves vigorously and in combination. It was also the only way in which the United States could get them to contribute the complementary forces which the entire defense scheme was deemed to require, as well as to provide the advance bases considered essential at the time for the appropriate wartime employment of SAC. 
95
LeMay viewed SAC's role very simply: "The paramount aim expressed in the National Security Policy is to deter war, and to prevail should war eventuate...Strategic air forces provide the greatest single deterrent to war. As such, they hold the key to the

So, for the initial selection of SAC overseas bases, emphasis rested with the DELTA mission. The Soviet economy was the easiest of the three areas to assess, and target sets could be pre-planned. SAC planners could allocate weapons and assign individual bomb units to these targets, which lay deep in Soviet territory.
The grouping of SAC's DELTA targets can be gleaned from two RAND studies of the 1950s. 
101
From these forward sites SAC officers could plan a considerable number of attacks upon Soviet targets. This greatly complicated the Soviet air defense situation;
American bombers could threaten from several different axes and Soviet air coverage had to spread to protect against a vast array of possible entry routes, diluting defenses and forcing a substantial commitment of resources.

104
You will notice that they form a ring around the USSR. This base system will permit us flexibility in attacking from many different directions...we can plan a variety of attacks which will be most difficult to stop and should cause the 105 Russian to spread his defenses around his borders.
Placing SAC bombers abroad allowed tremendous offensive capabilities, but this also posed compelling defensive problems for the command. There are two types of deterrent forces: denial-which defend the surrounding area, and retaliation-which threaten a distant location. SAC forces were the latter, composed entirely of offensive aircraft designed for use in the enemy homeland. As Brodie writes, "Among the
[strategy] changes we have to cope with today, perhaps the most significant militarily is the loss of the defensive function as an inherent capability of our major offensive forces." 106 SAC bombers operating from overseas bases remained a force at risk, one incapable of defending itself. Indeed, this was the thesis of RAND R-266, which noted "unfortunately when we are close, not only is our power to attack the enemy very great, but also his power to attack us."
Defensive considerations pointed the command towards sites on the edge of the continent, where bases would be less exposed to military threats from every mediumland, sea, and air. Initially, the primary threat to these sites was a large-scale ground  Separating these funds by country and by service reveals several relevant points. The RAF received $659 million from the United States, exceeding the expenditures of the other two British services combined.

For while the base system was established and expanded primarily to assure the effectiveness of our strategic air-atomic capability... [now] in truth it has become a major~if at times a too conspicuous-element of United States foreign policy.
Townsend Hoopes, 1958   Political conditions constrained SAC's overseas bases and imposed a measurable effect on the potential capability of the command. Despite the multitude of countries and the complexity of the issues, the United States successfully gained rights to an array of bases around the Northern Hemisphere. Retaining these sites, however, became more difficult throughout the decade as an assortment of political threats developed, limiting access and undermining the very purpose these forward positions sought to fulfill.
The outbreak of the Korean War prompted an intense American diplomatic effort towards obtaining overseas military bases of all kinds, and among them, sites for SAC bomber bases.

2 Throughout this chapter, the concept of "base" differs slightly from previous chapters. Here, the concern lies with access rights to a bomber base site, as opposed to the occupation of one by rotational bomb units. Base historians rightfully credit the Korean War as being the catalyst for the vigorous American diplomatic effort to gain overseas military bases, but these studies are of a broad nature and little research exists on the resulting international politics of SAC bomber bases. James Blaker's book, the secondary source most useful in several previous chapters, does not even address political issues. Other base histories tend to center on later eras or merely a single country.

American diplomats attempted to meld SAC bases into the overall collection of facilities being discussed with foreign governments. Through an analysis of the diplomatic framework which was used to obtain the bases, it is apparent-even before bomber sites developed-that the bomber bases would hold a critical position in purely American strategy, despite the international format thorough which they were attained. the United States Information Agency, the Treasury Department, the Military Assistance Group, and an officer from the military command seeking the new base.
Alterations occurred with this standard country team configuration when negotiating SAC bases. An Air Force officer from the regional command structure, rather than a SAC officer, generally represented SAC interests. This did reduce the visibility of the base's unique command arrangement, but the purpose was to appease The tying together which follows from the establishment of mutual defense arrangements, particularly those which are multilateral in character, tends to stabilize and secure a relationship which would otherwise be more subject to the countervailing pressures and divisive forces to which every government is more or less exposed. A multilateral organization tends to create an atmosphere of common purpose and effort in which the granting to the United States of certain facilities may be publicly represented and justified as a contribution toward the attainment of common objective.
These defense treaties paved the way for attaining American bases, by placing mutual security and common interests at the forefront. They also allowed the United States team to stress obligations expected of an ally, such American access to bases.
The most important of these alliances was NATO. According to the Nash Report: "The NATO area is the major theater in the cold war, and represents our greatest investment in terms of political commitments, economic assistance, forces in being, and military bases." 
15
Political alignments were not certain during this era, nor were continuing alliances. On a somber but realistic note, RAND R-266 concludes this discussion of hosts by stating: "Even given the failure of the North Atlantic Treaty Alliance, it is clear that there is a strong likelihood of the survival of a substantial part of the base system." 
24
25
to support NATO's existence, but even should this alliance fail, the political dispersal of SAC's overseas bases ensured that American national security would not be jeopardized.
The procedures for negotiating American overseas bases were the same, and gaining operating rights for SAC were no different from any other American commands. 
26
The American team started base negotiations by describing the threat facing the host nation. Usually this was Soviet-led communism, bolstered by its formidable ground force. The Nash Report notes that this was particularly effective among European nations, for the American mediators used the World War II experience to stress that these nations could not protect themselves, and that it was increasingly 27 doubtful that an adversary would honor a neutral status. Communist political parties were active in many of these nations, and in Iceland even 29 held prominent positions withm the government.
Sensitive to possible charges of imperialism or coercion, the American team sought to publicly underline the role of the host government in the negotiations. The Nash Report recommended that public information campaigns "must continue to emphasize the collective defense basis for US activities," and stress that the American military presence "results from wholly voluntary invitation of the host government (thus constituting a manifestation rather than a derogation of national sovereignty)." This was especially critical in former colonial territories which had become newly-formed nations. 
30
31
But there was much more to these negotiations than political allegiance and common purpose. Simon Duke, in his thorough assessment of American bases in Europe, has found that neither side in the negotiating process was magnanimous, both were guided by self interests. 
32
The primary incentive American diplomats offered to the host nation was money. This issue will be treated more fully later, but should be noted here because it contained a strong political element and arose routinely during base negotiations. The United States presented money to foreign governments for a variety of purposes,
including humanitarian reasons, stability of foreign trade, and vital political interests.
These factors were all independent of the utility of strategic air bases, but the diplomatic trick was to use this economic aid as leverage, intrinsically tying it to base access, quid pro quo.
A matter for further historical research would be to examine the American aid funds during the 1950s, specifically for individual countries which would later gain SAC bomber bases. 
34
My concern here, though, is how American negotiators presented this money to early stages of negotiations. This tactic strengthened the American bargaining position and successfully reduced the diplomatic negotiating room for the hosts.
American negotiators soon became aware of a "common denominator" pattern among host nations, as compromises with one country often brought increased demands from another. Concessions for a specific base in one country could reverberate half a world away, in a separate country with an entirely different geopolitical situation. If these costs remained hidden, lumped into a broad incentive package, there was less opportunity for other nations to demand alterations to their base agreements. Some of the initial access rights had come from service-to-service agreements or isolated negotiations by State officials, but further into the period State recognized and reacted to these global interrelationships. The Nash Report summarized the need for this: "The time has long since passed when one service can make its own arrangements with a particular country, or, indeed, where the United States, as a government, can make 37 arrangements with one nation without regard for possible repercussion with another."
The United States and the host nation used the potential economic impact to induce regional support for the facility. This began with base construction, as diplomatic agreements generally required host nation firms to build part of the facility.
Many of the host nations could not supply the necessary heavy construction, but did 39 offer a variety of local agencies for completion of the smaller projects. Air base 36 Nash Report, DDEL, p. 76. The next chapter will show that it remains difficult to directly correlate permission costs to the bases; this 1953 policy compounded the problem even further, for a diverse collection of funds were included in the negotiating package and many had little connection to the use of the bases. 37 Nash Report, DDEL, p. 6.

39
The large, temporary presence of outside workers amounted to a tremendous collection of new spending units, but could also cause produce transient inflation; for instance, the arrival often thousand employees with Atlas Constructors doubled prices of consumer goods around the Moroccan SAC bases.

Hiring locals was often an economic benefit for the United States. Estimates at one American base in England found a savings of $38 million over three years with the use of indigenous labor. The figure of "nine times" was for a truck driver in France during 1953. 83rd Congress, "Construction Overseas," p. 5.
An illuminating economic case study has been made of American bases in West Germany in the 1950s. Although no SAC bases were built there, it illustrates the tremendous extent and impact that these American facilities could have on a host nation. In 1951, the American military was the sixth largest employer in the country, and through the decade US bases spent 95.76 million marks on direct purchases within the country-the equivalent of almost six percent of the Marshall Plan expenditures in West Germany. Dewey A. Browder, "The GI Dollar and the Wirtschaftswunder" Journal of European Economic History, Winter 1993, pp. 601-612. estimated that in 1957 the entire collection of American overseas bases placed $2.2 billion into local economies, and employed 350,000 indigenous workers. To put these figures in perspective with others from the same year: this slightly exceeded the construction costs of all public utilities built for electric power and light across the United States, and was just beyond the number of officers in the entire American military.
Personnel issues were often the most sensitive to the native population and routinely host nations placed caps on the maximum number of American personnel stationed within their country. 
45
46
Icelandic Foreign Minister Emil Jonsson protested in October 1956, saying that the number of American servicemen in his country compared to stationing six million Icelanders in the United States. The situation in Greenland was even more pronounced,

for in 1957 thirty-one percent of the people on the entire island were Americans on a military base.
The large influx of Americans which came with the American bases could be problematic for the host nation in general and the local population in particular. In contrast to the locals, American servicemen often had greater incomes, a separate language, peculiar customs, different standards of behavior, and (especially in the Middle East) other religions. 
49
It is somewhat of an abnormal situation for large numbers of nationals from one nation to be quartered in another nation.... It is a difficult situation. It brings on misunderstandings and problems... [which] are inherent in the situation and they are inevitable. It seems to me that when the danger of war recedes, regardless of the attitude of the government, the attitude of the people must inevitably be "Americans, go home."
The italicized phrase raises a pivotal issue: How did the views of the Cold War differ for the United States and its hosts? This was a crucial point for many SAC bomber bases, which due to their mission, were at the very forefront of Cold War strategy, but due to their locations, were often far removed from its tensions. 
48
50
The American view was that the Cold War was a conflict with a continuous threat of war which required preparations and forward facilities. But this was not a consensus among all of SAC's host nations. Iceland is a telling example of this divergence of views. Under the 1951 base agreement, American forces were to leave the island when there was a "state of peace." But the precise meaning of this term differed to the two governments: Iceland defined it as absence of war, whereas to the United States it was the absence of a threat to NATO. This issue culminated in March 1956, when the Progressive and Social Democrats won a majority, formed a collective government, and introduced a resolution calling for the removal of all American servicemen. The debate persisted until the Althing rescinded the resolution, largely influenced by the brutal Soviet intervention in Hungary.
Another contentious matter was land, the amount requested and its later use.
"Practically everywhere in the world," announced the Nash Report, "demands for land are unpopular, economically disruptive, and politically damaging. Premature, fluctuating, and excessive US requirements have resulted in severe criticism and hard feelings." 
52
Development of an air base could infringe on the local inhabitants, which could not only cause tensions, but also hamper flying operations. In populated areas within developed countries, this could result in lawsuits. A typical legal claim against the Air Force was for diminution in property value, usually due to jet noise, and filed by residents living near the end of runways. For this reason Air Force criteria for a new flying base directed it be at least fifteen miles from any large population center.
Refurbished bases, as were most in the United Kingdom, were often in populated areas, and even if a base was built far from the nearest community, urban development typically spread closer to the facility within several years of construction. Sparsely populated areas in developing countries also presented distinct problems. Bedouin tribesmen around the SAC bases in French Morocco did not accept the loss of their hereditary land. Trespassing was common, and it was not unusual to find sheep grazing alongside the runways, tended by shepherds who had cut the perimeter fence. Thefts occurred regularly and peaked in 1956, when Morocco gained independence and local tribes sought to reclaim their domains. 
53
54
55
Occasionally, poor coordination between American negotiators, the military, and Congress also allowed sites to be purchased by the host government but never used by the American military, due to redirection of funds or change in priorities. After the purchase of land for a SAC base near Macha Bel Ksiri, French Morocco, the command found the site unsuitable and declined it, prompting diplomatic protests from France. In response, the United States reimbursed the French colonial overseers $143,000 for real estate expenses. 
57
But what would become the most divisive political issue of all was the one not mentioned during these negotiations: a SAC facility-by virtue of its weapons, mission, communications cable over 21,000 feet long was stolen, and active power lines were cut from electrical poles and transported forty miles for sale at a village market. The local chieftain, known as a Caid, was responsible for security outside the base. In the case of the power lines, the culprits were found, jailed, and reported as "killed in a riot" while being held. Thievery declined markedly after that. Adams, Morocco, pp. 73-74. 
56
57
59
58
59
The temporary nature of these sites can also be seen, for base diplomacy waned by the middle of the decade. Multiple agreements with Canada, Japan, Iceland, and the United Kingdom generally involved additional locations or slight amendments to previous agreements.
Although the United States obtained most of the bomber bases within the framework of an existing multinational alliance, the specific agreements often contained bilateral terms which differed markedly from one another. The most prominent components hinged on the issue of time; specifically, the length of the agreement and the period in which SAC aircraft could move to the site in a crisis. Breaking down the terms of these agreements reveals a jumble of operational rights. Unless otherwise noted, each "x" in the following table represents a separate agreement with an single host nation:  mutual). Portugal granted two time limits to the Azores, peacetime for 5 years, and wartime (D-Day, NATO), but only the latter is listed. Sources: see Table 
6
Across the top row are SAC rotational bomber bases in foreign territory; left to right, these were for five bases in Spain, one in Libya, three in French Morocco (before its independence from NATO-member France), and nine in the United Kingdom. In addition to these nine sites in foreign nations, SAC also had four rotational bomber bases on American territory: one in Puerto Rico, two in Alaska, and one on Guam.
Staging bases were primarily for training and tanker deployments, among them were SAC bases in Greenland and Canada, and also at Military Air Transport Service (MATS) bases in the Azores and Iceland. D-Day use meant that the command could only occupy the base during a "specified crisis," but the precise meaning of this phrase varied. Saudi Arabia allowed this, but it was the most common among NATO members (Norway, Italy, Greece, and Turkey) and required both nations to be at war against a mutual enemy under the terms of the NATO alliance.
The most compelling time limits are those on either end of intact, yet somewhat contentious, to this day. 
66
"prior consultation" (which was understood to be tantamount to a Japanese veto) was required before introducing nuclear weapons or launching combat operations of any kind.
The most permissive base agreements, by far, were with the United Kingdom, yet even these remained indistinct. 69 There were numerous agreements signed with the British government throughout the period, and many more "understandings," service-toservice agreements, and informal discussions. As several historians have noted, though,

Under arrangements made for the common defense, the United States has the use of certain bases in the United Kingdom. The prior understanding was confirmed that the use of these bases in an emergency would be a matter for joint decision by Her Majesty's government and the United States government in the light of the circumstances prevailing at the time.
Significantly, this agreement was entirely between the two governments, no consultations were required with any multinational organization. Despite the vagueness, and perhaps because of it, this would remain the guiding agreement for over four decades.
The United Kingdom was the favored host nation for SAC, and the special relationship is clearly evident in basing documents.

Three and a half years later, the Nash Report, after analyzing the host nations for every American military facility around the globe, also placed the United Kingdom in the most prominent position. The report went beyond earlier assessments to stress the reciprocity of this special relationship and the resulting benefit to American strategic air power:
The United Kingdom remains our strongest and most important ally and our indispensable partner in marshaling and maintaining Free World strength to contain Soviet aggression. Britain needs the support of the United States in all major respects, political, economic, and military. The United States, in turn, needs the political and moral support of the United Kingdom and maintenance of a political climate which will insure the continued availability of United Kingdom bases and facilities for the projection of our military power in Europe and against the heartland of the Soviet Union.
Fifteen SAC bases were built in the United Kingdom during the 1950s, nine of these were built in England for the exclusive use of SAC rotational bombers-the greatest concentration of strategic air bases anywhere in the world. Through
Commonwealth and British colonial territories SAC gained base rights in Canada, Bermuda, Malta, Cyprus, and Ascension Island. The British presence in Libya and
As evidence of the strong British resolve, this report emphasized that the United Kingdom's defense budget had nearly doubled since the start of the Korean War, in spite of the nation's severe economic situation. HQ USEUCOM, "Report on the Effectiveness of Forces, European NATO Countries," section X, United Kingdom, as of 30 June 1953, NA Suitland (College Park, Maryland), RG 330, box 20, file Greece-UK, p. 10.
Again using defense expenditures to illustrate the British commitment to the West, this report further noted that the British self-financed military production was greater than all other NATO allies combined The expected defense expenditure was 5.1 billion pounds, and was for the period of time corresponding to US FY 1951 to FY 1954 Egypt also allowed base rights for SAC bombers. And unlike the formal arrangements with other countries, American operating rights in many of these British areas required minimal diplomacy, often attained merely through service-to-service agreements. "One of the most important aspects of the US-UK relations," reads the Nash Report, "is the remarkably close collaborations and sense of partnership already existing between the military of the two countries." 
77
The foundation of this relationship was laid during the Second World War, and the precedent for base access occurred shortly after the conflict: the last American wartime bomber left England in February 1946, and only four months later air leaders of the two countries concluded the Spaatz-Tedder Agreement to prepare four airfields in East
Anglia for their subsequent return.
By the middle of the decade SAC access to overseas bases faced mounting political difficulties. SAC access rights could no longer merely blend into the overall collection of American overseas sites, the distinctiveness of these bases began to emerge and became readily apparent to host nations. In 1953 John Foster Dulles told Eisenhower that, from the host nation's perspective, the SAC bases might eventually

78
There were two major political issues which threatened retention of these sites: nationalism among the new nations, and military risk among the established ones.
Either way, the outcome was the same: SAC bases were no longer considered an advantage for the host. Efforts to retain access rights abroad threatened to undermine a major purpose of these sites, the consolidation of allies.
Complexities arose with the retraction of colonial territories and the rise of independence movements, causing a perpetual diplomatic scramble to preserve access rights to overseas bomber bases. Seeking to retain use of these facilities forced United States diplomats into the awkward position of downplaying their traditional opposition to colonial holdings, and even beyond this, to endorse the position of external powers in Goa, the Bonin Islands, French Morocco, and Egypt.

Independence or coups compounded the status of the bases in newly independent countries, generally resulting in renegotiation or removal of SAC facilities. These relations had always been difficult, primarily due to the tremendous power disparities between the United States and the host, which in turn, led to diplomatic mistrust on both sides. The Nash Report recounts that American officials had to be "constantly alert to foreign sensibilities on issues of sovereignty, since there is among most of our allies a hypersensitivity to inferred or imagined US slights to their national dignity and sovereign prerogatives," particularly "in those areas...which have recently emerged from a colonial status." 83 American access to air bases in the Cairo-Suez area was arduous, racked with severe problems due to British occupation and Egyptian nationalism, and has been analyzed by numerous historians.

forth several recommendations to further interaction between host nations and each American base, in an attempt to further cooperation and acceptance. Many of these were simple matters, easily remedied, such as using two languages on all base signs and flying the host nation flag. But, here again, SAC bases posed particular problems.
Bomber bases had many more base jobs classified as "sensitive," and these positions could not be filled by non-Americans. Additionally some aspects of joint planning were forbidden between SAC units and host nation forces, and in some cases so were military He felt that we had our heads in the sand on the bases--the foreign countries concerned were excited about national aspirations and sovereignty and we were in a position of being blackmailed. He noted that only this morning, in connection with the paper on Libya, it had been indicated that we were likely to have trouble at Wheelus [Air Base]. He thought that the base agreements which had been made ten years ago were beginning to be outmoded. We could not continue to depend on these facilities on the same basis as in the past.
At the same time as this political concern, though, new strategic weapons began to enter the American inventory. This was opportune, for the Soviet strategic arsenal was also undergoing tremendous growth, expanding political threats to SAC overseas access, even among larger, established countries.
Early in the decade host nations welcomed the protection of the American strategic forces, epitomized by SAC overseas bomber bases. "One-sided" deterrence, when only America possessed a strategic capability, was easy for the United States to practice and for the hosts to accept. But the growth of the Soviet strategic threat, wellknown among hosts and well-publicized by the Soviets, brought latent political tensions to the forefront. Host governments and local populations began to fully comprehend the risks associated with these sites. The unique features of S AC's overseas bomber bases could no longer be concealed, and could not remain imbedded within the broad collection of other American overseas bases.
The mere presence of nuclear weapons could bring hazards, even in peacetime. bases, as well as transport flights carrying nuclear weapons to overseas locations).
Fitting this criteria are nine known accidents: six outside the United States and three within. There were extreme safeguards built into the nuclear weapons environment, but 93 even if inert, these weapons accidents could be catastrophic, militarily and politically.
The SAC mission had always distinguished it from other bases, but later in the decade the peril this brought became more apparent to the hosts. RAND R-266 summarized this budding perception: "There is some justification, then, for feeling that a strategic base increases both the general security of the allied forces and the specific hazards of the area in which it is based." 94 Foreign governments and local populations tended to favorably accept military facilities which could add to regional defenses, such as army posts, naval ports, even fighter bases. A SAC bomber base, however, could only contribute defensively in a more indirect way. This issue arose in 1952 when the Icelandic government criticized the United States for not fulfilling its commitment to defend the island, noting that fighters were not based on their territory, only SAC bombers.
Should war occur, these sites actually increased the risks to the host nation and the local area. In the late 1950s the main targets for the growing assortment of Soviet 93 An excellent analysis of nuclear weapons accidents, real and potential, can be found in Scott D. Sagan, The Limits of Safety: Organizations. Accidents, and Nuclear Weapons, (Princeton; Princeton University Press, 1993). Although Sagan's case studies are outside the time period of this report (they begin with the Cuban Missile Crisis), the overall discussion relates well to the issue of safety within the American arsenal. See especially Chapter One, 'The Origins of Accidents.' The most infamous accident involving a SAC bomber and nuclear weapons occurred on 17 January 1966 when a KC-135 collided with a B-52 near Palomares, Spain. See Christopher Morris, The Day Thev Lost the H-Bomb, (New York: Coward, 1966); Flora Lewis, One of Our H-Bombs is Missing. (New York: McGraw, 1967).

Routine air base expansions at Tachikawa, Niigata, Kisarazu, and Yokota (facilities not even used by SAC, although the last was a potential wartime site) brought protests against nuclear weapons, injuring hundreds. Resistance to many of these projects continued for over a year, even after the Japanese government issued a public statement in August 1955 that construction was unrelated to nuclear bombers. The leader of the formal protests at Tachikawa (near Tokyo) was the mayor, who told The New York Herald Tribune, "We don't want the same thing to happen here as happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki." 98 And in 1957, the Ryukyun Legislature unanimously passed a resolution to halt American air base construction at Kadena, for fear of "the annihilation of the entire Okinawa population." 
96
The British government had always realized the hazards associated with SAC facilities, yet unflinchingly accepted their role as host. British political and military leaders fully accepted, and truly endorsed, dependence on SAC forces. Certainly, this stance goes beyond mere international friendship, for until the production of the V-Class bombers and British nuclear weapons-both of which began to arrive in 1957-the United Kingdom had no strategic force capable of substituting for SAC. British reliance on the deterrent power of SAC bombers preceded, and perhaps exceeded, that of the United States. 
105
104
105
A significant change occurred among these threats in late 1957. Prior to this, pronouncements from Moscow stressed the aggressive American base position and its resulting threat to peace. But following Sputnik the tone became harsher and stressed the Soviet missile threat to the host nations. 
113
At present the inherent liabilities and cumulative frictions are in greatest evidence...With the progressive development of Soviet atomic striking powerdramatically emphasized by the sputniks--and with the mounting drumfire of harsh Soviet warnings that countries containing American bases will be magnets 115 for attack and destruction in the event of war, the anxiety has grown.
Growing Soviet capabilities carried political repercussions among SAC host nations, and this developed in two distinct stages. The first has been recounted, the fear of devastation, as hosts perceived the growing threat to themselves by having SAC bases on their soil. Soviet missiles could threaten portions of Western Europe as early as 1955, but it was Sputnik which made this threat apparent. Strategic bomber bases would be a primary target in a superpower war, for they held a strategic capability which threatened the Soviet Union directly. This meant that a host nation's territory could be attacked, regardless of the host nation's involvement in a war between the United States and the Soviet Union. Host territory would become a battlefield due to the presence of SAC facilities and this prompted a strategic dilemma for these countries:
did the American security guarantees outweigh the risk generated by these sites? This was an imponderable.
By 1960 the Soviet Union proclaimed the deployment of an Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) capable of reaching North America. This presented some perplexing considerations. NATO allies now had to grapple with the realization that Article 5-the very foundation on which America gained overseas base access-went two ways, as the agreement clearly reads: "An armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an armed attack against them all..."
Again, this brought the prospect, or more properly the assurance, that European allies would become actively involved in a war which began only between the superpowers.
This was troubling, but not new, and certainly not unexpected.  
119
Thus, political problems with retaining overseas access for SAC bombers grew throughout the decade. The SAC sites were sui generis among America's overseas bases, and as this became exceedingly apparent, they faced an increasing number of political threats from host nations. These difficulties peaked late in the decade, and occurred simultaneously as new strategic weapons entered in the American arsenal.
SAC overseas bomber bases were temporary measures, but political conditions expedited the conversion to other, less politically controversial, strategic platforms. The haunting political difficulties associated with these sites could now be circumvented.
Technological innovations freed the United States from many of the binds of international politics, which had allowed, directed, and restricted, the projection of American strategic air power throughout the decade.

Chapter 5
The essential justification for vast expenditures on overseas strategic bases must be that, without such bases, a strategic force capable of doing a given job would cost vastly more, if it were feasible at all. General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, 1951
The story of SAC overseas bases cannot, and should not, be told in purely economic terms. Due to bureaucratic methods of the past and classification levels of the present, it remains extremely difficult to separate base costs from larger issues of foreign policy and military strategies. But doing so sheds light on an unexplored aspect of these sites, and presents two new assessments: the bases were much more expensive than generally assumed, yet even so, the tremendous costs did have an economic justification.
As we have seen, the outbreak of the Korean War brought massive defense and projects proceeded at a frenzied pace, before leveling off for "the long pull" guidance which began in 1954. At the transition between these two periods, the Senate Subcommittee on Real Estate and Military Construction noted:
The point, in so far as expenditure of construction funds goes, is that a position of formidable strength is being attained. We still have much yet to do, but no longer need to build every possible base that anyone could propose in every possible position under the sun.
By the middle of the decade the United States military controlled almost thirty-three million acres of land-over six million overseas-with an estimated value of twenty-two billion dollars.
Also known, is the Air Force portion of this build-up and its results. The service received nearly two-thirds of the military construction budget throughout the decade.
For most of this time, Air Force construction expenditures averaged over one billion dollars a year, which still amounted to less than one-third the amount of money the Air Force spent on new aircraft. 5 At peak rates in the middle of the decade, the service's construction contract awards averaged $115 million a month. Counting facilities of all kinds, the Air Force nearly doubled its installations, from 1,600 to 3,100, while the number of principal bases swelled to 360, with 156 overseas. The construction program had grown so large and expensive that in 1956 the Assistant Chief of Staff, Installations, told Congress, "Some people think that one billion dollars a year is a pretty good flow, but compared to the job to be done it is inadequate." Overseas strategic air bases were only one element of the Air Force program, but through the middle of the decade consumed almost one-fourth the service's construction budget.
Beyond this, base histories include very little about economic issues, and fail to fully address the topic.

Reluctance by other historians to discuss economic aspects of overseas bases might be due to the fragmentary historical record as well as the difficulty of separating the costs from other expenditures. This chapter will thus rely mainly on primary sources, the 84th Congress Study of Airpower, the Nash Report, and RAND R-266. The latter is the major source for this chapter, for its main emphasis was economic. The report came from RAND's Economics Division, and three of the four authors were economists. Partial economic evidence is thus available, which will be used to search for an overall monetary assessment of the cost of these sites.
Blaker's assessment of the permission costs of the later period also applies in the case of SAC bases of the 1950s. His conclusion, that permission costs paid by the United States government to acquire an overseas facility cannot be precisely determined, holds here as well. The most thorough base study ofthat era, the Nash Report, had direct access to classified information at the highest level of the American government, but still found that the money paid directly for overseas bases could not be separated from other funds: "There is no effective way to accurately appraise base price, 
Duke,
Europe,

for too many factors... [concerning] foreign aid apportionment of base use cannot be split out." 1 ' The report found that permission costs had been rolled into America's grand strategy, bounded by diverse issues of international relations, economic aid, and military practices. The exact costs for obtaining an overseas base were intertwined, blended with the others, and could not be discerned. Repeatedly, to Congressional investigators as well as members of the Nash Report, officials within the State Department and the Department of Defense refused to specify (or perhaps, could not specify) the price of obtaining overseas operating rights. Permission costs for American 12 overseas bases of the 1950s, even if known at the time, are still classified.
Each country benefited by keeping these funds indeterminate, and further, the added secrecy protected both parties. For host nation leaders, any pecuniary motivation was concealed and permission costs could be accepted without scrutiny from other allied nations. This also held advantages for American negotiators. A host government could not directly seek to increase these costs, because the amount directly paid for the American facility was effectively hidden, lost in a broad package of economic and military aid. Additionally, separate host nations could not easily compare the amount of money given by the United States and then seek to renegotiate financial terms. Through this process, the notion of shared security interests was propagated, without direct 13 evidence of other monetary incentives.
American officers and politicians generally viewed permission costs as distasteful. Having a military presence abroad, to these officials, amounted to mutual " Nash

security and there should be no exchange of funds for the "privilege" of operating a base in another country. But permission costs were paid around the world throughout the decade and had become, in the words of one observer, "facts of international life." President Truman discussed the relationship between aid and access in a 1951 public speech:
The Air Force has to have bases overseas to be in the right place to give full protection to our own country as well as to our allies. This is a clear example of how joining with other free nations for mutual defense helps all of us. Our allies cannot maintain and defend the necessary bases unless we give them aid. Giving aid to our allies is just as necessary as building airplanes if we are to have world The JCS concurred with this proposal, as did Secretary of Defense James Forrestal, who unsuccessfully sought support from Assistant Secretary of State Robert Lovett. The issue resurfaced internally within the Pentagon the next year, and the JCS formally proposed the concept again in October 1950.

The Nash Report repeatedly stresses that the relationship between overseas bases and permission costs was quid pro quo: American money in exchange for operating rights. The report even goes beyond this, stating that access to bases determined the amount of economic and military aid extended to the host nation. This cannot be disproved, but it also cannot be confirmed. Testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in June 1958, Secretary of State John Foster Dulles stated: "The system of collective defense that the free world nations have built is not one-sided. It is not just the United States gift to the world." Other nations contributed ground forces, a strong will to resist communism, and "bases, which greatly increases the efficiency of our deterrent force."
26
In contrast, facility costs can be measured and are relatively precise, although these values are notably absent from the secondary literature. Analysis of the primary documents shows that these costs were much higher than similar assessments of bases from later periods. 
28
The cost of pavements consisted of several taxiways totaling about one-and-a-half million dollars, a runway costing twice that, and parking aprons worth over six million dollars. The three main building complexes (maintenance, housing, administrative and community structures) taken together, amounted to forty percent of the construction cost. But this facility was still quite Spartan, with only limited maintenance capability, troop housing (the airman went unaccompanied by family members), and only one runway. These itemized costs could also easily climb, depending on the facility design.
Many SAC bases had two or more runways, which then required more taxiways, driving up the costs. The most significant point though, was that these prices were for a facility built in the continental United States.
To adjust this facility cost for an overseas location requires multiplication by a figure called the construction cost index--the additional money expended to build a facility abroad. This accounts for variances among different locations: weather (northern latitudes had a limited construction season), necessary construction standards (northern facilities required more insulation, enclosures, and heated buildings), as well as availability of a local work force, major transportation, and construction materials.
The following table, also from 1952, separates the construction costs by location:  
9
The highest component of the construction indices was building standards, not labor costs. In general, distant locations were more expensive not so much because of the importation of outside workers, but from colder temperatures. Iceland was not more remote than Japan, but the extreme climate required facility modifications which doubled the comparable base construction costs. An entire industry sprang up to support the construction of American overseas bases, and this kept a ready pool of 30 skilled workers, which further kept down the labor costs.
Notably missing from these figures is the cost of land or rent. The standard policy was for the host government to purchase land for the American airfield, with no direct charge to the United States. The United States paid to relocate any existing structures and reimbursed the host government for any facilities which remained on the site. American military forces then used the base under a lease agreement, usually free 31 of direct charge.
But the costs of operating bombers abroad went beyond merely building a base.
To become operational, an overseas base incurred a great deal of additional expenses. A distant installation required more airlift, logistics support, and command structures.
This was no pittance either, for in 1954 SAC overseas bases employed 70,000 people

locations. The Air Force financed these hidden costs with funds from research and development, operations and maintenance, or procurement-all outside the military construction program. A January 1961 report to Congress by the Comptroller General estimates that these collateral costs added about twenty-five percent beyond that 34 appropriated for air base construction.
As the annual figures show, remote locations also had larger recurring expenses, the largest of these were for airlift and theater support, which generally comprised about two-thirds of the yearly costs. The more isolated the facility, the higher these expenses;
Greenland, for example, had theater support costs fifty percent higher than the other locations.
A standard B-47 wing had forty-five aircraft, and dividing the systems cost in 
As presented thus far, the SAC system of overseas bomber bases involved a collection of new facilities around the Northern Hemisphere, where medium bomb wings from the United States could rotate abroad for a ninety day period. But alternatives existed to this practice, and each involved distinct costs. Considered here are alternatives within the framework of American national strategy and the SAC force structure. Broader alternatives, which would change strategy or reduce reliance on medium bombers before late in the decade, are not addressed. Within these constraints, there were two broad groups of economic alternatives. To fulfill their assigned missions, bombers needed fuel and operating locations; changing either carried cost implications.
If an American medium bomber was to leave from North America to attack sites within the Soviet Union, it required additional fuel. Under the base system which developed, aircraft were refueled in the course of routine operations at forward rotational bases. Other possibilities were to air refuel enroute to targets or to ground refuel at a forward location (which would have only minimal facilities, and was known as a "bare base"). Both of these options were highlighted in RAND R-266, and each came out on an extreme end of the overall systems costs.
It took five KC-97s to double the combat radius of a B-47. To optimize combat radii, bomber missions require tankers at specific points in the mission profile, and these points move closer together at a greater radius. A brief explanation will illustrate. If a generic graph is drawn for a turbojet bomber-with combat radius on the horizontal axis and systems cost on the vertical axis-it would be J-shaped. As tankers are used to extend the combat radius, the curve flattens, for bomber systems costs decline as the bomber radius extends. But with the addition of the tanker fleet which made this possible, the combined systems costs are considerably higher than that for the bomber alone. Granted, the radius extends, but there is a steep price. To be specific, RAND analysts calculated the systems cost for the primary bomber-tanker pair of the 1950s (the B-47E with the KC-97): to increase the Stratojet's radius to 3,600 miles tripled the total systems cost, 4,200 miles was a five-fold increase, and 5,200 was a tenfold increase.
Of all the possibilities examined in RAND R-266, air refueling was the most expensive. An overall systems cost was calculated by the RAND authors to compare the collection of forward bases with an intercontinental air refueling program, both with a goal of destroying eighty percent of the Soviet industry. After factoring in all 
38

40
elements (such as fuel and aircraft systems), the operating expenses necessary to conduct this campaign from forward bases was $27.3 million per bomber, while air refueling from the continental United States was $43.4 per bomber. 4 Within this scenario, the additional costs to air refuel just one wing of B-47s equaled the initial systems cost of five new medium bomber rotational bases built in French Morocco.
The least expensive basing scheme discussed in RAND R-266 was a forward system of ground refueling bases. These sites would be built only to minimum standards, with merely a single runway, a small staff, limited equipment, and over six million gallons of fuel. 43 SAC bombers would reside in the United States, then deploy on their wartime missions, with a stop enroute to obtain more fuel so they could reach designated targets. This required comparably modest costs, as an entire ground refueling base could be built for forty percent of a rotational base. Annual costs were considerably lower as well, for it took much less to support this moderate site. In the scenario presented above, a campaign using ground refueling bases cost less than onethird that of a campaign using air refueling. But the United States did not adopt this procedure until late in the decade.

RAND analysts working on R-266 sought to quantify the broad costs associated with the emerging assets, to compare against the rotational base concept then in use. Using a wide variety of Air Force sources, the authors of R-266 calculated the overall systems cost for several SAC wings based in the United States. Source: Summation of data found in Table

A true intercontinental bomber situated for operational use was thus very expensive. As Eisenhower commented in one of his most well-received speeches:
The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than thirty cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of sixty thousand population. It is two, fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete highway.
This is an early pronouncement against what would later be called the military industrial complex. He concluded this 1953 speech with an acknowledgment of, and indictment against, the developing arms race: "This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of "54 iron.
Funding for all American military bases followed the same Congressional procedures, and as far as these mechanisms, an overseas SAC base was the same as an Congressional appropriation, the middle step in the funding process that set aside the money for a specific purpose, was detailed and complex. Expenditures of appropriated funds were strictly bound by American laws and regulations, regardless of whether the money was spent domestically or overseas. Congress, therefore, carefully scrutinized each requested item, to the point of approving individual fire hydrants. The rationale for this process grew from home-grown Congressional concern over the amount of government money going to each politician's district or state, but this exacting policy applied abroad as well. 
57
Within a purely economic context, there were strong incentives for the United
States to build and occupy overseas bomber bases during the 1950s. SAC was merely a single command, within one of three military services, but it was very expensive. In external support received by the command from other military sources, came to $6.21 billion, just over sixteen percent of the American military budget. For 1957, the SAC figure climbed to $7.06 billion, almost eighteen percent of the DoD budget for that fiscal year.
To put these SAC figure in comparable terms for another time and another great power, I shall use the Royal Navy of 1900. There are several similarities between these two forces: each dominated its military category, each was used as a deterrent force, and each had a presence overseas. At this time, Britain possessed thirteen major naval bases abroad, plus fifteen minor facilities used as coaling stations. All of these sites were designed to enable the Royal Navy to extend its presence around the globe, so it could fulfill its role in British national security. In 1900, the Royal Navy had gross expenditures of 33.2 billion pounds, which represented twenty-six percent of British military expenditures. 
64
However, the overseas forces and bases of these two powers occupied entirely different places within the context of military structures of the periods. The primary combat vehicle for the Royal Navy was the battleship; for SAC, the strategic bomber.
The British overseas naval bases were not built solely around the battleship; most SAC overseas bases were built entirely around the bomber. In 1901, the British had fifty

I shall now calculate the initial cost of constructing overseas bomber bases. This requires a series of assumptions, as well as the use of figures described earlier in this chapter. I selected twenty-five bases around the Northern Hemisphere, and although other facilities were used by SAC aircraft, the additional sites had military functions beyond those of SAC bombers, and are not included. These twenty-five bases were originally constructed with the sole intent of stationing SAC rotational bombers. About a third of these sites were new and thus credited with full initial systems cost, the remainder were sites gained from another country or command, which I estimated cost one-third as much as new sites. Permission costs were not included in this figure, for these funds had many other purposes beyond merely obtaining bomber bases, were not needed to gain access to many of these locations, and were not entirely taken from military budgets of the period. By this method the initial cost of the overseas bomber bases comes to three billion dollars.
The annual systems cost can also be estimated, by tabulating the costs of these twenty-five bases against their location. The total annual costs, if all of the sites were in full use, comes to approximately $700 million. For comparison, this figure is less than 65 Accounts and Papers, Parliamentary Records, 1901, cited in Friedberg, Weary Titan, p. 153. 66 See Table

By my calculations, the total cost of building and operating this collection of overseas bomber bases was a combination of three billion dollar for initial costs and five billion dollars for the annual operating costs throughout the decade: thus, eight billion dollars.
The United States built bombers anyway, even before the bases, and the resulting base costs were expected. The SAC overseas base structure was not firmly in place until the summer of 1951, yet in the five fiscal budgets approved prior to this point Congress had authorized the procurement of 1,645 medium and heavy bombers. Of these aircraft, only three could operate against a distant enemy without overseas bases.
The twenty-ninth, and last, SAC wing converted to the B-47 in February 1957, and all of these bombers were dependent on overseas sites. Each of these wings had an initial 68 See Tables

The breakdown of bomber procurement by aircraft type is: bomber type FY1948 FY1949 FY1950 FY1951 FY1952 systems cost of $238 million, so the total start up costs of this force was $6.9 billion.
The annual operating cost of this force, at its height, was $1.9 billion-almost three times the annual cost to operate the entire collection of overseas bomber bases. In 1956 alone, the Air Force spent $5.5 billion on the purchase of new aircraft and their necessary spare components, almost twice what it cost to build the entire collection of SAC overseas bomber bases. 
70
During the 1950s the combined total of the United States military budgets was over $426 billion.

Our base system and military deployments must be carefully planned to avoid pressing the Sino-Soviet bloc to the point that may incline them to miscalculate our objectives and conclude that our intentions have become aggressive, thereby making them feel obliged to react violently.
The Nash Report, 1957   The use of overseas strategic air bases during the wars and crises of the 1950s has been approached from many angles. Memoirs of American leaders discuss the intentions and considerations involved with sending aircraft abroad. Cold War histories examine the interactive processes among political and military leaders, allies and adversaries, to explain and to judge the overall national security decisions.
Numerous books on deterrence cite these incidents as case studies to test the validity of the deterrent concept, and discuss the transmission and reception of underlying threats.
Strategic studies describe the potential capabilities within these events and assess the proximity of nuclear warfare.

The long view of the various wars and crises of the 1950s reveals the changing nature of overseas bomber bases. To do this requires a broad level of analysis, beyond the Air Force command structure, to the larger realm of American national strategy.
Certain specific incidents will be examined, but only as turning points for larger issues.
The goal here is to appraise general themes and variations with these sites, a collective analysis over the course of the decade.
Not all of the incidents of the 1950s warranted a strategic response, American leaders had to be selective when projecting the SAC bomber force abroad. The essence of the bomber base strategy was asymmetry and, according to Gaddis, "asymmetry recognizes the reality of limited resources, and stresses the need to pick and choose the manner of one's response...emphasizing the need to act in circumstances, at times, and in ways calculated to apply one's one strengths against adversary weaknesses." The following table lists SAC base use, stateside and overseas, during several international incidents. This list is not all-inclusive, but will enable some collective observations. This information comes primarily from a report prepared by the Office of the Historian, Headquarters SAC, titled The Development of Strategic Air Command, 1946-1986: The Fortieth Anniversary History. The listed responses are tied directly to the incidents. It should be noted though that this table only shows changes which occurred. Overseas, SAC bases and bombers were constants. Responses to these events should not obscure the fact that SAC bombers remained on SAC bases overseas throughout the entire period.
Gaddis, Strategies, p. 353. The information is this table is best presented as three phases, which are chronological and correspond to the time periods previously discussed.
The first period, the Korean War years (June 1950 to September 1953), was an era of preeminence for SAC bombers and SAC bases. Despite the frustrations air leaders felt with the limited war in Korea, SAC bombers remained the only means of threatening the homeland of the Soviet Union and its alleged junior partner, Red China.
At this time the command had only a limited number of overseas bases, but the deployment of SAC bombers to these sites served exclusively as America's strategic~in the narrow sense of offensive air power, the capability to attack the enemy homeland-response to major international incidents. A phrase used by one author of a SAC history well describes this period, "Whatever the Russians were able to conjure up was going to be countered, time after time, by the appearance of a portion of SAC's deterrent force."
When the Korean War began, SAC bombers went east to Guam and Okinawa, and west to the United Kingdom. The first deployment went to fight the Korean War, the second, to prevent World War III. To strengthen SAC's presence abroad, and thus its deterrent capability towards the Soviet Union, additional bomber bases were constructed in French Morocco, Alaska, Greenland, Iceland, and Libya, all of which would see major deployments by the command during these early years of the decade.

Bomber bases in the Far East played a direct role in the Korean War truce.
When Eisenhower became exacerbated with the peace talks, he authorized John Foster
Dulles to tell Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, "If the armistice negotiations collapsed, the United States would probably make a stronger rather than a lesser military exertion and this might well extend the area of conflict." 13 Diplomatic leaks told the Chinese and the Soviets that nuclear weapons had been deployed for SAC bombers on Guam. 
14
This was a threat towards a second nation to compel a first to do something, and in the process, these SAC bases became part of a complex American strategy, one which shifted away from its original constructs. As Gaddis points out, this threat was even more difficult, and could have been unenforceable, for South Korea was just as likely to break the armistice.

18
The New Look period (from October 1953 to October 1957) contained two major international incidents, and each was a significant transition point with the use of overseas bomber bases. The first Quemoy and Matsu crisis would, according to Eisenhower, "extend through nine months, threaten a split between the United States and nearly all its allies, and seemingly carry the country to the edge of war." The 1954 incident has received great attention among works already cited and they are quite critical of the American leaders for elevated a minor event in an area of little consequence into a major international crisis. They do acknowledge that the crisis was resolved in favor of the United States, but question the appropriateness of threatening to ignite a possible world war over the fate of some disputed rocky outcrops. In regards to SAC bases, strategic forces were, again, directed towards China, without a noticeable change in posture towards the Soviet Union. In the Far East SAC forces were only a small part of the American deployment though, for the most prominent American presence was the Seventh Fleet in the Formosa Straits. The prospective targets of coastal China were all easily accessible by means other than SAC bombers-long-range artillery from the islands, naval artillery, and naval air strikes. Although deeper inland

On 12 September 1954 Eisenhower rejected the JCS suggestion that American forces should help the Chinese nationalists bomb the mainland and hold the islands.
Eisenhower realized the gravity of the situation, stating "we are not talking now about a limited, brush-fire war. We're talking about going to the threshold of World War III."
During this crisis Eisenhower used many of the means at his disposal, and SAC forces in the Far East were merely part of the package. On 15 October 1954 a SAC B-36 wing left for a ninety day deployment on Guam. This was the first time an entire B-36 wing deployed outside the continental United States.
Eisenhower sought to avoid another limited war and he recognized the primary focus of American strategy, telling the Joint Chiefs: "If we attack China we are not going to impose limits on our military actions, as in Korea. Moreover, if we get into a general war, the logical enemy will be Russia, not China, and we'll have to strike there."
27
I do not believe that Russia wants war at his time-in fact, I do not believe that even if we became engaged in a serious fight along the coast of China, Russia would want to intervene with her own forces.... But I am convinced that Russia does not want, at this moment, to experiment with means of defense against the no bombing that we could conduct against her mainland.
Throughout this crisis the bulk of SAC's overseas forces were on bases around Europe, to maintain a credible threat towards the Soviet Union.
The Suez War of 1956 was the pivot point in regards to SAC base use, a transition from an active response overseas to a show of force from bases within the continental United States. According to the aforementioned SAC report: "In reacting to the Suez Crisis from mid-November to mid-December, SAC took several actions to place its force in readiness and to demonstrate to the world the high degree of readiness maintained by its bomber force." But this response caused no changes among SAC's overseas bomber bases. The United States did not send any more bombers abroad during the conflict. The three rotational wings abroad stayed in place: a B-47 wing in England, another in Morocco, and a B-36 wing on Guam. Overseas bases were used, but not for bombers: SAC tankers massed in the northern United States and deployed to Greenland, Newfoundland, and Labrador. To show the high state of readiness, SAC conducted its largest and most complex exercise to date, but this did not involve overseas bomber bases. For two weeks, one thousand SAC aircraft flew simulated combat missions throughout North America and the Arctic. 
29
The last period, Sputnik (from late 1957 to late 1960), was a continuation of the movement to polar operations. The period began two weeks before the launch of the Soviet satellite, when SAC instituted ground alert procedures at Sidi Slimane, Morocco, and selected stateside bases. This practice was known as REFLEX ACTION (often shortened merely to REFLEX) and it would be the norm for SAC overseas bomber operations for the remainder of the decade. 
30
12
31
At the start of the crisis SAC had bombers on routine alert on Guam, this force was increased and additional stateside bomb wings prepared to deploy. But SAC was only a minor player, and the command's status quickly returned to normal.
Several observations can be made concerning the use of overseas bomber bases The second observation concerns the growing capability of the American military. The use of bombers during these international incidents declined throughout the decade, as other weapons, other forces, other means, could be used to resolve a crisis. SAC forces were a strategic backstop, but excepting the end of the Korean War, never the primary means of influencing any of these events. American and allied forces continued to grow and the military buildup initiated with the outbreak of the Korean War would be felt for the remainder of the decade. SAC held operational control over all strategic nuclear weapons until the end of the decade, but other forces and other countries acquired smaller nuclear weapons. Tactical nuclear weapons, or the threat thereof, began to offset any inferiority of ground forces. For actual crises which did occur, the strategic umbrella offered by SAC bombers through the use of SAC bases carried less importance as the decade progressed.
The next observation is the most basic, fundamental, and far-reaching: World War III did not occur. This is the most obvious point of the wars and crises of the SAC bomber bases thus become embedded within much larger themes. Critics of American national security strategy of this decade claim that reliance on strategic air power (generally lumped together with nuclear weapons and Massive Retaliation) encouraged other, lesser forms of conflicts. This remains difficult to measure. But whether or not the capability of SAC bombers, the presence of SAC bases, or the reliance upon nuclear weapons encouraged small-scale combat misses a larger point:
these smaller conflicts, whatever their cause, never grew. And in large measure this was due to the projection of American strategic air power allowed by overseas bomber bases.

Chapter 7
Within the limits of the money given to us we should endeavor to free the Air Force as much as possible from the requirements for overseas bases in the hands of other powers. General Hoyt S. Vandenberg, 1951
Previous base historiography is weak on aircraft technical issues, yet these factors are pivotal to a thorough understanding of the development of overseas bomber bases. Bomber bases did not merely arise and disappear, there was a continuum of thought, choices, and policies which brought them into existence and then decline.
Throughout, aircraft technical issues were central. The American bomber force was constantly changing and maturing, and an analysis of the period before, and after, the development of overseas bases is required.
Before the Korean War, even before Pearl Harbor, the United States had sought to acquire an aircraft capable of launching from North America, attacking targets in Eurasia, and then returning to North America. The B-52 force which finally emerged was the product of a long, difficult, expensive, technological journey, one which lasted almost two decades. 2 To grasp the interim position occupied by overseas bomber bases, it is necessary to return to an earlier period, and examine the technical issues involved in the many attempts at extending bomber radius of action.
In Extending bomber range proved immensely frustrating in the decade after World War II. For bomber designs, turboprop engines had reached the point of diminishing returns: increasing the radius meant increasing the size-so more fuel could be carriedcausing a circular problem, more fuel meant greater weight and a thus a higher fuel consumption.

weighed six times the B-17 and could only operate from specially stressed runways).
strategic attack outweigh the loss of an aircraft and possibly its crew? Lieutenant
General Earle E. Partridge, head of the Research and Development Command, summed up the situation at an Aircraft and Weapons Board meeting in 1947: "Expend the crew, expend the bomb, expend the airplane all at once. Kiss them goodbye and let them go.
That is a pretty cold-blooded point of view," then considering that no other options existed, he added, "but I believe that it is economically best for the country." This was before NATO, before the accumulation of forward bases for SAC. American bombers had no firm overseas locations available. But the tactic was never tested, for by the early 1950s, with the development of alliances and bases around the world, one way missions were no longer a consideration.
A derivative of this one way mission was to just send the bomber, without the crew. Similar attempts had been unsuccessful before, but a new push for the concept emerged in 1950, when Air Force engineers worried that a bomber might not be able to 13 escape from the blast of the ever-increasing power of nuclear weapons.  In an exhaustive study of American strategic bomber acquisition, political scientist Michael Brown finds that, repeatedly, "The Air Force placed a higher premium on systems performance that it did on availability or cost...Given a choice on the mix of program outcomes, the Air Force was not willing to trade away performance for time or money." 
18
More than a decade after World War II, the Air Force still did not have an adequate intercontinental bomber force. In 1954, as the SAC overseas base network rapidly developed, RAND Report R-266 stated:
It is a most significant fact that, for the present and for some time to come, the Air Force has selected an overseas base system and has developed a force of bomber systems for operation at considerably less than intercontinental range. So far as an unrefueled, single-stage, two-way operation is concerned, we do not now have any bomber system capable of starting from the United States and hitting a significant number of Russian targets, and returning home.
In the summer of 1955, during an ongoing correspondence with the Second Air Force Commander, LeMay wrote, "We must develop a true intercontinental bombing capability as quickly as possible." And, assessing the B-52 force, concluded "it will be several years before we can possibly realize even the minimum level in the SAC inventory that I consider necessary."
21
have not yet developed a truly intercontinental bomber."
22
Still, the United States possessed a huge strategic bomber force in the 1950s.
The following table lists combat ready SAC bombers, those fully equipped with the systems, weapons, instruments, and crews necessary for inclusion in strategic warplans. The massive expansion of the SAC bomber force is evident, a five-fold increase in ten years. A comparison will put this force in perspective. In 1959 the total number of aircraft owned by all thirty-nine airlines in the United States was 1,596. SAC bombers alone could match the entire American commercial aviation industry, almost plane for plane.

The B-47 was the primary vehicle for strategic warfare in the mid to late 1950s.
Altogether, counting all versions of the plane, the Air Force accepted over two thousand B-47s, which, if laid wingtip-to-wingtip, would  At the present time [1957] most of the strength of our Strategic Air Command lies in the medium range B-47 bomber, the effectiveness of which is reduced substantially unless the planned overseas base structure becomes a reality. In fact, the entire B-47 program was activated, and the bombers were produced in heavy quantities, with the premise of the availability of these foreign bases.
The B-47 was not alone with this range deficiency, the same problem plagued the entire collection of post-war bombers until the end of the 1950s: The aircraft selected is the most purchased model in the SAC inventory during the decade. Sources: models from HQ USAF, SDFY 1960, combat radii from Knaack, Bombers, pp. 54-55,  156, 200-201, 292-293, 494. See also, Wohlstetter, et al, RAND R-266, p. 63.   At the beginning of the base build up, the B-36 had the greatest radius of action of any American bomber, so the question arises: why didn't the Air Force simply increase its to complicate the enemy air defense problems and allow greater offensive planning 
30
Regardless of its composition, the combat radius of the SAC bomber force could be greatly increased with air refueling. The first inflight air refueling occurred as early as 1923, but little serious notice was made until 1948 when the Air Force activated its first air refueling squadrons. 
34
35
36
36
The KC-135 was the first dedicated tanker, specifically designed and built as an air refueling platform. It was a jet and much more modern than its predecessor, capable of passing 120,000 pounds of jet fuel on a single mission-the equivalent of three KC-97s. Unlike the KC-97, the KC-135 did not require forward positioning across the 39 ocean, and tanker units began to group in the northern United States and Canada.
These tanker base assignments reveal the changing role of overseas bomber bases. In the early 1950s, tankers were a separate squadron assigned to a bomb wing, and both aircraft types shared a base. In 1955, with a heavy schedule of bomber rotations overseas (the previous year SAC conducted 3,400 ocean crossings), the command restructured the tanker force, and two units received designation as an air refueling wing (ARW), totally independent of any bomber units: the 4060th ARW went to Dow AFB in Chapter 8
Alternatives and Withdrawal, 1957-1960   This [overseas bomber base] system has proven an effective deterrent to general war, and viewed in true perspective, that has been the primary tasks assigned to these instruments of US policy. Now, however, we have crossed over another threshold into a new strategic situation, pushed relentlessly by technological and political changes... Townsend Hoopes, 1958   Near Previous base histories give little attention to operational factors, but it is only through these factors that the declining period of overseas bomber bases is most clearly revealed.
The previous historiography is weak on the strategy and technical aspects which directly affected the overseas bomber bases. Bomber bases did not merely arise and disappear, there was a continuum of thought, choices, and policies which brought them into existence and then decline. And throughout, technical issues are central.
Military history often falls prey to a kind of technological determinism, where attention rests with the impact of a new weapon, not the causes for seeking it.
Competing alternatives, the origins of these systems, and the momentum of the 0 ... developmental processes, can easily be obscured. Technological determinism is a common feature within military history, as rudimentary before-and-after models of such diverse items as the stirrup, the suit of armor, the longbow, even the nuclear weapon, reveal a tendency to examine not the cause of the innovation, but to fixate solely upon its effect. Technological determinism seemingly fits the spirit of the era for, in the words of one historian, it was "an article of faith in the United States from 1940 to I960." 3 But weapons do not have their own inertia, they are merely products of a complex interaction among societal forces. This base changeover was not a seamless transition, but rather a continual pursuit of competing systems, all with the same goal: to obviate the need for overseas bomber bases. The desired outcome was reached, but not with the expected weapons. The solution was foregone, but not the means of achieving it. I will not go so far as to dismiss the concept of technological determinism, but rather question its application to this issue.
Prior works did not search for explanations among technical elements of operational factors, yet the empirical data are available, largely through Air Force primary sources untouched by other scholars. Another possibly its that this specific facet was deemed unimportant to the base topic, perhaps for their wider assessments it was, but for an analysis of SAC bomber bases, technical issues are crucial. Previous histories of American overseas bases miss an opportunity, failing to fully explain how and why a transition occurred, moving away from the use and possession of overseas bomber bases. Lacking is an analysis of the progressive development of emerging American strategic platforms, of which the ICBM was only one. The ballistic missile was not the planned replacement for overseas bomber bases. A paradigm shift would occur among American leaders in the mid-1950s, one which embraced missile technology, but until then, American attempts at intercontinental capability centered on extending the reach of strategic bombers.
From late 1957 to early 1961, American leaders responded purposefully to a changing situation as United States strategic forces became increasingly vulnerable.
America's declared national security policy did not change, but among overseas SAC bases, significant alterations took place. In the late 1950s the underlying status of the The defining event of this period was the launch of Sputnik I on 4 October 1957.
The Soviet satellite shook previous American assumptions about its technological superiority, for the Soviets had used a ballistic missile as a launch vehicle, something the United States could not do at the time. Professed "gaps" were seen between the technology, bombers, shelters, and missiles of the two superpowers, and there was tremendous political pressure on Eisenhower to increase defense spending. Adding to this was another national security jolt in November 1957, the publication of the Gaither Report, which formally declared a "missile gap" now existed and proclaimed that SAC forces were increasingly vulnerable. Many scholars praise Eisenhower for resisting this call to arms, and find his position bolstered by the wealth of highly-classified intelligence gleaned from the U-2 and satellites, which revealed the limited status of o Soviet strategic forces. But in response to these events Eisenhower directed several significant modifications to America's strategic policy and arsenal.

Ambrose writes, "Eisenhower refused to bend to the pressure, refused to initiate a fallout shelter program, refused to expand conventional and nuclear forces, refused to panic. It was one of his finest hours." And, holds, that only Eisenhower, due to his esteemed military background, could have done this in the face of such fierce criticism.

Eisenhower's most concrete legacy from the missile gap period is the transformation of US strategic nuclear forces. A strategic nuclear triad began to emerge when the Eisenhower Administration developed and began to deploy ICBMs and SLBMs. Adding these two missile "legs" to SAC bombers would strengthen deterrence, the administration reasoned, by complicating Soviet plans for launching a first, strike...the triad-and the intellectual justification for itremained a central element in US strategic nuclear program for decades. But Sputnik was the clarion call which accelerated procedural changes and shortened deployment timelines. This event, more than any other, heightened awareness of Soviet scientific and military progress, bringing concern about the vulnerability of American strategic forces, which in 1957, solely consisted of SAC bombers.
The vulnerability of SAC forces, particularly those on overseas bases, became acute as Soviet ballistic missiles were deployed which could increasingly threaten these sites.

But this defensive posture at overseas bases was merely an interim situation, the United
States was in the process of fielding a new collection of strategic forces composed of new weapons systems which did not require the use of overseas bases.
The various ballistic missile systems under development in the 1950s had tremendous range (up to nine thousand miles), but the early systems were severely limited by warhead weight: the Atlas ICBM launch weight was comparable to the combat weight of the B-52, but the Stratofortress could carry twenty-five times as many pounds of weapons. The ballistic missiles of the 1950s had a maximum warhead weight of two thousand pounds, which could, at best, be delivered within five miles of its intended target. With conventional weapons this would be an ineffective and inaccurate 17 means of delivery, hardly a challenge to the strategic position of manned bomber.

American thermonuclear tests on Eniwetok Atoll during the spring of 1954 fulfilled von Neuman's prediction. One test shot used lithium deutereum fuel, eliminating the need for the heavy cryogenic facilities, and another (appropriately name the SHRIMP shot) involved a warhead small enough to be carried by a ballistic missile.

pounds, yet still allowed tremendous explosive power. Warheads eventually mounted on ICBMs and Polaris missiles could produce a yield up to one megaton. Though far less than the twenty-four megaton bomb which could be carried by the B-36, the yield of each ballistic missile exceeded the destructive power of all the bombs dropped during the Second World War.
Intercontinental ballistic missiles challenged the entire strategic role of the manned bomber. The development of the American ICBM force has been well-told elsewhere, and need not be recounted here.

There was resistance to missiles within the Air Force, for the service's mindset rested with the pilot-generals, who questioned the pursuit of an unmanned, unproved strategic platform. To them, the bomber was the primary vehicle of strategic warfare, and would remain so for the foreseeable future. 
26
The air power battle cannot be won with 1,500 pound warheads and a five-mile CEP [Circular Error of Probability]. The ICBM may prove to be the "ultimate weapon," but until the zenith of its development is reached, which will be much later than 1960, it can only support and cannot replace some slower weapons systems which have greater destructive power, more reliability, and better CEPs. 
27
Overseas bases would soon become a remnant of an early age, and SAC did not resist the decline of these sites, for the command retained its primacy in strategic matters. Although not intercontinental, when combined with the mobility of a nuclear submarine, this was a very significant increase, for every portion of the Earth is within 1,700 miles of the sea.
While the Polaris progressed through the developmental process, the Navy 32 Many problems were solved to produce this missile. Small inertial navigation devices were adapted from the Navaho cruise missiles program, so each Polaris could carry its own internal navigation device.
The Regulus cruise missile had to be surface-launched, but subsurface launch was sought for the Polaris. Naval engineers adapted ideas from a torpedo, so the Polaris would climb to the sea surface with compressed gas, then ignite its rocket engine above the water. The Kennedy Administration fully funded the entire proposed fleet of ballistic missile submarines, as well as variants of the Polaris missile with ranges up to 2,500 miles, and by 1966 there would be forty-one fleet ballistic missile submarines in the American inventory. Upon leaving North America the SSBNs could reach launch positions in five to six days. Once there, they patrolled international waters, seemingly free from the potential problems of overseas bases. But a bit of irony occurred: with the use of forward bases, launch points could be reached in merely one to two days. With overseas bases the submarines could also be serviced abroad, reducing transit time.
Three overseas submarine bases were built to accommodate this fleet ballistic missile force, and all went to countries or territories which once held medium bombers: Guam,
Spain (Rota), and the United Kingdom (Holy Loch, Scotland).
This submarine force used overseas bases, but not in the same sense as did bombers; submarines merely staged through them, they did not operate upon the facilities. Overseas submarine bases were a convenience, not a necessity. If needed, the ballistic missile submarines could operate without forward sites, an option unavailable to SAC bombers prior to the B-52. More fundamentally, the SSBN force offered something of far greater importance, an item that bombers and bomber bases, regardless of their location, could not--survivability. As the Soviet Union began to deploy strategic forces, the emphasis of deterrence shifted, from capability to security. As the United States would not launch a first strike, the key element necessary for stabilizing deterrence was to ensure that its strategic force remained viable following an enemy preemptive attack. Bomber bases can be found on any aerial map and bomber deployments cannot an item of great secrecy; information on the facilities, forces, and personnel are far too difficult to keep from a perspective enemy. And the farther forward these items, the more difficult to conceal. A bomber is a mobile platform, but it is tethered by its radii of action to its sources of support. A bomber is a moving target only during the hours of its mission; a submarine is a mobile launch platform, hidden for months at a time. These submarines were silent (only receiving transmission, not sending them), submerged, undetected. A strong argument can be made that a survivable submarine force might be the ultimate deterrent, but this cuts to the heart of deterrence and goes far beyond matters involving merely the bases. So, I will acknowledge the value of the fleet ballistic missile force, but then leave it, at its inception. The important factor to my topic is the timing, late 1960, the end of my period. My concern is with the overall impact that all of these new strategic weapons systems had on the use and function of SAC bomber bases abroad.
Until  The first four columns show continual growth throughout this period, trends which would continue into the next decade. Medium bombers and overseas bases peaked about the time of Sputnik, and then began to decline, a trend which would continue and accelerate in the next few years. There is, expectedly, a direct correlation between medium bomb wings and overseas bases. But, even more significantly, there is an inverse relationship between these two elements and those in the first four columns.
Heavy bombers, ICBMs, and aerial tankers could have their bases in the continental United States; by design, each of these systems could obviate the need for overseas medium bomber bases.
The overseas bases column show two large jumps, 1951 and 1957. The first was due to the Korean War, and the sites were primarily operational bases for rotational units, and most of these bases were in the United Kingdom. The increase in 1957 appears contrary to the professed decline of these sites, but further examination reveals it to be largely from reorganization. After the outbreak of the Korean War, the Joint It is certain, however, that adjustments and shifts in emphasis will occur as we adjust our strategic doctrine to the range of new weapons, improvements in the mobility and firepower of our tactical forces, and the political or military vulnerability of particular overseas areas.
This statement became the foundation for the new study of overseas bases, with a charter to examine the changes then occurring and expected to occur over the next decade.
The Lang Report placed a heavy emphasis on overseas strategic air bases, but recognized their altering role as they moved from occupied bomber bases to support operations (such as tanker bases, emergency recovery fields, and post-strike staging sites). strategic force, increasing options within a single part of the expanding arsenal of American weapons. Strategic tools had been recast, the medium bomber overshadowed by newer delivery systems. Overseas bomber bases had little place in this emerging force structure; and this had been the goal all along. The long sought ideal of freeing American strategic forces from other powers had finally materialized.
Chapter 9
The whole story of U.S.-Western European relations in the 1950s is thus full of cross-currents that scholars have barely begun to examine. The story, in fact, is not easy to sort out. But in these days when people should be thinking of how to create a stable political system in Europe in the aftermath of the Cold War, it is important to look back and try to understand how the Cold War itself took shape.
The way people interpret the past certainly affects the way they think about the future. There are always lessons to be learned. But even more important than that, there are always false lessons to be unlearned. Marc Trachtenberg, 1992
Throughout this dissertation I have presented five major findings which add to our general understanding of American overseas bomber bases in this period of the Cold War. Overseas bases allowed SAC bombers to serve as a counterbalance to the tremendous superiority which Soviet ground forces held in Europe, and this too, was only a transitory requirement. 
4
American leaders considered military parity a stabilizing influence on the Cold War, but it had the added benefit of reducing the need for positioning American strategic forces abroad.
The particular agreements signed between the United States and several host countries also illustrates the interim position of overseas bomber bases. Some SAC base rights in key locations existed with only yearly renewable terms, a curious arrangement if American leaders were planning long-term use of the sites. I hold that American diplomats and military officers accepted these restrictive terms because overseas bomber bases were only a temporary solution.
By tracing the concepts and goals which underlie the SAC bomber bases overseas during the 1950s, it is apparent that American leaders desired the sites only while their strategic arsenal possessed limited range capability. At their height, SAC bomber bases comprised only three percent of the American overseas bases of the 1950s, but they should not be assessed merely a small subset of the United States base network. SAC bases resulted from entirely separate influences, and when viewed from this perspective, it is clear that having bases abroad was only a stop-gap measure.
My second new finding concerns the role of nuclear weapons. I claim that nuclear weapons had little to do with the development of overseas bomber bases. This is sure to be contentious, for it contradicts previous base histories and faults a large body of literature collectively known as strategic studies. Among these Harkavy expresses a common view:
With respect to overseas military access, the close of World War II had also brought changes in military technology, evolving modes of strategy and the very basis for basing and access diplomacy. Most notably, the advent of nuclear weapons (superimposed upon the lessons assumed derived from the experience of strategic bombing during World War II) produced new needs for overseas bases, for deterrent purposes, and with a requirement for more or less immediate response.
I take issue with this statement on several counts. Harkavy fails to note that the lessons of World War II were produced primarily with conventional munitions, the Soviet Union did not possess the means to deliver a nuclear warhead until the middle of the 1950s, and that deterrence existed long before the advent of nuclear weapons. Deterrence is an ancient concept, nuclear weapons heightened the risk should it fail, but did not alter its principles.
Previous literature which mentions overseas bomber bases fails to separate three distinct elements: the bombers, the bases, and nuclear weapons. The three fundamental elements of American strategy must be partitioned, to assess the historical precedent of each and to more accurately weigh its contribution. The novelty of nuclear weapons has allowed other historians and political scientists to lump the three together, blinding them to the individual characteristics. I have analyzed each part separately, to glean distinct characteristics and reassess interpretations of overseas bomber bases. Through this I discovered that there was sufficient cause for overseas bomber bases in the 1950s even without nuclear weapons.
The primary considerations of SAC bases derived from the inherent capabilities of bombers, not nuclear weapons. The historical roots for overseas bomber bases came from the tenets of air power theory which developed after World War I and from the combat experiences of World War II. Through these ideas and events a concept of strategic air power emerged which successfully promoted the bomber as the primary means of access to the heart of an enemy nation. For the United States, from the advent of the B-17 in 
7
1935 to the deployment of non-aircraft strategic weapons in 1960, the strategic bomber possessed two qualities distinct among American weapons systems: it had the longest radius of action and could attack an enemy faster than any other military force. During the early Cold War period, only Air Force bombers could reach the interior of the Soviet Union. Had the B-47 carried twelve tons of mere rocks, until the late 1950s it remained the only weapons system capable of delivering a load two thousand miles and then dropping it within half a mile of an intended target. Access was the key, not destructive power, and targets, not weapons, defined the strategic mission.
I am not seeking to denigrate the deterrent and psychological capacities which nuclear weapons brought to the bases, nor to ignore the contribution that these weapons made to the era. But I do reject the intimate linkage that has been made between bombers, bases, and nuclear weapons. 
8

We often assume today [1966] that atomic weapons have changed air strategy enough to preclude any interesting or valuable analogies with the past. An attempt will be made here to prove just the opposite, to demonstrate that we are not alone in the "balance of terror" problem that we face, or so original in our solutions to it.
My research has shown that strategic air power, and its attendant overseas bases, possessed characteristics entirely independent of nuclear weapons. To any detractors, I pose the following counterfactual questions: without nuclear weapons, would the American bomber base structure have been any different? What could possibly have substituted for SAC bombers on overseas bases? Bombers abroad, regardless of their destructive capacity, offered direct access to an enemy nation and presented an asymmetrical threat toward enemy leaders. Nuclear weapons did not change any of this, but merely extended an existing capacity. Nuclear weapons certainly heightened the destructive capability of strategic aircraft, but I maintain that had fission and fusion not existed, American bomber bases would have been built at the same time, in the same places, for the same purpose.
The third new finding is that the demise of the SAC bomber bases was a long and multi-causal process. On this matter I also contradict previous scholarship, for I have shown that reliance on these sites waned at the end of the 1950s due to a combination of of American ballistic missiles became a true alternative to the strategic bomber. The story of the ballistic missile's effect on overseas bomber bases is thus more complex, drawn out, and purposeful than previously described.
The bomber-missile changeover is only part of the story though. Bombers and missiles have been discussed here and elsewhere, but other military systems also had a tremendous impact on the use of overseas bases, and these systems have been ignored or minimized in previous base histories. Air refueling tankers, as discussed in Chapter 7, greatly enhanced the range capabilities of the SAC bomber force and were rapidly built up by SAC, with a ten-fold increase occurring between 1950 and 1955. By 1959 SAC had over two hundred KC-135s, which greatly aided the command's shift to a polar strategy. The impact of ballistic missile submarines, if mentioned at all, is typically lost within the array of American ballistic missiles which became operational in the late 1950s. But the Fleet Ballistic Missile force, which first went on combat patrol in 1960, presented a direct alternative to overseas bomber bases by offering strategic access to an enemy nation without the requisite of overseas bases.
12
Thus, the military causes for the decline of overseas bomber bases have been far too rudimentary among previous works. There were indeed significant military influences which led to the terminus of the overseas bomber bases, but underlying all of them was a desire to avoid the need for the sites in the first place. The rapid demise of the bomber bases, recounted by so many others, was not happenstance. The primary military cause was not Soviet missile developments, or for that matter, even American missile developments. The United States moved away from use of these overseas bomber bases because that had been the goal all along. It was a long-term plan to free American strategic forces from possible interference by foreign governments.
In addition, previous base histories have been one-dimensional when describing the ebb of overseas bomber bases, for there were prominent political issues which affected the timing of this occurrence. This matter will be described in detail in the following section, but here it must be stressed that other historians have largely overlooked the role which international politics played in this decline. As described in Chapter 4, the political influences for the demise of the bases came in a number of steps, from several directions. Beginning in the mid-1950s Soviet leaders boasted of alleged missile capabilities and the risks faced by nations which allowed SAC bomber bases on their soil. These threats forced the host nation government and local populace to weigh the benefits of a SAC base against the risks. This appraisal often resulted in greater government, in turn, had to reassess the contribution that each base made to American strategy, and measure whether some of these sites were worth the increasing demands.
The political ramifications of this period are often lost due to the rapid deployment of new strategic weapons, which quickly circumvented the growing friction between the United States and many hosts.
The fourth new finding concerns the economic costs of overseas bomber bases.
On this matter I have greatly improved upon earlier works by presenting the overall costs in a more detailed manner. 
14
14
15
heavily on several RAND reports of the period. I began with the basic facility costs, as others have done, but then furthered the analysis by listing the construction costs and additional operating costs incurred for bomber bases in particular geographic locations. I have used the term 'systems cost' to define the aggregate expenses associated with building, supporting, maintaining, and using a SAC bomber base abroad. By my estimation, which I lay out in Chapter 5, it cost three billion dollars to build the collection of primary SAC bomber bases abroad. The total operating costs of these sites over the course of the decade was approximately five billion dollars. Thus, the overall total for building and operating the array of primary SAC bomber bases abroad was eight billion dollars, much higher than the mere facility costs offered by others.
But even with the high tabulation of systems costs, there was an economic rationale for seeking these bases abroad. Within the constraints imposed by American strategy and SAC force structure, paying for overseas bomber bases made sense.
Comparatively, overseas bomber bases were the least expensive means of projecting strategic air power until the late 1950s. Air refueling was extremely costly, for the tanker requirement increased exponentially as bomber range extended. Among the primary bomber-tanker pair of the decade, it would take five KC-97s to double the combat radius of a B-47. Buying enough tankers to allow the B-47 to operate from bases in North America tripled the total aircraft systems costs. Extending the combat radius of a single B-47 wing to intercontinental distance (a prospect complicated by the bomber's limited crew size), was equal to the systems costs of five medium bomber bases built in French
Morocco. Long range bombers were also expensive, the systems cost of a single B-52
wing was just shy of half a billion dollars-equal to the combined systems costs of a B-47 wing, a KC-97 wing, and a new rotational bomber base in Southern Alaska. It is a fair comparison to weigh the costs associated with fielding an American Army division against a medium bomber base, for SAC rotational bases were built so strategic bombers could offset the huge manpower advantage of the Soviet Army. Strictly in terms of annual costs, four SAC medium bomber bases could be operated around the edge of Western Europe for less than it cost to keep one Army division on the continent.
The expenses associated with building bomber bases abroad amounted to a tremendous return on previous investments. Overseas bases allowed the projection of an existing and very expensive bomber force. In the five fiscal years before the Korean War, the United States military placed production orders for 1,645 medium and heavy bombers, and without the use of overseas bases these aircraft could not serve their intended role. Overseas bases were the last link in a string of costs for American strategic air power during the 1950s. The total costs of overseas operations could legitimately be added to the costs of the American strategic aviation force, which until 1960 consisted wholly of SAC. For less than two percent of the decade's military budget the United States built and used an entire collection of overseas bomber bases for SAC, a command which consumed about one-fifth of the American military budget.
The fifth new finding, the matter of SAC control, is perhaps the most significant contribution that this work makes to the study of overseas bases. Most historians fail to even note this point, and those that do never analyze the issue, trace its development, nor scrutinize its ramifications. I speculate that the base histories discussed throughout this work have never given SAC control proper attention because of their wider perspective, the differences involved with SAC control were not noticed or addressed because they comprised only a small portion of America's overseas base network. SAC histories, on the other hand, have just the opposite focus, one too narrow to note the contrasts between SAC bases and other American facilities abroad. 
16
SAC overseas bomber bases were unique facilities, and here, my work has been original research. I have examined the issue of SAC control in three key areas: why it was desired, how it occurred, and, most importantly, what this control meant. The philosophical underpinnings for seeking SAC control developed from the principles of air power theory, which held that a strategic bomber force should concentrate on strategic targets within the enemy homeland. According to this theory, to best accomplish its mission a bomber force should be directed by airmen and independent from theater commanders, who may seek to use the bombers for more immediate, battlefield objectives. SAC's operational chain of command was exceptional, it did not run through any regional or allied structures. SAC forces were under the command of SAC Headquarters, then the JCS, then the President. In the spring of 1951, SAC gained control of its own collection of overseas bomber bases, and this marks a significant turning point in the history of American military facilities abroad. 
16
The Strategic Air Command, (New York: Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1958) each offers a survey of SAC operations to include the use of overseas bases, but the significance of SAC control is never discussed.
The next section will discuss how and why SAC gained control of a collection of overseas bases. The salient point here is the ramifications of this issue. I argue that SAC gained control of overseas bases because this well-suited larger American goals. Air Force officers sought SAC control of overseas bases, but could not have achieved this end on their own. They were aided by high-level military and political leaders. SAC was unique by mission and command structure, and the overseas bases controlled by SAC were an extension of these factors. United States leaders sought to control their own strategic assets, and with a system of SAC bases abroad this could be achieved. SAC overseas bases were technically independent of any foreign governments, so should alliances falter or deterrence fail, American strategic forces would still be controlled by American leaders. American national security would not be jeopardized.
This following section is only a brief synopsis of the main themes presented throughout this work. As such the argument will only be offered in skeletal form. I direct the reader to return to particular chapters for a more thorough explanation of the ideas, concepts, and findings mentioned here.
A thematic presentation has been used in the previous section and the bulk of this dissertation. However, a chronological structure will be used here to present a general summation of this work, for the many facets of SAC overseas bases can be recounted and the changing role of these sites can be more clearly discerned. For ease of presentation I shall return to the time periods used earlier in this work: the Korean War (June 1950 to September 1953), the New Look (October 1953 to October 1957), and Sputnik (late 1957 through the end of the decade).
Again and again, it has been shown that the impetus for the funding, development, and use of these bases was the Korean War. The communist invasion of South Korea seemingly validated the assumptions put forth by NSC-68. To American leaders the conflict was seen as a direct move against Western interests, one led by the Soviet Union, sponsored by Red China, and carried out by North Korea. The complicity of these communist nations is still debated, but the American response was clear: contain the conflict on the Korean peninsula and prepare for the possibility of a major war in Europe against the Soviet Union. For the first time, the Truman Administration accepted a budget deficit and, in the course of only six months, enlarged the American military budget fourfold. United States leaders directed a massive expansion of military forces and, as part of this build up, the Air Force was to double its number of combat wings within two years, with the largest increase among medium bomb wings.
The greatest concentration of American allies and interests abroad was Western Europe. Allied military forces were weak throughout the region, yet closely positioned to a massive Soviet army. The 175 divisions of the Red Army could not be matched by any conceivable allied army, but strategic air power could readily offset the inferiority of land forces, serving an asymmetrical threat towards the Soviet nation. Soviet armies threatened Western Europe, so American bombers threatened the Soviet Union. In the early to mid 1950s, only strategic bombers had the necessary speed, survivability, and range to pose a viable threat towards the Soviet interior. The sole strategic bombers among western nations were those within the Strategic Air Command, and the SAC force structure was heavily composed of medium bombers, aircraft with a combat radius of action of approximately two thousand miles. In order for SAC to pose a viable threat towards the Soviet heartland, medium bomber bases were required overseas.
There were several military considerations for locating the majority of the bombers on the edge of Western Europe. Offensive considerations were paramount, for the American strain of air power theory held that aviation forces are inherently offensive.
The primary target sets for SAC bombers of this period centered upon the DELTA mission, strategic attacks which would disrupt the enemy war economy. The exact target locations are still classified, but several RAND studies of the early 1950s show that the geographic grouping of potential sites was heavily concentrated, with eighty-eight percent of the DELTA targets in the western portion of the Soviet Union. American bomber bases thus had compelling offensive reasons for arraying near Western Europe.
Defensive considerations pushed the bomber bases toward the rim of continent, to better shelter the sites from potential enemy action. The resulting SAC bases were constructed at the edge of American bomber radii of action, positioned as far as possible away from Soviet military threats, yet within range of assigned wartime targets. These bases placed American bombers within single flight range of wartime targets, and through this, the Soviet interior could be directly threatened. The fundamental element was access, not which weapons the aircraft would employ.
Half of SAC's overseas bases were in the United Kingdom, and there was strong justification for this. Close relations between air leaders of the two countries ensured that arrangements, a position that would be maintained for the remainder of the decade. SAC control of overseas bases was a means to an end, a method of directing the strategic mission. I have traced the development of SAC control within Air Force primary documents, then go beyond this level of analysis to claim that the arrangement could not have materialized without strong support beyond the Air Force. Even from the beginning, there were international complications with seeking SAC control of overseas bases, and I hold that these matters were endured because SAC control conformed to larger desires among American leaders, namely to maintain direct operational over America's strategic forces, wherever they may be assigned.
The first year of the Korean War witnessed a tremendous American diplomatic effort to gain overseas operating rights for SAC bombers. An American 'country team' negotiated SAC base rights with each separate host nation. The most difficult negotiations involved smaller countries far removed from the tensions of the Cold War, particularly those newly emerging from colonial status. American motives were distrusted from the start and this led to continual political tension. The easiest sites to obtain were in nations which held a multilateral defense treaty with the United States.
For SAC bases, the most significant of these was NATO. During the 1950s SAC gained operating rights in eighteen separate countries or territories, with NATO nations and their colonial territories comprising twelve. Western European nations tended to have a strong identification with the Cold War and the provisions of collective security, but even so, the unique status of SAC bases did not go unnoticed. Seeds of concern were planted at this time as the political crux of these sites appeared: the bases were to support NATO, but
were not a part of NATO. This was not a major issue for the NATO hosts at the time, for the Soviet Union possessed no comparable strategic weapons which could immediately endanger the bases or the surrounding areas. The Korean War period was a time of rapid base build up and saw continual use of existing sites. SAC bases were under construction throughout the Northern Hemisphere, with the highest concentration of sites around the edge of Western Europe.
The only way to threaten the homeland of the Soviet Union and its alleged junior partner, Red China, was with SAC bombers and continually throughout these years American leaders played a shell game with SAC aircraft on overseas bases, sending the bombers abroad to emphasize American resolve amidst international incidents.
The enunciation of the New Look policy in October 1953 was not a change in regards to strategic air power, merely a public statement of an already existing American position. There was continuity between the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations on the use and status of strategic air power. But changes were coming for overseas bomber bases. The New Look period lasted the middle four years of the decade and, in regards to SAC overseas bases, truly marked a period of transition, a fulfillment of the earlier build up and a premonition of the coming demise.
In the middle of the decade the Air Force was spending over one billion dollars a year on military construction, and about a quarter of this went to SAC overseas bases.
The build up of overseas bomber bases was complete during this period and SAC's bases (such as naval ports, army posts, or fighter bases), a SAC base did not contribute to regional defenses. A SAC bomber base protected the area only through deterrence, should war occur these sites actually brought increased risk to the region. And due to the nature of SAC's mission, the bases would become primary targets for Soviet weapons.
Thus, a host nation would become a battleground in a superpower war, even if the host did not actively participate in the conflict. The governments of Spain, Japan, and even Britain began to show concern with serving as hosts for SAC.
The Suez War of 1956 marked a significant turning point concerning the use of overseas bases. For every international incident prior to this, American leaders sent SAC bombers to overseas bases. But from here and for the remainder of the decade, the strategic response of the United States would be seen at stateside SAC bases, not those overseas. SAC did send aircraft abroad, but these were tankers to bases in the North Atlantic area. Overseas bomber bases experienced no changes during this crisis. SAC conducted its largest exercise to date in December 1956, when one thousand aircraft flew simulated combat missions throughout North America and the Arctic region. This was a watershed for overseas bases, for through this it can be seen that SAC was moving away from a perimeter strategy which relied on forward bomber bases, towards a polar strategy with bombers based in the United States.
The Sputnik launch in October 1957 accelerated trends that had begun earlier in the decade. The Soviet satellite caused American leaders to question their technical superiority over the Soviets and realize that America's only strategic forces, SAC bombers, were now vulnerable at their primary locations. The deployment timelines for alternative strategic weapons were compressed, to lessen reliance on overseas bases.
Allies were also rattled by this event, and more than anything else, Sputnik brought political tensions with SAC bomber bases to the forefront. The tone of Soviet pronouncements became harsher and more direct concerning SAC host nations, so national leaders and local inhabitants began to fully comprehend the risks associated with these sites. The potential Soviet missile threat was now apparent and host nations fully .reassessed their positions. There were protests against SAC bases in the Middle East, the Far East, and North Africa. The Japanese opposition to the sites was especially virulent, but even the solid support previously seen among some segments of British society began to erode. SAC bases were no longer a reassurance from the United States, a guarantee of the host nation's national security, but actually a liability, a focal point for hostility from the Soviet Union and potentially a location for wartime devastation. It was increasingly difficult to maintain an independent American strategic force on the soil of another sovereign nation. By late in the decade SAC bases abroad compounded problems and fears among the many nations involved, the United States, the hosts, and the Soviet Union. These sites had become contentious for all.
SAC's collection of overseas bomber bases thus became a handicap on American foreign relations. Political problems and military risks forced American leaders to question whether these sites would be available should the United States need them in a war. The climbing political costs associated with these sites caused American leaders to reconsider their true value, and accelerated the search for alternatives, options that would allow increasingly complex political and military problems to be avoided.
Late in this period the United States fielded an entire collection of new strategic weapons, and underlying each of these was an American desire to avoid the need for overseas strategic bases. American leaders sought to protect their strategic assets and retain direct control over them as well, and each of the new systems fulfilled these provisions.
SAC had one wing of B-52s in 1957, two years later this number had increased ten-fold. By 1959 the command had over three hundred B-52s, all on bases in North America. The B-52 was the first true intercontinental bomber, with a combat radius of action of 3,550 miles Without refueling this aircraft could leave the United States and reach all but a small section of southern Russia; with only one refueling, every target in the Soviet Union could be reached. At this same time a fleet of jet aerial tankers entered the Air Force inventory, greatly aiding the SAC bomber force. By 1959 the Air Force had over two hundred combat ready KC-135s, and unlike its predecessors, this aircraft did not require bases across the ocean. In 1960 ten SAC bases were in Canada, and all were for tankers, to enable B-52s to reach wartime targets by traversing the North Pole region. The long-sought polar strategy was finally realized.
Two forms of ballistic missiles also greatly altered SAC's overseas base structure. Until 1960 America's entire strategic arsenal was under control of the Strategic Air Command. Here, I direct attention back to Table 
17
Soviet progress sped this changeover, but was not the driving force. American leaders had long sought to free their strategic forces from the possibility of foreign interference, and these new weapons finally allowed American strategic arsenal to operate from the sanctity of neutral waters and stateside bases.
I will conclude by briefly placing my topic within a wider context.
The short history of SAC overseas bomber bases is a striking illustration of the economic potential of the United States. SAC bases abroad were negotiated, built, used, and abandoned, all over the course of a single decade. The sites were deemed a necessity in the early 1950s, to guard a perceived vulnerability, but even while these sites were being pursued, an assortment of alternative systems was being sought as well. The new systems (long range bombers, aerial tankers, ICBMs, and SLBMs) all developed concurrently. Strategic weapons were not competing against one another for budgetary allotments, but undergoing parallel development. Choices were made concerning the funding of these systems , but these were not hard choices, for all could be produced simultaneously. The separate systems were viewed as complementary, a mix of weapons which would further the American strategic arsenal. In less ten years the United States could afford to entirely restructure the composition of its strategic force.
American overseas bases of the twentieth century have been primarily developed for counter-hegemonic purposes. Bases have tended to go to overseas locations where a potential enemy nation poses the greatest threat to American interests. Prior to the middle of the century, when using traditional forms of military power, this was a fairly straight-forward process: merely match an adversary's forces, wherever they might be arrayed. But the asymmetrical use of strategic air power made this matter much more complex. Strategic air power appears, at first, to serve as the supreme counter-hegemonic tool for the United States. In peace, it offers an asymmetrical threat towards the enemy homeland, and in war, it could reduce the military and economic power of an enemy nation. This concept underlies the development of SAC overseas bomber bases, but it became far more problematic to accomplish as the decade progressed. Positioning SAC bombers abroad well served American interests, and initially the bases also fortified the national security of host nations, but later in the decade the sites actually endangered the hosts. At this point, foreign basing of a purported counter-hegemonic force actually resembled a form of American hegemony.
SAC bomber bases of the 1950s are another example of American leaders searching for an active United States role in world affairs, while simultaneously guarding American interests. These bases allowed the United States to project its influence abroad with minimal risk to the physical security of the United States. The risks were borne primarily by the host nations for the bomber bases. This is not to say that host nations gained no benefit from SAC bases, but rather that these benefits had to be carefully weighed against the risks. SAC bases presented a range of very difficult national security questions for America and the hosts.
The 1949 strategic concept developed by NATO nations assigned the United States as the sole provider of strategic air power for the alliance, a role which America sought and allies could not provide. Yet the United States stayed distant in several respects. American exclusivity over strategic military power allowed comparably smaller commitments from the United States among tactical forces, particularly Army ground units. The SAC chain of command emphasized that although the United States was part of the alliance and that American strategic forces would support it, in the end SAC forces were purely an American asset. The changing reception given to the SAC bases among so many hosts also shows that other NATO members were equally guided by national interests: the sites were welcomed when they offered security, then opposed when the risks seemed too high. On this particular issue, NATO was an alliance clearly motivated by individual national self-interests.
The life-cycle of the SAC bases occurred during a crucial period of Cold War history, and the status of these sites reflect upon that era. This was a time of international uncertainty. Sides were being chosen, alliances solidifying, and countries on the geopolitical margins being courted by both East and West. It was a dangerous world.
Yet throughout the continual tension and recurrent crises, the ultimate recourse provided by the SAC bomber bases was, to my knowledge, never actively considered. The presence of these bombers abroad demanded that the United States, the Soviet Union, and the host nations, all recognize the extreme consequences should a large-scale war break out.
This work has been focused on overseas bases, and these sites were intimately tied to the status of the strategic bomber. The rise and demise of overseas bomber bases are but a consequence of similar fates encountered by SAC bombers. In the early 1950s, the bomber was the dominant form of American strategic air power projection. This position was unchallenged for most of the decade, but alternative systems emerged late in this period and the bomber's exclusive hold on the strategic mission had been lost. Other, more desired means had arrived to project strategic air power. Overseas bomber bases are reflective of the bomber's position, but even more, the bases are a causal influence on alternatives which developed to the bomber. Seeking to replace the bomber bases also led to replacements for the bomber. The bomber still had a significant role in American strategy, but only as a contributor to the strategic mission, not the sole purveyor. The late 1950s signaled the end of the strategic primacy of the bomber, a period that had lasted for over two decades.
In conclusion, this analysis should go beyond the bombers and the bases to assess the position of strategic air power. Prior to the late 1950s, strategic air power could be stated in merely one word: bomber. But at the close of the decade, the definition of strategic air power returned to its roots: attacks through the air on targets within the enemy homeland. The argument put forth by SAC generals, that targets, not weapons, defined the strategic mission, had been fully accepted. Bombers, cruise missiles, and ballistic missiles on land and sea, all seek strategic targets and all travel through a common medium, the air. The strategic mission is inclusive of all of these means of delivery. Through this perspective, this story is not so much about the decline of the bomber, but rather the rise of the concept of air power. The opening quote for this dissertation bears repeating. It comes from the Summary Report of the European War, written in 1945 as part of the United States Strategic Bombing Survey:
The air has become a highway which has brought within easy access every point on the earth's surface-a highway to be traveled in peace, and in war, over great distances without limit at ever-increasing speed. Continued development is indicated in the machines and in the weapons which will travel the reaches of this highway...[We] must govern the place accorded Air Power in plans for coordination and organization of our resources and skills for national defense.
By 1960, air power, of all forms, had become firmly established as an integral portion of American national defense. This story has been about the journey undertaken as strategic air power sought to assert its role, and ultimately, should be seen as a triumph for the acceptance of air power.

1919. But within a year of the Armistice, America abandoned all of these European sites, with one notable exception-the United States Occupation Force remained in Coblenz, Germany, until 1923, to monitor any resurgence of German military might or territorial aspirations.
That year the entire collection of American foreign military sites-including those in United States protectorates-amounted to four naval bases, six air stations, and twenty army posts.

Extended deterrence became the "the worm in the apple" of deterrent theory and remained the central, and very enigmatic, component of NATO strategy throughout the Cold War.

SAC eventually had two bomber bases in Alaska, which became a state in 1959, but by the connotation of the 1950s, it remained an overseas location.
This term is often interchanged with range, a misnomer, which should refer only to the absolute distance an aircraft can fly from takeoff until fuel exhaustion. Range is a vague term in reference to aircraft due to extreme variations of aerodynamics, climate, and mission. Range (straight line distance) is often confused with the term radius (half of a round trip). However, some quotes and paraphrases featured here will use the more common term 'range.' Range is best applied to missile systems for they use a one-way flight profile.
The bombers were B-52Gs, a later version of the venerable aircraft that first became operational in the late 1950s. Supporting the strike were thirty-eight KC-135s from Lajes Air Base in the Azores, and nineteen KC-10s from Spain. Eliot A. Cohen, director, Gulf War Air Power Survey, vol.

The Communist Chinese threat is not the major focus here, it will be addressed in a later chapter. The Nash Report held that, even by 1957, there was active cooperation between these two major communist nations, and repeatedly refers to the collective "Sino-Soviet threat." But, for purposes here, the major opponent of this period and the focus of the overseas bomber bases was the Soviet Union. The next chapter will discuss the American perception of communist complicity around the globe.

The US Army deployed atomic artillery in October 1953. That same month Eisenhower authorized the JCS to plan on the use of strategic and tactical nuclear weapons against conventional attacks. In December 1954, the NATO Council approved MC-48, which authorized NATO commanders to plan on the availability and probable use of nuclear weapons. In 1956 NATO approved MC-70, a "forward
The BRAVO mission became increasingly important in SAC plans throughout the decade, and by the late 1950s was the primary objective of SAC targeting. But this was not the case early on, though, when choosing medium bomber bases. RAND R-266 mentions BRAVO targets, but is entirely based on assessment of DELTA targets. Wohlstetter, et al, RAND R-266, p. xl.

Wohlstetter, et al,[180][181]. SAC sought wartime operating rights around the Middle East, but most of the area was considered too dangerous for full rotational bases. American warplans from the late 1940s increasingly found the Middle East indefensible if faced with a Soviet offensive. The first joint-approved warplan, HALFMOON of 1948, assumed an allied loss of the Middle East and most of Europe. Starting with the 1949 warplan OFFTACKLE, SAC bombers planned on the use of bases in the UK and northwest Africa.Moody, Building, 
For the complexity wrought by the bomber threat from overseas bases, seeWohlstetter, et al, A detailed mathematical analysis of Soviet defenses can be found in R. Schamburg, "Generalized Analysis of Aerial Campaigns Against Strategic Targets," RAND Pamphlet P-1017, 9 May 1957. The most useful portion of this pamphlet, for my purposes, can be found in pages 11-23, where Schamburg discusses various enemy air defense configurations. He presents several theoretical models, the advantages and disadvantages of each, then examines possible courses of action for SAC planners to overcome them.
For the structure of Soviet air defenses see Robert P. Berman, Soviet Air Power in Transition, (Washington: The Brookings Institution, 1978), (hereafter cited as Berman, Transition), pp. 15-20); Thomas W.

See Chapter 1, Historiography, for specific comments on these base histories. This is an intentional omission by Blaker, Dilemma, p. 2. Books that center on later eras are: Cottrell and Moorer, Problems on the 1970s; Duke, Europe, and Harkavy's, Presence, both center on the 1980s. Sources that assess a single country include: Adams, Morocco; Duke, UK; Bowyer, Freedom; Campbell, Unsinkable; and Murray, "Initial." Harkavy's Access is subtitled 'The Geopolitics of Access Diplomacy,' and his Chapter 4 concerns the early post war period and does have a section on SAC bases, but he analyzes the operational use of the bases, not the underlying politics. SAC histories touch on international politics, but only as a peripheral topic. Despite the overall limitations, some sections of other works were particularly useful in this chapter, notably:Moody, Building, Campbell, Unsinkable,  and the historical background segments in various chapters of Duke, Europe. Two articles from the period were especially useful for assessing growing international difficulties with SAC bases in the late 1950s, Hoopes, "Strategy," and Packman, "Future."

The Mk-6 stored in the igloo had a yield of 40 kilotons, but the high explosive detonators were kept separately from the plutonium cores. A nuclear explosion could not have occurred, but had the high explosives detonated, the surrounding area could have been contaminated with plutonium. Campbell is especially virulent about this incident, accusing American commanders of "grotesquely cynical behaviour," claiming they ordered an evacuation of the facility without notifying the local villagers of the danger. Campbell, Unsinkable, pp. 49, 52-53. Alan Milward lived near the base in 1970 and discussed the matter with local villagers. According to their version of the story, the exodus from the base was not ordered, but rather an involuntary panic by some people on the facility.

The reason is that other assessments merely list the facility costs, without considering the much more costly factors of systems cost involved with overseas operations.

(Westport; Greenwood Press,  1996), (hereafter cited as Botti, Ace in the Hole") which analyzes the American bureaucratic structures and the many levels of decisions surrounding these international incidents. Botti's thesis is that nuclear weapons could indeed prevent a conflict, but that American leaders failed to choose which incidents were vital to American interests, thus diluting the value of these weapons and immersing the US in numerous periphery conflicts of little importance. Botti is very insightful and offers a wealth of new details, but I do find his writing style to be somewhat trite and full of cliches, which often obscure his themes.

The RAF victory in the Battle of Britain ensured retention of possible American bases in the UK, and the US moved quickly to formalize arrangements. The ABC-1 Conferences, a series of joint strategy meetings between American and British officers held in Washington from January to March 1941, planned to base thirty-two American bomb squadrons in the United Kingdom upon American entry into the war.

The early models of the B-36, finally delivered in 1948, had a combat radius less than three thousand miles. Although not the hoped-for intercontinental bomber, the B-36 was the longest range bomber then available and entered full-scale production. The B-35 prototype, once tested, had a combat radius of only 1,300 miles-considerably less that B-29s then in the inventory~and was canceled in 1949.Knaack,  Bombers,[497][498][499][500][501][502][503][504][505][506][507][508]

These costs continued with the next generation of strategic bombers. The B-47 and B-52 were both built concurrently by Boeing, and had similar speed and altitude capabilities; the B-47E cost $1.87 million, while the much larger B-52G cost $7.32 million. HQ USAF, SD FY1958. See also,Wohlstetter, et al, 
The AAF placed an initial procurement order for a jet version of the B-35 (the B-49, jet Flying Wing), but it could only fly one hundred miles farther than its predecessor, and was canceled in 1950. In May 1948 the AAF requested Boeing to incorporate jet engines into modifications of the developing B-52. In 1949, jet engines were mounted on the B-36D, making it a true hybrid, with six rearward-facing propellers and four forward-facing jets.

In 1954, when budget cuts stripped funds from the ANP program, the Air Force launched two concurrent research programs for new fuel sources, chemical propulsion and a combination of chemical and nuclear propulsion. Air Force specifications demanded a combat radius of 4,600 miles, but both programs were far beyond the current state of the art and despite Air Force hopes that that technology would catch up, it never did.Hewlett and Duncan, Atomic Shield,[489][490] Brown, Blind,. The Air Force budget for 1959 included $39.6 million for the nuclear-powered bomber, and another $96 million for the chemical-powered bomber, but neither of these futuristic proposals ever moved beyond the conceptual stage.

The B-47E had more powerful engines installed, to carry more fuel and extend its combat radius. The B-47E-II had stronger landing gear installed for the same reason. These "heavyweight standards" allowed the radius to reach over two-thousand miles, and in March 1955 the Air Force directed that all previous B-47 models be modified to the new standards.

The Navy also deployed cruise missiles aboard ships and submarines during this period, but the Regulus I of 1951 had a range of only six hundred miles, and its 1957 follow-on, the Regulus II, only eight hundred miles; neither was considered a strategic weapon.

Nuclear propulsion relies on heat from nuclear fission: uranium control rods inserted into the reactor core produce intense heat, which is then carried away by a coolant (water) to a steam generator, to drive turbines for the screws. A nuclear reactor does not really refuel, but, in principle, replacement of the uranium core accomplishes the same thing. For an idea of the distance possible with this fuel source, the Nautilus received its third uranium core in 1959 and it lasted for the next five years, propelling the boat over 150,000 miles. Nuclear prolusion, inertial navigation, and internal production of oxygen allows extensive underwater cruises, such as shown from February to May 1960 when the Triton followed the route of Magellan and circumnavigated the globe, covering 36,014 miles entirely submerged.

Harkavy makes a similar argument, but uses nuclear weapons instead of SAC overseas bases.Harkavy,  Presence, p. 115.   
Asymmetry was defined in Chapter 3 as the use of strategic bombers to threaten the Soviet homeland, to counterbalance to the large Red Army presence in Europe. Soviet land forces could threaten Western Europe, so American bombers, in turn, would threaten targets in the Soviet Union. See Chapter 3, "The Purpose of Acquiring Overseas Bases" for a more thorough explanation of this concept.
Harkavy, Access, p. 108.   
Duke mentions the strategic value of SAC bombers, but stresses the nuclear aspects of the bases. He does, however, undermine some of his own logic when he states: "From the mid 1950s on, as the deployment of Thor IRBMs was to show, nuclear forces did little but neutralize or match those of the other side." Duke. UK. p. 100-101.
Harkavy, Presence, p. 251. Duke and Harkavy often make similar arguments, which is not surprising as they often cite one another.
As discussed in Chapter 8, the American SSBN force used three overseas submarine bases, but the sites were a convenience, not a necessity.
This position was originally titled Commanding General, SAC. It was changed to Commander in Chief, SAC (CINCSAC) in April 1955. LeMay was appointed as a Lieutenant General, and received his fourth star on
October 1951.

Requirements of Deterrence
A grave incident occurred on 26 July 1956, and through this can be seen both the risks of nuclear weapons and the solidity of the Anglo-American political ties. An unarmed B-47 was practicing touch and go landings at RAF Lakenheath in England, when it crashed into a nuclear weapon storage igloo containing Mk-6 ("Mark Six") aerial nuclear bombs. 
100
Have just come from the wreckage of B-47 which ploughed into an igloo in Lakenheath ADS. The B-47 tore apart the igloo and knocked about 3 Mark Sixes. A/C [aircraft] then exploded showering burning fuel overall. Crew perished. Most of A/C wreckage pivoted on igloo and came to rest with A/C nose just beyond igloo bank which kept main fuel fire outside smashed igloo. Preliminary exam by bomb disposal officer says a miracle that one mark six with exposed detonators sheared didn't go. Fire fighters extinguished fire around Mark Sixes fast.
The reference to "a miracle" can be misconstrued, but even so, this was a very alarming accident.

If the delivery platforms could not be changed at this time, perhaps tactics could be, thus reducing reliance on overseas bomber bases. Simple arithmetic shows that a one-way combat mission would double the effective distance these bombers could operate. This, obviously, was not a popular topic with aircrews, but it was a feasible alternative. ! x The matter ultimately rested on relative value: did the benefit of a wing and went to the northeast United States as independent squadrons. This time the purpose was more defensive, as these squadrons would spread the command's force among many stateside bases and aiding the movement of other SAC aircraft moving from their home field, expected ground zero for a Soviet attack. By late 1960, ten SAC bases existed in Canada, and all were for air refueling units. These sites were increasingly for the use of KC-135s, which in turn would support bomber operations, not B-47s deploying to overseas bases, but B-52s operating across the Arctic.
The first of the long-desired intercontinental bomber finally did arrive when ten, and by 1960 eleven. And all of these B-52s were assigned to bases in North America. 
42
The United States now sought to position its strategic forces away from a perimeter strategy, favoring instead, the security and sanctity of a polar strategy. The long range bomber would be one element of this new American strategic triad, but ballistic missiles would become the primary components, composing two-thirds of the arsenal.
Changes among America's strategic forces had begun before Sputnik. Through a series of exercises in 1957, SAC tested the concept of fifteen minute ground alert (aircraft could launch on retaliatory raids within fifteen minutes of receiving warning of an inbound attack) and instituted these procedures at selected bases around the world, including Sidi Slimane in Morocco, on 1 October 1957. 
12
1 ' Tamnes presents these as two offensive nuclear strategies. By his account, the US used a perimeter strategy before technology and range permitted intercontinental operations, and thereafter, shifted to a polar strategy in which the Arctic region "gradually became the juncture of the new Air-Age Globalism." Tamnes, High North, pp. 29-31.
12 For the many procedural changes instituted by SAC in the mid-to late-1950s see, HQ SAC, Fortieth; Roman, Missile Gap, Chapter 2. Clearly the medium bomber force was in decline, while those of long range bombers and jet tankers continued to climb. Most significant though, was the expected mercurial rise in the ICBM force. Largely due to this, there was to be a one-forth drop in the SAC bomber force. In 1960, for the first time since inception, the total number of SAC squadrons declined: a few missiles could do the job of many bombers. Eisenhower had long been a firm supporter of overseas bomber bases, but in his Presidential memoirs (which were published in 1965) even he would write: "Today the guided missile is, gradually, supplanting the airplane as an engine of war."
By 1960 the bomber base lessons of World War II no longer applied: other weapons now had strategic capability, bombers would not be the first to fight in enemy territory, costly wartime bomber bases would not be required. The primary need for these bases vanished. The tertiary need did not entirely disappear, for the bases still had a role in any conceived strategic air war against the Soviet Union. SAC retained wartime operating rights its bombers at several sites around the globe, but peacetime possession was no longer necessary.
