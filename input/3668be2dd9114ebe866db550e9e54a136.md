The purpose of this thesis is to conduct an analysis of tactical and operational impacts to the Field Artillery (FA) branch as the United States Army emerges from seventeen years of constant combat.
Specifically, if the FA battalion can effectively support maneuver commanders in large scale combat operations (LSCO) in the defense after restructuring.
The United States military is still engaged in operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria at the time of this writing while also facing the daunting challenge of having to pivot from counterinsurgency to addressing the threat of near-peer competitors who have worked to close capability gaps.
The National Defense Strategy specifically addresses China and Russia as the most likely competitors globally, with these potential adversaries challenging US allies in Europe, the Indo-Pacific, and the Middle East.
Russia in particular has exported its advanced equipment and technology to globally destabilizing nations such as North Korea and Iran with non-state actors like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria potentially acquiring some of these systems.
