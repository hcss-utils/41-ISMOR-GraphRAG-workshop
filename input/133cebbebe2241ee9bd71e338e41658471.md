Europe: A New Partnership?
Another key long-term factor affecting the future of the international system is the prospect for European unification and relations between a united Europe and the United States.
With Europe, as with the democracies of Asia, the United States shares not only common ideals but also immense stakes in an increasingly integrated global economy.
