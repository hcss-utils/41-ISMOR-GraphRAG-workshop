This thesis explores the viability of utilizing unconventional warfare (UW) as a strategic approach to safeguard Estonia's sovereignty and territorial integrity in response to the threat emanating from the Russian Federation. Given Estonia's close proximity to Russia and the latter's assertive foreign policy, this study presents an empirical examination that specifically delves into the geographical aspects of northeastern Europe and their impact on the implementation of unconventional warfare within Estonia's Comprehensive Defense strategy. The primary objectives of this research are twofold: first, to address the existing gaps in knowledge concerning the strategic principles applicable to small nations employing unconventional warfare for defensive purposes; and second, to identify and elucidate the variables that exert influence on the utilization of unconventional warfare in Estonia, thereby contributing to the development of a comprehensive defensive strategy.
The primary focus of this research is to explore how the Estonian Special
Operations Forces (ESTSOF) can effectively utilize the units of the Estonian Defense League (EDL), a voluntary national defense organization, for the purpose of conducting successful unconventional warfare in the event of a Russian Armed Forces invasion. To address this question, a qualitative research methodology was employed, which encompassed a comprehensive review of existing theories pertaining to asymmetric conflicts and unconventional warfare doctrines. Furthermore, this study conducted an indepth analysis of historical case studies from the Second World War, specifically examining scenarios with comparable geographical and conflict characteristics.
The results indicate that leveraging the geographical attributes of Estonia and
Western Russia, such as the forests, wetlands, and climate, can enable the EDL fighting groups, despite their numerical disadvantage, to impede the Russian Federation Armed Forces' communication lines. As a consequence, Estonia's strategic depth would be enhanced, offering increased maneuverability for the Estonian Defense Forces and NATO Allies in the event of a Russian invasion.

The selected geographical factors that were analyzed present significant challenges and limitations for conventional armed forces that heavily rely on concentrated mass and heavy armored vehicles of various types and functions. Conversely, the extensive forested areas with limited infrastructure, expansive wetlands that are difficult to navigate or penetrate, and the harsh climate conditions characterized by reduced daylight from late fall to mid-spring, create advantageous circumstances that are likely to increase the operational effectiveness of small unconventional warfare units.
The geographical variables incorporated in this research offer increased opportunities for unconventional warfare units to undertake deep incursions into the enemy's front line and defense positions, aiming to disrupt or sabotage their crucial communication lines. For instance, targeting railway communication lines, which the Russian Federation Armed Forces heavily depend on for transportation and resupply purposes, highly likely could severely impede their assault operations and tempo.
Consequently, these factors contribute to shaping favorable battlefield conditions for the defending side by providing additional time for decision-makers to formulate strategic responses.
Another advantage that can be derived from deep penetration operations carried out by unconventional warfare units is the compelling of the Russian Armed Forces to redeploy a portion of their troops to protect rear area communication lines. This, in turn, diminishes the number of troops available for offensive purposes, which can prove advantageous for the defending side. For the Russian Federation Armed Forces, reduced freedom of maneuver and a lower concentration of troops allocated for assault operations translate into greater freedom of maneuver for Estonian defenders in the event of an armed invasion, thereby expanding Estonia's strategic depth. Historical instances such as the battles of the Russo-Finnish War and the Second World War demonstrate the successful implementation of similar tactics by small units to disrupt the adversary's operational tempo.
The extent of disruption caused by sabotage acts carried out deep within enemy territory against vital communication lines is challenging to predict due to numerous variables that come into play. Factors such as the resilience of the communication infrastructure and the availability of alternative options for the enemy can significantly 
xiii influence the outcomes. However, it is reasonable to assume that deep penetration operations provide support for defenders while degrading the capabilities of the assaulting forces.
To ascertain the potential level of disruption, research conducted by Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart, a renowned British military strategist and historian, offers valuable insights.
Liddell Hart's concept of the "horns of dilemma" highlights the difficult choices faced in military strategy and decision-making situations.

In order to facilitate the integration of unconventional warfare as a crucial element of a small state's comprehensive defense strategy, it is advisable to focus on training and equipping Estonian Defense League units to effectively operate within the unique geographical conditions of Estonia and Western Russia. The training and operational utilization of these units should primarily aim to enhance their survivability. By adopting this approach, the EDL units can effectively serve as ambassadors, confronting the decision-makers of the Russian Federation Armed Forces with the challenging "horns of dilemma." This strategic maneuver can be regarded as a means to expand Estonia's strategic depth in the event of an armed invasion by the Russian Federation.

On February 24, 2022, as Estonia prepared to commemorate its 104th anniversary, Russia launched an unprovoked attack against Ukraine in an attempt to end its existence.
A hundred and six years ago, in the aftermath of World War I, the Estonian War of Estonian national and privately held resources. After the mass deportation of 1949, whose victims appeared to be chosen randomly, numerous people dreaded that they would become the next adversary of the regime.

Even the mass deportations could not break the civilian will to resist the authoritarian Soviet Union, which was the leading factor in restoring Estonia's independence in 1991. Despite being numerically inferior, the Forest Brothers could effectively exploit environmental conditions using their superior local knowledge. On the other hand, these courageous men and women who chose to risk and sacrifice their lives to oppose the tyrannical Soviet Union displayed the most remarkable fighting spirit. actions, the resistance spirit spread to the remainder of the population of the Baltic States.
Never was the will to resist and hope to achieve independence extinguished. Resistance movements awaited the appropriate time and favorable conditions to rise from the ashes like the Phoenix. At the end of the 1980s, conditions had drastically altered. The Soviet Union was losing its regional hegemony primarily due to the United States' unwavering policy and resolute actions against communism's global expansion. The citizens of the Baltic States viewed this as an opportunity to regain their independence. Over a halfcentury of the traumatic historical experience of the Soviet Union occupation and geographical proximity to its principal de facto internationally recognized successor state, the Russian Federation has imbued Estonia's strategic culture with two overwhelming imperatives: never again and never alone.

The four major strategic shocks-the so-called Bronze Soldier Monument Coup d'état in Estonia in April 2007, the five-day Russo-Georgian War in 2008, Russia's "hybrid war" campaign against Ukraine in early 2014, and Russia's full-scale unprovoked military invasion of Ukraine in February 2022-are just a few examples that have once again confirmed the Russian Federation's aggressive foreign policy strategy and determination to employ multifaceted means including full scale unprovoked military invasion to achieve its goals. Furthermore, the perverse and antisocial means by which the Russian Federation achieves its foreign policy objectives have significantly impacted Estonia's National Security Strategy and increased the population's desire to participate. Notably, Russia's aggression against Ukraine since 2014 has resulted in a genuinely tectonic shift, as most Estonians now view national defense as their top priority.

This study addresses two voids in the current understanding of unconventional warfare. First, there are few attempts to integrate strategic theory and tactical concepts for small states employing unconventional warfare for defense and deterrence, even though 19 Riigikogu, 4.   20 Riigikogu, 4.   21 Estonian Defence Forces, "About Estonian Special Operations Forces," Estonian Defence Forces, accessed April 23, 2023, https://mil.ee/en/landforces/special-operations/; Estonian Defence Forces, "Eriväelased Harjutasid Koos Kaitseliitlastega Tavatu Sõja Pidamist," Estonian Defence Forces, May 26,  2015, https://mil.ee/uudised/erivaelased-harjutasid-koos-kaitseliitlastega-tavatu-soja-pidamist/.

research on irregular approaches to fighting a militarily superior adversary has yielded a number of important insights.

How can the Estonian Special Operations Forces employ the Estonian Defense League units to perform successful unconventional warfare against the Russian Armed Forces in the case of an invasion?
To answer the research question, I employ a qualitative methodology. I collected data from existing theories of asymmetric conflicts and unconventional warfare doctrines from World War I to the present. This thesis aims to determine whether historically significant factors in an asymmetric conflict are continuously dependent or appear randomly, such that relatively weaker sides can seize the initiative and force the relatively stronger opponent to meet the opposition's demands. Suppose the qualitative analysis reveals persistent factors that have favored a relatively weaker side in asymmetric conflicts. My research also considered theories and practitioner inputs to trace the evolution of asymmetric conflict studies and determine how best to apply the lessons learned. This research considers asymmetric conflict theorists and practitioners from a variety of worldviews. It aims to distill the best practices for how an underdog can turn defeat into victory, regardless of how one defines victory.
Furthermore, this research seeks to identify methods for expanding Estonia's limited strategic depth, which is crucial to defend Estonian sovereignty in the event of an armed invasion by the Russian Federation through employing unconventional warfare. Due to its small size and proximity to the Baltic Sea, Estonia has little strategic depth. Therefore, the only viable way to expand strategic depth after a Russian-initiated armed conflict is by employing unconventional warfare into sovereign Russian western territory. In addition, Estonian military operations conducted behind enemy lines that target Russian communication lines could disrupt Russian military logistics and battle preparations, thereby extending Estonia's strategic depth.
I intend to shed light on the less scrutinized offensive guerrilla warfare options and how to improve the Estonian Defense Force's overall capabilities to degrade the numerical superiority of the Russian Federation Armed Forces and impede their maneuverability under conditions of limited Estonian strategic depth.
I organized this study into four chapters. Chapter I includes the introduction, information gap, research question, and research outline.
In Chapter II, I review selected asymmetric conflict theoretical studies and guerrilla warfare doctrines and manuals. Specifically, I examine the literature on unconventional warfare for arguments regarding asymmetric conflict theories, small wars and limited-scale armed conflict doctrine, and specific on-the-ground conditions.
Chapter III applies the unconventional warfare theories to the resources in Estonia with an emphasis on the key geographical variables in Estonia, namely terrain, forest, swamps, and climate, for employing guerrilla warfare against numerically more robust 29 Despite my agreement with the common belief that urban warfare presents the most challenging environment for land combat, I omit an analysis of the urban environment for two primary reasons. First, the regions of Estonia and Western Russia are not densely populated, so urban guerrilla warfare is highly unlikely. Second, the urban environment is unfavorable for guerrilla warfare, mainly because most urban territory is covered with sophisticated surveillance equipment, severely diminishing the guerrillas' ability to remain hidden against a numerically stronger opponent. 
The fundamental perspective of classical realist theory perceives international relations from the standpoint of comparative power, as exemplified by Thucydides' portrayal of the rivalry between Athens and Sparta.

Small nation-states have four general options for maintaining effective deterrence and defense capabilities based on their geographical location, available natural resources, and foreign policy goals. 32 First, they may replicate more powerful nations by maintaining a regular army.

On the other hand, in many cases, irregular strategies have been successful when a small force faces a stronger enemy. For example, over a decade of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations in Iraq showed that even a coalition of the world's most powerful militaries led by a global superpower experience harsh times when confronted by In his work "Why Big Nations Lose Small Wars: The Politics of Asymmetric Conflict," Andrew Mack argues that the triumph of weaker actors over stronger ones can be attributed to a fundamental disparity in their respective interests.

The ability of a weaker actor to mobilize local population support against their oppressors could often be more critical to achieving success than relying solely on foreign aid. The Resistance Operating Concept places a significant focus on governments' efforts to enhance the resilience of their nations through the implementation of a comprehensive defense strategy.

Collectively, the abovementioned works lead to a set of abstract concepts that are beneficial for fighting irregular warfare in an asymmetric conflict. On the other hand, the disparities between various asymmetric conflict theories raise the following question: what are the essential elements that enable weak actors to discourage or defend against powerful actors in an asymmetric conflict? It seems appropriate, therefore, to add another layer of well-developed concepts to this research. The rationale for including a literature review of selected small wars doctrines is to merge abstract ideas of asymmetric warfare and actual approaches from the history of small wars conflicts into a single entity.
Guerrilla warfare is commonly employed by the less powerful against, the more powerful, by those equipped with limited weaponry facing adversaries with vast military capabilities. Conversely, it is a tactic embraced by those who resist invasion or individuals driven to instigate civil unrest to overthrow an undesirable regime.

preserve these areas, which serve as the foundation for the revolutionary movement.
Volunteers are recruited, trained, and indoctrinated with revolutionary ideology during this phase. Agitators and propagandists are deployed to persuade and win the local population's support surrounding the base areas. The emphasis is on secrecy, meticulous planning, and gradual growth. 
87
Phase II "(progressive expansion)" 88 involves the expansion of the revolutionary movement beyond the initial base areas. With a solid foundation established in Phase I, the movement seeks to extend its influence and control into new territories. This expansion may involve military and political strategies, aiming to gain support from a wider population and weaken the existing power structures. The movement gradually increases its reach and strength, expanding its presence and undermining the authority of the ruling regime.

Instead, the focus should be on devising effective strategies to destroy the enemy. Mao's quote, "To gain territory is no cause for joy, and to lose territory is no cause for sorrow. To lose territory or cities is of no importance. The important thing is to think up ways of destroying the enemy." 94 encapsulates this idea. Deception plays a vital role in guerrilla warfare. Guerrillas should skillfully create illusions and conceal their true intentions and identity. They must be adept at constructing false appearances while disguising their real objectives. 
95
In guerrilla warfare, avoiding prolonged and decisive engagements with a superior adversary is crucial. Instead, the aim should be to conclude any direct encounters with the stronger enemy quickly. When facing a more powerful opponent, guerrillas should adopt a strategy of retreating when the enemy advances, harassing them when they halt, launching attacks when they are fatigued, and pursuing them when they retreat.

Abu Bakr Naji has divided Islam insurgency warfare into three phases. He describes it as a way to establish an Islamic state through three stages: "the stage of power of vexation and exhaustion.", 99 "the stage of the administration of savagery. 
The primary objectives of the "power of vexation and exhaustion" phase are multifaceted.

In summary, the "administration of the savagery" phase focuses on ensuring the local population's well-being, strengthening internal security, gathering intelligence, training new recruits, and forming alliances. These objectives contribute to the advancement of the insurgency and its ability to achieve its goals.
"The power of establishment -establishing the state" phase reinforces the core principle advocated by Mao in his III phase of revolutionary warfare.

Naji places considerable importance on incorporating media strategies alongside military actions.

119
120
To summarize, according to Naji, the strategy of depleting the enemy's economic resources is a key method to defeat a formidable foe. 
121
The insights provided by Thomas Edward Lawrence, Mao Tse-tung, and Abu Bakr
Naji shed light on the dynamics and strategies of guerrilla warfare. Lawrence emphasizes the importance of mobility, surprise, and the power of public sentiment in achieving success. Mao's philosophy highlights the principles of distraction, surprise, and targeting vulnerabilities to overcome a stronger opponent. Finally, Naji's approach emphasizes wearing down the enemy, strengthening internal support, and targeting economic objectives to achieve victory. These perspectives offer valuable lessons for Estonia's defense strategy, emphasizing the need for flexibility, adaptability, and integration of unconventional tactics. By incorporating these principles, Estonia can enhance its preparedness and resilience in asymmetric conflicts and ensure the establishment of a strong defense posture.

With an analogy, Robert Taber likens guerrilla warfare to a flea and dog battle. 
131
132
Robert Taber highlights that guerrillas face considerable challenges when confronted by adversaries prepared for coordinated resistance, making it difficult for them to achieve victory through open warfare in the early stages of the conflict. 
133
134
Moreover, densely forested areas are preferable over barren regions. Additionally, the presence of extensive railway lines and underdeveloped roadways can provide advantages for guerrilla movements. Lastly, an agricultural-based economy is deemed more conducive to guerrilla warfare compared to an industrialized one. 
135
137
138
139
140
Therefore, the selection of a pastoral territory with a dispersed population becomes crucial.
Such a region provides similar natural concealment and obstacles to desolate areas but offers the added advantage of being economically unfeasible for the government to garrison extensively. 
Taber's final analysis of conventional warfare versus guerrilla warfare emphasizes that the army's objective is to secure and occupy physical territory, including strategic locations, roads, and important areas. In contrast, the guerrilla's primary focus is to gain control over the population. 
142
Intelligence plays a pivotal role in guerrilla warfare, serving as the decisive factor. 
144
The intelligence operations within guerrilla networks are highly organized and extensive. 
145
Shortly, guerrilla fighters maintain a constant effort to participate in battles on their preferred terms, utilizing their access to superior information. Their extensive knowledge 
of the terrain empowers them to exploit it for their benefit while simultaneously placing their opponents in a disadvantaged position. Guerrillas exercise discretion when deciding to engage in combat, opting for situations where the likelihood of success heavily favors their side. Instead of concentrating solely on eliminating enemy forces physically, guerrillas understand the importance of targeting the mindset and determination of their adversaries as more critical objectives. Accomplishing this involves leveraging their enhanced intelligence capabilities, which provide valuable insights and facilitate strategic decision-making.

offensive phase, and they continue to serve as safe havens in later stages. However, it is important to note that confining guerrilla operations solely to these zones would be secure but not necessarily practical or efficient.
Relying solely on remote regions may result in a loss of connection with sympathetic domestic audiences, effectively isolating guerrilla fighters from their supporters. 
150
151
Due to the rapid growth of urbanization, rural areas have lost their capacity to support extensive guerrilla activities. 
152
153
They prefer engaging from elevated positions with sufficient cover and limited visibility, enabling even a small group to withstand a larger opposing force. However, relying too heavily on remote regions can isolate guerrillas from their sympathetic domestic supporters. The expansion of urbanization has diminished the ability of rural areas to While movement remains crucial, successful guerrilla campaigns recognize the importance of rest, recuperation, and regrouping as essential elements for long-term effectiveness.
The guerrilla movement is not an isolated occurrence; it satisfies the requirements of its followers. Therefore, Mao argues, in isolation, guerrilla warfare could only produce tactical achievements; to be successful, it must be integrated into a larger revolutionary plan. Guerrilla warfare requires a defined political purpose. Mao's strategy was goaloriented, with the essential components not solely military factors but rather the political and psychological results occasionally generated from military acts.

Since its origin, propaganda, and terror have contributed to guerrilla warfare. 
156
157
160
Guerrilla warfare is a prolonged and challenging endeavor that necessitates a clear political objective, meticulous planning, and effective execution. Key factors for success include the strategic selection of terrain, gathering intelligence, and garnering support from the local population. Through these tactics, guerrilla movements strive to undermine their adversaries, gain the public's backing, and ultimately accomplish their political aspirations. 
In the contemporary landscape of guerrilla warfare, strategic communication and propaganda have become increasingly vital due to the widespread influence of mass media.
Applying the principles and strategies of guerrilla warfare to Estonia's historical context reveals its relevance to the country's resistance against foreign occupation and its quest for independence. Estonia has endured periods of foreign dominion and occupation throughout its past, notably during World War II under Soviet control and later as a constituent of the Soviet Union. These experiences align with the fundamental tenets of guerrilla warfare.
Even today, the principles of guerrilla warfare retain their significance within Estonia's national defense strategy. Given its geopolitical positioning and historical background, Estonia places considerable emphasis on deterrence and defense. This includes the development of unconventional capabilities and maintaining a well-prepared population. In addition, insights derived from past resistance movements serve as the basis for Estonia's approach to safeguarding its sovereignty and ensuring border security.

Fighting groups of the Defense League collaborate closely with the Estonian Special Operations Command. The training of those units mainly concentrates on smallunit tactics, marksmanship, and combat engineering. In addition, the training focuses on unconventional warfare tactics. 
178
The equipment and training of a fighting group allow it to function independently without the direct support of friendly forces. Training for fighting groups emphasizes small unit tactics and extensive shooting and explosives practice. 
179
In addition, the organization possesses at least a rudimentary understanding of handling certain weapons not currently listed in the Estonian Defense Force's armament chart.
The fighting group also possesses the requisite communication, medical, and demolition expertise to undertake tactical missions behind enemy lines. 
180
Earlier sections of this study highlighted two crucial factors of guerilla warfare: extraordinary intelligence and appropriate topographical circumstances. If this conclusion is accurate, then the numerically weaker EDL guerilla force should be able to conduct effective military operations against the Russian Federation Armed Forces. However, to evaluate the validity of this premise, intelligence and terrain considerations must be applied to the Estonian setting and compared to past examples with comparable circumstances.
David Galula has articulated the significance of geography and guerilla warfare in the following manner. In a revolutionary war, the function of geography, which is significant in an ordinary war, may be predominating. If the insurgent's initial weakness is not mitigated by terrain, he may be doomed to fail before he even begins.

In explaining why certain nations have more successfully waged guerrilla campaigns than others, it is necessary to comprehend the conditions that favor guerrillas and limit enemy counter-guerrilla operations. Therefore, this study focuses on three geographical elements: forests, swamps, and climate. I concentrate on these variables because these three elements could be the significant limiting factors for Russian Armed Forces to apply their numerical force size and fire superiority. However, simultaneously, the same geographical elements enhance small guerrilla units' freedom of maneuver and survivability.

A key principle of guerrilla warfare is that the guerrillas are initially less powerful than the governments they oppose.

Guerrillas tend to succeed when they face a weak government and military that are financially challenged, corrupt, organizationally inept, politically divided and lack awareness of local situations.

According to Che Guevara, guerrilla warfare may not always take place in the most favorable geographical conditions. 
197

Estonia and Western Russia do not have mountain ranges or jungles. Nevertheless, there are forests and swamps present, which guerrillas can effectively utilize to their advantage. According to Mao Tse-tung's rules for guerilla warfare, Estonia's physical setting is not conducive for trading space for time.

Therefore, battles in woodland locations face similar obstacles as confrontations in urban areas. Due to the concealment of vegetation, it is challenging to determine fighting positions and troop movements. Today, forested region concealment's advantages are lessened due to the technical advancement of monitoring and reconnaissance equipment.
However, forested terrain inhibits the enemy's ability to observe and acquire intelligence.
Satellites and other forms of digital intelligence are more complex to deploy in forested locations. Therefore, forested terrain influences surveillance costs and diminishes the utility of intelligence gathering by nonhuman sources. 
206
To summarize the benefits that densely forested areas offer guerillas. Firstly, forested terrain inhibits the government's ability to collect dependable and precise intelligence at a reasonable price. Second, a well-known military concept is that one cannot destroy what one cannot see. Third, forested areas make it more difficult for Russian counter-guerilla operations to neutralize guerrilla activity, not only because of the lack of information about guerrillas' locations but also because forest regions typically lack the infrastructure, such as roads with high weight tolerance and a clear long line of sight, required for Russian Armed Forces to imply their superior firepower and armor; thus, the skillful use of a forested environment favors guerrilla tactics.
The importance of geography to national security extends back millennia. Seas, lakes, deserts, deep forests, and swamps have traditionally been used as natural state boundaries because they hamper the movement of armies. In addition, the size of a state's territory could be a valuable criterion for measuring its strength and self-defense capacity. 
207
Estonia has extensive swamps. Due to the flat terrain of Estonia, the marsh stretches everywhere. There are almost 165,000 marshes in Estonia that are larger than one hectare.
One hundred thirty-two are peatlands with more extensive than one thousand hectares.

Fighting in swamps is a nightmare of heavily armored mechanized units. Mud enters everything and ruins valuable equipment, and the wet ground dictates a plodding advancement pace. The lack of suitable infrastructure makes mechanized assault formations and logistics challenging. Soldiers frequently must dismount to fight or could only move on foot, considerably degrading a force's ability to employ weapons with superior firepower and armored vehicle advantages. Large forces have difficulty coordinating their maneuvers in the swamp, degrading their numerical advantages. Isolated adversary units are more vulnerable to guerrillas' attacks. Therefore, in a country characterized by swamplands, a relatively small military force can effectively withstand a significantly larger enemy for an extended period. This is due to the resource-intensive nature of controlling extensive swampy territories. Russian Armed Forces leadership faces two options: to allocate a significant number of troops to secure the swampy areas that could otherwise be deployed on the front line or leave the swampy areas uncontrolled and provide the guerrillas means to expand strategic depth towards the East.
The climate has a substantial impact on warfare. Some disadvantages for one side typically accompany a climatic advantage for the opposing side in a conflict. Each geographical region has its weather patterns, accompanied by unique difficulties. For In addition to temperature, the most significant meteorological component influencing warfare is moisture in its different forms. Rain, snow, and ice can severely restrict the mobility and maneuverability of the armed forces. In addition, dirt and humidity negatively impact the maintenance and functionality of weapons and equipment.

First, pro-guerrilla environment characteristics include a virtually endless list of conditions, depending on the geographic location where the movement emerges and thrives.
The scope of this study is restricted to terrain features such as forests, marshes, rivers, and inland water sources, as these are pertinent to the area of study. According to previous research, the terrain mentioned above features diminishes the numerical superiority of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. Even though additional terrain features could be advantageous, combining these four primary obstacles and the additional information gathered helps guerilla forces pinpoint specific areas of concern. Although climate conditions support guerilla warfare in the region, they are nearly impossible to predict accurately for long-term operational planning due to their volatility, so the author excludes climate conditions from mapping out.
Second, the arterial transit corridors of the Russian Federation Armed Forces are primary land-based transportation routes, and the western region of Russia has an extensive rail network. Since a motorized journey covers 250 kilometers per day and rail transport covers 600 kilometers per day, rail transport is preferred even though air transport has been considered the fastest way to deploy troops.247 Insufficient aviation platforms are available within the western military district to transport many troops and materiel by air. In addition, the region's infrastructure only supports a limited amount of transport by air. As a result, it contributes to the necessity of railroad transportation as the primary mode of transport.
Thirdly, the location of known military assets is based on data from open sources.
Although military assets could be divided based on available information into specific asset 247 Kaitsejõudude Peastaap, Vene Föderatsiooni Maavägede Lahingumäärustik. I Osa: Diviis,  Brigaad, Polk (Tallinn, Estonia: Kaitsejõudude Peastaap, 2001).  
To recapitulate the advantages, densely forested regions in northeastern Europe offer guerrillas (Figure

Densely swampy regions are conducive to unconventional warfare due to the natural cover and concealment provided by wetlands and marshes, the natural obstacles they create, the natural resources they provide, and the psychological advantage they provide (Figure

Russia's numerical advantage in large-caliber mechanized armament and armor could be diminished because its soldiers frequently dismount and fight on foot. Moreover, due to dismounted combat without the protection of mechanized armor, constant exposure to danger could negatively affect Russian soldiers, reducing their will to fight. As a result, guerrillas are more likely to target isolated and disoriented Russian units effectively.
Additionally, the lack of high-level coordination in the Russian Federation Armed Forces as a result of the swampy conditions creates voids in their offensive and defensive lines, allowing EDL fighting groups to circumvent strongholds unopposed.
Controlling the vast wetlands requires significant resources. This could force the Russian Armed Forces' leadership to choose between allocating significant soldiers to secure the swampy areas, which could otherwise be deployed to the front line, or leaving the swampy areas uncontrolled and allowing EDL fighting groups to expand Estonia's strategic depth to the east. 
To summarize the climatic advantages of northeastern Europe for EDL fighting groups (Figure

Thus, the faction fighting for the right to exist takes precedence over those with less ambitious evolutionary goals. Therefore, EDL fighting groups should have a psychological advantage over Russian forces when defending Estonia against the existential threat posed by the Kremlin's tyrannical and criminal foreign policy.
Extremely frigid weather conditions may cause disorientation and isolation among Russian forces, which EDL combatants could exploit. Rain, snow, and ice can severely restrict the maneuverability and mobility of the heavily armored Russian Armed Forces.
Additionally, dirt and humidity harm the maintenance and functionality of the armaments and equipment of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, which are technically antiquated relative to their respective NATO counterparts but superior in quantity. Forces. This research holds that if northeastern Europe's geographical conditions are exploited to their utmost potential. In such a scenario, the numerically inferior EDL fighting groups could conduct effective military operations against the rear-line communications of the Russian Federation Armed Forces, thereby increasing Estonia's strategic depth, which is crucial for providing maneuverability for the Estonian Defense Forces and NATO Allies in the event of a Russian invasion.
Due to Estonia's geographical proximity to Russia, whose political leadership has made clear its genocidal geopolitical expansionist aspirations toward its neighbors, preparations for defending Estonia's sovereignty and territorial integrity are a continuous and never-ending process. There are no clear indications that the political leadership of the Russian Federation will alter its criminal and perverse foreign policy soon. Therefore, Estonian strategic defense planners would find it beneficial to evaluate constantly new and improved countermeasures against Russia's aggressive foreign policy. However, countermeasures against the threat cannot transform the likely victim into the perpetrator.

and using planning guidance, the research will establish a set of unique characteristics that can enhance the Estonian Defense Force's unconventional warfare capabilities, ultimately contributing to Estonia's comprehensive defense strategy. The Estonian Defense Forces have already allocated resources for unconventional warfare as part of this strategy. In case of an armed invasion by the Russian Federation, the Estonian Defense League and the Estonian Special Operation Forces will be responsible for preparing and executing unconventional warfare. This research identifies the Estonian Defense League Fighting Groups as the primary source of human resources for conducting unconventional warfare against the Russian Armed Forces to expand Estonia's limited strategic depth.
The Estonian Defense League is a voluntary organization dedicated to national defense, operating under the supervision of the Estonian Ministry of Defense.

Within the framework of Estonia's comprehensive national defense concept, there is a need to bolster the unconventional warfare capabilities of the Estonian Defense Forces, which will enhance the overall defense readiness of the country. Additionally, conducting research on the geographical factors that influence the deployment of guerrilla warfare against the Russian Federation's armed forces in the event of an invasion can provide additional means to increase Estonia's strategic depth and reshape the battlefield conditions in favor of Estonia.
The security of Estonia is supported by its membership in the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization and the European Union.

Unconventional warfare provides additional means to mitigate the existential threat to Estonia in cooperation with NATO allies.
