The chapter on Russian security services, entitled "Protecting the New Rome," is a high point in the book.
Russia's tilt away from the West since the end of the Soviet Union towards an authoritarian model has tended to baffle many Western observers.
However, an examination of Russia's Byzantine influences provides a fascinating perspective on the culture that underlies this process.
President Putin's patriarchal behavior toward the Russian Orthodox Church draws parallels to emperors of a millennium past, but far from being an isolated anachronism, this chapter demonstrates elements of this pattern have perpetuated, even during the Soviet Union.
This culminates today in a security culture that has allowed Russia's intelligence services to weather extreme political change with surprisingly little impact.
