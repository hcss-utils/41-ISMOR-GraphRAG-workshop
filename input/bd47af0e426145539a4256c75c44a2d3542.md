Simply put this is Russian Revanchism.
To the chagrin of the US and the West, Putin's military and information machines consistently work more effectively to thwart Western attempts to reign in or dissuade Russia's behavior.
The US and the West have options.
These options require a better understanding of the challenges posed by Putin, a medium and long-term strategy of deterrence, and combination of appeasement plus persuasion.
They will also require commitment from a whole-of-government America working in better regional and bilateral coordination with our partners, particularly the Baltic nations and Europe.
