NATO instituted its PfP program in 1994 to develop relations with non-NATO members of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), including prospective NATO allies.
PfP played an important role in preparing the OSCE states to conduct cooperative peace enforcement and humanitarian military activities in the Balkans in the late 1990s.
It strengthened the development of interoperable forces by involving partner states in planning and carrying out joint peacekeeping operations and familiarizing them with alliance structures and procedures.^^ The PfP planning and review process provides a forum for the development of military restructuring plans for individual member states.
The results, incorporated in partner defense plans, reflect member state individual partnership programs, which demonstrate their capabilities for potential NATO membership.^^ Operations in both Bosnia and Kosovo have shown the potential for effective interoperability among NATO members, new and old, and their PfP associates.
The deployment of the Implementation Force in 1996 required the establishment of reception facilities in Hungary, while forces in Bosnia included Russian, Polish, and Czech combat battalions, Hungarian and Romanian engineer battalions, and smaller contingents from the Baltic states and elsewhere.^''
