In order to address these gaps and determine actions that may enable the United States to compete in the current environment and also prepare for future conflict, this study is organized into the following chapters.
Chapter II argues that GPC will characterized by irregular conflict; it does this by analyzing and assessing the predominant contemporary responses to increased competition with near-peer adversaries, and how the U.S. is currently responding.
It uses case studies of adversarial actions taken by Russia, China and Iran during the Syrian Civil War.
Each of these adversaries clearly executed their own brand of hybrid, asymmetric or irregular warfare while also appearing to modernize its military.
In response, the United States has focused its efforts on preparing for high intensity conflict, potentially ignoring an advantage it could attain by focusing more on irregular warfare in pre-conflict competition.
The chapter closes by identifying critical elements regarding how and where along the spectrum of conflict America's principal competitors gain an advantage.
