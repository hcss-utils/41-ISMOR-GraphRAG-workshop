Indeed, if we had enlarged this volume, we would have included selections that show what theorists and strategists in other nations are thinking about information-age conflict, particularly in Russia and China, where some sharp contrasts to the American, technologyoriented approach are taking shape.
Both the Russians and the Chinese are focusing on information-based concepts of strategy, doctrine, and organization-putting these at least on a par with technology, while avoiding a single-minded intent on it.
In this regard, Americans may have much to learn from both the Russians and the Chinese-about concepts of nonlinearity, about military networks, and about notions that the more technologically advanced an opponent is, the more he may be vulnerable to disruptive attack.
