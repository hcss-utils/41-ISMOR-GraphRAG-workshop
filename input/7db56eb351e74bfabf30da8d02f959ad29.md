Despite an economic decline following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia has maintained a sizeable conventional military force focused on resisting NATO expansion and maintaining influence in Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Far East.
Within Russia this force is seen as a key to their national strength on the global stage.
There is recognition however, that the force requires significant modernization, as much of Russia's military equipment has not been upgraded to keep pace with technological change.
To counter this, Russia has embarked on an ambitious program to modernize its forces, invest heavily in military related research and development, and sustain its top tier nuclear forces.
In order to achieve these goals a military investment plan was announced in 2008 to reduce the size of conventional forces while focusing on asymmetric, rapid response actions to support Russia's interests.
17 While Russia's GDP remained stagnant for the 1990s through the mid 2000s, it has increased three fold in the last 10 years 18 , and is the world's 7 th largest economy at over $2.2 trillion, as measured by purchasing parity.
