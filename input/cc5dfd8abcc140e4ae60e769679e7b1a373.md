John Lewis Gaddis summarizes Nixon's approach to defense planning in the immediate post-Vietnam environment as "consisting of (1) the appeasement of Congress, with a view to defusing as much as possible growing anti-military sentiment there, and (2) negotiations with the Russians aimed at restricting as much as possible their own military buildup, without constraining in any significant way comparable measures the United States might choose to take once the furor over Vietnam had died down."
