The United States and the United Kingdom are considered the countries where modern PMCs originated.
The first modern PMC is considered the British company Watch Guard International founded in 1965.
In the late 1980s, U.S. companies Vinnell and Military Professional Resources, Inc. followed the developing trend.
Nowadays, many others are imitating the Western model and, in some cases, revolutionizing the employment of PMCs.
Countries like Russia, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Colombia produce PMCs that provide robust military capabilities for the highest bidder -typically with little regard to human rights, international law, or ethical behaviors.
