# Title: Alliance strikes back: using multi domain operations to counter Russian hybrid warfare in the Baltics

# Fulltext:
NATO has little choice but to confront Russian covert violent action in the Baltics and prevent Russia from executing a 'bite and hold' strategy, as in Eastern Ukraine.
A failure to do so would risk the collapse of the Alliance.
In 2008 in Georgia, a pre-existing conflict partially excused Russia's actions.
NATO's reaction was muted.
In 2014 in Crimea, no such confusion existed, and overwhelming force was used to ram through the annexation of territory.
NATO's reaction was less muted but not effective.
In 2015 in Eastern Ukraine, Russia conducted another land grab.
NATO responded with limited military assistance to Ukraine and economic sanctions.
To misquote Oscar Wilde, to overlook one aggression may be regarded as a misfortune, to ignore two looks like carelessness, and not to respond appropriately to a third (or a fourth) would be stupidity
