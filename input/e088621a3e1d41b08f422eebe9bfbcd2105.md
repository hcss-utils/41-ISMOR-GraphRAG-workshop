The overarching argument in the first half of this report is that the same escalation dynamics that existed during the Cold War exist today as well -and they are just as powerful.
Nuclear deterrence is not a legacy mission, because states still face the same critical national security threats they faced during the Cold War and throughout history: namely, the leaders of weak states fear that the strong will conquer them or take steps that will lead to their downfall.
The high--stakes poker game of international politics has not fundamentally changed - contrary to the claims of many observers.
What has principally changed is merely who has the best cards.
Those who were weak during the Cold War are now strong; and another set of militarily "weak" countries -such as North Korea, Iran, and even China and Russia -now clutch nuclear weapons to defend themselves from overwhelming military might, just as NATO once did.
