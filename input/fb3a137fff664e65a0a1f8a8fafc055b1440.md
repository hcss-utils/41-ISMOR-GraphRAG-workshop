South Germany was critical to France's military fortunes; if the Prussians controlled it, they'd be still richer, bigger, and able to invade France on a broad front from the Prussian Rhineland in the north to Alsace-Lorraine in the south.
Geography and position had historically been an asymmetry that favored France against Voltaire's "kingdom of mere border strips."
Prussia's spread south would change that asymmetry in Berlin's favor, enabling Moltke to plan the sort of broad, concentric invasion of France that he'd used so successfully against the Austrians in 1866.
Thus, in 1868, Napoleon III warned the British foreign secretary that if Bismarck tried to annex South Germany, "our guns will go off of themselves."
