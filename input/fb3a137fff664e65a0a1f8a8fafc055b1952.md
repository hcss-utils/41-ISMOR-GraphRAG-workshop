The Meiji generation developed a new security paradigm.
Each major conquest began with a surprise attack-on Korea in the First Sino-Japanese War, and Russian interests in Manchuria in the Russo-Japanese War, and throughout the Pacific in World War II.
After winning the first two wars, Japan installed administrative institutions under the Imperial Japanese Army to maintain public order and to extract resources.
It invested heavily in infrastructure, pacification, resource extraction, commercial crop development, and education.
These created a literate population, a superior infrastructure, and rapid economic growth particularly in urban areas.
