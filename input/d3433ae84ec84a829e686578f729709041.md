Russia's military campaigns in the Ukraine and in Crimea are extraordinary examples to study in preparation for future operations in the information domain.
In an effort to use information to discredit and disrupt the 2004 Ukrainian presidential elections Russia employed a "directed chaos" 36 approach using Soviet era active measures to plant and cultivate disinformation depicting unfavorable candidates as fascists, anti-Russians, U.S. puppets, and neo-Nazis.
This use of directed chaos is incredibly effective as it saturates the media and the citizenry with information that requires time to validate.
That time works against the target and slows and or distorts the ability to make informed decisions.
Fundamental to this Russian approach is the deliberate use of denial, disinformation, and deception.
This is an example of where culturally the U.S. and Russia are diametrically opposed in their approach to conflict.
During the invasion of Crimea, Russian military forces surreptitiously crossed onto the peninsula, seized key infrastructure, and shut down media platforms.
Russian forces were reported by the now famous description as polite "Little Green Men."
When publicly asked if they were Russian troops, Vladimir Putin responded, "There are many military uniforms.
You can find them in any shop."
