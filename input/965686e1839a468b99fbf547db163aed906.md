two of the most significant European military powers, will experience a generation-long gap in their combat air capabilities as they bypass fifth-generation capabilities in favor of collaboration on a European future combat air system slated to be completed in the 2040 time frame.
For France, upgrades to the Rafale as well as investment in standoff munitions would still allow it to play a constructive role in the initial phases of a conflict with Russia, particularly if communication systems permitted the platform to be networked with the F-35.
However, this concept would require the French air force to be reliant on targeting and threat data from other European platforms, running somewhat counter to the French inclination toward strategic autonomy.
In light of the prominent French role in previous NATO air operations, additional research and analysis could assess potential trajectories for French strategic and operational leadership within a range of future air conflict scenarios.
