Hybrid warfare is the combination of political and military forms of war to achieve strategic objectives while minimizing the cost and risk associated with a conventional military campaign.
Hybrid warfare by definition does not imply the absence of military force or the use of violence, it requires it.
The projection of offensive power is expensive and politically risky, more so when it comes at the end of a linear increase in hostilities and the victim has time to accurately interpret the aggressor's intent and prepare to resist.
By weakening the Georgian and Ukrainian states' ability to control the entirety of their territories, undermining political, economic and defense development in both countries, and fomenting ethnic divisions, Russia was able to undermine the will and ability of each state to counter Russian aggression before Russia presented a "resolution" of its own design.
When Russia continued to pursue the military aspect of hybrid warfare in eastern Ukraine, Kiev was finally able to mount an effective response.
The result was a bloody contest of attrition where Russia's attempts to maintain some level of deniability constrained its ability to introduce a decisive amount of force.
