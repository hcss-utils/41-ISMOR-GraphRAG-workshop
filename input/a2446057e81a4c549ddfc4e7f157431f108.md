Thus there is a contest of wills between friend and foe during times of war.
One could conclude that the nature of war does not change but consists of four main elements: failure of politics, human dimension, contest of wills, and uncertainty.
However, warfare has evolved over time, and thus changes.
Cyberspace warfare is an example of a new type of warfare.
History has demonstrated that warfare evolves and those who adapted were successful while those who failed to adapt suffered the consequences of defeat.
These historical examples reinforce the notion and potentially project that cyberspace warfare is a new evolution in warfare conducted in, through and from cyberspace having effects in all domains, which will provide an advantage to whoever embraces this concept.
A brief analysis of this historical perspective is relevant to reinforce this point.
Examples from ancient Greece, Prussia, and World War II are illustrated to present cases where innovative leaders adapted and modified their methods to conduct warfare and integrated them into their strategic approach to achieve their desired end states.
