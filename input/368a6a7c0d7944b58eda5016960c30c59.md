In order to determine the capability and effectiveness of the Russian forces, the three largest conventional military operations that the Russian Federation conducted will be examined.
Although smaller Russian incursions in Kosovo and the Tajik civil war influenced Russian military thought and development, they are outside of the scope of this study.
The three identified conflicts encompass a full range of military operations as the Russians faced traditional military forces, militias, and in the case of the first Chechen war a hybrid force.
By dissecting these actions, a determination of a new Russian way of war will be identified.
