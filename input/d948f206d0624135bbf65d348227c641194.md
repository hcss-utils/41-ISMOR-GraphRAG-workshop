When dealing with a nation that is willing and able to conduct limited military incursions, the West must realize where and how Russia could make its next move.
It is highly debated that actions by NATO and its allies after 2008 and 2014-or lack thereof-have emboldened Russia.9 2F 93 The United States and its allies have since taken multiple steps to reprimand Russia by way of sanctions on critical businesses and individuals, providing military equipment to Ukraine, and freezing economic assets of key Russian oligarchs.9 3F 94 Diplomats, scholars, and economists have debated whether this is sufficient to contain or deter Russia, was it too little, or is it justified despite the possibility of escalating the crisis further.
Whichever direction the debate leans, Russia has not conducted similar attacks since 2014, which implies that the sanctions are working as a deterrent.
