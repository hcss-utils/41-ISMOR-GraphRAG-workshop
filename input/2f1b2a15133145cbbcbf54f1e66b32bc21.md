The Russians' view of warfare stemmed from their historical experiences.
In order to understand this particular view of war, one must understand the following factors: the development of operational art after the Russo-Japanese War, the impacts of the Russian experiences in the Second World War, the influences of Russian operations in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the rise of nuclear weapons after World War Two, and the role Marxism-Leninism played in the Russian view of war.
