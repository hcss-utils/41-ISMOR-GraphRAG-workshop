Our concerns are amplified by the fact that the current situation is by no means static.
How the future of nonstrategic nuclear weapons will evolve and the degree to which it may represent an increased or reduced threat are largely unknown.
Nevertheless, at least one development appears predictable: the asymmetry in current stockpile numbers is likely to grow.
Faced with the push of Russian insistence on the withdrawal of all forward-deployed US nonstrategic nuclear weapons and the pull of continuing unilateral drawdown, America could find that a "nuclear zero" might well be a realistic prospect for at least this component of its nuclear arsenal.
