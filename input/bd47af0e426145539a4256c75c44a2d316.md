The Baltic republics, which are presently NATO members, fall under article 4 and 5 of the NATO constitution which provide a protection mechanism in case of aggression against them.
Russia would likely apply tactics towards that region similar to its approaches in Luhansk and Donetsk regions of Donbass, and now in Moldova and elsewhere, rather than openly attacking those countries which might cause a NATO response.
There are significant ethnic Russian or Russian speaking communities in those countries and Russia has historical expertise and relevant socio-cultural aptitude at leveraging them to ignite tension at certain times to meet its geopolitical objectives.
