This cuts several ways.
Were a large war to break out in Europe between NATO and Russia in the near term, NATO would need to be prepared for the Russian SDFO, which accounts for the allocation and employment of Russia's nuclear and long-range conventional weapons and means of electronic attack to generate highly destructive and cascading effects in targeting.
On the other hand, in the near to middle term, Russia is unlikely to embark on a course of action that it does not think it can execute without the use of nuclear weapons against a nuclear peer.
Russia may well be deterred from taking preemptive military action against NATO, in part because of a lack of conventional capacity to-over a sustained period-engage targets throughout the European theater and the U.S. homeland.
As Russian conventional strike capacity grows into the 2030s, NATO will need to continue to evaluate and consider countermeasures to Russia's ability to engage greater numbers of targets with conventional weapons and electronic attack weapons.
