Intelligence agencies and functions play critical roles in several of the political warfare activities described above.
The FSB appears to have a lead role in cyber warfare (discussion with think tank analyst, 2015; Heickero, 2010, p. 4).
Military activities described above, including special reconnaissance, peace support, and military assistance, also depend on the support of the intelligence ser vices.
Indeed, one can think of the spetsnaz-GRU as performing both intelligence and military functions.
Furthermore, reports have been made of intelligence ser vices working closely with proxies, influencing propaganda, and conducting other tactics of political warfare.
In Crimea before the war in Ukraine, for example, Taras Kuzio reports "covert support to separatist, anti-NATO and anti-American groups in the Crimea and Odessa," and notes reports by the Ukrainian National Security and Defence Council about Rus sian intelligence efforts "to discredit the Ukrainian leadership with the aim of reintegrating Ukraine into Russia's sphere of influence"
