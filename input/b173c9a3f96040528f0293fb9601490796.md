The military and security implications of Russian mobilization processes for the United States are numerous and increasingly urgent, given that the tensions between the United States and Russia are likely to remain serious for the foreseeable future, and possibly deteriorate as other disputes (such as that over the U.S. ballistic missile program) compound it over the medium term.
The war in Ukraine has ensured that some of the ramifications are obvious and are already under consideration in the U.S. Army, in the U.S. intelligence community, and more broadly across the body politic.
Senior U.S. military figures have pointed to the potential threat Russia poses to the United States, its interests, and allies.
But as noted above, it becomes increasingly important that this potential threat is understood in more granular terms so that it does not become a self-fulfilling security dilemma; that moves to deter further Russian aggression do not become provocative, resulting in a further escalation of tensions that the United States does not seek or for which the United States is not prepared.
