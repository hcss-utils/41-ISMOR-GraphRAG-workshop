Initially, Russia had various advantages.
The Russian Empire took advantage of China's incapacity to secure Chinese territory by treaty.
By the time of the war, Russia had created a new Russian navy and the Trans-Siberian Railway (begun in 1891), which provided a two-armed pincer surrounding the weakly-held territories of China, Manchuria, and Korea.
But, the Japanese analyzed the operational environment to develop an approach of utilizing the captured rail systems to support a series of tactical actions through the use of the Korean railway network to put considerable pressure on Russian forces.
This allowed Japan to achieve a position of relative advantage.
As the campaign continued, the Russian Army supplies dwindled and the Russian military was faced with a multi-faceted threat and few options at their disposal.
