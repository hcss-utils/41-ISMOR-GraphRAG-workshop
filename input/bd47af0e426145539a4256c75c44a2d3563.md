The clich√©, "perceptions are realities" applies in fullness to this scenario.
Expansion of NATO and the economic pressures of the European Union is a real and perceived threat to a country.
It is also a pressure for Putin as a communist Russian heir, who's accustomed to having compliant buffer states for 100 years.
Putin fears the West's economic bloc will undermine any of their organic revenues, and pressure the regional petrol giant to lower prices and further conform on Euro-terms, rather than Russia's.
A consolidated European military, for example, threatens the already weak Russian MIC.
To the east, in China and beyond, is a full awareness that while China and Asia must deal with Russia, there remains a deep mistrust and disdain.
The clash of cultures could even find other venues, or create new frozen conflicts.
