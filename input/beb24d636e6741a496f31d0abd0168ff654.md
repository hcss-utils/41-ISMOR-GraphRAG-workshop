Russian disinformation efforts in Ukraine started long before the 2014 Maidan movement and the ouster of pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych and his government.
Some themes reiterated in Russian propaganda during the war in the Donbass-for example, that the pro-Western element of Ukraine is made up of fascists-date back at least to the 1990s.
5 Russia's propaganda effort increased in the early 2000s.
In 2004, a contested presidential election-mired in accusations of voter fraud-sparked a series of protests, called the Orange Revolution, and ended Yanukovych's first bid for the presidency in favor of Viktor Yushchenko.
