Although it is possible, again, to interpret this distribution as a reflection of the two campaigns' diverging priorities, another interpretation is that Russia was strategically risk averse (aside from engaging in risky maneuvers for specific tactical purposes).
The VKS's "limited liability, limited risk" approach acknowledged the risks of escalation; the VKS was particularly sensitive to aircrew inexperience and aircraft technical limitations.
Deadly encounters with peer forces, as when a Turkish F-16 shot down a Russian Su-24, led the VKS to make significant adjustments to its operational planning and TTPs, such as deploying advanced S-400 surface-to-air missile systems.
Therefore, the deliberate, sequential nature of Russia's air campaign was plausibly driven by Russia's reluctance to escalate with a peer adversary.
In this view, the deconfliction line was no less important to Russia's ability to adhere to its lean expeditionary approach than it was to the United States, despite Russia's periodic willingness to attempt asymmetric maneuvers against Coalition forces.
