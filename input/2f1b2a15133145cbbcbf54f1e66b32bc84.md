The invasion of Afghanistan provided the Russian military with its first real test of fighting a determined irregular force since its clashes with the guerrilla forces in Ukraine and Lithuania after World War Two.
The mountainous environment of Afghanistan proved to be exceedingly challenging to the Russian forces that were trained and equipped to fight on the steppes of Eastern Europe.
Additionally, the indomitable Afghan opposition forces were more determined to oppose the Russians than the relatively ineffectual Hungarians and Czechoslovakians that the Russians engaged with in the 1950s and 1960s.
Yet, given these apparently obvious differences, the Russia military continued as if their existing military framework accounted for these variances.
This section seeks to discover the reasons behind this phenomenon.
