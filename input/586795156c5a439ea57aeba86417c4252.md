Space is vital to our Nation's security, prosperity, and scientific achievement.
Space-based capabilities are integral to modern life in the United States and around the world and are an indispensable component of U.S. military power.
Ensuring the availability of these capabilities is fundamental to establishing and maintaining military superiority across all domains and to advancing U.S. and global security and economic prosperity.
Space, however, is not a sanctuary from attack and space systems are potential targets at all levels of conflict.
In particular, China and Russia present the greatest strategic threat due to their development, testing, and deployment of counterspace capabilities and their associated military doctrine for employment in conflict extending to space.
China and Russia each have weaponized space as a means to reduce U.S. and allied military effectiveness and challenge our freedom of operation in space.
