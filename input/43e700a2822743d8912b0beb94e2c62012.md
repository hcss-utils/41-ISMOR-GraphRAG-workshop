Operational art evolved with the Industrial Revolution during the American Civil War and the Prussian wars against Austria and France from 1866 to 1871.
Telegraphs enabled Ulysses S. Grant and Helmuth von Moltke to coordinate the movement of their field armies in multiple theaters of operations.
Railroads enabled forces to move rapidly from one theater to another, extending their operational reach.
Technology and mass production improved the lethality of rifles and cannon, strengthening the defense as the stronger form of war.
Nationalism and ideas like freedom, states' rights, and preserving the union of U.S. and German states fueled the intensity of the wars beyond recent precedent.
The origins of the U.S. and German operational art are found in their approaches to solving these problems.
