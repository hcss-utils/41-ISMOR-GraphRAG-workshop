One year would be required to bring the troops up to the standards demanded of conventional war.
A year would be needed to reorganize the army and raise the standards of discipline.
In year two, we could focus on training, resupplying, and armaments.
Makki: Yes.
But after me, they were never able to find another director for the CDD.
They brought in four or five different officers who could not handle the job, so it was rolled into the directorate of training.
I was responsible for military doctrine.
When I came to the directorate, it was chaos.
I found formal military manuals from Russia, America, and Egypt.

The officers in the CDD could not reconcile the differences.
The first thing I did was publish a manual describing our military doctrine.
All other manuals were then written in harmony with this main pamphlet.
I collected concepts from many armies, but we learned toward following American doctrine because we found it to be logical, detailed, and easy to apply.
