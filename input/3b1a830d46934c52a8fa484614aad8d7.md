(You can swallow a rough bone, but once it is embedded in your bowels, it cuts up your guts.) 1    The purpose of this book is to offer a fresh perspective on the various conflicts that have beset Afghanistan from the nineteenth century to the present. The scholarship that exists on the Afghan wars and frontier actions of Pakistan, worthy though it may be, is written almost entirely from a Western viewpoint. It is disappointing to note that, in these Western military histories, Afghans are often deprived of 'agency' and are portrayed as capable only of reacting to external pressures. Even modern accounts have tended to reduce the Afghans to stereotypes and to deprive them of strategic, operational or even tactical initiative. Ironically historical commentators with direct experience of the country were rather more generous, and, it has to be said, that Western Coalition forces operating 'on the ground' in Afghanistan have been acutely aware that the Afghan insurgents exhibit great skill and adaptability in the tactical arena. However, there is also a tendency to gloss over the intrinsic problems faced by Afghan insurgents and to attribute to them capabilities which they do not possess.
This book, part of the Changing Character of War series, represents more than just another military history of the Afghan Wars. It seeks to open a new chapter in the debate about Afghanistan using methodology that not only makes use of several disciplines, but also attempts to reconstruct changing historical encounters with Afghan perspectives. It is not the intention to suggest that the Afghans have a fixed method of fighting, a way of war, that is unchanging through time. Scoured by the strategic shocks of the past, the Afghans are pragmatic and adaptive. It is change, not continuity, that characterizes warfare
x in Afghanistan. Thus, military officers and policy-makers looking for strong lines of continuity from the campaigns the British fought against the Afghans in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in order to grasp lessons that can be applied instantly may be disappointed. This is a history of transformation. That said, there are characteristics of conflict in Afghanistan that endure, not least the difficulties presented by its human and physical geography, and Afghans have often interpreted events through a cultural lens that is distinct from the West, leavened, of course, with that strong sense of pragmatism.
This book has been formulated over many years and after frequent visits to Afghanistan, although I am deeply conscious that, since I am not an Afghan, attempts to reconstruct the Afghan perspective will be seen by some as inherently flawed and distorted. Anthropologists and other scholars will, no doubt, find fault with the methods and the shorthand nature of the terminology used. Space does not permit a full exposition of all the literature, while endless definitions, although useful to the academic scholar, would interrupt the line of argument too frequently. At best, this book is an interpretation which brings a new dimension to the debate about Afghanistan's security. Criticisms of its brevity and assumptions I can leave to others.
I am deeply grateful to a great range of people and institutions for support in producing this book. I have been able to reflect on the work that many scholars, service personnel and policy-makers have brought to the Oxford Changing Character of War programme. Thanks here are due to Professor Hew Strachan, the Chichele Professor in the History of War at All Souls College, Oxford, who directs the programme and never ceases to labour for a greater understanding of war and a more intellectual application of strategy. I am also deeply grateful to Professor Henry Shue, Professor Anne Deighton, Professor Richard Caplan and Dr David Rodin, who have brought their own disciplinary expertise to bear and exposed me to new thinking. This is also true of my other colleagues at Oxford and friends at Cambridge, King's College London, London School of Economics and Exeter, including Professor Judith Brown, Dr John Darwin, Dr Georg Deutsch, Dr Faisal Devji, Dr Adrian Gregory, Professor Chris Bayly, Professor Anatol Lieven, Professor Theo Farrell, Dr Antonio Giustozzi and Professor Jeremy Black. Rodric Braithwaite's Afgantsy came out as I was finishing the chapter on the Soviet War. He has kindly given me permission to use passages he has translated from the Russian and I have drawn on several of his references, for which I am most grateful. I am indebted to the British Army and RUSI for the contacts they have made available and the chance to gain a better insight into recent Western military operations. xi I am deeply grateful to Michael Dwyer for his support in the commissioning and production of this book. There are those in the United States who have contributed to my understanding of Afghanistan, including the War College at Fort Leavenworth, the Tribal Analysis Center, RAND Corporation and friends in Washington DC and Kabul. Special mention must be made of the men and women who work 'on the ground' , including the service personnel of the British and the United States armed forces, government agencies and civilian NGOs; especially those who have made courageous efforts to go and speak with and work amongst the Afghans in the cause of a 'better peace' , like Michael Webb and Rory Brown. They have each given me unprecedented access to their work and to their Afghan interlocutors across the country. Most important are my Afghan friends and colleagues, including Nadir, Latif and Mohammed, the Afghan Army officers who have hosted me on several occasions, and all the Afghans who endure the current conflict with great stoicism but still make time for warm hospitality to foreign visitors. The North West Frontier Province The difficulty in defeating the neo-Taliban insurgency has compelled the Western armed forces to investigate the socio-cultural aspects of their adversaries, and to look deeply into the British and Soviet historical experience of fighting the Afghans.

The literature on the existence and influence of a 'way of war' , or 'military culture' as it is now known, has grown rapidly.

The Western world's view of the Afghans and the adjacent Pashtuns of the Khyber Pakhtunkwa (North West Frontier Province) of Pakistan draws on a legacy of half-understood and often misconceived ideas from a long period of colonial contact, and distant memories of the Mujahideen struggle against Soviet occupation in the 1980s. Since 2001, a variety of interpretations have been offered on Afghanistan's history: from academic studies that often combine anthropological fieldwork and observations on the Western military intervention in the country, through political commentaries and media reports, to the emotional reactions of the Afghan and Pashtun diaspora. Given the centrality of current political and military interest in the Afghans and Pakistan's Pashtuns, this particular field of history not only has contemporary resonance, but is also much contested. History is used to reinforce particular agendas and score moral points either in favour of continued intervention, or against it.
This introductory chapter seeks to offer a framework to examine an Afghan way of war, with explanations of the approaches taken to the subject and the problems that have evolved. It illustrates the varieties of history that have emerged, some of the reasons that lie behind different interpretations, and attempts to uncover why particular myths about the Afghan and Pashtun way of fighting have proved so enduring. In this, we owe a great debt to Patrick Porter whose Military Orientalism pointed to a predilection to stereotyping in the Western episteme which is so pervasive as to threaten to prevent accurate judgements being made in the policy sphere.

There are some distinctive trends in the way that the Western world wrote about the nature of Afghan and Pashtun society and about British and Soviet encounters with the Afghans and Pashtuns, which have an important bearing on the descriptions of the Afghan way of war. In many cases, British views of the Afghans and Pashtuns actually tell us more about the British than they do about the Afghans and Pashtuns themselves. Soviet interpretations, so often filtered through the lens of communist ideology and the anxieties of the Cold War, suffered from a similar form of partiality. By examining the Afghan approach to war more critically, we may understand more clearly why, for exam-ple, the West believed the Afghans were 'natural guerrilla fighters' , why occupations in the modern era were short-lived, or why recruitment drives by foreigners so often ended in failure. In addition, narratives of Afghan civil wars can help fill the gaps in our understanding of the Afghan way of war.
The purpose of this book is to provide an historical assessment of the changing character of warfare in Afghanistan and to review some of the long-held assumptions about the Afghans as fighters. In recent operations, Western forces have tried to 'win hearts and minds' , that is, to influence the way that Afghans think and behave. There has been a desire to isolate the insurgents of Afghanistan from the rest of the population. To access the 'Afghan mind' , policy-makers have turned to academics and specialists to provide answers that can be translated directly into practice. While some anthropologists have rejected the 'unethical taint' of collaboration with military personnel, others have provided detailed support not only from Europe, but also in Afghanistan and Pakistan on the basis that ignorance amongst Western policy-makers is far more lethal to the Afghans than trying to assert the moral high ground.
Despite the current interest in the conflict in Afghanistan and some remarks pertaining to it, this book takes a longer, historical view and cannot be considered a policy guide. Afghanistan in the early twenty-first century is experiencing rapid change. It is subjected to a variety of new ideologies, the interests of neighbouring states, and the bewildering speed and accessibility of new information technologies. Each of these is being harnessed by different generations and communities in Afghanistan, and few can predict, long-term, where this is taking the country. Equally, after thirty years of civil war, with its infrastructure ruined and its economy still feeble, many Afghans have experienced a collective trauma that is likely to have profound repercussions. In essence, war has shaped Afghanistan in a very comprehensive way, Afghanistan's recent transformation is rendering many old certainties redundant and this book can only attempt to begin to understand that effect.
This chapter is structured in three parts. The first is an examination of the problem of a 'way of war' , including a brief discussion of the historiography and conceptual framework, the place of Islam as a mobilizing force in Afghan warfare, the nature of civil war, the question of ethnic warfare and the relative importance of negotiations in war. The second part of the chapter offers a brief overview of the existing histories of war in Afghanistan, particularly those of the Afghans, British and Soviets. The third and final part deals with methods and approaches, indicating that each comes with its own problems and flaws. With these caveats and parameters outlined, navigation of the rest of the book will, hopefully, be much easier.
The phrase 'a way of war' was coined by the British historian and former soldier Basil Liddell Hart at a lecture at RUSI in 1931 to describe a deep-seated British preference for the 'indirect approach' through armoured doctrine or other technologies, or naval and expeditionary warfare, rather than continental alliances and commitments.

Defeats and strategic shocks have been capable of altering apparent 'ways of war' , or perhaps reaffirming a preference from which there had been a deviation, as in the case of Liddell Hart's original analysis.

One of the few constants in Afghanistan's situation is its geography. Terrain, climate and distance have imposed considerable limitations on the conduct of war in the region.

There is no theological basis for an 'offensive Jihad' in modern Islamic scholarship, although there are vestiges in historical tracts. Much of what contemporary internationalist Jihadists claim to be the 'true faith' is in fact a false and manipulated version of Islam. 
35
Jihad, strictly defined, has two aspects. It is a daily personal struggle to live out one's faith, al-jihad fi sabil Allah (striving in the way of Allah). It is also the defence and obligation to protect the people (Muslims), and Islam itself (its culture, integrity and 'purity'). Jihad is subject to qualification and limitation including concepts of proportionality, self-defence, last resort, necessity, collateral damage, manslaughter, discrimination and pure intention. The 'offen-sive Jihad' is a reinvention of a concept, based on a crudely selective reading of history, which suggests one has to defeat or convert the unenlightened or heretical in a war, or even simply to wage total war as the means to arrest the overbearing power of the West. Despite the absence of any single head or authority of Islam, a process of precedence and scholarly debate has determined the 'right path' in defining Jihad. Nevertheless, from the beginning of Islamic history there have been bitter divisions and even civil wars over what constitutes the right direction, including the great Shia-Sunni schism. Islamic scholars and teachers (ulema) exercise varying degrees of authority based on decades of study, and they constantly reinterpret Islam in light of new situations. While very few have the authority to issue fatwas to initiate Jihad, the desire to defend the faith is a widespread and pragmatic reaction to events.
Interpretations and justifications for Jihad are particularly revealing and indicate how Muslims can be mobilized. 
36
There is a long-standing dispute in Islamic jurisprudence over fard al-kifaya (collective obligation) to wage Jihad and fard al-ayn (individual duty) to carry out Islamic responsibilities. For those distant from a conflict, Islamic scholars indicate that fard al-ayn only applies if the local Muslims require assistance and have not enough men, or power, to expel an invasion of Muslim territory. 
37
For modern Jihadists, training is an alternative obligation, hence the willingness of some Muslims resident in the West to make visits to training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and their expressions of a readiness to serve when called. They cite the Qur'an: 'And prepare against them whatever you are able and with steeds of war…' 
38
While Islam is predicated on the idea of achieving salama (peace) through the submission to the will of Allah, in the contested lands of Afghanistan it has often seemed that such noble injunctions are ignored. Cosmic Dualism is central to Islam and, given its position amongst believers as the 'final revelation' , the defence of the faith is seen as particularly critical. There are several types of threat, and a permanent occupation, erosive interaction and constant contact with non-Islamic ideas and practices would increase the level of these significantly. 
39
40
At the higher level, war, rather than communal infighting, was only justified if it was to defend Islam as a harb al-Muqadis or ghaza ('holy war'). Failure to adhere to the ethical code of Islam in this struggle would mean that an individual or a community could face judgement, for the Qur'an states: 'Those who believe fight in the way of Allah, and those who disbelieve fight in the way of Shaitan' . 
41
42
Ghaza (holy war) was probably conceived in the earliest Muslim conquests, but certainly can be traced to written records as early as AD 983 (361 AH) and the catechism written by Abu al-Layth al-Samarkandi. 
43
Yet, for all the neat academic interpretations, the reality on the frontiers of the Islamic world was different. Faced with numerous and committed enemies, Muslim polities had to fight for their survival and aggrandizement with the rules of realpolitik rather than jurisprudence. In the Ottoman context, the concept of ghaza was co-opted to provide legitimacy for heroic but arbitrary military leadership, or to justify the prosaic acquisition of land, property and loot.

Islam has been an important cultural lens for Afghans' perceptions of and approaches to warfare. The concept of Jihad, the struggle to protect the faith, has been deeply enmeshed with a desire, particularly in rural areas, to preserve a way of life from outsiders or alien contaminants. Islam also emphasizes a sense of obligation that lends itself to military service, and this too is reinforced amongst rural communities with obligations to protect and serve one's family, clan or qawm. The more ecstatic forms of Islam, heightened in times of crisis, have sometimes corresponded with and strengthened support for charismatic leaders, while clan cultures celebrate acts of heroism. Equally, Islam has provided the framework for negotiation and restoring peace, and the rural mullahs were often the individuals who acted as intermediaries in inter-clan disputes. Rural clans stressed the pragmatism of survival which could, at times of extreme scarcity, take a ruthless form. Islam could act to temper violence but also provide the legitimacy and regulatory element for it under particular circumstances.
Curiously, the notion of a 'way of war' is not normally applied to civil war in the way that it is for conventional wars between states, although it is sometimes attributed to a category of warfare in wars of liberation. This inconsistency reflects a disciplinary preference for the study of state-on-state conflicts in international relations and to some extent in military history too. To explain repeated episodes of civil war, or the ethnic nature of conflicts in Afghanistan, sociologists, anthropologists and political scientists emphasize comparable behavioural traits and practices, whereas historians tend to look for empirical explanations through the specificities and contingencies of events and evidence. For social scientists that align themselves to 'primordialist' explanations, the focus is on traditions and beliefs that are antagonistic towards 'primordial objects' , the biological features of a group or their territorial location.

James Fearon and David Laitin argue that conflicts that appear to be 'ethnic' are in fact driven by other conditions: political instability, weak governance, economic inequality and structural conflicts that can be traced back into the past.

Nineteenth-century ethnologists, British colonial officials and, subsequently, historians have attributed the ancestry of the Afghans, and particularly the Pashtuns, variously to Alexander's Greeks, the Scythians and White Huns, the 'lost tribes' of Israel, Turks, Aryans, and vaguely-defined 'aboriginal populations' .

Afghanistan came into being as the territory between the British, Russian and Persian Empires, continuing its historical role as a crossroads between Central and South Asia. Afghanistan had been a 'highway of conquest' from at least the fourth century BC, and, despite the frequent reference to Afghanistan's recent reputation as a 'graveyard of empires' , historically it was Afghanistan that was repeatedly overrun and occupied because of the fragmented and weakened nature of its political organisation. 
59
Under the idealized version of the tribal code of Pashtunwali, a Pashtun will shelter, defend to the death, and offer generous hospitality to a stranger (melmastia), including an enemy who has become a fugitive (nanawatai). Charles Lindholm argued that this was due to a deep emotional need for an expression of love in a competitive, violent and barbarous society. 
60
Afghan Pashtuns were not entirely anarchic, forming alliances through marriage and relations in order to increase military power and deter rivals. However, once the qawm, or descent-locality group, reached a size likely to threaten the available resources, then suspicion and anxiety increased and served to undermine the very alliance to which a family or an individual might belong. Pashtuns valued the idealism of gheryatmun (courageous independence), rendering qawm alliances inherently temporary, unstable, and liable to disinte-gration. Solidarity to groups external to one's qawm were normally despised, but could be arranged for convenience or necessity. However, such a relationship would be even more temporary, lacking the solidarity that would be required to form a permanent bond of trust. The Pashtun needed to engage in alliances that were convenient but avoid military obligations that might incur his or his family's destruction. This helps to explain the fluidity of Afghans on the battlefield, rushing to assist another clan in the hope of spoils or an alliance, but equally quick to retreat and disperse if the engagement turned unfavourably against them. This dichotomy of engagement and independence can be expressed as atrapi-y (an Arabic term for 'freedom in all directions'). 
61
62
Ethno-nationalist mobilization and contestation are macrohistorical processes that operate over both short and long time spans. It may take decades until perceived humiliation and unfair ethnic status hierarchies give rise to political mobilization and conflict. Thus, rather than being an instant and ahistorical phenomenon, nationalist mobilization takes place in a historical context that might be characterized by previous episodes of ethno-nationalist violence. In extreme cases of path dependency, actors may find themselves trapped in self-sustaining cycles of violence. 
63
64
prior exposure to combat means that violence is no longer unthinkable but constitutes part of the accepted repertoire of action and may help create organizational structures and identities that can be reactivated at later points in history or even create a culture of violence. We express these three mechanisms of path dependency in our third main hypothesis. 
65
It has long been recognized that negotiation has been a constant feature of conflict, during the fighting as much as it is at the conclusion, and, according to British and Soviet accounts, this was certainly the case throughout Afghanistan's modern history. When there is an asymmetry of historical records from which to work, as is the case with the relative abundance of British and Soviet sources compared with the relative paucity of Afghan ones, an understanding of the processes can help to establish a baseline of types of negotiation, practices, assumptions, calculations and outcomes. Existing theoretical models give us frameworks that can be applied across a number of episodes in Afghan history, and they lend themselves particularly well to comparative work. Theoretical approaches also enable scholars to identify specific themes and test them against quite distinct historical eras, and make it possible to begin to analyze the decision-making of Afghans where we have relatively few written records. Five stages emerge as particularly useful: one, the decision to negotiate; two, the conditions prevailing (whether one side perceived imminent defeat or victory, for example); three, the terms proffered and the process of negotiation; four, the implementation of those terms and, finally, the perceived or desired outcomes.
One feature common to the Afghan conflicts is the fact that Afghans were forced to negotiate amongst themselves, across traditional lines of social and ethnic division as much, if not more than with the foreigners who had occupied their territorial space. Moreover, it is clear that negotiations with foreigners did not end the conflicts of interest between Afghans, and civil wars were the frequent result. Afghan groups were divided by collaboration and resistance, while some tried to utilize the presence of foreigners to manipulate their military power or to exploit the withdrawal of occupiers to reinforce their own prestige.
There are four main themes common to Afghan conflicts which are given treatment here, but several other observations can be made. First, both the Afghans and their Western adversaries knew that it was better to negotiate from a position of strength. This challenges the popular idea that belligerents are more likely to initiate negotiations when there is a stalemate or an impasse, perhaps of some duration. In the First Afghan War in the winter of 1841, when a British garrison at Kabul had been isolated and cut off from its supplies, and its main negotiators, Alexander Burnes and William Hay MacNaghten, had been killed, the Afghans were prepared to discuss terms with the British for a time, until the imminent collapse of the retreating British forces tempted local Ghilzai clans to kill and loot at will. Equally, Soviet authorities delayed negotiations for some time in the mid 1980s, believing that a more vigorous prosecution of the war would enable them to 'break clean' . 
66
Second, violence is often a form of negotiation. That is not to say that violence is used only as a selective device to 'up the ante' once negotiations have begun, and thereby to improve a bargaining position tactically, but rather that violence is a form of communication with another identifiable group. In a recent lecture, Mary Kaldor noted how violence was reciprocal and that in war both parties tended to develop a dynamic of dependency at least in rationalizing their actions. 
67

Third, negotiating a truce or ceasefire can be a pragmatic means of escape from defeat or the method by which a belligerent can achieve their aims by means other than fighting. There are clear examples of this occurring in the Afghan context. Abdur Rahman, as a pretender to the Afghan throne in 1880, had not the means to defeat the British Army which was in occupation at Kabul. Instead, while protected by the Hindu Kush mountain range, he negotiated with the British to become Amir in return for concessions over Afghan foreign policy. In a contrasting example, the warlord leader Ahmad Shah Masoud settled a truce with the Soviets in order to relieve pressure on his guerrilla forces in the Panjshir Valley in the mid 1980s and as a means to 'break out' to more secure base areas in the north-east. His manoeuvre, while not without controversy, was a success, enabling him to resume resistance later on more favourable terms.
The fourth major theme for negotiation appears to be the need to find a surrogate. Both the British and the Soviets were prepared to negotiate with their enemies and the local powerbrokers to form and leave behind a government favourable to their own interests. In the case of the British in 1842, they accepted the return of Amir Dost Mohammed as the figure most likely to guarantee stability on the western flank of their growing Indian Empire. In 1880, they accepted Abdur Rahman as a ruler likely to keep Russian interests out of Afghanistan. Both of these Afghan leaders saw advantage in negotiating directly with the British, but also making use of the presence of Russia, as the means to wring concessions from the government in Calcutta or London. For the Soviets, the appointment of Dr Najibullah as a candidate likely to serve their interests but also be acceptable to the Afghan people appeared to be the means to ensure a strategic victory. 
71
Many studies emphasize the importance of 'ground conditions' as the determining factor for negotiations to begin. This can be a rational decision of costbenefit analysis, where the time, cost, chances of victory, likely pay-offs, resources remaining, degree of external support and the level of pressure from a domestic population wearied by war may have a part to play. The ground conditions can produce a 'balance of power' , or a stalemate which, George Modelski argued, is probably the key factor in creating the environment for negotiation. 
72
The willingness to seek to resolve conflict through bargaining is seen by some scholars as more significant than ground conditions, and can explain why the decision to negotiate is taken when military victory is imminent. It is thought that the identity of the combatants (which includes their values and ideologies), the divisibility of the stakes (whether there are sufficient spoils to divide, for example), and the presence of external third parties can determine the initiation of negotiations. When ideological convictions preclude concessions, then negotiations will fail, just as they will when the demands imposed by one belligerent are impossible to fulfil, or when one side prefers to pursue a path to absolute military victory. The aims of revolutionaries, which are predicated on the overthrow of a regime, are unlikely to permit negotiation, which contrasts with separatists or those seeking moderate reform that may be prepared to accept a compromise. Popular clan revolts against British occupation in 1841 and 1879 would exemplify the former, while the cooperation and collaboration of certain Khans, such as the Khan of Kelat in 1880, eager to preserve their position and faced with overwhelming force, illustrates the latter.
The presence of a third party to push for negotiations and monitor the implementation of terms is regarded as a key factor in the lasting success of any settlement, although even then, as Barbara Walter observed, almost two-thirds of negotiations in civil wars fail. 
73
74
However, military intervention to forestall civil war, as in the Soviet case in 1979, adds a new variable of violence and does not guarantee peace. The Soviets became the target of violence and actually united previously warring factions against them. Nevertheless, Walter argues that the ground conditions are not the determinant in the decision to negotiate. She believes that security guarantees, for which third parties are essential, are critical to the success or failure of any negotiations. Walter's 'Credible Commitment' thesis suggests that negotiations require more than the resolution of underlying grievances to succeed at all. Ceasefires may fail, for example, but negotiations can still work if the protagonists feel that their goals can be fulfilled and that their own personnel can be protected as they make the transition to peace. Confidencebuilding measures, such as verification, monitoring and security, are vital to success. Interventions to impose a negotiated settlement, and the deployment of peacekeepers after a settlement, may not guarantee success. It will invariably depend on the local situation whether full military interventions (such as Afghanistan in 2001 to the present) are effective.
There is a vast amount of material by British writers on the Afghans. This collection of travelogues, official literature and academic work is characterized by a desire to describe the history, geography, ethnography and politics of Afghanistan, and, above all, the behaviour, culture and habits of the people. Some, like Mountstuart Elphinstone, the first British envoy to Kabul in 1808, sought to understand the Afghans sympathetically, but amongst the others, the Political Agent Alexander Burnes was more instrumentalist in his assessments and manipulated or selected what he observed in order to concentrate minds at home or directly alter British policy. British views of the Afghans were made in relation to their own experiences and in comparison to British rule in India. Elphinstone noted that the Afghans were 'decently attired' and not 'half-naked' like the Indians.

The English traveller from India-would admire their strong and active forms, their fair complexions and European features, their industry and enterprise, the hospitality, sobriety and contempt for pleasure which appear in all their habits; and, above all, the independence and energy of their character-On the whole, his impression of his new acquaintance would be favourable-he would reckon them virtuous, compared with the people to whom he had been accustomed.

There was rather less appreciation by the British of the effect of the environment on their views of the Afghans, although they were often given to describing the 'wild landscape' and relate this to the 'wildness' of Afghans. Given the mountainous nature of much of Afghanistan, the population had been confined to marginal terrain and ribbons of cultivable settlement. The heavy winter snows cut off Afghanistan's passes and restricted access for caravan traffic, leaving the people isolated. The presence of neighbouring states and empires, including the Persians, Sikhs, Russians and British, hemmed in the population, and eventually political divisions carved away portions of the country, adding to the natural divisions created by mountain systems and distance. Although the British saw the Afghans and the Pashtuns as frontier peoples in relative poverty, the Afghans regarded themselves as survivors, dependent on subsistence agriculture, transit tolls, raiding and smuggling. These economic activi-ties coloured British views of the Afghans and Pashtuns as a whole. Bellew concluded that the Afghans were: 'a race of robbers, … quarrelsome, … faithless and intractable without appreciating their situation' .
These critical perspectives became more prevalent after military setbacks in the nineteenth century and as more rigid views of South and Central Asians took hold. Racial interpretations and a frustration with the continued resistance of the Afghans and Pashtuns meant they were condemned as fanatics, given to irrational beliefs. British observers pointed to the endemic violence of Afghan society as evidence of their lawlessness. Yet while Pashtuns seemed so irreconcilable, the concept of martial races more suited to service in the Indian Army gained greater purchase; a number of Pashtuns were enlisted in frontier formations and line regiments because of their martial qualities as warriors. Pashtuns were especially admired for their 'strong, self-sufficient' attributes. The British tended to see the Afghans and the Pashtuns as a collection of tribes readily suited to military service, but the concept of the 'noble savage' espoused by Rousseau in the eighteenth century had been replaced, by the late nineteenth century, with more negative connotations. British officers noted that Pashtun soldiers were often divided by clan rivalries and family feuds that spilled over from their home life, or indeed, were a consequence of their military service. This gave the impression that Pashtun soldiers were unreliable when, in fact, their first loyalty was to their family and qawm, and not to the mercenary service with the British. The British Indian Army tried to circumvent local rivalries by grouping personnel into specific frontier corps, companies or regiments, and Political Officers were despatched to work with specific sections, but they never overcame the first loyalties of the Pashtuns they employed.

To some extent, the contradictory nature of British impressions of the Afghans and Pashtuns stemmed from the many shifts in frontier policy from 1849 to 1947 as they attempted to manage, manipulate and manoeuvre the Pashtuns. 
86
87
Soviet knowledge of the Afghans was, to some extent, better than the Western agencies of the twenty-first century because there had been a period of cooperation for almost two decades before the war of 1979. The resistance fighters came to be known as dhukis (ghosts) because they were so unknown and elusive, but, despite the general familiarity with the country, many Soviet soldiers regarded the Afghans with contempt. There were episodes where Soviet troops would fire on Afghan communist soldiers, and vice versa, and the history of the war is littered with accounts of atrocities. 
88

Misunderstandings have characterised Afghan perceptions too. Afghan histories, both oral and written, have tended to reflect a political purpose, either reinforcing genealogical achievements of particular clans or nationalist values. Louis Dupree embraced oral traditions to glimpse an Afghan world view and the values that supported it, and discovered how the memories of the three Anglo-Afghan Wars were used to reinforce a sense of clan identity. 
91
The holy war began. A real hot war. Then the British appealed for another jirga and asked permission to leave and give up Afghanistan. They said … We must decide who will be king of the Afghans. And that will be Abdur Rahman Khan, son of Amir Afzal, who was living in Moscow … The British left Kabul and the Afghan patriots chased them. Wherever the British camped the ghazis were after them… when the British entered the Khord Kabul Valley, the Afghans shouted and began the battle. The British troops lost many of their people. Some were killed by the water, some by swords, some by guns, but all by the hand of Allah. The ghazis had flintlocks, some breechloaders. Hour by hour the British received losses… only three, four or five got back to their homeland.

James Belich's study of the New Zealand Wars provides us with a possible framework to recover the Afghan and Pashtun perspectives in the British campaigns along the frontier and in Afghanistan, of various factions in the civil wars (as reported and recorded by Afghans and British personnel in Western records) and of Afghan operations against the Soviets without the loss of objectivity.

The problem of interpreting the actions of those who fought the colonial powers, but who have few or no written records, has led in recent years to greater interest in oral tradition. This has its merits, of course, but historians remain sceptical of its value, especially when events experienced by people several generations ago are collected. 
100
Post-colonial scholars have also attempted to recover the 'silenced subalterns' of empire by offering their own interpretations which strip away Western assumptions, conceptions and an emphasis on the rulers. Ranajit Guha's introduction to the first volume of Subaltern Studies criticized the emphasis of 'elitist histories' of the intelligentsia and denounced the idea that the masses had responded along 'vertical lines' of command rather than possessing any agency of their own. 101 Certainly it would seem sensible to assess the degree to which the highly democratized and fragmented Pashtun groups acted inde-pendently of their 'leaders' , but equally, it would be just as crucial to keep in mind the part played by charismatic leadership, not least from influential religious figures, as well as the influence of khans, elders and chieftains of non-Pashtun Afghans.
Some more recent post-colonial scholars are so concerned to remove the 'taint of colonialism' in their analyses that they have suggested that a bricolage of myth and memory should take the place of 'empiricism' as the history of those peoples as they see it. Edward Said pointed to European constructions of the Asians which were so pervasive as to render them subordinate, and it was evident that he railed against the racist stereotypes of the colonial era that had, unwittingly or not, continued into modern analyses. 102 Critics of Said's work demonstrated that there were several flaws in his polemic, and the very existence of the Pashtun resistance, spread over many decades, suggests that, for all the ideological justifications the British or Soviets invented, there was no question of this being a substitute for exercising power or actual occupation.

There are some fragments of written testimony which, rather like the Western historian of the medieval period, one must piece together carefully. It is clear from the letters of leading Afghan and Pashtun participants which do survive that, as so often in history, it is not so much what happened as what people believed was happening which determined their decisions. A letter from Kazi Mira Khan (representing the Adam Khel Afridis' Jirga) to Mullah Said Akbar of the Aka Khel clan on 28 th Jamadi-ul-Awal 1315AH (25 October 1897) on the British side of the Durand Line referred to reports that had come via Kabul to the effect that Aden, the British coaling station, and the Suez Canal had been seized by the Ottoman Sultan. This meant that it would take the British 'six months to send reinforcements to India' . The letter continued:
The Sultan, the Germans, the Russians and the French are all in arms against the British at all seaports and fighting is going on in Egypt too against them. In short the British are disheartened nowadays-British troops are required in Egypt and other seaports.-In the case of the Mohmands and the peoples of Ghandab, who had killed ten thousand British troops and had inflicted a heavy loss of rifles and property on them, the British, in their great dismay, concluded a settlement with them for 24 rifles only-when the British get rid of their other difficulties they will turn back and demand from the Mohmands their remaining rifles and compensation for their losses,-I have thus informed you of the deeds and perplexities of the English. 
105
We should also consider the approaches of other disciplines that can help to illuminate the Afghan decision-making. Political anthropology, for example, examines both power and culture, and the role played by ideology, symbols and organizations, particularly during conflicts. Comaroff and Comaroff argue that it is not just the narrative of decisions which emerges from the participants that matters, but also the context of that narrative. 
106
108
David Edwards' study of the Pashtuns during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s suggested a far more selective use of the Afghan behavioural codes, warning us to be circumspect about the creation of some over-arching hypothesis.

The notion of a dynamic tribal culture certainly appears to offer a far more satisfactory historical explanation for the actions of the clans of Afghanistan and the North West Frontier. The idea of a dynamic within tribal society continues to be the case in Pashtun-dominated regions of Afghanistan, even where decades of civil war have sliced through and disrupted older hierarchies, social and political jurisdictions, and land claims.
However, there is another caveat. Decisions and actions were not only the result of dynamics within tribal societies, but also of reactions to external influences. Unity could be forged by an alien threat. Language, a segmentary structure and acephalous organization, endogamous marriage rules and egalitarianism could all help the coherence of the tribes in the sense that they all understood and endorsed a particular way of life and defined themselves with reference to the difference of outsiders. Moreover, groups and families made frequent reference to a patrilinear descent using the suffix of zai (family) or khel (clan) to identify themselves. The oldest groups might be able to trace their ancestry back generations, and these connections could form the basis of a temporary alliance, but equally clan identities could be changed for survival or convenience. The parajamba (taking sides) in disputes within Pashtun society might involve a calculation of one's proximity, from a lineage point of view, to the protagonists. The process was so common that it was termed tarburwali (conflict between first cousins). One British officer recalled how shooting could break out within a village, but after a few had been killed or wounded and the ammunition exhausted, 'a quarrel could be settled by an interchange of marriages 
' . 112
Historically, particular aspects of the Pashtun code do appear to have been influential in fighting. The key issue for the Pashtuns of the frontier region in the late nineteenth century, for example, was that the occupation of any of their lands constituted a direct threat to their way of life, and they believed that the British had deliberately and consistently eroded their honour. For generations after the Pashtuns had occupied the mountain region of the Suleiman range, this marginal land was periodically redistributed to the daftari (shareholders) in a process known as wesh. Considerable tracts were sometimes exchanged, requiring some nomadism between sections. The exchange of land also served to reinforce the pashtunwali code, since it ensured that each tribes-man had the means, along with women and weapons, to sustain his personal honour. 
113
114
For the British trying to control the frontier, it made sense to create a landowning class to provide a leadership to do business with and to lead the tribesmen into less 'criminal' activity. Settled and wealthy landowners had a stake in the Raj and shared its interests in terms of stability and order. Smaller landowners, who aspired to share the prestige of the larger landowners, also collaborated willingly. When faced by feuding and raids, the British put pressure on the jirgas of the Settled Districts to produce far more draconian and punitive sentences than the traditional, more ambiguous assemblies had done. An increase in population put more pressure on the land, whilst rising rents and prices towards the end of the century increased the tension between families and clans, and increased disaffection with British influence. There was still more anger at the British habit of paying 'political pensions' for the continued loyalty of certain landowners. Both the British and these 'sub-imperialists' assumed they could exercise some control over the clans of the settled areas. In the remote areas, Political Agents were despatched to create communication channels and to exercise some supervision, but, whilst these agents were generally treated with respect, they nevertheless represented another step towards direct colonial rule. The result was armed resistance. This desire to protect the land and way of life was perhaps typical of the Afghan situation.
This book attempts to examine the Afghan 'way of war' , reflecting on the ways in which Afghans could define victory, conceive of strategy, carry out operational planning and execute those plans during campaigns. It evaluates force structures, troop types and tactical evolutions. It attempts to show strategic preferences that occurred under particular circumstances. However, the emphasis is on change over continuity. It attempts to explain how motivation changed, showing how the emergence of ideologies subverted traditional allegiances based on dynasts and qawm. It illustrates the problem of disunity, clan dynamics, the values and ethos that affected decision-making, and the role of the ulema. There is a brief overview of how negotiations, alliances and coalitions were undertaken during conflicts in Afghanistan.
The book is not limited to Afghan conflicts against foreign interventions; episodes of civil war are included. However, a limitation on the available space has meant that the book is necessarily selective. It has not been possible to include the fighting in the border areas of Pakistan since 2001 and many of the minor conflicts of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. However, readers should understand that the aim is to illustrate through examples rather than offer a definitive history that lists every encounter. The key point is that there was no single Afghan way of war in the country's history. Every response has been dependent on the situation that confronted the Afghans, and it is hoped that the number and breadth of examples will be sufficient to demonstrate that process of change.
Having set out some of the problems and framework, the second section of this book tackles three particular and inter-related themes concerned with British attempts to manage, manipulate and manoeuvre the Afghans and frontier Pashtuns from 1849 to 1947. Willing to sustain the costs of permanent occupation, the British instead rendered Afghanistan into a client, buffer state, whilst weakening the Pashtuns on their immediate frontier with punitive military expeditions, boundary demarcation and the deployment of Political Officers. The British learned that it was more effective to work through the social networks which characterized Pashtun society. The British came to appreciate that negotiation, was an integral part of Pashtun culture. They also looked to recruit the 'martial races' of the frontier into the Indian Army and local corps, as a solution to the security threat the Pashtuns posed to the British settled border areas. It is clear that employment and negotiation with tribal leaders proved to be more lasting solutions than punitive military operations. This section also examines how the Afghans and Pashtuns reacted to these British efforts.
The third section of this book offers chapters on the period of civil war, including the unrest in 1978, Soviet intervention, the insurgency against the communist government, the post-Soviet civil war and the emergence of the Taliban. The final chapter brings the past into the present to show how historical perceptions and myths cloud Western analyses of the Afghans and Pashtuns and how this has led to misconceptions in Western military operations since 2001. To achieve a victory in counterinsurgency, the Coalition powers believe that they require a thorough understanding of the Afghans, to exploit weaknesses and divisions in order to drive a wedge between the population and the insurgents, to recruit a robust Afghan National Security Force, to encourage a democratic ethos in order to establish effective governance, and to 'win hearts and minds' through the protection of the population. 
115
In the light of these initial reflections, some questions might now be posed: Are we any nearer understanding Afghans and the manner in which they waged war in the past? Can historical assessments be re-applied to the present? Are cultural analyses mere academic exercises that lack empirical foundation, but which serve the purpose of reassuring the hubris of the academy that it somehow 'understands' while practitioners do not? The current state of the literature resembles a minefield of stereotypes, fragments of empiricism, and shards of constructed knowledge, all liable to explode if mishandled or inadvertently trodden on. Different disciplines approach the subject with their particular methods and assumptions, and this work, a practical military history, is perhaps as guilty as any other of this charge. As Patrick Porter has pointed out in Military Orientalism, the West is prone to construct curious caricatures about its Asian adversaries. This book challenges stereotypes whilst trying to avoid creating new ones. It seeks to make a contribution to the scholarship and to provoke thought as to the methods by which we recapture the manner and purpose of those who fought. It will, I hope, cause us to rethink the British and Soviet accounts of the Afghans at war and appreciate the determination and courage of the Afghans as a whole. It may perhaps even provoke more research into the military histories on Afghanistan written by westerners over the last two hundred years. However, my hope is that this will drive us all to recover Afghan perspectives about the history of war in the region. I also believe that a better understanding of the record of Afghans at war actually shows that British and Soviet efforts were more remarkable than is usually acknowledged. This study may enable us to accord them the respect they deserve.
The conclusion thus draws together the various themes, showing, through more recent historiography, how enduring misconceptions obscured some fundamental elements of Afghanistan at war and relations between the Afghans and their adversaries. Western observations, working through Afghan interpretations, the distinctive circumstances and character of warfare, and changing Afghan approaches to making war all feature in the concluding argument, which is, specifically, that the British, Soviets and Americans often did not understand the Afghans and saw a people that threw their own reflections into sharper relief; that working with the 'grain' of Afghan society and negotiating have proved as effective in the past as waging war, although coercion and negotiation are themselves tools of power amongst Afghans; and finally, that the recent Western approaches in Afghanistan have required a significant shift to produce the strategic effects the West desired.
In the thirty years before British military intervention in Afghanistan, there had been a steady erosion of the strength of the first modern Afghan emirate. The territorial expansion of Ahmad Shah Durrani, the 'founder' of Afghanistan, proved to be an illusion of success. Indeed, even before his death in 1772, lands on the peripheries were restive and rejected Ahmad Shah's authority. When he died there was no obvious successor, which meant that fratricidal warfare between his heirs broke out around the country. The succession of pretenders and usurpers undermined the legitimacy and authority of the institution of monarchy, and contributed to the heightened sense of rivalry between qawms and regions. At one point, violent Shia-Sunni sectarianism erupted in Kabul, while Durrani factionalism, and conflict between Durranis and Ghilzais, weakened the nascent polity of Afghanistan still further. More remote communities were nevertheless largely unaffected by dynastic struggles, while regions on the northern periphery were governed independently by 'warlord' figures, or chieftains, who ruled without penalties or fear of retribution. It was against this background of political instability and regional division that the British formed their initial judgements about Afghanistan and its peoples, and, in turn, formulated their policies.
The Durrani empire was built on the successes of its army and not its administration. Ahmad Shah himself admitted to his treasurer in 1751 that this was, in effect, a military state that depended on the warriors: 'it is by their unanim-ity, and with the help of their swords, that I have been raised to this position-I should certainly look upon my soldiers as partners in this wealth' . 
1
The anatomy of the Afghan army in this period also indicates the character of the regime and its methods of war. The original force under Ahmad Shah Durrani's control numbered 16,000 feudal cavalry, known as the sawara-i kushada or sawara-i khudaspa, but this was expanded when he took power to 40,000. The army was composed of Durrani and Ghilzai Pashtuns with a bodyguard of Kizilbashes ('redhead' Turkic mercenary cavalry), augmented on campaign with more irregulars to reach a maximum strength of 120,000. The Durrani cavalrymen were supplied by the clan elders in return for grants of rent-free land. If their land produced insufficient revenue, they could be granted barats (stipends) from other sources, such as transit duties. Additional cash allowances were received if they increased the number of horsemen in the Shah's service. Because of their association with the 'royal' clan, the Durrani elders assumed the mantle of a noblesse oblige, and, like the baronial order of Britain in the thirteenth century, they took the view that they had the right to govern in the name of their selected monarch. If that monarch failed to serve their interests, they took it as a sine qua non that they could intervene to remove that head of state. Ahmad Shah's capital at Kandahar was guarded by 12,559 cavalry, of whom 5,710 were Durrani.

It was significant that Ahmad Shah Durrani and his son Timur attempted to incorporate their rivals, the Ghilzais, while subordinating the other ethnic groups of Afghanistan as subjects to be farmed and managed by the army. Nevertheless, sustaining this vast host was problematic, and supplies were stripped from the lands through which the force passed like a plague of locusts. Even the structure of the army was oriented towards the acquisition of plunder. A third of the 'regular' army was mounted, and a variety of light guns were drawn, but the irregular forces, the sipah-i ghair-i munazzam, were a mixture of cavalry and dismounted warriors. Some accounts suggest that a majority of these irregulars were mounted to suit their role as raiders, emphasizing mobility and mass over strength: corps consisting of thousands of horsemen could generally swarm around foreign garrisons and overwhelm them before they could be reinforced, or cascade through the countryside to acquire booty and then ride away before their enemies could concentrate against them. Each cavalryman was armed with a variety of weapons for the diverse military tasks he might have to perform on extended expeditions: shield, long spear, matchlock, sword, pistol and long knife.
Officially, the army could be paid in cash or granted jagirs or lucrative appointments in Afghanistan, or in conquered parts of India. Irregular forces were raised not just by asking for levies of men from chieftains in return for an annual tax remission, in the hope of loot (that would be shared by the victorious troops) since the same jagirs and cash rewards enjoyed by the standing army often proved a greater draw. On the borders, irregular light cavalry were maintained more or less permanently to patrol the frontier, impose taxation (from which they took a share for themselves) and to pursue enemies of the Shah. They were paid in the same way as other tribal levies. In an attempt to garrison the troublesome north, a permanent military colony was established at Balkh. 
4
Elsewhere, fortresses were supposed to control entry points into the Afghan realm. At Herat, the earthen walls were many feet thick and provided with a variety of cannons; and the citadel, the Maruchaq, occupied an area that was equivalent to two-thirds of the size of the city itself. The fort of Dehdadi in Mazar-i Sharif was also notable for its size and strength, and the Bala Hissar of Kabul was famous throughout Central Asia. 
5
There were three significant problems, though, that affected the Afghan military forces specifically. First, they lacked any secure financial-logistical system, so that if chieftains failed to pay their men, or there were sustained periods without the rewards of loot, there were mutinies. Second, the frequency of raids fell hardest on the Sikhs of the Punjab, and they reorganized their forces in such a manner that resistance against the Afghans stiffened. Third, their loyalty was often in doubt. Afghan forces were raised by local chieftains and communities and their first loyalty was to them and not the Durrani rulers. The governors of regional cities were also aware that loyalty could be purchased. Durrani Shahs faced the dilemma of staffing governorships with weak men who might be unable to rule effectively, or stronger men who might be tempted to rebel. A traditional proverb maintained that: 'An Afghan Amir sleeps upon an ant heap' .
To offset this problem of disloyalty, Ahmad Shah had established another independent military force, the ghulam-i shah. This bodyguard, based on the Persian shah-sevan, excluded Durranis from its ranks and recruited kizilbashes. Troopers were enlisted for life and paid in cash, and their units were commanded by respected officers, or qular aghasis. Yet, for an army made of feudal levies without professionalized systems such as regular terms of service, the Afghan army's strength often ebbed and flowed. Although it was traditional to try to garrison regions with troops drawn from other parts of the country, to avoid sympathies and fraternization developing, in practice this was far harder to achieve. Soldiers would simply vote with their feet if conditions did not suit them. Officers might use greater coercion to prevent desertion, but irregular pay or simply a desire to return to one's home could not prevent the army from fading in strength. Far more serious was the problem of local insurrection, and Afghan troops drawn from the same communities were not reliable. Ghilzais, who had traditionally made up the majority of the Afghan forces, were often in the forefront of resistance to the Shah. Although Ahmad Shah, like those who followed, tried to adopt Persian practices, such as the reading of statements of fealty to the monarch at the khutba (Friday prayers), the Ghilzai elders were aware that the Shah did not control their districts. Financial rewards might induce cooperation, but they did not ensure loyalty. Ghilzai clans were also conscious that they could exact tolls at will on caravans that made their way from Kabul and Kandahar, or across the Suleiman range into the subcontinent, and this financial independence reinforced the sense that they were politically autonomous too.
The bulk of fighting forces in wartime were the eljaris (dismounted levies), men who were raised during foreign raiding expeditions, to resist invasion, or to crush rebellions of rival qawm. Given the proximity of the plains of India, many of the eljaris were drawn from Ghilzai clans, but the forces were a mix of groups organized in tens, fifties, hundreds and thousand-strong formations under leaders correspondingly styled as dahbashi, pinjabashi, sadbashi (yuzbashi) and hazarbashi (mingbashi). Governors of the provinces were given overall jurisdiction, but real authority rested with the elders who selected them and paid them. 
6
Exhibitions of personal courage were deeply ingrained in the Pashtun code, and were common to other Afghan minorities. It was considered a means to acquire greater honour and prestige by performing acts of daring, either against rival clans, or in wartime against an enemy. There was much to be gained, therefore, by being at the front, and no honour at all in serving as some logistician or victualler. Equally, accepting orders from others was seen as a limitation on their opportunity to demonstrate their courage. Every man thought himself a khan, 'har saray khan deh' , and every man thought himself the equal of anyone else. This had a number of unfortunate effects. In battle, many would try to get straight into the fight, regardless of the odds against them, and there would be little restraint or patience. Equally, once a line started to collapse, the whole army tended to fragment and melt away. In periods of stalemate, the absence of any logistical support meant that the army had to break up for foraging. 
7
In the chaos following the death of Ahmad Shah Durrani in 1772, it was one of his sons, Timur Shah, who succeeded in crushing another favoured heir from his Durrani qawm to take power. However, to reduce the threat of being overthrown in a subsequent coup d'état, Timur had moved the capital from Kandahar, out of the Pashtun heartlands. For greater security, he looked to develop the Kizilbash to provide the core of an army that would be loyal to him, through cash rewards, and not to Afghan clan affiliations. This attempt to break with tribal linkage was significant, and Timur, like his father, was clearly trying to establish a hereditary monarchy that could bind all Afghans under a single ruler in emulation of the Persian or the Mughal empires. Yet the Pashtun clans of the south distrusted, collectively and universally, any attempt to assert one individual or family over all others. Pashtunwali emphasized egalitarianism, and, despite the creation of a majlis or advisory council of elders, Durrani and Ghilzai elders were not convinced that Timur was content to be a mere primus inter pares. Nevertheless, although he was forced to deploy the kizilbash cavalry to break a series of Pashtun revolts, Timur hoped to continue the policy of avoiding taxation and to foster support through consensus and a network of patronage. He also ensured that garrisons were maintained to prevent any large faction, like the Ghilzais, taking possession of Kandahar, which they might use as a base for operations and a recruiting ground to overthrow him. Most importantly, he tried to keep the Durranis, the closest qawm to the seat of power, divided. A British observer wrote: 'the King's policy is to keep the Douranees in subjection to himself, while he exalts them over other Afghauns' , continuing: 'For this purpose he protects the Taujiks, and all others whose power he can use to depress the nobles, without endangering the ascendancy of his tribe' . 
8
9
To reduce expenditure, he avoided military expeditions beyond the border zones, and concentrated his army against internal disorders. However, the net effect was that peripheral regions were less and less influenced by the court at Kabul. When Timur died in 1773, the factions of the country made further attempts to assert their autonomy. His sons waged civil war against each other, or used intrigue and assassination to capture, maim and murder each other. Zaman Shah (r. 1793-1800) succeeded for a time and tried to reunite Afghan factions by marching on India, but Mahmud Shah (r. 1800-03), the governor of Herat, rebelled and then captured Zaman. 
10
It was another of Payinda Khan's sons, Dost Mohammed, who emerged from the maelstrom of intra-Barakzai feuding to become the ruler of Ghazni and Kabul in 1826. However, Dost Mohammed's realm extended only as far as the region around the two cities, since rival factions held northern and eastern territories, Kandahar (half-brothers of the Mohammadzai clan) and Herat (ruled by the Sadozai Durranis). Remote areas that might once have considered some suzerainty to the Durranis, like Kashmir and the Pamirs, were lost. Ghilzai lands in the south and east also considered themselves entirely independent. Despite this evident weakness and fractiousness, it was the intervention of foreign and 'infidel' forces that would weld some sort of unity amongst the Afghans, particularly in defence of Islam.
In the late 1820s, Dost Mohammed and his clan were regarded as usurpers with the impertinence to emulate Ahmad Shah Durrani. The weakness of the new regime only seemed to be underlined by the Sikh victory in 1834, when Peshawar was wrested from Afghan control. Despite later historiography that portrayed Dost Mohammed as a national leader, he was weak. As Mountstuart Elphinstone observed: the internal government of the tribes answers its end so well that the utmost disorders of the royal government never derange its operations, nor disturb the lives of the people. A number of organized and high-spirited republics are ready to defend their rugged country against a tyrant; and are able to defy the feeble efforts of a party in a civil war. 
11
These internal fissures meant it was difficult to sustain operations beyond the fiefdom of Kabul. Although Dost Mohammad managed to mount an expedition against the Sikhs, winning a battle near Jamrud in 1836, he was simply unable to recover Peshawar. He looked to open up diplomatic relations with the British to outflank the Sikhs, and in 1837 the British seemed to be moving closer to the Afghan position when they compelled the Persians to abandon a siege of Herat. However, it soon became evident that the British, who had succeeded in annexing most of the Indian subcontinent, were a formidable adversary. The Afghans were aware that the British possessed a large and modern army with a great deal of mobile artillery, and they had augmented their forces with Hindu sepoys and sowars. Dost Mohammad had believed that a careful diplomatic approach to the British would avoid ever having to confront them in war, but his diplomacy with Russia and Persia merely fuelled British suspicions that Dost Mohammad was looking to join Britain's enemies. As a result, Afghanistan was to find itself defeated and occupied.
In the prelude to the Anglo-Afghan War, the British believed the Afghans were unable to withstand a modern, disciplined army. Herat had withstood the siege of 1837 by a narrow margin of success. Although the ruler was Kamran, the descendant of Ahmad Shah Durrani, the city and the Hari-Rud valley was governed by Yar Mohammed, and he had assembled the inexperienced city militia to withstand the onslaught of the Persian army. The Persians had long-standing claims to western Afghanistan, and had occupied the city in 1805. They compelled the Afghans to pay tribute to the Shah of Persia, until a revolt in the neighbouring Khorassan province enabled the Heratis to cease their payments, and in 1816 the rebels seized the Persian fortress at Ghurian. 
12
13
However, Herat's defences were also reduced by a persistent outbreak of cholera and a steady migration of the population away from the city. By 1829, when Shah Mahmud died and his son Kamran took over, the city population had more than halved from an estimated 100,000 to 40,000. However, Yar Mohammed, as Vizier, tried to organize the city's recovery and even extended the area under his control southwards into Seistan. The Persians regarded this as part of their own dominion and there were preparations to reduce Herat's power. Shah Shuja's return to Kandahar in 1834, Dost Mohammed's need to counter that threat, and the annexation of Peshawar by Ranjit Singh indicated to the Persians that the Heratis were unlikely to get reinforcements. The defeat of Dost Mohammed's forces by the Sikhs at the Khyber Pass in May 1835 also suggested that the Afghans were weakened. However, the Persians were locked into a struggle with the Ottoman Empire on the south-western border, and consequently they could take no action against the Afghans until 1837. Russia, which was eager to assert greater influence over the Persians, faced disturbances in the Caucasus (1834) and Kazakhstan (1836-7) and was unable to intervene. 
14
15
The British tried to broker a last minute compromise, and Yar Mohammed offered to restore the Persian tribute while refusing to accept full Persian sovereignty. The British accepted the Heratis' position, as they were concerned about growing Russian support for Persia and wanted to see Herat remain independent. The Persians reacted by sending an army, 30,000 strong, across the border in October. The Heratis tried to slow this advance by a scorched-earth policy, destroying any forage, although they declined to defend the fortress at Ghurian. On 23 November the Persians reached the ruined north-western suburbs of Herat, but after some skirmishing the Afghans took refuge behind the vast walls of the city. For the first few months, the Persians struggled to maintain their investment. Their logistical system was under severe strain, especially when bad weather hampered supply columns. There were no lines of circumvallation, and the Afghans were able to use three of the five city gates to move in and out of the city, even grazing cattle on lands to the east. Persian artillery fire was desultory and ineffective, although trenches were dug to within yards of the base of the walls and a half-hearted effort was made to mine underneath them. If the morale of the Persians wasn't affected by their meagre rations, Yar Mohammed did his best to terrorize them by displaying the heads of captured Persians along the battlements.
In April 1838 the Persians finally effected a breach in the walls and prepared to storm the city. The attack was planned for the night of the nineteenth, but the British arranged a truce and the assault was cancelled. It was not until June that the Persians were able to reinvigorate the offensive, assisted by Russian advisors. The city was finally sealed off, and it was not long before disease broke out in the unsanitary streets. Yar Mohammed ordered that all remaining stocks of food be seized, and suspected 'fifth columnists' were summarily executed.

However, Herat had been reduced to a population of little more than 8,000 with no supplies. Yar Mohammed was driven to selling prisoners as slaves to the Turkomen across the border. He accepted British money, but was eager to avoid any control from the government of India and prepared to re-open negotiations with the Persians to obtain support against the British if that proved necessary.

As General Keane advanced towards Kabul, he was informed that Dost Mohammad was urgently trying to complete the fortification of Ghazni and 'exciting the Ghilzais' . 
24
25
26
27
The initial military operations were thus a great success for the British. Dost Mohammed sent his brother Jubber Khan to negotiate a settlement, as was the Afghan custom after a decisive battle. The Amir had accepted that his surrender might prevent the 'further effusion of blood' and that he would hand over 'the state of Cabool into the hands of Shah Shooja' . 
28
29
When Dost Mohammed escaped into Central Asia, the British conceived a plan to march a strong column to the Oxus to impress upon the Emirs of Bokhara and Kunduz that they should under no circumstances attempt to assist the Afghan exile. The military force was designed partly to protect their envoy, Dr Percival Lord, but also to persuade the local potentates that resistance to the British was hopeless. However, military officers advised against the scheme, arguing that sending a column over the mountains so late in the year when supplies further north were uncertain, and when potential enemy strengths were unknown, courted disaster. Even sending individual envoys was known to be hazardous. Two British officers were imprisoned and subsequently executed by the Emir of Bokhara in 1842, after allegations that they were spying for the Khanates of Khiva and Khokand. 
30
What was more troubling for the British was the evident lack of enthusiasm in Kabul for Shah Shuja, and the obvious resentment of the presence of a foreign army of occupation. Keane, on his departure for India, made the ominous prediction that: 'It will not be long before there is here some signal catastrophe' because of Shah Shuja's growing tendency to govern by coercion and use 'harsh measures' .

In 1839 British objectives were achieved and the war appeared to be over. Within two years, however, the British would be confronted with a series of localized insurrections and a serious rebellion in Kabul that ended with the destruction of a British brigade.
There were two inter-related causes of unrest: the reform of the Afghan armed forces and the distribution of money. Although the revolts against the British were legitimized by invoking the name of the Shah and the defence of Islam, the elites who provided the leadership were concerned to acquire power, wealth and military forces to assert their position. In effect, despite the presence of the British forces, the conflicts that occurred between 1839 and 1842 were really a continuation of the dynastic struggle and civil war that had begun in 1803, or perhaps even earlier. Western writers have tended to emphasize the errors made by the leading British political and military figures, and the antagonism caused by cultural affronts, but a more detailed examination of the Afghan situation and the concomitant communal rivalries shows that the fissures in Afghan society, prised open by military reforms and money, were of great importance. The British errors were chiefly to attempt economies in security in the face of growing unrest. Because of the costs of occupation and the extended lines of communication, the military garrison was reduced with small pockets left in key urban areas, each of which proved vulnerable to insurrection or isolation. The British presence also polarized the Afghans. During the occupation, Shah Shuja's lack of traditional consultation and the high-handedness of his subordinates caused considerable resentment, but it was his association with foreign backing that eroded his legitimacy by 1842. The death of Shuja at the hands of an assassin created further instability and a civil war, weakening the resistance that Afghans could offer to a British counter-offensive in August 1842. These internal divisions were not resolved for years after the departure of the British garrisons, and they resurfaced when Dost Mohammed died in 1863.
A large proportion of the revenue gathered by Afghan rulers was to pay for the army, and it was common for officials to take a share of the whole and for individual clan leaders to claim financial allowances for larger numbers of men than they had actually raised, the corrupt practice of 'ghost-payrolling' . The siphoned income was used as patronage pay-offs. Dost Mohammed had seen the need for a regular corps at the heart of the Afghan army, but he also knew that it would be fatal to attempt to change the system of feudal cavalry and its financial-patronage networks while the clans remained so powerful. Even Cap-tain Trevor, who later opposed the idea of payments to the feudal horsemen, recognized the political role the light cavalry of the army played:
We must not look on the Irregular Cavalry as merely a military body; in that light 3 Regiments might annihilate it tomorrow, but, as an instrument which enables H.M' .s principal subjects to appropriate a greater part of his revenues without making any return, and which has continued so long that its destruction would certainly be considered an invasion of private property.

The other financial effect of the British occupation, particularly in Kabul and Kandahar but less so in Herat, was inflation. The influx of rupees, brought by the troops and the traders, victuallers and camp followers who came in their wake, had a dramatic effect on prices. The inflation polarized the commercial classes of Kabul, who made large profits, from the khans and elders, whose income fell in relative terms. This overturned the carefully calibrated hierarchy of prestige and created a sense of humiliation for the traditionalist khans.
Inflation also increased the price of food in and around Kabul, increasing the relative poverty of the urban inhabitants. The introduction of cash crops for exports added further upward pressure on food prices, and the approach of winter, when there was a traditional scarcity and higher prices anyway, increased anxiety. 
38
In order to cut the costs of occupation and keep order, the British returned to the long-established practice of raising their own auxiliaries. Two cavalry formations were created, the Janbaz and Hazirbash. The Janbaz were designed to be a well-trained and disciplined force, initially just 1,600 strong. 
39
The Hazirbash were auxiliary cavalry raised at the same time for the purposes of local security and tax collection. 
40
41
The rebels in Kabul were not drawn exclusively from the feudal cavalry, although some of the urban population who had mustered in the past did sub-sequently join the revolt. The strongest support would come, in fact, from the Ghilzais and the Kohistani Tajiks, and the ulema, rather than the Durrani Pashtuns. Mohammed Akbar Khan, who eventually came to direct the revolt against the British garrison, had to rely on the Ghilzai khans and elders because the Durrani factions were so divided and opposed to him as a leader. Zaman, who assumed the position of Shah for a time, was a committed rival of Akbar Khan. Faction fighting came to the fore as soon as the British garrison had been driven from Kabul, reached a peak after the assassination of Shah Shuja and continued even when the British were poised to launch a counter-offensive against Kabul with the so-called Army of Retribution. Unity, even in the face of a common enemy, proved impossible to achieve.
The first signs of armed resistance to the British occupation can be traced to the attack on a large column on the road to Ghazni by 2,000 Ghilzai horsemen in May 1840. The Ghilzais had not been engaged by the main army during the invasion and were not prepared for the firepower that the British possessed. Although the Ghilzai cavalry made an attempt to envelop the 1,200-strong British force while pinning their centre with a frontal attack, disciplined musketry and artillery fire inflicted an estimated 200 casualties, and the Ghilzais were forced to retreat. 
42
In the east of the country, the Ghilzai clan elders had been summoned to Kabul in September 1841 to be informed that, owing to economies, their allowances were to be reduced drastically. The news was received without complaint, but as soon as the elders and khans had returned to their homelands, violence began immediately.
The first revolt broke out in Zurmat in the form of resistance to revenue collection. An attempt to occupy a local fort failed, which fuelled the fighting, and so a larger force was dispatched to destroy compounds and forts and to seize stocks of grain. 
43
44
More importantly, the swordsmen had created a psychological effect on their adversaries. Hemmed in by the terrain, the British and Indian troops had been unable to do much damage with volley fire. The steady attrition of their ranks, where 300 had become casualties in the space of a week's march through the pass, and the resolute attack by men armed with Khyber knives had clearly unnerved the soldiers. Something of the strength of feeling of the Afghans is suggested by the fact that even some of Shah Shuja's personal bodyguards rode out to join the fighting against the British, although there were many reported cases of joining a fight regardless of who was involved for the thrill of action and the chance to be tested in battle. At Gandamack, Sale halted his brigade and was subjected to sniping from the nearby hills, but then news arrived that a revolt had broken out in Kabul.
In the far west, Yar Mohammed, the vizier of Herat, was continually searching for the opportunity to subvert the presence of the British and Shah Shuja's apparent suzerainty. Correspondence was maintained with the Persians, and both money and men were sent to support Akhtar Khan Alizai in a revolt against Shah Shuja in December 1840. 
45
There was also developing unrest of a small and localized character in the Pashtun south. General Nott at Kandahar had to deal with a minor insurrection in January 1841, but his troops were able to contain the resistance. By August the rebels had been dispersed. Rawlinson noted that: 'The only "irreconcilable" was Akrum Khan, with whom promises and threats were alike pow-erless… A fellow countryman, therefore, having been induced to reveal his whereabouts, the unfortunate Doorani chief was surprised and seized. Nott carried him to Candahar, where, after consultation with the Envoy and the puppet monarch, he was executed, being blown from a gun' . 
46
It is often assumed that Afghan resistance was constant and united throughout the British occupation, with a desultory low level of insurgency as the norm. In fact, as the episodes of 1840-41 show, unrest was localized, sporadic, and closely related to the provision of allowances or clan politics. The Afghan view is that opposition to foreign occupation was inevitable, universally popular and that success was assured. The reality was that many collaborated with the British or used the presence of the foreign forces to pursue their own agendas. Afghan society remained as divided as before, but new alliances and coalitions were formed under the political dispensation of Shah Shuja. The myth that Afghanistan was the 'graveyard of empires' has proved persistent, despite the historical fact that Afghanistan has been overrun, incorporated and rendered into a 'rentier' territory many times. Moreover, the defeat of a British brigade at Kabul in 1841 at the hands of an irregular force was the exception rather than the rule. Afghan forces had found it impossible to hold ground against the disciplined battalions of British and Indian troops. The lack of coordination between Afghan factions, and occasions of outright hostility to each other, has often been overlooked.
The emphasis on the 'inevitable' defeat of occupiers in the historiography emerged because of several related factors. The first, and most recent, was the Soviet withdrawal in 1989, but ironically there was also an echo of the determinism of Soviet ideology in the narrative, namely that revolutionary forces would always overthrow an imperial power. Western Whig histories also emphasized the inevitability of outcomes. It suited the authors of British histories in the nineteenth century to use the destruction of the brigade at Kabul to prove that it was impossible to hold Afghanistan, which was also the contrasting case for India or other parts of the empire. Afghan exceptionalism was easier to assert, and consequently the characteristic of 'fanaticism' was emphasized. The strategic situation for the British after 1841, specifically to reduce costs and render Afghanistan a client buffer state rather than assume the burdens of occupation, has too often been ignored. The biggest oversight has been the failure to acknowledge that it was the under-resourced nature of the occupation, with small and isolated garrisons, both those of the Shah and the British, and the consequent under-financing of the project, that led to the crisis of 1841. Each generation rewrites its history to suit changing values, expectations and interpretations, and nationalist agendas in Afghanistan have been reinforced by the case of the First Anglo-Afghan War. The notion that the Afghans conducted a 'national revolution' against the British and their puppet leader ignored the fact that Shah Shuja enjoyed greater legitimacy than Dost Mohammed and the Barakzais.
The populist aspect of the resistance to the British had a strong Islamist character, and leaders found this factor a useful tool for mobilizing the people in large numbers. This had an obvious and critical military value. The employment of mass was in effect the only way to overwhelm the military power of small, professional British and Indian forces. However, there is another tendency, used by Afghans, to see this as the exclusive element of the resistance. In reality, the prospect of loot was just as important in motivating men to fight. Shah Shuja noted: 'these men are not influenced by considerations of religion, they give their lives for the wealth of this world and do not fear death' .

In Kabul on 2 November 1841, the British faced a small but serious revolt which broke out in the bazaar and quickly spread to other parts of the city. Amongst the first to be killed was Sir Alexander Burnes who had been a key negotiator with the Afghans and was due to succeed Sir William Macnaghten as the senior political figure in the British administration. The crowd, estimated initially at 300, was reported to have gathered at Burnes' house in the old city in the early morning in the hope of acquiring the cash that was said to be stored at the property. The crowd appears to have started with verbal abuse and vocal protest, and Burnes is reported to have attempted to remonstrate with them from the balcony of his house. The protest turned violent and Burnes was hacked down. This murder of a British officer committed the crowd to further action. One of the first buildings to be stormed was the Treasury under the command of Captain Johnson, the Paymaster of the Shah's army.
According to Mohan Lal, Burnes' secretary and spymaster, the uprising was led by disaffected court nobles, Barakzai khans and the middle-ranking ulema not in the service of Shah Shuja's court. 
51
52
The leaders who had planned the protest and revolt were keen to protect their privileges and their incomes, and, in the secret meeting the night before the outbreak, there were frequent complaints about British high-handedness towards them. They were angry that their prestige, so crucial to social relations in Afghanistan, was undermined and that Afghan women, especially wives and consorts, were being attracted by British money to the foreigners. There was concern that the influx of revenue was being redistributed to other factions, and not shared according to the former hierarchy of clans. Resistance to the Hazilbash and Janbaz cavalry was especially marked in this regard. Some of the ulema argued that the new uniforms and forms of discipline were un-Islamic, but the real motive was to register their protest at the growing influence of the British over political affairs and their own relative loss of power. 
53
54

56
More effective military leadership was established by Mohammed Akbar Khan, the son of Dost Mohammed, who arrived in Kabul around 25 November. He arranged for the ulema to move into the villages to persuade the farmers to stop selling supplies to the British cantonment at Sherpur. 
57
The Afghans also made good use of a fortification that lay close to the British cantonment, known as Mohammed Shareef 's fort. They loopholed the walls so as to be able to shoot down any British attempt to sortie from the gates. As before, the prospect of acquiring loot was a strong incentive to join the fighting. When the commissary was overrun, the scene of Afghans scrambling to get a share of the goods was said to resemble 'an anthill' . 
58
On 10 November, the Afghans tightened the ring. The heights above the two sides of the cantonment, if occupied, offered the chance to thin out the defenders manning the ramparts and to dominate the entire position. If artillery could be established on the heights as well, this would hasten the fall of the British defences, although finding trained gunners proved difficult. On the eastern side of the cantonment, Afghan cavalry managed to get on to the high ground and then ride forward to occupy a walled enclosure called the Rikabashee fort. Dismounting here, the Afghans opened fire on the ramparts. The British assembled a force to clear this position, but when their attempt to open a breach in the enclosure walls only created a small gap, the Afghans inside were able to pick off the attackers as they tried to get in. Seeing the British assault, the Afghan cavalry still on the heights above charged down and took the infantry in the flank. The British 44 th Regiment was driven back, rallied, and rejoined the troops who had managed to get inside the Rikabashee enclosure. The Afghans therefore abandoned the position but their cavalry managed to mount a second charge, and dismounted Afghan troops made a counterattack up to the main entrance. The British troops at Rikabashee were unable to close the gates, were driven back into a stable block and wiped out. Once again, the British fought their way back. This time, the 37 th Native Infantry managed to push the Afghans out and straight into the fire of the 44 th Regiment. Meanwhile the rest of the British force had skirmished up to the Siah Sung Hill on the eastern side of the cantonment from where they could use cannons to fire onto the remaining Afghan formations. In this sharp engagement, the Afghans had proved that they could contest positions they knew to be of tactical value and that they understood the importance of momentum and shock action in attack. They also demonstrated perseverance by launching a second major attack three days later.
On 13 November, the Afghans manhandled two field guns up onto the Beymaru Heights that stood to the immediate west of the cantonment. They began to fire through the British encampment as soon as they reached the summit, and it was clear that, once again, the British would need to clear the high ground. The Afghans had anticipated this move, and as soon as the British were in the open they launched a cavalry charge from the hillside. The Afghan horsemen rode into and through the British and Indian ranks, causing complete confusion. However, the British cavalry were able to mount an effective counter-attack and the Afghan horsemen fell back. The British artillery joined in, inflicting losses on the Afghans streaming back across the plain to the south. The British infantry then scaled the heights, spiked one gun and hauled away the other. The Afghans may have abandoned the guns because they lacked ammunition, although the hilltop location would have made it extremely difficult to extract them under fire. There is no record of the Afghans having fought to defend the guns. The shortage of ammunition may also explain why they did not use them to attempt to make breaches in the walls of the cantonment.
The British planned to remain in possession of the Beymaru Heights until darkness, but their withdrawal proved to be the opportunity the Afghans needed to close with their enemies. As soon as it got dark, distinguishing friend from foe became impossible and the Afghan cavalry rode deep into the British lines causing chaos. At this point a second wave of 400 Afghans advanced from the north-east, which suggests that there had been some coordination in this attack. In the confused fighting, the British managed to extract themselves and returned to the cantonment, firing for some time from the walls. The Afghans, realizing the impossibility of preventing the British from recovering their position, drew off.
The contemporary British accounts of the fighting in and around Rikabashee and Beymaru focus strongly on the errors of the commanders and the gradual demoralization of the British and Indian garrison. The shortage of supplies, caused by the failure to secure their commissary depot, also features prominently. Rather less attention was given at the time, or indeed by subsequent authors, to the Afghan perspective. In many ways the Afghan attacks on 10 and 31 November were premature. Having taken the British supplies, or at least a substantial portion of them, they were not prepared to sit out a siege and wait. The decision to secure the Rikabashee compound appears to have been a hasty decision, which contrasts with the careful siting of forces on the dominating heights. Getting drawn into a fight for a relatively unimportant position, albeit one close to the cantonment walls, caused unnecessary casualties. At Beymaru a great deal of effort was made to get two guns above the British cantonment, perhaps to cause a demoralization of the garrison rather than any substantial physical effect. The action of the Afghan cavalry when the British left the security of the cantonment walls gives the impression that an ambush had been planned, but it was too small a force to defeat the British and was driven off. The night attack as the British withdrew suggests an attempt at coordination, but too few Afghan forces were deployed to create a decisive effect. This suggests that the Afghans had difficulty combining their various factions to act in concert, even when they were presented with a common enemy. When the British eventually withdrew from the Sherpur cantonment, only the Ghilzai factions pursued them beyond the Khoord-Kabul Pass, because this was, in effect, their own territory.
Macnaghten reluctantly agreed to offer 200,000 rupees to draw off all the Ghilzais, but perhaps sensing that they now had the upper hand and a greater reward awaited them, the Ghilzai elders rejected the offer.

Meanwhile at Charikar, in Kohistan, a Gurkha regiment and its families and camp followers, who had attempted to fall back on Kabul, had been destroyed. Muslim gunners attached to the formation had been persuaded to cooperate with their Afghan co-religionists against the British and Indian troops. It appears that the survivors who tried to escape through the snows were cut down by fast-moving Afghan horsemen. Finally the reinforcements due to reach Jalalabad from India, a composite force under Brigadier Wild, had been defeated in the Khyber Pass. On the eve of the advance of this relief column, the Sikh auxiliaries had deserted and the remaining sepoys broke under the Afridis' jezail fire. The collapse of the force affected the garrison of the fortress of Ali-Musjid. They fled, and the Afridis rushed in to seize cattle, supplies and abandoned munitions. When news arrived that British reinforcements would not be coming from the south or through the Khyber, and with dwindling rations, Macnaghten once again tried to open negotiations.
The Afghans, however, were eager to inflict a decisive military defeat on the British first, partly to assert that the negotiating position was absolutely clear but also to satisfy their honour by reasserting their supremacy in battle. After another three days of preparation at Kabul, which the British observed was to manufacture more ammunition and collect more powder, the village of Beymaru was sealed off. Since the British garrison had been on half rations since the loss of the Commissary depot and had relied on Afghans to supply food and fodder via the village, it was decided a sortie should be made to recover control of this key terrain. The Afghans began to dig in on the heights above the cantonment, perhaps aware that the British were about to undertake some offensive manoeuvre. At dawn on 23 November, British and Indian infantry, with sappers, cavalry and a single cannon, started to advance on the village, but they were met by a considerable weight of jezail fire. The sound of the firing drew Afghans from the city and they concentrated on the heights. Estimates suggest that 10,000 assembled there. The single British gun, although effective, overheated and ceased firing.
At this point several hundred Afghan horsemen had assembled nearby, prompting the British infantry to adopt the 'square' formation for all-round defence against cavalry. However, the Afghan horsemen had no wish to throw themselves into the path of British volley fire and hung back, allowing the jezailcarrying foot soldiers to open up on the densely-packed British ranks.
While the British and Indian troops were pinned in one place, Afghan swordsmen approached them via dead ground, using a gully that concealed them from both the infantry and the fire of British guns in the cantonment. Emerging at close quarters in large numbers, the nearest square collapsed and this was the signal for the Afghan cavalry to surge forward. The single British gun was overrun. However, the British held their ground and counter-attacked with bayonets accompanied by an Indian cavalry squadron. In the mêlée, Abdullah Khan, one of the original leaders of the Kabul revolt, was mortally wounded. This caused the Afghans to pull back, abandoning the hill and the British cannon. However, the British were still vulnerable when they halted. The Afghans took up positions on the slopes amongst the rocks and proceeded to cut down the standing ranks, taking care to keep out of range of the muskets and under cover when volleys were fired overhead. The skirmishing continued for some hours until a second force of swordsmen again worked their way up to the British position using the cover of a defile. They assembled for a final assault while concealed and then made a sudden attack. This compelled the British to fall back and the Afghan cavalry, still hovering nearby, seized its chance to pursue and destroy the collapsing line. The Afghans were soon mixed in amongst the retreating redcoats and victory was so certain for the Afghans that many of them chose to spare the British troops rather than slaughter them. Captain Trevor noted that 'several times' Afghans had stopped short of killing him, waving a sword above him instead. Curiously the Afghans also let the British return to the cantonment. This fighting on 23 November at first sight suggests a far more coordinated operation, and the obvious suggestion has been that Akbar Khan had taken command of the various factions to achieve a victory. In fact, although there was a picquet line of Afghan jezailchis in Beymaru village, most of the Afghans who took part in the battle had to assemble from their billets in Kabul. This fact, and the decision by the cavalry not to attack, had little to do with a coor-dinated plan but were based on the experience of having faced a cohesive line of British musket fire in the past. For the second time, Afghan cavalry and infantry had been unable to hold the Beymaru Heights or stand their ground in the open, but they had been most effective when the British insisted on using close-order formations (a precaution against rushes by swordsmen or cavalrymen) and the Afghans could make use of cover and fire against them. This was simply a pragmatic decision on the part of the Afghans against the key British assets, namely cohesion and massed fire from the infantry, not forgetting the effectiveness of their artillery. It was not an enduring Afghan 'way of war' but a classic example of adapting to a new situation.
The reason why the British personnel were spared, especially after such bitter fighting in the previous weeks, might be explained by the desire not to create the conditions for revenge. Amongst Afghans, their culture dictated that to kill or die in the heat of battle was quite legitimate, but unnecessary killing might compel the victim's family members to seek badal. The Afghans who spared the British officers may have believed that they were simply worth more alive than dead, perhaps as hostages, but it may also have been connected with the idea that, since the British were clearly defeated, there was no need to annihilate them. It certainly casts doubt on the oft-repeated assumption that the Afghans were simply 'thousands of fanatics' whose 'fervour was directed at the destruction of the infidels' , as one writer put it. 
61
The loss of key resources, a reduced garrison, paralysis in the military leadership, the defeat and massacre of a garrison at Kohistan, the loss of the Khyber Pass, and then the defeat of British and Indian troops at Beymaru Ridge on 13 and 23 November 1841 completely altered the conditions for negotiation. Macnaghten knew the critical nature of the military situation and he initiated overtures to Mohammad Akbar Khan, who had come into the city of Kabul soon after the revolt, and to the tribal leaders of the Ghilzais from the neighbouring districts.
The Afghans demanded that Shah Shuja and his household be handed over to them, and that the British garrison at Jalalabad should evacuate and return to Peshawar. They insisted that the Kabul garrison should give up all its arms and ammunition, make over all the European officers and families as hostages, and that the Indian troops should march back to India. 
62
The British rejected the Afghan demands, but 'back channels' were kept open. One of the key negotiators, Mohan Lal, was still active in this regard. It is alleged that Macnaghten, or perhaps Mohan Lal himself, had offered cash to any Afghan who would assassinate at least two of the tribal leaders, although there is no documentary evidence of such a plot. 
63
64
Macnaghten still hoped that divisions amongst the Afghans would give the British the edge in negotiations and perhaps permit a recovery of the situation. Indeed, Akbar Khan appeared to have great difficulty in persuading the tribal leaders, particularly the Ghilzais, to accept any deal at all. The British lacked sufficient transport animals, and disorganization prevailed in the cantonments at Sherpur such that the original deadline for departure, 15 December, passed without any movement at all. This served to increase the suspicions of the Ghilzais. On 22 December, on the second date set for departure, Akbar Khan offered a new treaty which stated that, in return for making him Wazir and donating supplies to get the Kabul garrison through the winter, he would support Shah Shuja. He even offered to arrest Amanullah Khan, the serving Wazir of the 'shadow government' and one of the leaders who had started the revolt in Kabul in November. Macnaghten famously signed this instrument, which was duly shown to the tribal leaders by Akbar Khan as final evidence of the infidelity of the British.
Macnaghten had hoped the new treaty would actually divide Akbar Khan and the clans, but it united them in a determination to abandon negotiations and destroy the British garrison altogether. On 23 December Macnaghten was summoned to a meeting on the banks of the Kabul River, where he was murdered and dismembered. The weakened state of the garrison was then exploited, and while some British officers still favoured fighting their way out or seizing the Bala Hissar fortress, the garrison in fact attempted to march out expecting the 'safe conduct' which they believed Macnaghten had secured. It took six days to wipe out the British force, which included hundreds of civilians and the families of many of the troops.
The Afghan forces at Kabul began to loot the cantonment even before the British had completed their evacuation on 6 January 1842. Several jezailchis opened fire as the rear of the column left the immediate vicinity, and a number of the garrison were killed before they could escape. The first 5 miles of the retreat was marked by abandoned baggage and some despairing camp followers. Many of the Afghans who pursued the column simply looked to acquire this baggage or valuables still held by the British. After all, the British had a reputation for wealth and so waves of raiders would move in, largely under cover of darkness, to seize anything of value. The British continued to resist and the looting parties were driven off on repeated occasions. Akbar Khan eventually caught up with the column to acquire more hostages which he could use for bargaining and insurance against any British counter-offensive. Conscious of the expectations of his peers, that all fugitives deserved to be offered hospitality under nanawatai, and perhaps reminded that his father might be humiliated if he did not ensure that British captives were well-treated, he ensured that his British prisoners survived.
As the British column struggled towards the Khyber Pass, each Ghilzai clan looked to acquire some sort of compensation to make up for the loss of their allowances. It seems unlikely that the Afghans, collectively, had set out to annihilate the entire British force, but rather this was the cumulative effect as the column passed through each clan territory. There must have been a steady stream of clansmen moving to and from the retreating column's route encum-bered by valuables, or setting off to acquire a share. The acquisition of plunder had always been a divisive issue amongst Ghilzai families and villages, and the sudden input of these goods must have generated a good deal of rivalry which may have lasted for years. One of the reasons why the Ghilzais proved unable and unwilling to confront Dost Mohammed in the years after his return to power may, perhaps, have been because of the increased frequency of internal disputes and faction fighting caused by this sudden influx of goods. While we have no written records to support this assumption, similar episodes from other periods point in this direction.
In the defiles of the Khyber Pass, some Ghilzais attempted to halt the British column altogether with barriers. There were also British attempts to negotiate a path through the clans. At the Khoord-Kabul Pass, however, the Ghilzais tried to kill as many foreigners as possible, and once again, according to eyewitnesses, they concentrated their fire wherever the baggage was clustered most densely or where animals or loot might be acquired. On 8 January 1842, the third day of the retreat, some Ghilzais rushed in to try and wrest weapons from the Indian soldiers. They also used the herding masses of civilians as cover so as to get closer to the valuable goods without being shot down by the soldiers still offering resistance.
After the British had pushed their way through the Hoft Kotal defile, suffering more casualties, Akbar Khan offered to negotiate and demanded that the British surrender entirely. The British refused and tried to make a night march to reach Jugduluk while the Ghilzais slept, but the mass of panicking civilians destroyed any hope of secrecy. Conscious that the British and their valuables might soon be out of reach, the Ghilzais therefore launched a series of attacks on the rear of the column. The British nevertheless created a defensive position, using the walls of the village at Jugduluk as cover, and this forced the Ghilzais to sustain their fire from some distance away. But on entering the Jugduluk defile, the British were subjected to more intense fire as they tried to dismantle a holly oak barrier. Almost all the remaining officers were killed at this point and the camp followers were massacred. A handful of troops reached Gandamack and formed a defensive ring. The Ghilzais, according to Captain Souter who survived, initially approached without firing, possibly in the hope of disarming the British and acquiring their weapons. When the British resisted, they were all cut down. Another survivor, Dr Brydon, also noted that villagers had used a red flag to signal the approach of the British, whereupon Afghan cavalrymen concentrated to attack. This suggests that a system of warning signals may have been in use in and around the Khyber Pass, perhaps to summon lashkars for a defensive action.
The key Afghan accounts of the negotiations in November 1841-January 1842 were analyzed by the Afghan historian Sayyid Mohammed Qasim Rashtiya, and, as expected, they emphasized the treacherous nature of the British negotiators.

The view in London, which was shared by the Governor General in India, was to abandon Afghanistan, but there was a general feeling that some restoration of military prestige was required. Major General George Pollock, who commanded the forces below the Khyber Pass, argued that without a new expedition against Kabul 'our character as a powerful nation would be entirely lost in this part of the world' .

What British histories tend to overlook is the bitter divisions that had opened up amongst the Afghans. When the British garrison first left Kabul, the sick and wounded that became hostages were bargaining tools to be traded between the various factions. Legitimacy to govern and loyalty were also part of a currency for exchange. Zaman Shah could look to the Barakzai for his support, but not all followed willingly and some felt that Shah Shuja was still the true authority of Kabul. Others looked to Akbar Khan, who had organized the resistance and who represented the link with Dost Mohammed, although Akbar was engaged in trying to control Ghilzai khans and elders as they pursued the British towards the Khyber. The court nobles of Kabul, led by Amanullah Khan, drew upon the support of the Logaris. They derived their finances from pressure on the Hindu bankers left behind by the British garrison, and this gave Amanullah the chance to enlist soldiers in a private army. In the Bala Hissar fortress of Kabul, Shah Shuja himself could count on the backing of 2,000 troops and a sizeable treasury, and, he hoped, he could call upon the British to return and restore his undisputed position. At first a compromise was agreed where Shuja would remain as Shah, with Zaman as Wazir and Amanullah as na'ib. But the agreement soon ran into problems.
The first dispute was over the raising and control of the Afghan military forces. Most of the khans had exhausted the cash they had acquired, and many turned to looting Kabul and the surrounding area in order to raise money to pay for troops. Amanullah threatened the commercial classes to obtain more money. Shah Shuja was also called upon to raise forces with some of his state revenue and then send one of his sons to lead an army against the British.

The Afghans were unable to confront the conventional forces of the British with any hope of success, but they still exercised a form of passive resistance. Major General Nott, who had marched from Kandahar to Kabul, reported that although his men were behaving well towards the Afghan population: I believe the enemy (I mean Futteh Jung's party and the rest of the people) are organising a system to bring our men to the same state of starvation to which General Elphinstone's army was reduced in hopes of the same results-while I think it is my duty to state this, I must declare that I will not, to please a few Afghans, who have already washed their hands from the blood of our countrymen, allow my army to be destroyed and my country to be dishonoured. There is grain in the country and I think it ought to be brought in immediately the same being paid for' .

We should not, however, underestimate the importance of religion. Henry Rawlinson, the Political Officer stationed in Kandahar, noted that many Afghans were angry with the British on religious grounds and that 'it is indeed the rock upon which we split' .

Nevertheless, the Afghans' chief problem was their internal divisions. The British were able to defeat the Afghans at Kandahar because the various factions would not agree on leadership and direction. Mirza Ahmad was recognized as the key leader amongst the Durrani Pashtuns, but Ata Mohammed claimed that he was better suited to take command. Arguments broke out between the Janbaz mutineers, the Ishaqzai and the Popalzai. No system of supply could be agreed and no one could be sure exactly how to pay for the support of the clansmen. Mirza Ahmad nevertheless attempted to organize the resistance and encouraged the mullahs of Kandahar to spread propaganda against the British, and to try to subvert the Muslim troops in British service.
However, in many cases, the appeal to join the Jihad against the British fell on deaf ears. Only a handful, barely 400, of the Barakzais from Helmand joined the rebellion. Dihrawat, under the jurisdiction of Yar Mohammed in Herat, also stayed quiet. It was not until late February that any more Helmandis felt compelled to fight, and then a lashkar of only 1,000 could be raised. This made one attempt to storm Gereshk but was driven off by a detachment of Indian troops. Supply problems in the harsh winter weather forced the force of 6,000 that had mustered outside Kandahar to break up again to search for food. 
105
General Nott believed it was necessary to draw the rebels into a decisive battle, so he was content to see the Afghan lashkars concentrating around the city. 106 However, when he marched out to fight them, he was frustrated by their tendency to fall back. He fought a series of three engagements between 7 and 10 March, which he believed had dispersed the rebels. There is some evidence to suggest that the Afghans were following a plan conceived by Mirza Ahmad to draw Nott further and further away from Kandahar. After an assembly of other forces lasting the entire day, a night attack on 10 March was made on the Herat gate of Kandahar. It was only driven off with some difficulty. The wooden gates had been set alight, and when they collapsed the Afghans stormed through. British and Indian troops, stiffened with artillery firing case shot, held the portal of the city for three hours. The Afghans rallied several times but their losses were considerable: it is estimated that 600 bodies were found around the gateway. By dawn they abandoned the attempt to storm the city. Mirza Ahmad was blamed for the débâcle, and only the news that Ghazni had been retaken offered an encouragement to the rebels. However, the numbers remaining at Mirza Ahmad's side fell to 1,500.

The rebellion in the south was saved, briefly, by the defection of Akhtar Khan. He brought with him a large number of Alizais, and the size of the force he deployed rewarded him with the offer of overall command. Consequently, on 29 May, 10,000 fighters began another advance on Kandahar. 111 They were stopped by Nott and defeated, and then forced to fall back to Ghorak. A second counter-attack by the British on 16 June compelled the rebels to split up, with Ata Mohammed and Mirza Ahmad journeying to Kabul, while others remained with Aktar in Zamindawar. The Durranis, noting that the British seemed to be contemplating evacuation of Kandahar, now sensed that the foreigners might be a useful means to break the power of the Barakzais, and they began to cooperate. Nevertheless, once the British had left in early August 1842, the Barakzai Khans returned and, with threats of force, demanded to be able to join the administration. The Durrani government led by Safdar Jang collapsed under this pressure, but resentment increased to the point where, in September that year, the Durranis once again drove the Barakzais out of the city. Alikozai and Popalzai clans also clashed in and around Kandahar, reflecting the same termination of unity that the clans had achieved temporarily against the British at Kabul.
At Qalat, Ghilzais of the Tokhi and Hotak clans had assembled very suddenly, having been uninvolved in the fighting before. They made one attack on the British outpost there on 21 May, were repulsed and then dispersed. Without reports on the clans' politics and movements, it is difficult to determine why this brief aggression occurred. The best guess that can be offered is that the clans, when informed of the reinvigoration of the revolt around Kandahar, the news of the fall of Ghazni and the existing evidence of the defeat of the British at Kabul, believed that they might be able to sack Qalat and seize the wealth that was housed there.
What had influenced the decision of the various clans and factions of the south to side with the British or to rebel was the legacy of the civil war before the time of Dost Mohammed. Durranis wanted to keep Shuja on the throne, or a Saddozai candidate, as long as they could keep out their rivals the Barakzai. If the Barakzai took Kabul, then they were even more determined to ensure that the Saddozai kept Kandahar. Rawlinson observed: 'their detestation of the Baruckzyes appears to be only inferior to their jealousy of our monopoly of power' . 
112
113
The British had deposed Dost Mohammed but found the alternatives unsuitable for their purposes of keeping Afghanistan neutral and free of the interference of Russia or Persia. In the 1830s, the British had sent warships to pressure the Persians to relinquish any influence over Herat. In 1856, they went to war with Persia on Afghanistan's behalf to free that city. Their diplomatic pressure on the Persian Shah after that date was constant. They also used diplomacy to establish a détente with Russia, roughly demarcating their exclusive areas of interest in 1873 and threatened war with Russia when the northern borderline came into dispute in 1885 at Penjdeh.
For the Afghans, Dost Mohammed was restored when Akbar Khan had defeated the rival factions of Sadozais and their allies. There were concerns that the British might return, but it was domestic security that was the perennial problem of the regime. With the Saddozai heirs driven off or discredited, Dost Mohammed was in fact in a stronger position, at least in terms of credibility and perhaps legitimacy. He and his supporters emphasized their role in having defeated foreign forces to ensure the independence of all Afghan Muslims.
However, he was aware that Afghanistan lacked an army that could ensure both internal security and hold off the British, a point driven home by the second invasion from India in 1842 which had stormed through the Khyber Pass, despite attempts to hold it. The difficulty was that, without changes in the means to acquire more revenue, including the taxation structure, it was difficult to raise a larger or more professional force. Nevertheless, the legacy of the British occupation was that the amount of tax being collected from the realm in the vicinity of Kabul had risen from 2.5 million to 7 million rupees. This was sufficient to raise a large enough force to wage war against his rivals in the north. Acquisition of the revenues of the north then offered the chance to sustain operations against the southern provinces, and subsequently against Herat.
The traditional army had preferred a core of light cavalry, some foot soldiers, and a collection of relatively poorly armed and untrained eljari militia, and success depended on being able to swarm en masse against isolated British or Indian detachments, or hold seemingly impregnable mountain terrain. The fact that large numbers of eljaris and clan warriors had been involved in the war, and had even enjoyed brief successes in the Khyber Pass, held out the possibility that a more universal military service might result.
The weapon that had proved surprisingly effective, as far as the British were concerned, was the jezail musket. The long barrel gave the Afghan jezailchi a greater range against the British and Indian musketeer, although the heavier ball and difficulty of reloading a fouled and hexagonal bore reduced the rate of fire to about one round every two or three minutes. To offset this problem, Afghans tended to carry two or three loaded weapons into action and, if advancing, all weapons were discharged before closing with sword and shield. The short sword, or 'Khyber knife' , was much feared because of its ease of concealment and the damage it could do. The cutting up of wounded personnel with this weapon had a psychological effect on British and Indian witnesses, and was mentioned frequently by survivors of the 1841 retreat from Kabul. But the jezail was better suited to the Afghan defence of mountainous terrain. Firers could take cover to reload, whereas sword or mounted attacks, for all their spirit, were often destroyed by volley fire from the British. There is much disagreement about the range of these weapons, with some claims being made that they could hit targets out to 500 yards, but this seems an exaggeration and may be explained by the Afghans occupying positions in cliffs practically above their targets, or, in the retreat from Kabul, being virtually unable to miss the densely-packed camp followers in narrow defiles. According to Vincent Eyre, 'the Afghans shot down our men with ease, and laughed at the musket balls [fired back at them]' . 114 Some jezails could also be supported by stands or bipods which allowed them to be aimed, and therefore enhanced their accuracy.
Eyre observed that the Afghans were 'invariably taking steady deliberate aim, and seldom throwing away a single shot; whereas our men seemed to fire entirely at random, without any aim at all' .

Afghan foot soldiers lacked the mobility of the cavalry, and could be used to hold ground for cavalry to advance from, but horsemen could also deliver the infantryman to the front line, and the cavalry occasionally dismounted as dragoons to engage the British with their jezails. At Kabul, this ability allowed them to increase their manoeuvrability. Lady Sale remarked that, although the Afghans had a reputation for assassinations which provoked condemnation from the British, they 'show no cowardice in standing as they do against guns without using any themselves, and in escalading and taking forts which we cannot retake' . 
118
The Afghans fought in the style of many South and Central Asian armies of this period, making use of gunpowder weapons and coordinating their use with the arme blanche. They understood the value of shock action, delivering charges with both infantry and cavalry, but they also knew not to attempt a stubborn defence when the odds were against them. Feudal cavalry were not prepared to risk losing their horses if the outcome was doubtful, and foot soldiers might make similar judgments if the chances of escape were in the balance. Withdrawing to fight another day when there were greater advantages and chances of success reflected the Afghans' pragmatic approach to warfare.
In terms of internal security, the feudal cavalry and militia forces were problematic. Local forces were likely to side with the rural population in times of rebellion, and the fact that so many had experienced the war against the British, and were so well-armed, was a concern for the rulers of Kabul. What was needed was a professional army led by an officer corps loyal to the Amir. Although the dynastic threat of rival leaders remained a perennial problem for the Amir, the threat of internal disorder and the loss of state revenue continued to bind the Afghan army into the administration in a fundamental way. Dost Mohammed's initial operations had been modest, concentrating against Jalalabad and Bamian. The northern territories were absorbed between 1849 and 1850, although Badakshan was not incorporated until 1859 and Maimena remained under Herat's jurisdiction until 1863. Peshawar was retaken briefly in 1849 after the defeat of the Sikhs by the British in 1848, but fears that the British might use the seizure of the city as an excuse to attack Afghanistan persuaded the Afghans to withdraw. A negotiated settlement with the British in 1855 awarded Peshawar to the British. In return Afghanistan obtained British support against Persia. Kandahar was taken in 1855 when Dost Mohammed's brothers there died, but Herat remained defiant. The Persian army captured the westernmost city in 1856, prompting the British to launch an amphibious operation against the Persians in the Gulf. In the Treaty of Paris which followed, the Persians managed to retain sympathizers in the city and prevent Kabul regaining full control. The British nevertheless supplied Dost Mohammed with 8,000 muskets and ammunition, and 500,000 rupees, with a further 100,000 rupees a month while the Anglo-Persian War was underway in 1856-7 to support him. This had the effect of ensuring that Dost Mohammed remained neutral during the Indian Mutiny, despite the urgings of some of his followers, and it also enabled Dost Mohammed to equip his army and march on Herat in 1863. The westernmost city of Afghanistan had to be besieged, but it fell just a few months before Dost Mohammed's death that year. Dost Mohammed believed that, sooner or later, the British would try to attack Afghanistan again and he was determined not to provoke any invasion. Diplomacy was the first line of defence. He had written to the Emir of Bokhara: '…I well know that my own kingdom, and that of Bokhara, will one day be annexed to the British territories. I have therefore entered into an alliance … with the view to keeping my country as long as possible' . 
119
When the British invaded, Afghanistan had just come through a civil war and Dost Mohammad controlled only one fiefdom in the whole country. Afghan-istan was divided, and Shah Shuja was eager to use the British military machine to obtain the restoration of the Sadozai line and exclusive power of the entire country. He needed an external backer to break the power of the Barakzai.
The British intervention exposed the divisions between Afghans, and although in the face of a foreign occupation these differences were settled temporarily, the fissures resurfaced soon after. Factions were prepared to use the presence of British forces to secure advantages for themselves, and the civil war resumed the moment the British had withdrawn. However, the Mohammadzai Barakzai could present themselves as the focus of the anti-foreign resistance. By contrast the Ghilzai were unable to assert themselves over the Zirak Durrani Pashtuns, despite being perhaps the most homogeneous fighting force. Loyalty to qawm was strong amongst Ghilzais when their autonomy was threatened, but they fragmented into parochial disputes which prevented the sort of unity the Mohammadzai could muster.
The Anglo-Afghan War had illustrated the weakness of conventional forms of resistance against a disciplined, professional army, but also the enduring advantages of guerrilla warfare, use of the environment and the power of 'mass' . Major Broadfoot, who took part in the fighting, concluded that the Afghans were: masters in mountain warfare…; skilful in choosing ground, and of a coolness never to be disconcerted; swift to advance, timely in retreat, and expert in both; their masses were seldom shown, hardly ever uncovered to our fire, yet never far away when a blow could be struck… Better arms, organization, and leaders would make them troops of the highest order; the want of them rendered the largest assemblages unworthy of the name of armies. 
120
Both the Civil War of the 1830s and the Anglo-Afghan War had been characterized by intrigues and treachery as much as conventional fighting. The pres-ence of foreigners made it possible to legitimize the quest for power and wealth as a religious struggle. Despite frequent negotiations between the leaders of the factions and the British, the ability to mobilize peasant farmers and mountain clansmen with a rhetoric of xenophobia and Jihadism was a lesson that the ruling Mohammedzai dynasty understood very well. To avoid civil war, Dost Mohammed hoped to exploit the weaknesses in his rivals and assert a more centralized government in which a loyal army would play a key role. The fact that Afghanistan had received an injection of Indian rupees, bullion and regular payments from the British in the 1850s greatly assisted Dost Mohammed's consolidation of power, but it could not prevent a new civil war.

On 22 September 1864 it was reported to the Assistant Secretary to the Government of the Punjab that unrest in Afghanistan was spreading. The chief complaint was the arbitrary conduct of Sher Ali. It was alleged that, although 'the Ameer had sworn on the Koran at Mazar Shareef to be true to his brother' , the treatment of Afzul Khan turned the Sirdars and the chiefs away from Sher Ali.

While Barakzais and their supporters in Kabul grew restive, relatives of Afzal Khan made an attempt to rouse the Barakzais families living in the Pashtun south. Sikunder Khan took 800 regular cavalry, via the Hazarajat to Kandahar. Even those the Amir considered loyal began to desert him. Sirdar Wali Mohammed Khan, whom Sher Ali had only just appointed Governor of Turkestan, fled to Bokhara to join Abdur Rahman. Opportunists across the border sensed a weakening of the power of the Afghans too. 'Hearing of Afzul Khan, the Oozbecks attacked the Afghans settled in the Taktapool districts, and according to their custom, carried off about a thousand families with their wives, children and property across the border' . This slavers' raid created terror on the northern frontier and one report noted 'the Toorkistan chiefs are in much excitement' . Sher Ali was perhaps fortunate that the Bokharans were in no position to exploit this crisis or assist Abdur Rahman and thus extend their own power over Turkestan since they were at that time engaged in a war with Khokand. Interestingly, both these states sent envoys to the British hoping for assistance.

Each entrenchment was occupied by two guns and two companies of infantry' . There was then a council of war. 'The Ameer ascended a hill and assembling all his officers round him declared the Heir Apparent and the sirdars of rank should advance with infantry and artillery and drive back the enemy' . Sirdar Mohammed Rufeek Khan and Sirdar Mhd Ibrahim Khan were allocated four regiments of infantry and eight guns and sent to the left flank while the heir apparent commanded the right flank. Mohammed Rufeek Khan wrote:
Next morning the Ameer ordered an advance from both flanks; he directed the Heir Apparent to advance against Sirdar Mohammed Ameen Khan and ordered [me] to attack Sirdar Mohammed Shureef Khan. Both wings of our force advanced and arrived opposite to the entrenchments/sungars of the sirdar. Their force consisted of 12 regiments [c.9,600 men], 6,000 cavalry and 26 guns.
It seems the Amir's army struggled to get the upper hand, and Mohammed Rufeek Khan found it necessary to explain events through the framework of traditional Afghan battle narratives of individual heroic combat:
We were severely engaged for four hours; at last the Ameer came to the assistance of the Heir Apparent. The fight raged on all sides and the Heir Apparent and the Sirdar Mohammed Ameen Khan found themselves face to face. Sirdar Mohammed Ameen Khan wounded the Heir Apparent with his sword. He then fired at him with a pistol. The ball entered above the eye and the Heir Apparent fell dead. Sirdar Mohammed Ameen Khan received 3 sword wounds from the Heir Apparent before he fell. Seeing their leader fall, five foot soldiers fired at Sirdar Mohammed Ameen Khan who was killed. The two chiefs fell within a few paces of each other. The Candahar force was defeated, their camp plundered and Sirdar Mohammed Shureef Khan fled.
The newswriter in Kabul gave a different account, noting that, at first, the Amir was losing the battle: 'His force … was being defeated and was dispirited' . 
12
13
The newswriter noted that the battle had not been decisive: 'Sirdar Mohammed Shureef Khan with the Candahar army and several guns, is encamped at Gurinaha in the Julduk district. Sirdar Mohammed Shareef Khan's force has lost nothing; a few articles of small value belonging Mohammed Ameen Khan's army have been plundered. The Candahar army has lost 18 guns' but 'up the 7 th of June, none of the Candahar force had tendered much enthusiasm to the Ameer' . Sher Ali attempted to resolve the conflict in the same way he had tackled the northern rebellion the year before, by offering to negotiate, but the rebels remained defiant. 'The Ameer held out an offer to Sirdar Mohammed Shareef Khan who replied on behalf of himself and the chiefs that they would only give up with their lives, [in] the hope of revenging the death of Sirdar Mohammed Ameen Khan, and that he did not consider the death of the Heir Apparent an equivalent to the death of the Sirdar' . Sher Ali was unable to make many decisions immediately after the battle because he was stricken with grief, retreating to the Shrine of the Cloak of the Prophet in Kandahar. When Mohammed Afzul Khan heard of the loss of the Heir Apparent, he reminded the Amir: 'You have done irreparable injury and have brought upon yourself a sorrow that you will carry with you to the grave' . The Amir's loyalists nevertheless took the view that the rebel leaders should be punished: Sirdar Mohammed 'Suvrier' Khan, son of Sirdar Mohammed Amin Khan, and Taj Mohammed Khan Popalzai were bound hand and foot, and it is reported that Taj Mohammed had his ears cut off and his nose slit. It is estimated that 2,500 were killed and wounded on both sides in the battle, but it is not recorded how many were subsequently executed. The Kabul newswriter noted that 'Many of the slain belonged to the royal family' .
The paralysis of the Amir and the news that some of the Kandahar rebels were still in the field encouraged Abdur Rahman and his brother Azam to exploit a new rebellion that had broken out in the north. The fighting began on 5 August with a mutiny amongst unpaid Kabuli and Turkistani troops at Takhtapul that local people joined. 
14
15
In the midst of revolt, Sher Ali tried to exercise divide et impera. The Amir offered to appoint Mohammed Sharif Khan to be Governor of Kabul, ordering him to lead four regiments of infantry, each 400 strong, a battery of artillery and 1,000 horsemen against the northern rebels. Mohammed Sharif Khan refused. 
16
Although Kabul was still secure, the Amir felt it necessary to remain in Kandahar, which 'he considered his capital' . While he was busy writing to Pashtun leaders to gain support, he did not at first announce news of the Turkistan revolt to the Kandaharis, fearing the consequences. However, he was aware that he could cultivate support amongst the Pashtuns and rouse them against a rebel army which was largely northern in composition. He also tried economic warfare by stopping caravans going north so as to prevent goods reaching the territories under Abdur Rahman's control.

20
By the autumn of 1865, the Amir's authority appeared to be breaking down altogether. The Governor of Jelalabad, Shahmurd Khan, warned that Sirdar Mohammed Afzul Khan's supporters were preparing for revolt in his area and he wanted troops and guns to make a show of force against them. Neighbouring clans detected the opportunity to strike too. Turcoman raiders about 600 strong crossed the border to raid north-west Afghanistan, but were driven off by the forces of the Amir's son, Yakub Khan, in Herat. Many of the Amir's loyal followers pleaded with him to go to Kabul to take charge of the expedition to the north and snuff out the revolt before the situation got worse.

The solution to this breakdown was to develop further Dost Mohammed's idea of a professional standing army that owed its loyalty to the ruling dynasty and not the qawm and ethnic factions of the country. When Sher Ali made his first visit to India in 1869, a request for military assistance was at the top of the agenda. Britain refused to offer substantial aid, but did agree to the provision of some arms and the opportunity to recruit retired British Non Commissioned Officers as military advisors. The training teams would also bring with them engineering skills that could be used to develop a rudimentary arms manufacturing base.
In Dost Mohammed's second reign, regiments had been formed neither by conscription nor voluntarism, but by seizing quotas of men with threats to the family that they would either be imprisoned or ruined. Pay for foot soldiers, when it was paid at all, amounted to 5 rupees a month. Discipline was harsh with capital punishment or torture for minor infractions. Command was devolved to provinces and districts with no single chief of staff who might threaten the political order. For all its faults, this had produced a regular army that was, to quote Sir Bartle Frere: 'quite equal in armament, skill, and drill to any corps in our service' .

Even with the growth and development of the army in the 1870s, Sher Ali feared it was no match for the modern forces of the British or the Russians. This was a decade of rapid technological change. The British had armed themselves with single-shot breech-loading rifles, rifled artillery, and there were experiments with machine guns. The British possessed telegraph communications, as well as tinned rations to sustain themselves on campaign all year long, and the railway network in India would soon terminate on the Afghan frontier.

The Second Anglo-Afghan War: Amir Sher Ali's strategy Relations with Britain had been strained for some years before the outbreak of the Second Anglo-Afghan War. Sher Ali had not been recognized as Amir by Britain in 1863 and the Government of India under Lord Lawrence, following the policy that had been announced in 1842 (specifically, that the British would recognize any government that could establish itself in Kabul), had actually recognized his rival Afzal Khan as Amir. Belatedly, Sher Ali had also been granted diplomatic recognition when he finally secured power in 1869, but he did not forget the slight. Sher Ali believed that the British policy had actually encouraged the coups and revolts of the 1860s. In fact, fratricidal and patricidal warfare, and faction fighting amongst the leading Pashtun qawm, had been an established element of Afghan politics for generations and the British view would have made little difference to the ambitions of Sher Ali or his rivals. Moreover, Sher Ali's reception at the ceremonial durbar at Ambala in 1869 had been lavish, with generous British support: the Government of India had told Sher Ali it would 'view with severe displeasure any attempt on the part of your rivals to disturb your position as ruler of Cabul and rekindle civil war' . 
40
41
42
However, the fall of Kokend in 1876, the last independent realm in the region, seemed to herald another phase of Russian expansion. Operations were also being conducted by the Russians against the Turcomans, a nomadic people who lived astride the line determined in the European capitals. The British were themselves eager to acquire a secure frontier from which they could launch operations deep inside Afghanistan should the Russians attempt to advance on India. In 1876, the British took up a post at Quetta in Baluchistan and the following year began to assert their influence across this province. Afghanistan regarded Baluchistan as a feudatory principality, and so Sher Ali had cause to fear that his country was about to be crushed from two directions. The unwelcome arrival of a Russian delegation in Kabul in 1878, at the height of a confrontation between Britain and Russia near Constantinople, caused anger and alarm in India and seemed to confirm to Sher Ali that there was little to choose between the two European empires. His strategy was to continue to keep both empires at arm's length and, if attacked, to ally himself with one against the other.
The Viceroy, Lord Lytton, demanded that a British delegation be permitted to establish itself permanently in Kabul, but Sher Ali refused. 
43
44
46
47
The second element of Sher Ali's strategy was to obtain Russian support. He abandoned Kabul in order to concentrate the bulk of his army in the northern provinces where they could marry up with the Russians. General Kaufman had assembled 30,000 troops in Central Asia in the early summer of 1878 and Sher Ali expected to get, as he put it, 'financial and military assistance so that I may return to avenge myself ' . 
48
The Afghan army of 1879, while numerous, was unable to offer effective resistance to the British. There was considerable rivalry between regiments that were recruited from different localities, and the infrequent and irregular nature of soldiers' pay fostered desertion. Lists subsequently seized by the British in Kabul suggested that Sher Ali had wanted to introduce universal military service, but there was a lack of officers and trainers who could convert large numbers of conscripts into a modern army. There were, in common with other Asian countries in this period, attempts to emulate the Western model, even to the extent that British uniforms were copied, but this outward change concealed the lack of real transformation. One British journalist wrote: 'Shere Ali might be able to distribute Enfield and Snider rifles amongst his sepoys, fit out batteries with every kind of shot and shell, and teach his men such rudimentary discipline as would enable them to march in fairly good order; but he could not get beyond this' . 
49
The British believed that the Afghan fighter was just unsuited to service in a regular army. One observer concluded: 'The Afghan does not lack native courage, and in hill warfare he is unrivalled so long as it takes the shape of guerrilla fighting; but once he is asked to sink his identity and to become merely a unit in a battalion he loses all self-confidence, and is apt to think more of getting away than of stubbornly holding his ground as he would have done with his friends, led by his own malik or chief ' . 
50
The artillery was regarded as the elite arm of the Afghan forces, having been developed by the introduction of British guns in 1869. Traditional brass smooth-bore guns of small calibre had been held in the various fortresses of Afghanistan, but the Amir was eager to replicate as many of the British rifled guns as he could. He ordered his chief military engineer and gunsmith, Surferaz, to copy the guns he had been given, but the experiments failed and Surferaz was imprisoned. He then dispatched another engineer to Peshawar, where the British obligingly showed him around the arsenal and allowed him to study the manufacturing of artillery and the means by which rifled bores were made. He returned to Kabul with model guns and scale drawings and was given an unlimited supply of metalworkers and cash by the Amir to turn out the new artillery. Iron was imported from India. The gun barrels were first fashioned by hand, and the bore was cut by machinery driven by a watermill at Deh-i Afghan, which was designed, according to the genealogies favoured by the Afghans: 'by a Hindustani named Muah Khan [who] learned his trade from a negro, named Belal, who was taught by one Ibrahim, a native of Isphahan, who came years ago from Persia in the service of Sultan Jan, late governor of Herat' . 
51
52
Similar problems of low quality affected Afghan gunpowder manufacturing. There were six major mills in Kabul and a number of smaller facilities around the country, which the British estimated could produce a ton of black powder every day in wartime. Sulphur was extracted at Bamian, saltpetre was made at Kabul and charcoal derived from the willow trees in Chardeh. However, the processes of mixing were rough and therefore the charges were lower than British ones, which tended to diminish the range of Afghan weapons. Fuses for exploding shells were also of poor design, causing accidents and duds. However, these defects did not detract from the Afghans' ability to develop their own armaments industry. The British underestimated the number of modern rifles the Afghans possessed, and were surprised by the weight of fire that the Afghans could lay down.
The greatest problem was the lack of training. Gunners were issued one artillery round with which to test the barrel, but there was no 'live-firing' practice. Consequently artillerymen were trying to learn how to operate their guns in combat for the first time. On 8 October 1879, Afghan gunners fought an artillery duel with the British in Sherpur from their position on the Asmai Heights. They did not inflict any casualties at all. By contrast, at Sang-i Nawishta, British gunners were able to score direct hits on the Afghan guns, which severely demoralized the Amir's men.

In November 1878, at the outbreak of war, the British Khyber Line Force set out to seize the fortress of Ali Musjid at the mouth of the Khyber Pass. 
59
The British decided on an encirclement of the position, using mountain paths to the north to get behind the defences. The advance took longer than expected because of the terrain; they were forced to bivouac overnight and then compelled to move in single file whereupon they arrived 'in a state of considerable exhaustion from exposure, heat and want of water' .

At dawn the next day, the British discovered that the Afghan garrison had slipped away under cover of darkness. Some 300 Afghans in the most forward positions had been left behind and were captured.

However, from the Afghan perspective, they had fought long enough to delay the British and took the pragmatic decision to abandon the fort when its fall seemed certain. Nevertheless, the action was clearly an Afghan defeat. The Official History noted that the Afghan camp had been left 'precipitously' because nothing had been taken with them. There was also reference to the fact that the Afghan troops were 'harried and looted' by Afridi Pashtuns as they withdrew. Certainly there were problems of command and communications. One relieving column of Afghan infantry, seemingly unaware of the battle at Masjid the day before, was scattered by a British ambush and its commander was persuaded to surrender with 300 of his men. The rest were eager to get away via the mountains.
In 1877, Major General Frederick Roberts had written that a military intervention in Afghanistan and the reorganization of the defence of India along the Hindu Kush should be accompanied by the recruitment of Afghan troops. This would ensure local security and be 'very different to the present, where, although we do hold the issues from the mountains, we are liable to be continually harassed from the existence of inimical neighbours on our immediate border' .

News of the Amir's flight from Kabul was reported to be the prelude to the collapse of resistance in the capital: 'Before his departure the Amir appeared to have lost all authority at Kabul, while his army had been weakened by numerous desertions' . 
71
72
Low-intensity raiding on the British lines of communication by Mohmands continued, although certain rival families saw advantage in siding with the British. The Zakka Khel Afridis continued to offer resistance, and there was sniping at night into British hilltop picquets. 
73
74
Nevertheless, on 28 January 1879, the British received intelligence that their expedition into the Bazar Valley had created a fear amongst the neighbouring Afridis that they could also expect a visitation and punitive action. It seemed that news had passed quickly between the various clans and some attempt was being made to assemble all the Afridis, Mohmands and Utman Khels and to coordinate an attack from Kabul. Rumours suggested the attack would commence on 7 February. The objective appeared to be Jalalabad. The news that the British had taken prisoners and sent them into exile in India was particularly prominent as a cause of the unrest, and it was alleged that 20,000 men had been seen gathering on 2 February in Kunar 'on instructions from Kabul' . 
75
The various clans also had considerable problems in coordinating any anti-British resistance even when they agreed to cooperate. The Mohmands and Bajaurs had not heard that the Shinwaris, Khugianis and Ghilzais around Jalalabad had called off their offensive. The reason for this is unclear, although contemporary British accounts maintained that the death of Mir Akhor, a charismatic mullah who embodied the Afghan resistance, had been the cause. Conflicting rumours about the resistance were mirrored in various reports emanating from Kabul. 
76
Lieutenant General Maude, who commanded British forces against the Zhaka Khels and Afridis, was eager to limit his operations, despite punitive measures in the first two months of 1879. He was conscious that fighting every village that resisted would invite 'a general Afridi war' , and he was aware that the Government of India was eager to avoid unnecessary clashes with the border clans. 
77
The deployments of the Afghan forces on the frontier confirmed a defensive strategy. Yakub Khan, Sher Ali's son nominated to be the garrison commander, held a reserve at Kabul on the Siah Sang heights numbering 7,800 with 25 guns. Another force was deployed at Butkhak, possibly with the bulk of the irregulars holding the passes. Another 9,000 men were held at Ghazni to prevent the southern flank being turned. Rather than being unpopular, Yakub Khan was 'most active in organizing his troops' and was 'greatly aided in this by the preaching of the mulla[h]s' . Although the Afghan leaders were attempting to generate a sense of the nation and the faith in peril, to the British this anti-foreign sentiment was further evidence of the 'passions and fanaticism of the Afghans' . 
78

While negotiations were underway, the British were forced to contend with aggressive Ghilzais who cared little for the diplomatic concerns of Kabul. Shinwari villagers attacked a British road survey party on 14 March 1879. The resistance appears to have been spontaneous, but was almost certainly sparked by anxiety that a road would assist foreign forces to enter and dominate the local area, perhaps leading to a complete loss of their independence. About fifty men, perhaps a hastily formed arbakai, attacked the survey group with long knives while villagers showered the British with stones, but they were no match for British firearms. By the time the survey party had reached open ground, they were being pursued by upwards of 300 fighters. 
81
Meanwhile Asmatullah Khan, a Ghilzai leader, had gathered 1,500 men and travelled towards Fatehabad in order to encourage more Ghilzais and the Khugianis to join him, and to make an attack on those who were collaborating with the British. The despatch of a British column to intercept Asmatullah seemed to have succeeded in dispersing the lashkar by the beginning of April without a shot being fired, and the Ghilzai territories simmered, awaiting better opportunities. Once again, the difficulties for the Afghans and Pashtuns to achieve any coordinated resistance were evident. The British tried to minimize their presence and avoided occupations, choosing instead to make devastating raids on property, livestock and crops. At the same time British finances had neutralized the resistance of several clans, and, despite occasional raids to secure vulnerable goods, mules or horses, the Khyber Pass resistance was contained.
The neutralizing of the Khyber Pass left the Afghan army somewhat isolated against the British. What Major General Roberts, the commander of the Kurram Valley Field Force, hoped to do was to screen the pro-British Shia population in the Kurram valley and to inflict a decisive defeat on the Afghan regulars on the border. His instructions were to secure the cooperation of the Ahmedzai Ghilzais, who tended to migrate across the Suleiman range and winter along the Kurram, and to seize Khost inside Afghanistan.

Resistance was maintained until 12.30 hrs, when Afghan units began to abandon the ridges and the kotal. British artillery fire, particularly from mountain guns brought up onto the ridge, was ranging down on the flanks and rear, having already destroyed a number of Afghan cannons. Roberts, still unable to get past the ravine astride the ridge, decided to break off his attack and push into depth behind the Afghan position.

The British operations in Khost were less successful than hoped. Akram Khan, the governor, had agreed that, in return for a guarantee of order in the region, the British would ensure his personal safety.

Nevertheless, the main British thrust into Afghanistan was virtually unopposed. Kandahar fell on 8 January 1879 after token resistance by a force of Afghan cavalry at Ghlo Kotal outside the city. 
97
98
The new Amir, Yakub Khan, who was son of Sher Ali, could see there was little hope of successful resistance. Kandahar had fallen. The British were at Qalat. The regular army had been defeated at Ali Masjid and Peiwar Kotal. The clans of the Khyber Pass, in contrast to their actions in 1842, were cooperating with the British. Khost had been occupied without opposition and, although the British had been driven out, the Khostwals were hardly favourably disposed towards his regime. In despair, Yakub Khan signed the Treaty of Gandamack in May 1879. By its terms, imposed deliberately at the very site of the last stand of the Kabul garrison in 1842 in order to expunge the memory of the British defeat, Afghanistan lost control over its foreign policy, was compelled to accept a British residency, was incorporated into the economic system of India and was forced to relinquish authority over the borderlands astride the Suleiman range. Afghanistan was rendered a British protectorate and Sher Ali's strategy had failed.
Major Cavagnari dictated the terms with some impatience. He wrote to the Viceroy: 'I found the whole lot to be pretty much of the ordinary Afghan stamp, and their avarice and suspicion were their leading qualities. Their arguments were so feeble and far from the point that I at once made up my mind to deal with the case as if it concerned an ordinary affair connected with border Pathan tribes' .

Renewed violence against the British occurred soon after the Residency had been set up in the capital. In September 1879, soldiers from Herat who were stationed in Kabul mutinied and marched on the Residency because they had not been paid their arrears. Unrest similarly affected Herat and Kandahar where regiments had also not been paid. They understood that the British were the paymasters of the Afghan army, and the Amir Yakub Khan did indeed enjoy a subsidy of 600,000 rupees per annum from the Government of India. The mood of the mutineers in Kabul was evidently anti-British. They jeered the Kabuli regiments that had been defeated by the foreigners, and even when paid a portion of their salaries from the Bala Hissar they demanded to know why no one was throwing the British out of the city. Mullahs exhorted the Kabuli residents to action. To remove the threat, leave was granted for 40 days, which many took advantage of since cholera had broken out in the city and 150 soldiers had died from the disease in the 24 hours prior to the unrest. 
101
102
103
General Roberts immediately set out to reoccupy Kabul and the Amir was placed under house arrest. Intelligence had been procured that suggested the Amir had counselled his leading courtiers, the representatives of the Ghilzais, Kohistanis, Kabulis and Kizilbashes. It is alleged he asked them whether they all 'intended to join in a ghaza to fight the British' . 
104
105
When Roberts made a rapid advance, Yakub Khan initially gave himself up, ostensibly for protection against his own people, and then abdicated soon after. The British believed that, if he could not protect a British envoy within a stone's throw of the Bala Hissar or even ensure his own safety, he was 'of no real use as an ally' . 
106
107
The Afghans had abandoned the hills at Charasiab, but Roberts was aware that the population was hostile and that he dare not engage in street battles which would result in heavier casualties. Indeed, the day after the battle, large numbers of irregular fighters gathered to attack the British rearguard and transport, and were only driven off with some sustained volleys by two battalions. At Asmai, the hills overlooking the Chardeh plain to the east of Kabul, three regular Afghan regiments under Mohammed Jan Khan of Wardak had entrenched themselves with several guns. The British cavalry enveloped the position hoping to prevent their escape, and a force of British infantry with mountain guns made its way along the same ridge, but was unable to close with the Afghan force during the day.

To the south, General Stewart had reoccupied Kandahar, again without opposition, and pushed up to Qalat in order to draw Afghan troops away from Kabul. Although he had insufficient transport to reach Ghazni, he managed to send forward a small screening force of 350 men to Shahjui (Shahjoy). These troops encountered a Ghilzai lashkar numbering no more than 900 that may have been assembling to contest Stewart's advance. The Afghans withdrew to a hill fort some 6 miles from the settlement and were immediately attacked there. Although the Ghilzai leader, Sahib Jan, managed to charge the British and Indian troops and get to close quarters, he and another sixty of his men were killed and the rest were scattered.
The Afghans were aware that Roberts' force at Kabul was relatively small, in fact 8,000 in total. They were also bitterly opposed to his presence near the city and incensed by the military tribunals that were carried out against the ringleaders of the attack on the British Residency. The difficulty in identifying the individuals responsible, and Lytton's private advice to Roberts that many Kabulis, indeed 'every civilian, be he priest, or layman, mullah or peasant' , were guilty by association, made the atmosphere highly charged. 
117
118

121
In order to obtain supplies for the winter, especially as the passes might be closed by bad weather or by harassing raids, Roberts dispatched foraging parties. On 22 November one of these was attacked by irregulars at Dara Nirikh valley in Wardak. 
122
Further north, Mir Bacha, a Kohistani leader, drove out the Britishappointed governor with popular backing. Links were soon established between communities in Maiden and Wardak under the leadership of Mohammed Jan, an Afghan regular army officer who had commanded the artillery at Ali Masjid. The conduit for negotiations between the various communities around Kabul was the ulema. Many had served as acolytes of Mushki-i Alam and so his calls for resistance had a particular resonance and made him an obvious choice as leader. The governor of Ghazni, Mohammed Syed, abandoned the city and arrived in Kabul on 18 November claiming the mullahs had taken control there, gathering 'several thousand tribesmen from the villages in the district' . 
123
However, the Afghans of Wardak were not simply heading for Kabul. They were attempting to link up with the Kohistanis and then advance together with overwhelming numbers against the British. Macpherson asked to be able to move instead against the Kohistanis who were assembling in large numbers at Mir Karez, just 10 miles north-west of Kabul. While pretending to fall back on Sherpur, he struck north-westwards and drove off the Afghans who held the Kriskana gorge and then scattered the Kohistanis assembling near Mir Karez. The Afghans did not withdraw northwards into their own territory, but evaded pursuing British cavalry as best they could and moved in groups of various sizes in a south-westerly direction. Roberts hoped to catch this movement on the horns of Baker's brigade that was now swinging through Wardak back towards Kabul. To ensure the destruction of the Afghans, a force of British cavalry under Brigadier General Massy was deployed to complete the encirclement. In fact, what the British had not realized was that the Afghans were not in retreat but moving to join 10,000 of Mohammed Jan's Wardak and Maiden fighters who had reached the Chardeh Plain. This area, full of cultivation and settlements, could conceal large numbers within striking distance of Kabul, and provide the supplies that such a vast force needed.
When the small cavalry force under Massy engaged Mohammed Jan's army, the Afghans had the advantages of numbers and cover. Moreover, they adopted more dispersed formations than Afghan regular troops. An officer of the 9 th Lancers wrote: 'the RHA [Royal Horse Artillery] opened fire, but as they [the Afghans] were in such straggling order, only a few were killed' . 
124
125
He decided to move towards the Deh Mazang gorge, the gap in the Asmai heights that led directly into the city of Kabul. However, a small force of British riflemen from the 72 nd Highlanders held this vital ground and Mohammed Jan's formation was forced to take up a new position on the Takht-i Shah mountain where it could overlook the city and the Bala Hissar. There was no further movement on either side for the rest of the day on 10 December 1879, but at night a number of attacks were launched against the Highlanders at Deh Mazang. Sangars were constructed amid the boulder-strewn slopes.
Meanwhile, Baker's brigade found itself under attack as it passed through Maiden from Wardak and Lohar clansmen, although initially it was only the baggage train that was targeted. At Argandeh, close to the Chardeh Plain, the Afghans tried to block a pass, but they were driven off. Baker was ordered to return to Sherpur where Roberts was concentrating his forces, but the rearguard was subjected to constant sniping. Meanwhile the British tried to dislodge Mohammed Jan from the Takht-i Shah with infantry assaults. The weight of Afghan fire proved to be so heavy and sustained, the slopes so steep and broken, that only the Sher Darwaza heights could be captured before ammunition started to run low. As darkness gathered, the British troops bivouacked in their positions and there was a renewed assault in the morning via the Beni Hissar spur.
Mohammed Jan seemed to be holding his position on the mountain awaiting the arrival of more fighters from Kohistan and elsewhere. He held the high ground, had checked two British attacks in two days and felt secure on the heights. Moreover, as the British started their new attack on 13 December, Kabulis emerged from the suburbs to join him. George White, who led the vanguard of the British assault with the 92 nd Highlanders and the Guides, tried to prevent the Afghan reinforcements from linking up with those on the summit, and there was a close-quarter battle which the British won. These Afghans withdrew back down the mountain and reoccupied the villages and compounds as well as the lower slopes of the Beni Haissar. White then brought up mountain guns and, using a combination of fire and manoeuvre, fought his way to the summit, while the other British force pushed their way along the ridgeline to join them. The Afghans contested every yard of ground.
More importantly, while the British forces fought their way up the western slopes, Mohammed Jan directed some of his men to seize two villages which lay in their rear. Baker, the commander there, was forced to use his reserves to retake these villages with more close-quarter fighting. As soon as this was done, he was informed that another Afghan force was circling around his troops and heading for Sherpur, the British base. The British cavalry sent to intercept them was then pinned down with fighting around the Siah Sang heights. More fighters were gathering in Kabul and the local area. It was a situation where, as one historian put it, 'as fast as one gathering was dispersed another appeared in a different direction' . 
126
Roberts was forced to give up the Deh Mazang defile because he lacked enough troops to hold the ground and thus concentrated his force at Sherpur, holding only the Takht-i Shah heights with a small detachment. He and many of his officers were encouraged by the fact that the Afghans often dispersed when attacked, but those with experience of fighting on the North West Frontier knew that this dispersal was temporary. By the morning of 14 December, Mohammed Jan had moved his men back around the Takht-i Shah and occupied a new position on the Asmai heights to the west of the British base at Sherpur. Roberts once again used a pincer movement to clear these hills, and the Afghan forces withdrew. However, the long-awaited Kohistanis arrived at the northern end of the heights and overwhelmed the British infantry and mountain battery there, despite a determined defence. Meanwhile, more of Mohammed Jan's forces had occupied the Siah Sang and others were moving north-eastwards around the British cantonment at Sherpur, attempting to join hands with the Kohistanis and complete the encirclement of the British forces. From the Asmai heights, still more Afghans could be seen streaming north and eastwards across the Chardeh Plain. 127 At 14.00 hrs that day, Roberts ordered his units to withdraw into the cantonment, abandoning the city and all the high ground that surrounded it. Extraction from the Takht-i Shah involved a fight more or less the entire way, and as they passed through the suburbs of Kabul they came under fire from walls and houses, but they reached the relative security of Sherpur by the end of the day. The Butkhak garrison was also brought in unscathed. However, the British forces had suffered losses of 81 killed and 213 wounded in a week, and found themselves 'locked up, closely besieged, after a jolly good licking and all communications with the outer world cut off ' . 
128
129
For two days, the Afghans did not make any move against the British defences, and on 17 December, when a British cavalry formation left the perimeter, the Afghans who tried to attack it were subjected to accurate artillery fire. Nevertheless, at night, enterprising fighters would try to shoot sentries on the walls and a number of groups tried to get close to the ramparts and had to be driven off. In the city, Mohammed Jan's men loopholed walls, perhaps expecting the British to make a counter-attack. 
130
What determined Mohammed Jan's next actions was not Roberts' silence over the terms he had offered but the news from the Ghilzais that a British relief force was on its way. The Afghans believed they had to overwhelm the garrison at Sherpur or risk facing a larger force. The plan was for a diversionary attack to be made at night on 22/23 December on the southern walls, while the signal for the main attack on the eastern side would be the lighting of a large beacon on the Asmai heights. Once inside, the southern attack would be renewed. The aim was to split the British forces and make entry via the houses and narrow corridors and streets of Beymaru. News of the proposed attack spread to the Ghilzais on the Khyber Line who moved westwards to join in. 
131
The ghazis led the attack, but almost immediately the British threw up star shells which illuminated the entire battlefield. For three hours, the garrison used sustained rifle, artillery and machine-gun fire to cut down the assaulting Afghans, and at first light it was apparent that the Afghans had not broken through. Nevertheless three sides of the cantonment were under attack when, just before 10.00 hrs, the Afghans gained a lodgement on the eastern end of the Beymaru heights. However, some had begun to drift away believing that the British could not be overwhelmed, and this allowed the garrison to venture out and bring defilade fire on the lodgement made in the hills. As these men fell back, the British commenced a counter-attack, and pushed the attackers out of the Beymaru village area on the eastern side. Individuals and small groups tried to hold on to some houses and compounds, but it was clear the assault had failed. The retreat became general and the British, taking no chances, pursued the Afghans relentlessly. Roberts estimated that, for around 33 British and Indian casualties, the Afghans may have suffered more than 3,000 killed and wounded. The defeat was psychological as well as physical. It was evident that the British could not be defeated in a conventional battle, particularly if they held defensive positions. The lesson of the Battle of Sherpur was to return to attrition, severing British logistics and attacking more isolated detachments.
When the British sent a punitive force to destroy the villages controlled by Mir Bacha, Afghans in the surrounding districts were eager to make their submission. Supplies of food and fodder were handed over, despite the risk of hardship for themselves throughout the winter. Some livestock were killed because there was no longer fodder to feed them. Martial law was re-imposed in Kabul and more defences were constructed at Sherpur and in the surrounding hills. Compounds and houses close to the cantonment were destroyed and the inhabitants driven out. Along the Khyber Line, the Ghilzais found some villages temporarily occupied, but their attacks ceased when the assault at Sherpur failed.
Yet Afghan resistance was not entirely extinguished. With the defeat of the attack at Sherpur, the fighting clans drew off and sacked the wards of Kabul that belonged to the Hazaras and Kizilbashis, since they regarded them as pro-British.

In January 1880, Abdur Rahman returned to northern Afghanistan to raise an army amongst the old regulars, the clans of the north and his relations amongst the men of Badakshan.

141
When the British bivouacked at Jan Murad, 70 miles south of Ghazni, a war party of Hazaras swept into the Pashtun settlement and looted the properties, killing anyone who offered resistance. The British believed that they would get the blame for this sectarian and ethnic pogrom, but the Hazaras understood that the Pashtuns would not bring in a retaliatory lashkar under the very noses of the British. They were exploiting the temporary shift in power for their own advantage.
On 18 April, there was more certain intelligence on the assembly of 9,000 Ghilzais who were moving on a parallel track just 10 miles from the British. This force encamped at a point only 4 miles from Stewart's division, but a reconnaissance patrol the next morning found that the camp was deserted and the fighters had moved off during the early hours. Later that day, this same Afghan force appeared astride the road to Ghazni, but its numbers had swollen to 15,000. They had moved from behind, passed the British and now blocked the route, while others had perhaps come down from Ghazni itself. While Stewart deployed to make an attack that would pin the Afghans astride the road and roll up their right flank, the bulk of the Ghilzai force swept off the hills straight for him. Despite this massed attack, some Afghan irregulars did not join the charge and held back. 
142
143
144
Despite the weight of fire, the Afghan swordsmen were able to crash into the British firing line and engage in hand-to-hand fighting. The British artillery on the right had started to run out of ammunition and was withdrawn when the Afghans reached within 30 yards of their muzzles. On the Afghan right, the horsemen punched through the 19 th Bengal Lancers and rode into depth, through the medical posts. However, the Afghan attack lost momentum, and, without reserves, it had no means to exploit the success of the initial shock wave. The reserve Indian cavalry made flank attacks, while in the centre the disciplined British and Gurkha regiments did not break and run, but maintained their cohesion. They shot down large numbers of the Afghans immediately in front of them with volley fire. Reserve artillery plunged fire onto the Afghan horsemen that had ridden into depth and who were heading towards the column's baggage. The Afghans were hurled back, and then started to stream away. Some 2,000 Hazaras, waiting a mile or two from the battle, pursued the defeated Ghilzais, killing as many as they could. 
145
When Stewart arrived at Ghazni, the 'shadow government' had deserted the city, but there were cavalry patrols that reported a force of 6,000 at Arzu and Shalez, villages that lay just 5 miles from the British encampment. Moreover, it was said that 30,000 irregulars had assembled under Mushk-i Alam in the region. The British despatched a force of 2,800 men to disperse the Afghans at Arzu and Shalez, but the compound walls of these villages proved impregnable to British artillery fire and despite feigning a withdrawal to tempt the Afghans out, there was no movement. Yet the arrival of the British force appeared to have the effect of encouraging more local clans to join the original defiant band in the villages. The British brought up reinforcements, and when it seemed the escape route would be cut off, the Afghans evacuated the settlements. If there was any plan to repeat the charge at Ahmed Khel there was no evidence of it here.
Nor were the Afghans able to lure the British from their line of march into the hills. The British continued their advance to Kabul, while the resistance remained at large in rural areas. To underline the point, a force of 1,200 men of the Guides and the 92 nd Highlanders who were patrolling Logar were confronted with a lashkar at Chikildukhtaran near Charasiab. The fighting began in the early morning and more irregulars arrived from nearby villages as the day wore on until about 5,000 were assembled. The Afghans used rifle fire to suppress the British movements and then used cover to inch forward until they were within 200 yards of the British firing line. An attempt was made to edge around the right flank but a detachment of British cavalry was deployed into a village to the right rear, and fire from here stopped the Afghan manoeuvre. It seems that efforts were made to encourage a final charge. One officer recorded: 'At one moment, they rose up all round with a shout and threatened to break over us like a great wave… men felt for their pistols and instinctively tightened their grip on their swords' but the attack never materialized. 
146
Further north it was reported that Mir Bacha, the Kohistani leader, was eager to take revenge for the destruction of his property and the defeat of his forces at Sherpur. Along the Khyber Line there were repeated attacks, but almost all of these appeared to be for the chance of loot from the baggage trains constantly moving up to Kabul. At Jalalabad, an audacious raid resulted in 1,000 cattle being herded off into the hills. However, reports were also received of a mullah, Khalil, preaching Jihad against the British at Ghoshta and Besud.
A lashkar of 2,000 men affiliated to Khalil was surprised by a British ambush: 70 were killed and the rest dispersed. Khalil nevertheless escaped and continued to rouse the clans in Kama amongst the Mohmands. Another force of 1,000 Pashtuns under the charismatic leadership of Mullah Faqir was similarly destroyed near Abi Boghan, but Mullah Faqir reappeared later in Laghman in league with Asmatullah Khan, the latter keeping up resistance near Jagdalak. Yet, in August 1880, when the British garrison withdrew and took with it the entire Khyber Line detachments, a total of 24,000 personnel, the Ghilzais did not attack. They contented themselves with picking up abandoned stores, some of which became the scene of bitter inter-clan skirmishes. 
148
The Battle of Maiwand has been elevated to legendary status in Afghanistan. The only war memorial in the country, other than those marking national independence in 1919 at the end of the Third Afghan War and a pillar to the fallen of the unrest in Khost in 1924, is dedicated to this battle and it stands at a busy road intersection in Kabul. The concrete structure, the Minar-i Maiwand, is covered in gaudy billboards and the details of the battle are largely forgotten or misinterpreted. 
149
150
Ayub Khan, the Governor of Herat, was aged twenty-nine in 1880, and had been a consistent critic of the Treaty of Gandamack. He had been in exile in Persia for intrigues against Sher Ali until his brother, Yakub Khan, became Amir in Kabul. But Yakub's decision to conclude a treaty with the British appears to have alienated him, and the arrest and deporting of the Amir offered the opportunity for Ayub Khan to claim the throne for himself. He possessed an independent military force, and his control of Herat gave him the power to rival occupied Kandahar and rebellious Turkistan. Intelligence reports suggested that he possessed seventeen infantry regiments and forty-four guns, some of the latter being modern breech-loading pieces. The appointment of the ageing and unpopular Sher Ali as Wali of Kandahar, the wealth of the Pashtun south, which was relatively unscathed by the war, and the chance of a British withdrawal, marked by the departure of Stewart's division for Kabul, all seemed to herald an opportunity to begin his march on the capital via the southern provinces.
However, Ayub Khan aborted his first attempt to advance on Kandahar in December 1879 because of significant unrest in Herat. His regiments were on the verge of mutiny and, with little revenue to pay them, he had to seek alternative methods to gain their loyalty. He tried to declare a Jihad and advocated an advance against Kandahar because of the Infidel presence there, both to claim legitimacy and offer its loot to his unruly troops.

Ayub Khan made a remarkable march from his base in Herat on 15 June, at the height of the hot weather, over a distance of 253 miles (407 km) with his artillery, completing the journey in just twenty-five days. This achievement rivals that of General Roberts, whose march from Kabul to Kandahar to relieve a beleaguered British garrison was celebrated in the contemporary press and, anxious for success, lauded by the British public. Like the British, Ayub Khan ensured that depots for supplies were set up in advance in Farah and possibly as far as Helmand. 
157
158
159
When the British concentrated at Gereshk and news arrived that Ayub Khan's army was close at hand, the Wali's troops gradually became less reliable and then mutinied.

162
163
164
165
The battle began at 10.50 hrs with British artillery firing on the Afghans, who were by now responding to the British presence. 
166
Meanwhile, some of Ayub's army continued to make their way southwards along the ravine until they were behind the brigade, and from here they made an attack on the baggage and its guards, although this was beaten off. On the opposite flank, Afghan cavalry edged its way further and further around the British left, until Burrows' brigade was completely enveloped. Lieutenant Fowle, a subaltern in the Royal Artillery, wrote that the Afghans 'kept pouring men round both flanks in some sort of loose skirmishing order' . 
167
For the first half hour of the battle, Ayub had no answer to the British artillery fire, hence the need for his men to find cover in the ravine. However, as more reinforcements arrived from the line of march he was able to bring his artillery into action. His batteries took up a position on the British left as soon as they arrived. Ayub had an estimated 10,000-15,000 troops under his command, dwarfing the British force by five to one, but it was in artillery that he possessed a particular advantage. 168 Ayub Khan's six Armstrong breech-loaders could hurl a heavier calibre shell at the British, although not always with great accuracy. However, Ayub Khan's dispositions, in an arc around the British, meant that all his guns could be brought to bear. Burrows later wrote that 'The former [Ayub Khan's artillery] were admirably served and with the exception of their Armstrong shells, which were generally too high, every shot was amongst us' . Lieutenant Fowle noted: 'Their artillery was exceptionally well served; their guns took ours in flank as well as directly, and their fire was concentrated. We were completely outmatched … our guns seemed quite unable to subdue theirs… their smoothbore guns had great range and accuracy and caused great damage' .

The Afghans rode forward to ensure that they held the Maiwand Pass, the most direct route to Kandahar, which forced the retreating troops to curve away to the south-east. A rearguard provided a modicum of cover, but the rest of the British and Indian force was chased for miles across the plains, although it proved more difficult to come to grips with them once night came and Ayub called off the pursuit until daybreak. Survivors spoke of jezails and matchlocks being fired from villages along their line of retreat, and some were killed as they searched for water.

The Afghans were willing to testify to the courage of the British soldiers of the 66 th , especially those that held the compounds at Khig. However, they had their own icons represented especially by Malalai, a girl who lived, apparently, in the same village. Soon after the battle had begun, Malalai is said to have watched as the irregulars wavered under the rifle fire of the British troops and appeared to be on the verge of retreat. Malalai ran into the main ravine and, waving her veil over her head, encouraged the Afghans to hold on. Other accounts have Malalai replace an irregular fighter who had fallen while carrying a banner. She is said to have picked up the flag, or perhaps used her veil instead, and rallied the men by berating them about their honour. Other legends stress her care for the wounded. Shortly afterwards she was killed, but she was later buried in the village and for many years her grave was a site of special reverence. It was even said that Ayub Khan made a speech in her honour. The name Malalai has been a favourite for girls, schools and hospitals in Afghanistan ever since.
At Kandahar, the British placed the city into a state of defence and expelled much of the population. 183 Ayub Khan's leading elements arrived outside the city on 30 July, but the main body did not arrive until the next day. There was some desultory firing from guns on the ridges north and west of Kandahar, but there was also some speculation from spies that a night assault was imminent. However, Ayub Khan instead sent parties of his men to seize and fortify villages and compounds around the city walls.

On 24 August, Ayub Khan was informed that a British relief column was approaching and his army decamped.

To the Afghan people, Abdur Rahman always argued that his army was organized purely for the defence of Afghanistan against foreign invasion, but in reality the Amir's troops were designed for internal security. Over forty separate disturbances were crushed by the army between 1881 and 1901. It was noticeable that senior officers were selected because they were mediocrities and they were given no training so as to prevent any chance of a coup d'état. The British consul at Meshed in 1886 noted: 'The company officers … seem far superior to the General Officers, for the former do appear to have the instincts of soldiers, but General Officers [are appointed] merely as an act of favour bestowed on any but soldiers; a slave, a surveyor, or a contractor suddenly finds himself raised to the rank of General, and given to the command of an army' . 
199
200
The core of the army consisted of eight regiments, largely volunteers, that had accompanied Abdur Rahman from the north, and he made no attempt to retain the troops that had served Sher 
Ali. 201
202
By the 1890s, the composition of the Afghan army was far more balanced. Areas conquered after unrest were called upon to supply recruits, again to ensure future loyalty and to absorb some of the young men of particularly troublesome communities. The exception was the Hazaras, where only a handful of Besud and Jaghuris were enlisted for reasons of sectarian prejudice which might affect cohesion within the army. Some volunteers from beyond the Durand Line were incorporated, including Khattacks, Waziris and Afridis, and there was an increase in their numbers after the 1897 Pashtun Revolt. The army continued to be deployed with regiments stationed outside their place of origin in order to prevent fraternization with the locals, although intermarriages did occur. All regiments were organized on the qawm but it is striking that there was only one purely Pashtun regiment.

The infantry was the largest and cheapest branch of the army. The smallest subdivision was the paira, a section of eight men under a hawaldar. Although theoretically infantry companies consisted of 100 sipahis (soldiers), few reached that strength and consequently the battalion, which should have been made up of six companies, was often less than the established strength of 600 men. That said, in some areas battalions were made up of 1,000 men, depending on local recruiting patterns and the state of the economy. Afghan regiments were identified by clan, city or region, but sometimes adopted a religious title, such as the Mohammadiyya, or simply the colour of their uniform, such as the Zardposh. The fact that the troops were responsible for providing their own uniforms and clothes led to great variety in appearance. The only item that differentiated a regular soldier from an irregular was a leather belt issued by the Amir. All regulars were supposed to be armed with the modern Martini-Henry rifle, and irregulars with the Snider, but in reality there was again a great diversity in weaponry.
Afghan cavalry regiments had an established strength of 400 sowars divided into four troops and commanded by the Zir Mishar (leader of the thousand) or Karnail (Colonel). 
209
210
The efficiency of the cavalry was criticized by British observers. It was noted that Afghan cavalry never did drill and were scattered into small troops across the country to collect taxes rather than prepare for war. Nevertheless, Colonel Yate, the British Consul in Meshed, described Afghan cavalrymen as uncomplaining types and he praised the Kabuli sowars as 'the less bigoted and more energetic' , noting that they 'learn quickly' and are 'strong, sturdy men as a rule' . 
211
212
As in the reign of Sher Ali, under Abdur Rahman the artillery was the most prized branch of the Afghan army. To serve them the Amir possessed 860 guns of various types by 1891. 
213
In addition to the main branches of the army, the royal bodyguard consisted of three infantry battalions and four cavalry regiments, all of whom were better armed, well-fed and paid higher salaries. The Anduran-i Khas (the household guard) and the Hazirbash (bodyguard of the Amir) were hand-picked khanzada men from across the country, including Tajiks and Uzbeks, but with a disproportionate number of Kandahari Mohammedzais, Gardezis and Safis who were considered the most loyal. By contrast the Hazaras, who were regarded as an inferior minority of the country, were formed into pioneer battalions to carry out road building, mining and construction tasks. Despite their status they were constantly at work and therefore considered an efficient element of the army. 
214

216
In Herat, where there was perceived to be a dual threat of foreign intervention or rebellion, there were some 2,400 permanent border cavalry, the qarawal khana, backed by 996 Durrani cavalry, 1,101 Aimaqs, 70 Ghilzais and 657 drawn from the Tajik, Kizilbash and other minorities.

Abdur Rahman was eager to embrace the idea of a 'nation in arms' to strengthen the defences of his country.

In March 1885, a brigade of an estimated 1,200 Afghan troops positioned at Penjdeh, an oasis settlement at the junction of the Murghab and Kushk rivers, was confronted by a Russian force advancing southwards from Merv (Mari) under the command of Colonel Alikhanov, a Daghestani in Russian service. 
230
231
At 06.40 hrs on 30 March 1885, the Russians sent forward a screen in an 'advance to contact' . There were disputes as to who actually fired the first shot, but in the engagement that followed, the Russians drove off the Afghan cavalry screen and then overran the Afghan trenches. It was reported that the defenders in the entrenchments 'died to a man' , but there were eyewitnesses who stated that many of the Afghan troops tried to escape and drowned or froze to death trying to flee across the Murghab river. The Afghans lost 800; the Russians lost only fifty killed and wounded.
The incident caused a major international crisis. 232 Both the Governments of India and London announced that Afghanistan had to be defended against a Russian invasion, and preparations were made for the mobilization of the reserves and the deployment of the Royal Navy against Vladivostok. The Indian Army, already on manoeuvres, also prepared to advance into Afghanistan to hold the passes of the Hindu Kush and to secure Kandahar and Herat. 
233
234
Captain Peacocke and a team of engineers helped the Afghans improve the defences of Herat to prevent a Russian coup de main. New bastions were constructed to take field guns, and the entire reconstruction bill was met by the Government of India. A total of thirty-one field guns and fifteen heavy guns were positioned there with provisions, munitions and accommodation for a garrison of 6,000 men. When it became apparent that a cemetery mound, the Talibankiyyan, outside the city walls could provide a platform for enemy artillery, a city meeting was convened to debate whether it could be removed or not. The elders agreed that their security considerations, for the defence of Islam, outweighed the survival of the burial grounds and the mound was levelled, although the ulema had to issue a fatwa to prevent rioting against the plan. 235
Revolts in Afghanistan, 1886-94   Given the numbers of Ghilzais serving in the Afghan army, the revolt of the eastern Pashtuns in 1886 represented a serious threat to Abdur Rahman's rule and further limitations on Afghanistan's military power. The Ghilzai revolt was the culmination of a number of grievances about the imposition of taxa-tion and more direct interference in local governance. Beyond the immediate environs of Kabul, Ghazni and the main roads, Ghilzais had enjoyed almost complete autonomy and had even been exempted from a poll tax in 1881 by Abdur Rahman during his struggle with Ayub Khan. When new measures of centralization were introduced and some of the key leaders who had resisted the British were imprisoned, including Muhammed Jan (Wardak) and Asmatullah ( Jabar Khel), the clan elders encouraged their village jirgas to revolt. Two leaders emerged in October 1886 to direct operations, Mullah Abdal Karim Andar and Mohammed Shah Hotaki, and they scored victories over the garrisons at Muqur and Ghazni. In the spring of 1887, after a successful winter against the Amir's detachments, great numbers of Ghilzais assembled at Muqur, but there was no money and there were few modern firearms amongst the rebels, and, perhaps more importantly, they could enlist no support outside the Ghilzai districts. The Amir deployed his regular regiments and artillery with some effect, and it is estimated that approximately 30,000 eljaris accompanied the troops. 
236
237
238
The rebellion of Ishaq Khan in August 1888 was the most serious of Abdur Rahman's reign. The rebels of Badakshan were a combination of mutinous troops and disaffected khans incited by Ishaq Khan, Abdur Rahman's cousin, but also driven by genuine anger and anxiety about Abdur Rahman's reforms. There were allegations that, having been given 20,000 rupees with which to recruit spies to watch the Russians in Tsarist Central Asia, Ishaq Khan had instead purchased 1,500 rifles to arm his loyal followers. The spark for the rebellion came amidst rumours that Abdur Rahman had died after a prolonged illness. The Hazaras threw in their lot with the rebels, although the population of Bamian remained quiet. Nevertheless, the British newswriter at Kabul warned: 'I do not believe that anyone will side with the Amir' . 
239
27
240
Interestingly, at the height of the rebellion, the Amir was so concerned that he requested support from the British, including the temporary military occupation of Kandahar and Jalalabad, and the appointment of a permanent Residency at Kabul. However, once the revolt was over, he dismissed any idea of cooperation. This incident nevertheless reveals Abdur Rahman's strategy and his priorities. He was eager to retain British support and even countenance military intervention in order to secure his power. For all the anti-foreign rhetoric, Afghanistan was still dependent on a foreign empire for its security. This was largely the reason for the Amir's acquiescence in the British terms for the Durand Line, the proposed border between British India and Afghanistan in 1893. Against a background of Russian advances across the Pamirs from 1887, and the defeat of a small detachment at Somatash (1892), the Amir needed the British as his best guarantee against Tsarist forces. 241 However, that did not preclude his own negotiations with General Kaufman, the Russian Governor of Turkestan in the 1880s, in order to ascertain Russian intentions.
Once the Durand Line was established, Abdur Rahman felt he had a free hand to deliver a decisive blow against the pagans of Kafiristan in 1895 that would also enhance his Islamic and dynastic credentials. The campaign, which was popular with the troops, resulted either in the forced conversion of the population of the province or slavery. 
242
Indeed, the popularity of the campaign encouraged Abdur Rahman to invoke the defence of Islam as a concept whenever his popularity was jeopardized by coercive policies. This had proved successful during the Penjdeh crisis and was especially important when he exaggerated the idea of a foreign threat in 1887 and 1897.

We know that the general object of the expedition [in 1897] launched by us against the Afridis and the Orakzais was to exact reparation for their unprovoked aggression on the Peshawar-Kohat border, [and] for their attacks on our frontier posts-But that is only our view of the matter. We want to get behind this, and ascertain the Afridi view. Why did they, who had faithfully kept their agreements with us for sixteen long years, why did they rise against us, and commit these outrages? Were they altogether 'unprovoked' as we so confidently assert?

What made you come down [from the hills to fight]? The mullahs brought us down.
Why did you obey the mullahs and not turn them out of your country? They were too powerful for us.
Have you any real grievance against the Government to induce you to fight against it? No, we had not.
Then why did you attack the posts? The mullahs forced us. 
4
The Afridis are essentially a fighting race; we have little to teach them in the tactics best suited to their conditions of organisation and terrain. It is only in the higher branches of the art of war-the domain of strategy rather than tactics-that they have much to learn. Lack of organisation has always been the keynote of those guerrilla tactics which have baffled again and again the armies of civilised nations. 
5
The British were concerned through much of the nineteenth century by the Russian threat towards India. 
6
Nevertheless, in 1885 and in 1893, the Russian army clashed with the Afghans and compelled the British to clarify the delineation of Afghanistan's borders. Despite the Amir's reluctance to 'risk losing an arm' by taking responsibility for Wakhan, he was persuaded to accept this outlying district so as to give the British a narrow strip of territory between their own and the Russian possessions.

Crucially, attacks were being delivered at night because the Pashtuns dare not risk daylight assaults against the British who were armed with modern breech-loading weapons and entrenched behind prepared positions. 'It is possible' , wrote one British officer shortly after, 'the frontier tribes have realized, as well as more civilized races, that rapid firing guns and rifles can best be faced when darkness nullifies aim' . 
17
As the British restored control in Malakand and Swat, more Pashtun groups joined the rising. On 26 August the forts of the Khyber Pass were attacked and captured, despite the resistance of some Afridi levies.

Yet almost all studies of this campaign have focused on the British perspective. 
22
The Afridis and Orakzais knew from previous encounters with the British that it was impossible to survive an engagement from fixed positions or dense formations against their firepower. Instead they adopted dispersed 'light infantry' tactics, concentrating into larger groups for specific tasks such as an assault on a fortified post. The basic grouping was the lashkar, formed of an irregular number (which might range from 30 to 1,000) and based loosely on a particular leader, clan or a group of villages.

The British felt they had learned valuable lessons from the campaign of 1897-8, but there was some anxiety about the deficiencies exposed in their training and tactical doctrine. What is fascinating from the point of view of this study is the willingness to admit that the Pashtuns often had the upper hand. Major A. C. Yate noted that in the Tirah 'Our best frontier officers and soldiers found themselves foiled and at times worsted by these unorganised guerrillas' .

33
The strategy of the Afridis was to clear the British from their lands astride the Khyber Pass and maintain the inviolability of the Tirah Maidan valleys, whilst the Orakzais, further south, aimed to drive the British from the Samana Ridge by destroying the forts there. The initial attack by the Afridis against the forts of the Khyber Pass was far more successful than anticipated and encouraged the Orakzais to commence their own attacks at Samana. A few isolated militia posts were easily engulfed and destroyed. A force of 3,000 tribesmen then sought to eject the Kurram militia from Sadda, but when a larger British force assembled, the tribesmen fell back. The focus therefore shifted to the Samana Ridge. As they advanced eastwards along the Khanki Valley a small British force withdrew, and this bought time for a considerable force of 10,000 clans-men to concentrate below the forts. Undermining the walls while protected by small arms fire, the Sarigarh fortification was overrun. However, the Orakzais, with an Afridi lashkar in support, failed to capture or destroy the two most important positions on the ridge, and when British reinforcements arrived with their artillery, the clansmen retreated. In these attacks, the Pashtuns seemed to focus on the symbols of British occupation, but while they had set out to uproot the British, they also intended to delay reinforcements and to concentrate wherever the threat appeared greatest. Despite their fragmented structures, the presence of an Afridi lashkar alongside the Orakzais was a significant commitment to inter-clan unity.
Through letters between prominent personalities, intercepted by the British in October, it is clear that the two tribes hoped to be able to count on the support of the Afghans. A delegation was sent to Kabul and, in accordance with protocol, it was treated with great courtesy by the Amir. There is little doubt that Abdur Rahman was concerned about the British insistence on the demarcation of the Durand Line.

To strengthen his domestic position, Abdur Rahman claimed to be Zia-ul-Millat wa-ud-Din (Light of Union and Faith) and the King of Islam, that is, of all the Muslims in his realm.

In fact, the tribesmen appear to have believed, with fighting going on elsewhere across the frontier, that they may have in fact already won their campaign and no further precautions were necessary. They had achieved their objectives of taking the Khyber and had prevented any offensive action by the British in the south. For eight weeks there was little sign of any British counter-attack, and the harvest had been gathered in without any hindrance. The British delay had in fact been caused by the difficulty in acquiring sufficient transport and troops for the campaign (some 20,000 ponies and mules, and 13,000 camels were required). When Indian pioneers appeared near Shinwari fort (south of the Samana Ridge), the tribesmen convened another jirga at Bagh. It seems that several leading spokesmen urged resistance, claiming that any attempt to conclude a separate peace would constitute a betrayal of Islam. Oaths were apparently sworn over the Qur'an. Nevertheless, an Orakzai delegation from the Kanki Valley tried to offer their submission to General Yeatman Biggs soon after. His refusal to accept their offer because of the raiding going on at the time compelled them to join the revolt. 
50
The British road-building activity south of the Samana Ridge had indicated to the Pashtuns the axis and the likely date of an offensive so that despite 'great secrecy in issuing orders' , a number of tribesmen had gathered at Dargai to contest the advance. According to one British officer, the natural defile at Dargai not only made a defensive stance far easier, it also afforded 'excellent cover, naturally provided by the rocks and improved by walls, etc, built up by [the tribesmen]' . Light artillery could make no impression on the sangars, and there was a steep climb to the tribesmen's positions. It took the leading British and Indian troops six hours to reach the point where an assault could be made. The Pashtun riflemen put down some fire but gave way as soon as the British began to close on them, and they were prompted to retreat as soon as they came under fire from a flanking force under General Kempster. On the approach march and in the frontal assault across an exposed area barely 200 yards wide, the British lost nineteen killed and wounded; Pashtun losses were unknown.
The British decided that they could not retain this high mountain-top position because of a lack of water and manpower, and consequently the troops began to withdraw soon after 14.00. There was a great deal of controversy about this decision, not least because it became necessary to retake the Dargai heights just a few days later at a much greater cost in lives. However, in this debate, there was little thought given to the Pashtun perspective. The sound of the artillery fire at Dargai from 09.20 drew Orakzais and Afridis from the Khanki Valley, and they began to concentrate on the northern slopes, with a strength estimated at 12,000. Colonel Charles Callwell noted: 'As the afternoon proceeded, the enemy began to gather in great strength to the north of Dargai. Swarms of tribesmen were observed streaming up out of the Khanki Valley to participate in the fray' . 
51
It must have been evident to them that, if the British attempted a second attack on Dargai, it made sense to try to concentrate as much fire as possible on the narrow frontage they would have to take. They must also have reasoned, as their deployments subsequently suggest, that they had to avoid being outflanked. Tribesmen were pushed westwards along the ridge and also covered the spurs leading from the British forts on the Samana. General Lockhart, the commander of the British forces, originally considered bypassing Dargai, but these new dispositions indicated that any attempt to pass beneath Dargai to the west (below either the Chagru Kotal or Saran Suk) would simply invite a fusillade against his flank and possibly expose his column to a large attack. 
52
The British account of the battle that followed has been well documented in a number of contemporary and subsequent works. There is little doubt that the British and Indian troops who took part were courageous, disciplined and determined, sustaining very heavy losses whilst continuing to press on into the Pashtun position, but there are almost no analyses of the tribesmen's actions. First, and most importantly, the new Pashtun deployments had compelled Lockhart to change his plan to bypass Dargai. Second, the tribesmen knew that the British were coming and what route they would take. The ground had been carefully selected and channelled them into a specific killing zone. Almost all the British casualties occurred in one small area that could be swept by smallarms fire. The tribesmen opened a long-range fire at about 09.30, but it was not until 11.00 that the first wave of Gurkhas was in a position to assault the heights. As they tried to cross in small groups, 'each clump of men that dashed forward melted away under the converging and accurate fire, and after a time affairs practically came to standstill' . 
53
54
The British established their first camp in the Khanki Valley at Khangarbur on a plateau, having cleared a village of Afridi marksmen with artillery fire. After two days of accumulating supplies (caused by the absence of sufficient transport animals and the difficult terrain), the British were aware that they were in danger of losing momentum. Colonel Hutchinson regretted that in the eyes of the tribesmen the delay would be put down to 'hesitation and fear, and, in proportion to the timidity which we (in their estimation) display, do[es] their own courage and confidence increase, and their numbers too' . 
55
56
57
There was then a relatively quiet day perhaps for Jirgas and then a more determined attempt to destroy foraging parties that were detached from the main body. Each of these parties had to be protected by strong escorts of infantry and some mountain guns. Even so, as they withdrew, they came under the fire of tribesmen who pursued them closely. Ambushes were frequent. One favoured tactic was to wait until the British crested a ridge where they were thus silhouetted against the skyline. A single volley from the tribesmen at 1,000 yards had the effect of 'invariably knocking someone over' . 
58
The British advanced towards the Sampagha Pass, hoping that the Pashtuns would attempt a stand like that of the Orakzais at Dargai, simply because they wanted to bring them to battle and inflict a decisive defeat rather than having to endure the steady sniping and guerrilla attacks. At Gundaki, the British surprised the tribesmen by a sudden movement at dawn, and the snipers who were still sleeping after a night of shooting were almost captured. In fact, the tribesmen had a routine for their sniping: they would observe the British camp and its picquets or sentry posts closely before dusk so as to have a clear idea of the targets to engage that night. Shooting went on between dusk and midnight, and the tribesmen generally retired after that time, but resumed their fire after daybreak.
As the British advanced towards the Sampagha, there was almost no opposition because the ground did not lend itself to defence. Wide valley floors and low hills did not afford much protection. At Sampagha itself, it was soon clear that the tribesmen did not wish to fight there either. As early as 07.00, the clansmen began to abandon their forward positions and few had much appetite to endure the concentrated shellfire of thirty-six mountain guns and four hours of bombardment. Although it was estimated that twelve standards had been seen, it likely that a token force held the pass itself. About twenty clansmen held a sangar in the centre of the position, but after being shelled for twenty minutes they ran back over the pass, and it seems that a good many fighters were in fact herding their flocks, shepherding their families into the hills or burying their grain to the north.
It was a similar story at the Arhanga Pass, with British artillery driving off a token defence force that was estimated at no more than 1,000. 
59
The clansmen were not inactive though. On two successive nights the Zakka Khel Afridis raided the baggage columns that had been overtaken by darkness before they reached the British camp. Several soldiers and drivers were killed and 11,000 rounds of rifle ammunition were seized as well as other military equipment. The raids had a disproportionate and negative effect on the morale of the baggage personnel. The Pashtuns regarded the British as raiders too. The foraging parties that went out every day into the villages of the Tirah Maidan recovered great quantities of food, such that each man of the invasion force could be provided with two full days' rations from just one small area. A few other souvenirs were taken: jezails, swords, daggers and handwritten Qur'ans were much prized. Bagh was of particular interest. The Musjid was left untouched but searches revealed letters between Pashtun tribal leaders and the Afghan Amir. Elsewhere General Lockhart selected the targets for his operations carefully. Where there was resistance, houses from which fighters had fired were burned down and towers were dynamited or shelled. However, on the whole, he refrained from wholesale destruction. Tribal elders were summoned to hear the terms that Lockhart would offer for their surrender, but there was little appreciable difference to the amount of fighting taking place every day. Sniping into the British camp occurred each night, and there were two incidents where British forces that were withdrawing got into difficulties and sustained significant casualties.
Over a period of ten days, while the British paused to await the outcome of the jirgas' deliberations and bring in their fines, every forage party was fired upon. The telegraph wire, which extended back over the passes, was cut every night and 'a mile or two of it carried off ' . The Pashtuns knew that these communications were important to the British for both logistical and operational decisions, and they also knew that parties who came to fix the line could be attacked. Foraging parties were frequently surprised and occasionally knifewielding attackers attempted to get into hand-to-hand combat. Yet it was perhaps the now constant sniping that had the most demoralizing effect. Nor were these random single shots: Pashtun marksmen would crawl into position below the picquets in groups of three or four using the natural folds in the ground and '"brown" the camp with forty or fifty shots before they [could] be dislodged' .

On 12 November, after a lull in fighting for three days, representatives of the Orakzais were brought to the camp. It is noticeable that those who arrived were all 'graybeards' . Whilst these men accepted the fines and submission of rifles as compensation in principle, the speed at which these could be arranged would be slow. The elders were probably concerned that the British might be tempted to stay for good, or at least prolong their 'pacification' measures and destroy more crops and property, but their faces were inscrutable as they listened to the British terms. The lull in fighting nevertheless suggests that there was some unanimity about seeing an early British withdrawal. Curiously, they asked the British Political Officers to assist them in apportioning the fines across each of the clans and sections because, they said, they would 'quarrel' if left to themselves. General Lockhart immediately put an end to the destruction of property of the Orakzais and even decreed that the British would pay for any supplies they subsequently requisitioned. Nevertheless fighting continued, particularly as almost all of the Afridis were still defiant. The Afridis may have been hoping that, as the British supply situation became more acute and the winter weather threatened their already attenuated lines of communication, they could hold out. 
64
When General Kempster attempted to withdraw his brigade from the Waran Valley on 16 November 1897, the Afridis attacked the rearguard in large numbers. Once again, wounded men delayed the withdrawal and the Afridis tried to work around the flanks of the British force as it neared a pass. Wooded and precipitous country provided a screen for this movement, which brought them to within a few hundred yards of the 15 th Sikhs. Having already inflicted a number of casualties with rifle fire throughout the afternoon, some of the clansmen were eager to close with the Indian troops in hand-to-hand fighting. However, as they emerged from the woods, the Sikhs formed a skirmish line and opened fire at close range. The effect was devastating, and later estimates claimed that 200 fighters were shot down in a few minutes.

After the incident, General Lockhart consoled his men by reminding them they were 'opposed to perhaps the best skirmishers and the best natural shots in the world, and the country they inhabit is the most difficult on the face of the globe' .

However, the fragmented nature of Pashtun society was beginning to have an effect. On 21 November 1897, the jirgas of the Malikdin Khel, Kambar-Khel, Adam-Khel and the Aka-Khel offered to accept the British terms, namely a fine, the restitution of property, the surrender of 800 rifles and a formal act of submission. Interestingly, the British Political Officers also used the opportunity to dispel the rumours which they felt had given rise to the unrest and to interrogate the clansmen as to the reasons for the revolt. The tribesmen took the opportunity of blaming the mullahs, and this seemed to corroborate the idea of a conspiracy in the letters discovered in the house of Mullah Sayid Akbar. Sir Robert Warburton, an experienced Political Officer who later wrote about the 'Pathan Revolt' , pointed to 'the fifteen hundred mullahs from Ningrahar' .

The onset of bad weather indicated that the Tirah Field Force would have to withdraw, but it was decided they would march through the Bara and Waran Valleys in order to force the Zaka-Khels, the last group to defy Lockhart, to surrender or face a wave of destruction. It was hoped that the Zaka-Khels would not risk having their lands laid waste so close to winter, but since the valleys were largely abandoned in the winter months in favour of lower pastures anyway, these expectations seem unrealistic. In the first week of December, the British began their descent in separate divisions, but the Afridis pressed the rearguards and flanks of the 2 nd Division in the Bara Valley harder each day. Clearly they believed that the British were now retreating, and unlikely to make a significant counter-attack. For the Pashtuns, who had often given way before each attack and then pursued the British, this was the opportunity they had been waiting for to inflict as many casualties as possible and avenge their losses. The cold weather and the fact that the column in the Bara Valley had constantly to cross and re-cross the frozen river had a detrimental effect on morale. Colonel Hutchinson noted that the camp followers suffered the most: 'many unhappy followers, frozen by the cold, and terrified by the bullets whistling overhead, collapsed and died by the way, in spite of the efforts of the escorts to keep them all together, and bring them safely along' .

Ironically, the other division made its way out of the mountains virtually unopposed, suggesting that the Afridis had made a conscious decision to concentrate their forces in one place. This seems to be confirmed by the fact that the British also sent a column to re-enter the Khyber Pass and for some days it was barely opposed at all. When two brigades entered the Bazar Valley, they were nevertheless engaged in constant fighting, the greatest resistance being offered to troops as they withdrew.

The Tirah Campaign that took place during the 'Pathan Revolt' of 1897-8 offers a fascinating case study of fighting on the North West Frontier and the Pashtun 'way of war' in this period. In terms of the causes of the fighting, rumours, beliefs and myths combined to mobilize the population already fearful about British encroachments. The Afridi-Orakzai revolt certainly needs to be seen in the context of the 1893 Durand Line agreement and the British Forward Policy, but it also needs to be understood as a specific local reaction to a world that was changing around them. That reaction suggests their pashtunwali was not fixed and immutable, despite the strength of its obligations, but permitted interpretation depending on the level of threat and crisis. Consequently, clans responded differently to the revolt of 1897 and not all of them followed their charismatic mullahs blindly. Indeed, the clansmen proved themselves capable of great tactical prowess in mountain warfare and an eminently pragmatic strategy. 
88
Afghanistan's non-intervention was important, and some Afghan Pashtuns were prevented from joining the rising, but this simply empowered local leaders all the more. Clansmen were quick to blame the mullahs for 'forcing' them to fight, and it seems that few of them wanted to run the risk of being the only individual to defy their religious authorities. A collective pressure created a momentum that was hard to resist.
In the light of the Tirah campaign, some British officers felt that the fighting on the North West Frontier had cost too much for results gained. Reflecting on future operations, Captain Nevill wrote: 'To compel the surrender of guerrillas, such as the frontier tribes of India, by the usual process of breaking down the means of defence would entail operations so prolonged and costly as to be out of all proportion to the interests at stake. Other means therefore, must be found to achieve the same result, such as the destruction of villages and personal property, which has always been the only effective way of dealing with the elusive tribesmen' .

The 'Pathan Revolt' is a specific historical illustration of the nature of the Pashtun region astride the Durand Line, but it is one that has been hitherto dominated by Western interpretations. To the Pashtuns, the border line laid down by the British with Kabul's compliance did not exist and they saw no objection to an appeal to the Amir of Afghanistan when hard pressed. Whilst the causes of the revolt were attributed to fanaticism, a conspiracy of mullahs, or resistance to British encroachments, the sources of resistance appear to be evidence of the internal dynamics of a society confronted by change and seeking to exclude foreign influences. It interpreted the solutions to a foreign threat and a sense of crisis in religious terms and according to the guidance of their tribal code, but the Pashtuns pursued a more practical strategy. There was some pressure to respond to the crisis in a collective way, despite the fragmentary nature of their society, but some of these fissures were not entirely closed. Some clans opted to remain neutral and others were rather half-hearted. The Zakka-Khels by contrast believed their honour was at stake and they fought determinedly throughout the campaign. The Tirah campaign was an illustration of how the Pashtuns fought at the end of the nineteenth century, but does not prove there was an unchanging 'way of war' . Although it is possible to see tactics common to other eras, we should be cautious about attributing this to a distinct military culture. Instead, we might conclude that the Pashtuns at this time had evolved the most appropriate form of mountain warfare best suited to the technology and tactics of their enemies. The best tributes to the Pashtuns came from their British adversaries, and the last word on the campaign surely belongs to one of those who took part in the Tirah operations:
We are too much accustomed to think of the tribes on our frontier as an undisciplined rabble to be treated with contempt, and brushed aside with ease, whenever we choose to advance against them in a lordly fashion. We have learned now that the conditions no longer exist which warranted such a belief. We have seen that the Afridis and Orakzais are as practically well armed as ourselves;-that they can shoot as straight as our own men; that they can skirmish a great deal better than most of them; and that they are enterprising and bold, and thoroughly understand how to make the best use of the natural advantages which their woods and mountains and rocky defiles give them. Such a foe is to be treated with respect. 
91
The Official History of the Third Afghan War of 1919 assessed the Pashtuns and the Afghans as 'expert in guerrilla warfare' , noting:
They seldom await an assault, but follow up a retirement relentlessly and with the utmost boldness. They show great skill in cutting off detachments and laying ambushes for isolated bodies of troops. They are, however, deficient in some important military qualities. They lack steadfastness in adversity and lose heart when subjected to reverses. They have little cohesion and concerted action on their part cannot be expected. Their forces (lashkars) are brought to, and kept in, the field by the exertions of their religious leaders, and each man fights as he pleases. Time is lost owing to lengthy discussions which often precede military action or declaration of policy. Mutual jealousies or blood feuds, which are sunk on occasions of fanatical outbursts, are apt to reappear during prolonged operations.

Afghanistan's strategic dilemma remained unchanged between 1880 and 1914, in that it was a mere buffer zone inside the sphere of British influence, hemmed in between the Russian Empire and the Raj. Dynastic survival depended on the ability to retain good relations with the Government of India, in order to procure arms and essential revenue. However, Afghan Amirs could neither be seen to be too closely associated with the British by their own population, nor could they risk too many concessions, since there was a real risk that Britain would try to assert its control more fully, which might in turn encourage the Russians to seize territory in Afghan Turkestan. Abdur Rahman's successor, Amir Habibullah, maintained the same finely balanced relationship with the British as his father, although he looked for opportunities to improve the quality of the Afghan Army and he made no secret of his satisfaction with the defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War (1904-5). Habibullah renewed the existing treaty terms with the British in 1905. However, the settlement of the Anglo-Russian Convention two years later, which formalized Russia's recognition of Afghanistan as a state within the British sphere, caused deep resentment in Kabul. The terms of the Convention actually guaranteed that British forces would not occupy Afghanistan, and the Afghan Amir had already accepted that all foreign relations would be directed through the British. 
4
Afghanistan's strategic situation altered in 1915 when a Turco-German military mission arrived during the First World War. While officially neutral, Amir Habibullah was aware that anti-British sentiment in the country was a threat to relations with the Government of India and to his authority.

Habibullah's brother, Nasrullah Khan, claimed the throne as Amir and ensured that Habibullah's eldest son and heir apparent, Inyatullah, submitted to him. The announcement was greeted with enthusiasm by the ulema and by the Ghilzais. 
8
Afghan strategy in this period is much disputed. Amir Amanullah claimed that he was responding to British aggression and that, unable to find an answer to the subsequent bombing of Kabul by the RAF and having scored a 'decisive victory' at Thal in Waziristan, he was eager for peace. At the end of the conflict, the Amir wrote to the Viceroy claiming that he had merely deployed his army to the frontier to watch for disturbances and that he had only occupied territory marked on his maps as part of Afghanistan. He claimed to have sent a Vakil to negotiate as soon as the British started the fighting and noted that 'a day had hardly elapsed after the departure of our envoy for your camp when one of your aeroplanes flew over Kabul and bombarded the royal palace, thereby causing great excitement and panic among our loyal people' . The letter continued: 'it is a matter for great regret that the throwing of bombs … and bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation [in the World War] while we now see with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent amongst all civilized people of the West' . 
9
However, the balance of evidence suggests that Amanullah was using a strategy of brinkmanship and proxy war to achieve domestic popularity, as well as the strategic objective of securing independence in foreign affairs from the Government of India. Prior to the outbreak of war, Amanullah had given encouragement to the frontier clans on the British side of the Durand Line to engage in a Jihad, which included the issuing of weapons. Hamilton Grant, at the India Office, noted that Amanullah had staffed his government with nationalists or those with pro-Turkish leanings. The new Commander in Chief, General Saleh Mohammed, for example, was an Anglophobe. The Amir made a clear declaration of independence for Afghanistan, and the British noted wryly that in April 1919 Amanullah had appointed a Commissary for Foreign Affairs in defiance of the treaty with the Indian government. In addition, towards the end of April, Afghan troops began to concentrate near the border and fortifications were constructed at Peiwar Kotal.
One of the documented calculations that can be identified is the Afghan assumption that the British Empire was weakened by the First World War. In March and April 1919, British authorities in India were facing serious unrest in the Punjab. One verdict was that: 'The English are distracted in mind on account of the European war, and have not the strength to attack the Afghans. The people of India too are much dissatisfied with the English on account of their tyranny and oppression. They will never hesitate to raise a revolt, if they can find the opportunity, as their hearts are bleeding at their hands' .

Most units in the eastern provinces were given the best armaments, leaving the regiments on the other frontiers with obsolete breech-loaders. It was noted that, while issued with bayonets, the Afghan infantry tended to use them only for the execution of criminals and political prisoners. 
18
On the borders, the Afghan army had concentrated in four locations: in Kunar, at the head of the Khyber Pass, in Khost, and in Kandahar, while a reserve was kept at Kabul. This was a contrast to the peacetime distribution, suggesting that some sort of offensive action was planned. Moreover, the failure to announce a general mobilization in May, in favour of a Jihad, reflects the calculations of the Amir. His strategy was based on exploiting a narrow window of opportunity and achieving a rapid if limited success against British forces in the border area, in order to bolster his domestic position. Not all of his forces had got into position by the time the war broke out, and there is no doubt that prompt counter-offensives by the British disrupted the Afghan strategy. The main Afghan offensive on the 'central front' near Thal did not get underway until 26 May, by which time Afghan forces at the Khyber Pass and Kandahar had already been defeated.
Since 1901, the British had pulled back their military garrisons from the Afghan border and substituted many regular European battalions in favour of locally recruited khassadars. These small Pashtun units, invariably commanded by a British officer, had the advantage of causing less cultural offence or suspicions of occupation; they knew the ground and language, and they absorbed some young men who might otherwise have carried out raids on rivals or into British territory. The main problem was in their reliability. Those who enlisted were keen to take the money and act as a roving militia so long as their interests did not clash with the local clans or their own families.
Behind the frontier zone, the British had a number of Territorial Army battalions and some inexperienced Indian Army regiments, stiffened with mountain artillery, armoured cars and, most importantly, aircraft of the Royal Air Force. From the outset, the RAF were envisaged as a decisive arm against the Afghans. The Afghan concentration at Dakka was one of the first objectives in the campaign. Although there were some concerns that the aircraft themselves were obsolete, the air raid on Dakka was a great success, not least because, just as the aircraft approached, the Amir's officials were in the process of distributing rifles, ammunition and food to irregulars recruited from the local area. This concentrated mass of fighters made an ideal target. Some twentyfive irregulars were killed, but the effect was psychological rather than physical. The Afghans were now at risk of air envelopment, and their only protection lay in dispersal and concealment.
At Bagh in the Khyber Pass, the Afghans occupied unexpectedly a 2,000-yard long crest, the Ash Khel, and brought up more reinforcements including artillery. However, the Afghan commander, Mohammed Anwar Khan, failed to capitalize on his initial advantage in numbers so that, within two days, the British could muster five battalions, machine guns and a battery of mountain artillery to support the nearby garrison of Landi Kotal. Aware that the British would now take offensive action, the Afghans established two belts of defences. An outpost line was thrown forward to the base of the ridge, while the main position on the crest line, a natural amphitheatre, was entrenched. Although keen to take the offensive as soon as possible, the British commander, General Crocker, was concerned that his northern flank was exposed and there was every possibility that Mohmand and Afridi irregulars would appear in large numbers from this direction. Covering this northern flank meant reducing the numbers available for the attack against the Afghan regulars. Consequently, even though the outpost line was driven back, the British and Indian troops could not get through the weight of fire from the main position. At nightfall, the British dug in on the lower slopes. 
19
The failure to exploit the situation, coupled with the failure of the Peshawar uprising, neutralized the momentum that might have encouraged the clans on the British side of the border to join the war. The British had prevented the Afghans taking control of the Khyber Pass because of the rapid arrival of British reinforcements by motor transport vehicles and through air attacks, and it is likely that the Afghan strategy depended on the ability to open the road to Peshawar. The British also noted that the Afghans made other elementary mistakes in mountain warfare. They did not, for example, occupy some vital picquet positions through the night and so the British were able to seize a key feature known as Bright's Hill at dawn on 9 May 1919 without opposition.
The Afghans did bring forward more reinforcements, but they were unable to cope with the speed by which the British could mount operations. Despite being checked at Bagh on 9 May, the British were in a position to make a second assault just two days later. 
20
To follow up their attack, the British maintained their air bombardment of Dakka, dropped propaganda leaflets urging local clans to stay out of the fighting and pushed on westwards, across the border, with ground forces. The Amir protested, claiming he had not sought to interfere in the unrest in India, and initially there was no resistance to the British occupation of Dakka, but this was merely a result of a lack of reserves in the area rather than a deliberate policy. On 16 May, British cavalry patrols soon brought reports of Afghan regular troops and militia arriving from the west. The British encampment, which had not been well sited, was subjected to Afghan artillery fire, and it was with some difficulty that the British held on to the surrounding hills. As darkness fell, the British units were withdrawn to avoid being enveloped, but this enabled Afghan snipers to close in towards the British camp, whereupon they kept up a steady fire throughout the night. 
21
At dawn the next day, the 1/35 th Sikhs and 1/9 th Gurkhas were ordered to clear the heights. These inexperienced troops were ambushed as they approached the crest of the hill by concealed Afghan units, and the Sikhs retreated in disorder. The Gurkhas rallied them, but neither battalion could get through the fire sweeping the slopes and the leading platoons were pinned down just 20 yards from the summit. Once again, the Afghans made no attempt to counter-attack. 
22
Despite the retreat of the Afghan regulars at Dakka, the Afridi clans in the Khyber Pass prepared to launch their own attacks on the British lines of communication. The chief agitator was thought to be Yar Mohammed, a malik of the Malik Din Khel Afridis, and he warned the British that he was going to strike. His men, initially numbering no more than forty, were increased by other villages and there was a concerted campaign to subvert the Khyber Rifles. The rumour was that the British intended to use the Khyber Riflemen as cannon fodder in their war against the Afghans, killing both alike with their own guns. There were outbreaks of fighting south of the Khyber Pass too, and shooting incidents in Peshawar. Road blocks and ambushes were set up in the Khyber Pass itself, and telegraph wire was cut down and stolen. Despite the existence of Jihadist propaganda, the unrest appeared to be a combination of opportunism and anger at the war being waged against the Afghans.
Although there was an attack against a detachment at Ali Masjid, the arrival of more British and Indian troops and the disbandment of the Khyber Rifles quietened the area. Moreover, when a small Afghan force crossed the border north of the Khyber Pass into Mohmand country, the local clans were unwilling to assist them. The Afghan Wardaki Battalion was particularly criticized for its arrogant conduct. The main reason for their hostile reception was that their demands for supplies affected local communities who had been blockaded by the British in 1915. They remembered the difficulties associated with being short of food, and were unwilling to hand over what little they had to the Afghan Army. 
23
The weak point in Afghanistan's defences against the British in the previous Anglo-Afghan wars had been the Bolan Pass and the route to Kandahar. Twice the British had outflanked the bulk of the Afghan forces, which had concentrated around the Khyber, by moving against Kandahar. To meet this threat in 1919, the Amir had despatched the chief minister, Abdul Qudus, to take command in the south personally. The forces deployed around Kandahar consisted of 5 infantry battalions, 1 cavalry regiment and 25 guns, with a further 2 battalions at Qalat and 2 en route from Kabul. The British decided to make a surprise counter-offensive against Kandahar to prevent the Afghans from stirring the Baluchis of British India to resistance, but also to put pressure on the Afghan government and draw reserves away from the northern theatre of operations.
The result was the defeat of the garrison at Spin Boldak by a British force of 4 battalions, 1 machine gun company and 12 guns, supported by aircraft.

The main Afghan offensive was on the Central Front into Waziristan, perhaps in the hope that the Waziris, who had shown support for the Amir's Jihadist declarations like the Afridis, would accompany the Afghan Army as it advanced through British territory. The fact that an offensive did not get underway until the end of May, and the existence of entrenchments that had been started in late April, suggest that the initial Afghan strategy had been to remain on the defensive in this sector but that events at Dakka had compelled them to seek to relieve the pressure in the north. They believed that an offensive towards Kohat and Bannu, and ultimately Peshawar, might force the British to abandon any hope of reaching Kabul. The offensive was to use overwhelming force, with two axes of advance via Kurram and Matun converging at Thal, consisting of fourteen battalions of infantry and 48 guns, augmented by irregulars. The British, aware of the build-up, had reinforced their posts at Parachinar, near the Peiwar Kotal Pass, and at Thal, but there were too few troops to cover the Matun axis, and the decision to evacuate the area caused the local khassadars to desert or open fire on their British officers. The news of this unrest spread quickly and the North Waziristan and South Waziristan militias melted away. When General Nadir Khan commenced his offensive on 27 May, there were almost no forces left in Waziristan to resist him.
The Afghan artillery, consisting of nine German mountain guns, was packed onto mules and elephants in order to make the crossing of the difficult terrain into the Kurram Valley, and with an advance guard of 3,000 regulars and approximately the same number of irregulars, Nadir Khan advanced on Thal. Occupying the high ground around the settlement, he was able to cover three sides of the hastily dug British defences. The Afghan guns managed to destroy ration trucks in the railway siding, a petrol dump, a store of animal fodder and a wireless transmitting station on the first day. Moreover, the frontier constabulary, which had been guarding the water pumping station, deserted, and this vital position fell into Afghan hands. The small British garrison, numbering just ninety men, were able to resist a number of probing attacks, but it was clear that, without supplies, they could not hold for long. As a result, Nadir Khan decided not to risk heavy casualties with a direct assault on the shallow British trenches. He believed that clans to the east would delay any British reinforcements sufficiently, and that the advance could be resumed in any direction once he had captured Thal. However, Nadir Khan squandered his initial advantage and handed the initiative to the British. Brigadier General Dyer assembled a relief force at Kohat and implemented a deception plan, whereby he assembled dummy artillery from logs and used brushwood on the mud flaps of his motor vehicles, which raised great clouds of dust, to give the impression that a large force was approaching. It is alleged that Nadir Khan fell for the ruse, stating: 'In the name of God, we have the whole artillery of India coming against us' . 
29
The Afghan position consisted of two wings held by irregulars while the centre, on hills to the west of the town, was held by the Afghan Army, now reinforced to 19,000 men. Dyer launched another deception plan by shelling the northern wing, but making an attack with all his forces against the southern hills. 
30
The RAF had assisted in the harassment of Nadir Khan's forces, but perhaps their most important contribution was the bombing of Kabul and Jalalabad. Just over a ton of explosives were dropped on Jalalabad in one day, which caused panic. The temporary collapse of order encouraged rural clans to descend on the city and loot it. In Kabul, the effect of the bombing was no less profound and was mentioned by Amanullah's negotiators as a key factor in their calculation to sue for peace. The first requests for a ceasefire were issued on 14 May, but it was not until 2 June that the British accepted the majority of the Afghan proposals. The British insisted that the Afghan troops withdraw 20 miles from British units and that the clans were to be informed that all hostilities had ceased.
Amanullah tried to rescue himself from the débâcle he had created by insisting on full independence, while claiming that he had not started the war. Invoking the memory of the two previous Anglo-Afghan wars, he reminded the British that: 'The Afghan nation had repeatedly been a cause of destruction and ruination to any foreign power on its sacred soil…' 
31
The Afghans possessed no effective counter-measures against air attacks, although concentrations of irregulars adapted their tactics by concealment, standing still or lying under cover as aircraft approached. They managed to shoot down aircraft with a slow climb rate from the highest mountains, but there was really no adequate response to this development in warfare. Nadir Khan tried to maintain his own pressure on the British by encouraging irregulars astride the Durand Line to fire on British camps. Indeed, the prolonged presence of British garrisons created fears of a permanent occupation, just as it had in the 1890s. Yet Afghanistan and its clans remained as divided as ever. Not all Pashtuns joined the resistance, and Abdul Qudus hinted that he would be willing to make a separate peace if Amanullah proved unwilling to compromise and the British would assist him to take power.

The government's irregular forces swarmed over Khost and sacked the province. In January 1925 the leader of the revolt, the 'lame mullah' , was captured and executed along with his family. However, the rebellion had cost the Afghan government the equivalent of £5 million in state revenue and had demoralized the army. The most important contributions had come from the irregulars, and also from the British who supplied Lewis guns (a light machine gun), rifles, ammunition and two aircraft, piloted by Germans. British assistance was nevertheless condemned because a son of the former Amir Yakub Khan, Abdul Karim, had arrived from British territory in Khost at the height of the rebellion to claim the throne. The suspicion was that Britain had encouraged the revolt as revenge for the Third Anglo-Afghan War, but it was necessary for the Amir to distance himself from any association with the British in order to maintain his legitimacy.
The Afghan Army deteriorated in quality after the Khost rebellion, despite the purchase of some new technologies. 
38

Interestingly Amanullah had relied on the Afghan artillery to hold the city of Kabul when many of his troops, who had not been paid, deserted. Amanullah capitulated only when he found that he had no troops left to defend the city. Habibullah had started his campaign to take the capital by sniping into the city at night, and did not launch an attack until he had gathered sufficient numbers to overwhelm the defenders. 
41
The country soon began to fragment along familiar lines. The Ghilzais believed that Nadir Khan might provide an opportunity for looting and offered him support. Durrani Pashtuns took control of Kandahar, making it autonomous. Meanwhile, Ghulam Nabi Khan, son of Abdur Rahman's Commander in Chief, recruited Uzbeks and Turcoman Afghans, and seized Mazar-i Sharif for a time. Nadir Khan tried to advance on Ghazni but was attacked by the Ghilzai leader, Ghaus ud-din, and forced to withdraw to Gardez in June. A second offensive into Logar also failed on 10 July 1929. Habibullah drove his opponents away from Kabul and captured Kandahar, executing Ali Ahmad Jan for attempting to assert his independence there. Nadir Khan concentrated on propaganda and enlisted the Kabul Khel Waziris as his principal allies, appealing for support from Pashtuns on the British side of the border. With these forces, he mounted a third offensive in August 1929 which retook Gardez at the end of that month. At almost the same time, the Hazaras inflicted two defeats on Habibullah's army at Sirchashma near Kabul. Habibullah's detachment in Kandahar was also defeated, although they held the citadel. Habibullah then attempted to disarm clan fighters in the vicinity of Kabul, but this aroused more resentment.
Nadir Khan was able to advance on the capital soon after via the Logar Valley and emerged at Charasiab on 6 October. Here Habibullah's men were entrenched. Thinking they had driven off Nadir's assaulting forces, they set off in pursuit. To their astonishment, the Waziri lashkar had feigned its withdrawal deliberately and Habibullah's men found themselves in a killing zone. They attempted to retreat to the trenches, but the pursuit was so rapid that all cohesion was lost. The trenches were overrun and Nadir Khan marched into Kabul the same afternoon. It took a further three days of bombardment to force the Bala Hissar to surrender.
To claim legitimacy Nadir Khan declared himself Nadir Shah, the Padshah (king) of Afghanistan. 
42
43
Resistance by the Pashtuns under British Administration, 1919-24   In 1919, at the height of the Third Anglo-Afghan War, it had taken some time to mobilize Pashtun resistance to the British. This time lag may be explained by the fact that many clans were in receipt of subsidies and had enjoyed a long period without any British presence in the area beyond the infrequent visits of Political Officers and their khassadars. However, fear of occupation, the opportunity of loot offered by the vulnerable lines of communication that threaded their way through the mountains, and the appeal of joining the Afghans in a war against the British all acted as incentives to action. The collapse of the Waziristan militias in British service and the pursuit of their British officers added to a sense of momentum.
The militiamen and those Pashtuns who had served in the Indian Army during the First World War brought with them new tactics and techniques, including the coordination of fire and movement by small bodies of riflemen. When organized, the fighters could lay down withering suppressive fire while others dashed closer to the British lines. 
44
In the summer of 1919, the Tochi Valley and the Khyber Pass were recaptured, but resistance continued within the North West Frontier Province and it was decided to send a punitive expedition, the Dejerat column (DERA-COL), into Mahsud territory that winter. An attempt to establish picquets on a feature known as Mandana Hill on the first day, 18 December, was a disaster for the British. Two detachments of Indian troops were sent up the slopes but were ambushed as they crested the hill. Their retreat was so dramatic that British officers laconically described the event as 'Derby day' , since each unit appeared to be in a race to reach the base of the hill first. The next day the exercise was repeated, and morale amongst the Indian soldiers was badly shaken. On the third day, the units were dispatched to another uncontested feature known as Tarakai or Black Hill. The operation seemed to be a success and sangars were constructed, but, before they were finished, the Mahsuds moved a substantial lashkar stealthily up the far side of the hill, and then made a sudden assault over the last few yards. The plan was to pursue this time and to overrun the British encampment below. Most of the Indian troops fled, but a detachment of 3/24 th Sikh Pioneers held off a series of attacks on the summit until their ammunition ran out. Their delaying action, and artillery fire from the valley floor, were sufficient to persuade the Mahsuds to abandon the main attack. 
45
46
47
The failure to hold Ahnai Tangi Gorge meant that the Mahsuds fell back on the Barai Tangi defile, and here a new innovation was attempted. Light artillery, provided by the Afghans, opened up in defence of their positions, but the weight of British artillery fire and strafes by aircraft silenced them. As the weather deteriorated and there seemed to be no way to halt Skeen's 'steamroller' , Mahsud resistance began to fade.
The long-running security problem for the British on the North West Frontier and in Baluchistan, and particularly the unrest caused by the Faqir of Ipi in Waziristan in the years 1936-9, resulted in protracted military operations, but, fortunately for the British, the frontier had been relatively quiet during the First World War. Political agitation by the Pashtun movement that allied itself with Congress, the Khudai Khidmatgar or 'Redshirts' of Abdul Gaffar Khan, occasionally turned violent, but its period of protest was short-lived and it was easily contained. 
48
In Waziristan, Mirza Ali Khan, a pious Tori Khel Wazir, stirred agitation against the British when the verdict of a high-profile legal case involving a young girl was announced. The agitation led to a wave of raids, arson and murder. 
49
50
51
52
Post-operational analyses stated that the situation had been the result of insufficient artillery, too little route security by picqueting caused by the imper-ative to link up both columns, and a lack of experience amongst the units involved. However, it also revealed a fatal miscalculation about the psychology of the Pashtuns: the advance of the British columns seemed to confirm the Faqir of Ipi's assertions that roads and new garrisons were but a prelude to the full occupation of the tribal areas, the destruction of Islam and the expropriation of their lands. 
53
To unify the direction of operations, General Sir John Coleridge was given the command of all the military forces, Civil Armed Forces and the RAF assets. Having provoked the fighting and faced armed resistance, at this stage the British saw the solution in entirely military terms. The road was built in just two months whilst the qalas of known insurgent leaders were destroyed. The whole region was saturated with troops to concentrate force, but air operations were limited to an area 5 miles ahead and either side of the subsequent advance by 'Khaicol' , another well-armed column. The headquarters compound of the Faqir at Arsal Kot was destroyed and Afghan volunteers, who had come to the aid of the Waziris, were driven off. British civilian control was then re-established when the Tori Khel submitted, but not until a total of 166 casualties had been sustained. 
54

56
However, as so often in an insurgency, their losses were replaced, and, over the summer of 1937, the Faqir's lashkar strength increased to approximately 4,000 men. There were further raids into settled areas, with more attacks on bridges, culverts and picquets along the new road. Sniping against patrols was also frequent. The most successful and audacious ambush for the tribesmen occurred at Shahur Tangi on 9 April 1937. 
57
On 22 April, a new drive by British forces took place in the Khaisora and Shaktu areas, operating where it was relatively easy for armour and for aircraft to coordinate with ground attacks, but the lashkars carefully avoided fighting the full might of the Indian Army. Instead, the tribesmen waited for the opportunity to inflict heavier losses. To deter any further encroachments into their territory, they made a determined night attack on an encampment. Nevertheless, two days later, the same lashkar was caught in the open by artillery fire and air attack. On 30 April, another group of 100 clansmen was surprised as they tried to move between ambush positions. By the beginning of May, the clans around Khaisora had suffered significant losses. To administer the coup de grâce, 'WazDiv' (Waziristan Division), the formation based at Dosalli, intended to strike against the Tori Khels in Shaktu, the Faqir's stronghold. On 11 May the column made an unorthodox overnight advance over the Iblanke Range led by the Tochi Scouts. 
58
Although the Faqir escaped, the accumulated losses ensured that many fighters gave up the campaign at this point and a proportion of the Afghan volunteers left the Faqir's cause. In fact, the majority of the Tori Khels had obeyed their maliks, under the pressure of the British Political Officers, to keep out of the fighting. This was evidence of the weakness of the Faqir's cause and exemplified the importance for the British of a political effort alongside the military one. Moreover, when his base at Arsal Kot was taken, and his cave complex destroyed, the Faqir's prestige and credibility were further reduced. 
59
The Waziristan campaign had been fought by only a few thousand tribesmen but it had required 61,000 troops to suppress it, a ratio not uncommon in other insurgencies. 
60
The principle of letting local forces lead where possible, in order to reduce costs, to make full use of their knowledge, and to avoid the antagonism created by the presence of 'foreigners' , was well understood by the British authorities. The Tochi Scouts, who were about 5,000 strong, had proved useful when deployed alongside regulars or on independent pursuits. They were mobile, had local knowledge, and could operate on the flanks and rear against insurgents' attacks, although they were too lightly armed for sustained battles. It was even suggested that the Indian Army should recreate a specialized frontier unit which would be made up almost entirely of this sort of light infantry. However, the idea was rejected as impractical, on the grounds that the army needed to be prepared to fight in Afghanistan primarily against regular forces, although concerns about the reliability of the existing locally recruited auxiliaries in certain cases also played a part in the decision.

Although major operations had ceased in 1937, the Faqir of Ipi remained at large, and between 1938 and 1939 'irreconcilable tribesmen' continued to snipe at troops and posts, attack roads, rob traffic and cut telephone lines. 
68
69
Throughout operations in Waziristan, the British had kept a close eye on the Afghans. Referring to all Pashtuns, a military handbook was published in 1933 and advised: 'They appreciate justice, an open hand, firmness and patience, good humour and the English disposition to punish and be friends again' , but there was also a warning that the Pashtuns and Afghans were a mass of contradictions. 
70
The British military handbook illustrated the characteristics of regular armies operating in mountain warfare, highlighting the importance of the need to picquet heights on a route, well-sited perimeter camps, and recommended movements along spurs and not vulnerable nalas. There was always a need for the careful coordination of rearguards, advice to 'get settled before dark by proper calculation of time and space' , the avoidance of weak detachments, and an emphasis on leaving strong camps and depots. The guide suggested that, against Afghans, commanders should 'never hesitate or remain inactive' and that speed and energy were required. The handbook noted that, since 'fanaticism' impels sudden charges by Afghans, troops should be prepared at all times for these rushes, and, referring to British firepower, suggested they 'will dissolve if resolutely met' . In defence, it was suggested that 'Afghans will hold a position with utmost determination until their front is penetrated or flank turned' then they make 'a sudden retreat in disorder' .
To counter the guerrilla-style low intensity conflict in the mountains, officers were told to 'Do unto the Afghans as they do unto you' , namely 'lay ambushes, especially in withdrawal; use night marches; dawn attacks and frequent surprises, especially in winter' when their supplies were more vulnerable. There was advice to 'never make terms with the Afghans, unless they can be compelled to observe those terms' , and 'never attempt to conceal military weakness by the payment of subsidies or bribes' , although this was a practice familiar to Political Officers. Readers were advised to 'pay cash on deliverynever in advance' for their locally procured supplies because the locals could not be trusted to engage in honest commerce. Infringements of all kinds were to be punished in a way that was 'stern and drastic' since 'half measures are worse than useless' . When fighting had broken out, officers were urged to take offensive action which should be 'planned to inflict the heaviest casualties' , followed by a 'relentless pursuit' . Tribunals that attempted to carry out a trial and an execution of individual guerrillas were not advised since they 'just exasperate and fuel resentment' . The handbook concluded with an awareness of the patience that Afghans exhibit and the importance of regaining a sense of honour, noting that 'Afghans will often wait for hours if compelled to abandon a position, and pursue [British forces] as a means to regain honour' . There was also a suggestion that Afghans would try to conceal their weaknesses for the sake of honour, for, when forced to retreat: 'They invariably contend they were merely luring an enemy into a trap' .
At the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939, there were forty-eight British and Indian battalions on the North West Frontier, which represented 38 per cent of the army in India's peacetime strength and gave some indication of how seriously the colonial authorities took the threat and manpower demands of guerrilla warfare. With the Faqir of Ipi still raiding Derajat, in December 1940 it was decided to build frontier posts in Waziristan. However, intelligence that the Faqir of Ipi was the object of some interest to German and Italian envoys in Afghanistan, and the success of the Wehrmacht against Russia in 1941, caused concern.

There were multiple explanations for this trend. The Governor admitted that during the war 'we have a large number of local people of influence, including many of the best known mullahs, working for us' .

A confidential report in December noted that in Kurram and Dera Ismail Khan, 'the general attitude of the people [was] excellent' .

79
The Faqir of Ipi remained at large until 1960, but his campaign of resistance was never as effective as it had been, briefly, in 1936. After the war, the British returned to their policy of maintaining local auxiliaries in the frontier province while keeping larger regular garrisons further back inside British territory. The British, nevertheless, were soon to leave South Asia and the NWFP was incorporated into Pakistan. Relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan were tense periodically, but, despite calls for a revision of the border, there were no major conflicts, not least because Pakistan's focus was on fighting India and contesting the sovereignty of Kashmir. Afghanistan would not be troubled by a serious conflict until the domestic unrest of the 1970s.
Resistance to the Afghan communist government and the subsequent Soviet military intervention changed profoundly the manner in which the Afghans conducted war. This was, in essence, a civil war into which foreign forces of the 'Soviet Limited Contingent' were committed, but which also drew in Pakistan, the United States and, in a more limited way, Iran and a number of Gulf States. Foreign intervention changed the character of the war dramatically and affected the lives of every Afghan more comprehensively than previous conflicts, but this was also an intensely ideological war which had long-term effects on the country and on the region. The resistance groups found themselves in an asymmetrical conflict which required new approaches to warfare, and a whole generation was schooled in the arts of guerrilla operations and political warfare, with varying degrees of success.
After the Soviet withdrawal, the civil war continued and new approaches to fighting emerged in the form of conventional operations. These were conducted using former communist government and Soviet equipment or arms and munitions supplied by Pakistan, although for some it proved difficult to shake off the guerrilla style of fighting. This preference, the sheer number of factions and the parity of strength between them led to a protracted conflict. In this period Afghan force structures also changed. The most dramatic development was the gradual disintegration of the Afghan regular army and the emergence of militias led by paramilitary freebooters popularly styled as 'warlords' . Yet there were some themes of consistency, and older cultural traditions influenced the conduct of operations during the Soviet War. Indeed, it is striking how the conflict was interpreted through the traditional Afghan cultural lens. Nevertheless, in almost every aspect of the way the war was fought, even in the realm of negotiations, there was a great deal of change.
In the 1960s, Prime Minister Daud Mohammd Khan had championed the creation of 'Pashtunistan' which would wrest the North West Frontier Province from Pakistan, fulfil an irredentist dream of recovering lost territory, and create a powerful, Ghilzai-dominated bloc in Afghan politics. The Afghan government extended support to the mullahs of the Federally Administered Tribal Area and even appeared complicit in a 1960 uprising of 15,000 Pashtuns who crossed the Durand Line, with the Afghan Army closely behind them.

In fact, Daoud wore his communist credentials lightly and would have preferred to make Afghanistan a non-aligned nation. He resented Brezhnev's demands and the influx of yet more Soviet advisors. His attempts to achieve a rapprochement with Pakistan, an ally of the United States, increased Soviet suspicions that Daoud might be insincere in his politics. The death of a Parcham official under suspicious circumstances soon generated fears of a purge of the entire PDPA. Given Daoud's true allegiances, this fear had some grounds. On 15 March 1979, Khalqi officials and their Soviet advisors were attacked by a mob in Herat chanting Islamic slogans.

Afghanistan had descended into civil war. It is striking that the period between April 1978 and December 1979 is so often overshadowed by the subsequent Soviet intervention. Nevertheless, this was a critical period in Afghanistan's politics, generating violent and widespread opposition to the government in Kabul to such an extent that, as soon as Soviet forces arrived, they were confronted by armed and increasingly organized resistance.
With Iran in turmoil in 1979, and the West deploying medium-range nuclear missiles in Europe, Moscow felt it had to act to restore order and influence along its vulnerable southern flank, not least because an Islamist revolt threatened to engulf the Central Asian Soviet Republics. With Hungary ( 
1956
However, the USSR's intervention was seen by the embittered Afghan people as another form of coercion, and Karmal was regarded as little more than the puppet of a foreign power. Worse, the reform agenda of the government confirmed fears that the regime intended to restructure Afghanistan completely. The opposition to the Afghan government and its Soviet military support therefore assumed the character of a struggle for liberation from foreign ideologues in defence of Islam. The resistance believed they were defending the people and the very fabric of their life in a people's war. One fighter remarked to a journalist: 'Why do you differentiate between fighters and old men, women and children? If you have courage and treasure freedom, you are mujahed. We are all mujahedeen' .

The overall strategy was initially to deny the resistance of popular support, but when this failed the Soviets turned to severing the means by which the insurgents could be supplied. This meant not only stripping areas of civilians or of persuading them, through destruction, that it was too costly to support the resistance, but also of interdicting supply routes from outside the country. The bulk of the insurgents' war material came over the Pakistan border. A series of operations were mounted to clear particular nests of support and to cut these lines of communications, but the steady attrition through ambushes and mines meant that, between 1980 and 1985, the Soviet 40 th Army lost 9,175 killed in action.
To wean the Afghan population from the resistance, the Soviets continued with their pre-war development work and initiated new projects. Road building, well digging and urban development projects were common. At Jalalabad, a major irrigation project had produced six large state farms, producing citrus fruit, vegetable oils, dairy products and meat. The work had included the con-struction of a dam and a canal, a hydroelectric power station, a workshop, a timber yard and a jam factory. Soviet civilian advisors, numbering over 2,800 men and women, continued to operate as best they could, although most were armed or protected. Not all advisors were civilian. There were between 1,600 and 1,800 Soviet military advisers in Afghanistan by the end of 1980, some of whom had served in the country before the intervention. The Soviets retained most influence at senior levels. There were at least 60 generals, and the rest were distributed at a ratio of 11 officers to each Afghan Army division, 4 to each regiment and 4 to every battalion, each of which had one or more interpreters.

Yousaf knew that there could be no conventional operations against the logistical chain from the Soviet frontier to the major urban centres, and much as he would have preferred to 'turn their flank' and sever their line of communications, he had to orchestrate a campaign of a thousand cuts: 'The better strategy would be the raid, the ambush, the stand-off attack, but made with such frequency and ferocity that the loss of blood from these multiple cuts would seriously weaken the enemy's ability to continue' . He believed in 'the added benefit of compelling the Soviets to tie down an ever higher proportion of their men in static security duties' .

The Soviets developed their tactics in response to the guerrilla operations of the Mujahideen. Seizing the high ground with paratrooper units and heliborne lifts in a form of vertical envelopment replaced a purely armour-infan-try doctrine, although the extensive use of firepower, including artillery and mortar concentrations, tended to squander the element of surprise. Airstrikes and carpet bombing were particularly important throughout the campaign. Colonel Aleksandr Rutskoi of the Soviet air force told the Russian parliament after the war that air power had been effective in neutralizing resistance: 'A kishlak fires at us and kills someone. I send up a couple of planes and there is nothing left of the kishlak. After I've burned a couple of kishlaks they stop shooting' .

While regular motor rifle formations were the most numerous forces in all major operations, and some reached high levels of efficiency and competency in mountain warfare, the Mujahideen reserved the greatest respect for the elite Spetznaz, parachute units, and reconnaissance elements of the Motor Rifle Regiments. All units were capable of mounting ambushes. In July 1983 the Mujahideen had not observed the necessary security precaution of varying their route, and they were subjected to an ambush where the Soviets had dug in tanks and infantry on two sides of a valley with a stop group to close off the exit. The ambush resulted in the killing of over 100 fighters and drivers. 
22
The defence of urban areas and keeping open routes were fundamental parts of the Soviet strategy, which absorbed much of the Afghan government forces and more than 20,000 soldiers of 40 th Army. A network of over 800 blockhouses (zastavas) were placed at regular intervals around major cities, airports, power stations, along roads and pipelines, and on strategically important high ground. Each one had the ability to call in an airstrike or artillery barrage in a FPF (final protective fire) plan. The remote posts, particularly those near the border, were manned by Afghan troops less than enthusiastic about their duties. While some zastavo were attacked, other garrisons exercised a 'live and let live' system. Giradet visited one in 1982 and found 'a group of bored conscripts, … kicking an empty can about. We met several soldiers hauling water from a nearby desert well. We shook hands and they watched as dozens of guerrillas marched by, leading strings of pack mules loaded with arms, ammunition and other supplies' . 
23
The Afghan Army, which was supposed to support the Soviets, was plagued by desertions, defections, informers, ghost pay rolling and even murdered some of its Russian officers. Many battalions were unwilling to engage in combat. In theory the army of 1979 consisted of 10 divisions, armed with modern Soviet weapons, with its own integral aircraft, armour and artillery. 
24
25
The desertions reached epidemic proportions by 1980, with the losing a quarter of their strength. The government lowered the age of conscription from 18 to 15, forced villages to provide manpower at gunpoint, increased service to a three-year term and mobilized reservists up to the age of 39, although sometimes men of 55 were still serving.

This attitude led to unofficial understandings between government troops and the resistance. Major Izmailov, a Muslim in the Soviet 40 th Army, took the view that the Afghans needed to be treated courteously, recommending that convoys drove through villages at very low speeds to avoid accidents, stopping to help if there were accidents, and crucially talking to the village elders prior to moves. If there were some incident, Izmailov argued, the Afghans would take payment in kind in compensation, even for a death. Conversely, if the Russians refused to accept responsibility or give compensation then the Afghans assert badal, mining the routes and setting up ambushes. The Mujahideen claimed that their intelligence was so good they could identify column commanders. Izmailov related how one Soviet colonel who refused to treat the locals well had his column ambushed in February 1987 and the colonel was killed.

Meanwhile, the Afghan Army continued to be strengthened: discipline was tightened and desertion curtailed. To ameliorate the feelings of the popula-tion, freedom of religion was declared and mullahs were incorporated into the Afghan Army's administration. However, the Mujahideen did their best to spread their influence within the army and try to prevent an end to combat operations. Thus the protracted character of the war continued. There were occasional operations led by the Afghan Army and supported by Soviet firepower, but the Russians began their withdrawal in 1987. That year, aside from Operation Majistral in Khost and Operation Typhoon in the Panjshir, Soviet forces remained largely on the defensive.
Jon Lee Anderson, who travelled with the Afghan resistance, observed:
Just as they can be harsh when deciding the fate of other people's lives, they can also be stoic when it comes to their own. This stoicism comes out of their culture, in which war enjoys an exalted status, and from their faith in the Islamic idea that after death, a better life awaits. If they are to die, so be it, as long as they do well in battle in the eyes of God. They are mujahedin, holy warriors. They live to make holy war, to kill the enemy, and if necessary be martyred themselves. These are facts they accept. Most of them would have it no other way.

For some, death was in the hands of Allah and would mean access to Paradise, but recklessness tended to be an attitude more acceptable to the Arab volunteers. Indeed, some Arab fighters who joined the conflict with 'a murderous hatred of non-Muslim Westerners' favoured a deliberately self-sacrificial approach to combat and were criticized by Afghans. 
41
Nevertheless Islam became the justification for all military activities, and was a convenient means to motivate the resistance fighters. It was even said, citing the Prophet, that 'the Mujahid who spends one night on guard duty has performed equally with the ordinary man who prays for a thousand nights' . 
42
The Mujahideen fighters were rarely able to articulate a concept of strategy or victory, emphasizing instead that they had to endure and continue the struggle as an obligation, and they focused on repeated tactical engagements. The Mujahideen knew their own local territory and they felt compelled to fight for it, but the war gave certain individuals a new and important status as fighters and areas of responsibility for particular commanders expanded. This enabled the Mujahideen to develop from a purely localized resistance into a national insurgency. There was some encouragement in the fact that outsiders, especially the Arabs, had come to fight on their behalf. Most significantly, there was an elevation in the status of the mullahs, who provided the ideological justification for the fighting and sustained the resistance psychologically. In times of crisis, the ulema had always assumed a more prominent position, and the protracted character of the war made this change of status more permanent. Jirgas also had a renaissance as elders organized the establishment of surveillance teams, guides to Mujahideen groups that were in transit, and local security. 
43
44
45
However, there were significant technological developments which once again forced the Afghans to adapt their 'way of war' . The helicopter and the anti-personnel mine were particularly important in hindering their traditional methods of guerrilla resistance to outsiders, just as aircraft had done in 1919 and 'precision strike' was to do in 2001. In the 1980s, the Mujahideen were forced to adapt their techniques although they never acquired a solution to the new weapons. Some managed to bring down even heavily armoured assault helicopters with curtains of heavy machine guns, and there were even attempts to lure aircraft into pre-designated canyon killing zones. 
46
47
48
To increase their reach, the Mujahideen tried to acquire heavier weapons including heavy machine guns, MBRLs (multi-barrelled rocket launchers), an improvised single-barrelled version, mortars, anti-tank recoil-less rifles, and even tanks and anti-aircraft guns. 
49
In terms of tactics, the Mujahideen proved adept at ambush and the pursuit of small detachments. However, at times there was a tendency to want direct engagements rather than more clandestine and operationally effective targeting: 'They wanted noise, excitement, personal glory and the spoils of war' . 
50
51
Guerrilla forces rarely hold ground, and it is in the nature of guerrillas to remain elusive and sacrifice space for time. However, all guerrilla forces need space to manoeuvre. If cornered, the Mujahideen could not survive. By the mid 1980s, the Mujahideen were able to move over 85 per cent of the country. What they could not do, however, was establish a permanent presence. Every valley and district could only be held temporarily. Major urban areas remained outside their control, even though they could transit through them and conduct operations within them. Although they made attempts to capture towns, they had not the means to hold them, and Soviet retaliation was inevitable. Large-scale attacks, especially in the early years, were often costly and ineffec-tive. One Western intelligence officer remarked that, if concentrated and giving the government '"a whiff of the old Jihad", they got a bloody taste of cannon fire and napalm from the air' .

This was the first operation where we met major resistance. There were ambushes [and]  the roads were blown up … On the way back along the mountain path, my battalion was ambushed. Thirteen men were killed in the leading platoon. My own platoon had been in the lead on the way out, and so we were in the rearguard on the way back. We stopped for the night, and had to beat off a number of Mujahideen attacks: their weapons in those days were simple, many of them home made. They didn't get mortars until later. The numbers opposing us were very small-perhaps only a few dozen. 
57

59
The ISI offered training to the Mujahideen as a means of getting influence over the operations of the resistance. The offer of weapons and ammunition, as well as money and supplies, created competition amongst Mujahideen commanders as they vied for Pakistan's support. In return, the Mujahideen were expected to carry out operations designed by the ISI. Allegedly, there were occasions when the Mujahideen commanders claimed to have fulfilled operations in order to obtain more weapons and supplies, but in reality no operation had taken place. The training, particularly on prestige weapons, was much sought after, but not all training was a success. Experiments with the Blowpipe SAM were a failure, and Cordovez and Harrison estimated that only half of all Stinger launches hit their target.

There was a regular traffic of weapons and supplies across the Afghanistan-Pakistan border. Edward Giradet noted that merchants would transit goods out of Afghanistan and then ship weapons and ammunition back on the return journey, charging money for the service. Old smuggling routes with storage facilities were also invaluable. Transport included buses, jeeps, trucks, motorbikes and mules. 
69
70
71
The Mujahideen also tried raising money locally from the population in order to sustain their resistance. Some units set up their own 'shadow' taxation system, expropriating the traditional zakat and ushr for the war effort. Some of the funds paid for their own levies of part-time fighters. 
72
73
The ISI were frustrated that, amongst the Mujahideen, there appeared to be little logistical planning. There was 'no discernible pattern to their activities; they fought when they saw an opportunity or they needed loot, and when the time suited them' .

Khost lies 10 miles from the border with Pakistan and is linked by a mountain road, vulnerable to ambush, to Gardez and Kabul. The most critical section crosses the 10,000 foot Satykandav Pass. The guerrilla force in the area was led by Jalaluddin Haqqani who was supported by the ISI.

The Soviets and Afghan Army had made a brief attempt to neutralize the resistance around Zhawar in 1983, but the offensive which began on 20 August 1985 was a far larger and more elaborate operation. The Mujahideen, who had failed to observe basic security precautions, were taken by surprise when a combined infantry and artillery attack began to the north-east of the base. 
82
83
With the high ground secure, the DRA troops began to direct air strikes against Mujahideen positions further back, and they were able to bring more forces through the Manay Kandow Pass. Anti-aircraft guns and small arms were unable to arrest the government offensive at this point. When the DRA troops took Tor Kamar, a prominent peak, it put them within half a mile of the Zhawar base. However, Alam Jam and Muhammad Salim, two Mujahideen commanders, deployed their tanks out of the cave complex and opened fire on the hill top sangars. The first round destroyed an artillery OP, and after several attempts a second OP was neutralized. This encouraged the Afghan Army troops to withdraw other exposed posts and fall back. For five days more deliberate operations were mounted, but they failed to take any of the Mujahideen positions. The entire offensive was terminated after forty-two days of almost continuous fighting. The Mujahideen had lost 106 killed and 321 wounded. The Soviet offensive postponed Mujahideen attacks on Khost and caused some serious concern in Pakistan. The ISI believed the fall of the base would have proved catastrophic to the resistance because it was such an important logistics hub. 
84
The Mujahideen strengthened the Zhawar base prior to the next Soviet offensive in 1986. Anti-aircraft defences were pushed out to 7 kilometres from the base itself and a series of defences constructed in depth. All the likely approaches were mined and covered by small arms, RPGs, mortars and recoil-less rifles. 
85
At 07.00 hrs the first heliborne troops began to deploy in a series of dispersed landing zones around Zhawar, including the eastern side of the base, close to the Pakistan border. Although two helicopters were destroyed at these landing sites, the Mujahideen had no effective means to defeat the aircraft that supported them and air strikes destroyed several Mujahideen positions. 
86
87
88
The Afghan Army made a series of attempts to push through the Manay Kandow Pass and was held up in a repeat of the operation of the previous year. A flanking column unhinged the defence and forced the Mujahideen to fall back. As more troops poured into the Zhawar area, the Mujahideen decided not to contest the base any longer and dispersed. Rumours that Haqqani was dead had a profound effect on the fighters' morale at this point. 
89
90
In the history of the war, many have tended to overlook the weaknesses of the Mujahideen resistance. One of the most serious structural problems was in command and control because of deep divisions amongst the resistance. The Mujahideen was never a homogeneous organization, but a patchwork of competing factions. 
91
92
93
The ISI were critical of the Mujahideen commanders' 'rigidity, resistance to change and proud inflexibility' , which caused 'serious problems in the tactical field' . There was 'endless bickering' and sometimes a point-blank refusal to cooperate with other parties of commanders.

Uzbek and Tajik groups got less support from the Pakistani ISI, partly because of the distance from the Durand Line border, but also because of deliberate obstruction by rival Afghan groups.

The one group free of the internecine faction fighting of the Mujahideen was the Shi'ite Hazaras. Traditionally ostracized by Pashtuns and occupying the central mountain belt of the country, the Hazaras elected their own president, Sayed Ali Behesti, and military commander, Sayed Mohammad Hussein, known by his nom de guerre as Djendral. The Shia party, Mardaz-e Wahdat or the Centre of Unity, came to dominate all political activity in the Hazarajat. The fighters stated that their aim was to fight the Soviets, but, in an echo of Iranian revolutionary rhetoric, they aimed for liberation 'for the whole world' against oppression, by which they also meant the Pashtuns. 
103
The Hazara method was to sustain a guerrilla army of 20,000 men aged twenty-two, each of whom was required to provide one year's service. Those Hazaras in other countries, including inside Iran, were expected to contribute a tax in lieu of their absence. Each group of ten families was expected to pay for the costs of maintaining a conscript fighter in the field, including his rations and a small salary. Given the hardships that most families faced, this demand was unpopular and hard to meet. Each Hazara fighter received a month's training from former Afghan Army officers before being sent to a local japha, or front. The fighters served up to eleven months in the field, covering strategic entry points into the mountains. Regular telephone communications linked the centres of resistance and the fronts, which gave the Hazaras the ability to mobilize large numbers in an emergency. During a sudden Soviet assault near Ghazni in December 1980, fighters poured in from outlying areas.

No single leader emerged to lead the Mujahideen, although there was a suggestion that King Zahir Shah might serve as a figurehead. In 1984, at a meeting in Peshawar, Hekmatyar's representative argued: 'The people of Afghanistan need a leader. Everybody wants Zahir Shah because he is all we have' .

Unfortunately we are in danger of losing our people. This is where the Soviets may succeed. Failing to crush us by force, as they have said they would with each offensive, they have turned their wrath on defenceless people, killing old men, women and children, destroying houses and burning crops. They are doing everything possible to drive our people away.

It had not always been that way. He had been exiled after Daoud's coup in 1973 with other Islamist militants under Rabbani.

In May 1982, in retaliation, the Soviets launched an offensive into the Panjshir with 12,000 troops and all the accompanying assets of armour, artillery and air power. The preliminary bombardment, systematically destroying one village after another, lasted a week. Heliborne troops seized the highest ground and valley junctions. On 17 May, after three days of fighting, the southern portion of the valley was overrun and a northern pincer completed the occupation. Reinforcements were then brought in to relieve the heliborne units at the northern end of the valley after Masoud's men targeted the most isolated detachments. The guerrillas had fallen back as the Soviet and Afghan Army approached, and they concealed themselves in pre-designated positions, replete with rations, ammunition and other stores.

With the exception of Masoud and the Hazaras, welfare of the local population was, perhaps surprisingly, low on the list of priorities of the Mujahideen. There were only a handful of schools, literacy programmes, medical dispensaries or sources of economic support, in contrast to many other global insurgency movements. Masoud purposely established twenty-eight schools in the Panjshir Valley, a hospital and a prison. He sent representatives to Pakistan to obtain regular supplies and to ensure that his faction was represented in any resistance alliance.

Gulbuddin Hekmatyar placed considerable emphasis on propaganda. As early as 1979 he established a radio station to broadcast the existence of his Hezb movement, its aims and achievements.

Recruitment to the cause was relatively simple for the Mujahideen. In most cases recruits were members of the family or clan, serving under a local leader. The leaders themselves often felt obliged to show solidarity with the cause. Entire communities could be swayed to join either the government or the resistance in this way. Some young men joined for the chance to prove themselves or for the thrill of adventure. Abdul Salam Zaeef admitted that the first group he joined did not fulfil his expectations so he went looking for a team with a more formidable reputation for action.

The Mujahideen would argue that age was of no consequence in the struggle. 'Boys of 13 or 14 and men in their sixties with snow white beards' , noted Yousaf, 'frequently fought side by side' .

Najibullah resorted to buying support and abandoned his attempts to reunite the PDPA. He continued the policy of coercion and ignored the Soviet Union's calls to initiate a policy of reconciliation. Gorbachev had urged the Afghan communists to: 'Widen your social base. Learn, at last, to lead a dialogue with the tribes, use the particularities [of the situation]. Try to get the support of the ulema. Give up the leftist bend in economics. Learn to organize the support of the private sector…' 
141
The Soviet military intervention in Afghanistan was not, as contemporary Western observers suggested, part of the 'onward march of socialism' in Asia, but an attempt to shore up an increasingly unpopular and divided Afghan communist regime under the PDPA. Publicly, the Soviets were confident of victory on behalf of Afghan socialism because they believed their historically progressive ideology opposed an Asiatic backwardness that was doomed to extinction. However, there were real concerns that the Islamist nature of the unrest in Herat, much of which had been directed against Soviet advisors and their families, might herald an Islamic revolution in Soviet Central Asia, or provide the opportunity for Western intelligence to exploit the vulnerable southern flank of the USSR. The combined fears and ideological position of the Soviets, with the angry reaction of the opposition in Afghanistan, made any negotiations unlikely, and therefore the two sides would be difficult to reconcile. However, what made any rapprochement even more unlikely was the brutal heavy-handedness of the government and its secret service, the KhAD. The inability of the PDPA to reconcile divisions within its own ranks, particularly between the Parcham and Khalqi branches of the party (which themselves reflected ethnic or qawm fracture lines as well as ideological splits), meant that Soviet intervention was likely.
The Soviets had regarded Afghanistan as a potential protégé from the 1930s, but the Revolution by Mohammed Daoud in 1973 and its apparently pro-communist character cemented the Soviet alignment. When Soviet forces failed to totally extinguish resistance by their sheer presence, they applied overwhelming force. The 'stick' was accompanied by the 'carrot' of reforms designed to bring about modernization in agriculture and bureaucracy, and there were active campaigns to recruit collaborators as a means to achieve victory. However, since these changes appeared to herald a process of social engineering, they generated fears that the religion and way of life of Afghans was about to be overthrown and local resistance stiffened. The Soviets maintained that their objective was the resolution of civil conflict, but they wanted the installation of a government more acceptable to the USSR that could ensure stability. However, the invasion earned international condemnation, provoking intervention.
For the resistance, there was a general unwillingness to compromise. Although there was no national movement, the Soviets were viewed by rural populations as foreign unbelievers set on occupation and destruction of traditional ways. However, some, including urban and educated Afghans, chose to collaborate and negotiated their future under occupation or as local communist participants. Yet, in the conduct of military operations the Afghans remained subordinate, which caused a corresponding slump in morale. In political terms, the Soviets selected their surrogate leaders, but neither these, nor the Soviet forces, could find a solution to the military impasse developing. Stalemate in the ground conditions did not produce a desire to negotiate on either side, and the war continued.
By 1985 the conflict in Afghanistan appeared to be intractable. 
142
In the past seven years Soviet soldiers have had their boots on the ground in every square kilometre of the country. But as soon as they left, the enemy returned and restored everything the way it was before. We have lost this war. The majority of the Afghan people support the counter-revolution. We have lost the peasantry, who have got nothing from the revolution. 80% of the country is in the hands of the counterrevolution. And the position of the peasants there is better than it is on the territory controlled by the government. 
143
Beneath these international actions, the Soviets were, like the British, eager to conclude local deals that divided the resistance. They attempted to employ militias, and there was an acceptance of local truces that seemed to ensure Soviet control of rural areas. 
144
Informal truces and deals could be made by more junior officers. The situation was often fluid and Afghans could change their minds depending on the behaviour of Russian or DRA troops or changes in the local security situation. Fighting alternated with negotiation. Both sides might observe a mutual local ceasefire as part of a continuum of violence and communication. Locals might be willing to barter with Soviet troops if they turned a blind eye to smuggling. Blockhouse garrisons were particularly vulnerable and maintained a trade with Afghans to ensure their survival. Goods exchanged included canned food, sugar, cigarettes, soap, kerosene, matches, used clothing and shoes. Soldiers even handed over magazines but took care to 'cook' their ammunition in boiling water so that the cartridges could not be used against them.
Mutual destruction could also create an equilibrium. Alexander Kartsev commanded a blockhouse detachment but got on well with locals, using his pre-war medical skills to treat their illnesses. When Afghan government officials arrived to negotiate with the local Mujahideen commander, they were taken prisoner and the Mujahideen threatened to kill them. Colonel Wahid,  commanding the local KhAD, asked Kartsev to negotiate the release of the men and their armoured vehicles. Kartsev was told that the Mujahideen would release the vehicles but not the prisoners, who were scheduled to be executed as 'allies of the enemies of Islam' . Kartsev was reassured that, as a gesture, the prisoners would not be tortured. Kartsev argued that if the officials who were acting as envoys in negotiations were killed, the Soviets were bound to take reprisals against the local villagers and their crops. Many would be killed. After a jirga amongst the Mujahideen, the prisoners and their vehicles were released. 
145
146
In all cases, the Soviets were prepared to negotiate only to ensure the success of their mission and to bring about a local pacification of the population. However, the Afghans were just as capable of making truces to suit their own designs. The most significant of these was Ahmad Shah Masoud's truce in the Panjshir Valley in 1982. As already noted, the Afghan-Tajik warlord leader had mounted a successful guerrilla campaign astride the strategic Route 1 from Kunduz, Mazar-e Sahrif and Kabul, and his men enjoyed some successes against the Soviets around the Salang Tunnel area. The Soviets therefore launched an offensive in May 1982 and stepped out their counter-measures between August and September, which kept Masoud on the defensive. To buy time for his exhausted forces to regroup and to break out to the Tajik homelands to the north-east, Masoud concluded a truce with the Soviets which lasted from December 1982 to April 1984.

The Soviet reconciliation policy had several stages in its evolution. Soon after the invasion it had placed local leaders in positions of power at provincial level through the Afghan government in Kabul, but on 9 January 1987 it announced the establishment of a national reconciliation commission based on several more permissive provinces. In March, the commission stated that it had achieved a number of successes in Kabul, the north-east and some central provinces. By June of that year, there were 1,800 sub-commissions and the following month this had risen to 2,498. It was alleged that 90,000 had reconciled themselves to the government and a further 51,000 had laid down their arms while 93,000 were in talks. By the end of the year, the Politburo reported that it had had some success with joint governance at provincial level in Afghanistan. In fact, the statistics were utterly misleading. There were strikes in major urban areas and public condemnation of reconciliation efforts. Hafi Mohammed Aman, the chairman of the reconciliation commission in Kandahar, was assassinated.
In terms of reconciliation, it was the Mujahideen who enjoyed the greatest success. Towards the end of the war they found it was possible to take tactical positions by negotiation with their garrisons rather than launching attacks. The only problem for the more senior front commanders was that, having secured local control, some Mujahideen groups lost interest in the struggle and refused to operate out of their local area.
The most significant element of the negotiations that brought to an end the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan was the Geneva Accords brokered by the United Nations. The Soviet Union had the ability to veto any condemnation of its initial invasion as a permanent member of the Security Council, but this also meant that it could treat the UN as a third party when it came to negotiating a settlement with at least some of its adversaries. The UN, unable to implement Chapter VII against the Soviets, could at least try to initiate a withdrawal through its 'Good Offices' and some shuttle diplomacy. Article 99 of the UN Charter gave the Secretary General the authorization to initiate negotiations unilaterally in order to prevent or resolve 'any matter which may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security' . The Secretary General can also call upon the Secretariat to provide personnel to assist him in his negotiations, and he is able to appoint Special Representatives or Personal Representatives to maintain the momentum of negotiations. These representatives have the ability to act directly for the Secretary General and not on behalf of the Security Council. Nevertheless, initially the Soviet Union was not content to see the UN play any role and preferred to get the Karmal regime in Kabul to negotiate directly with General Zia ul Haq in Pakistan. Brezhnev was suspicious that the UN might only act on behalf of anti-Afghan and anti-Soviet powers. 
150
151
Although the Soviets were effectively in control of Afghanistan's destiny, the Afghan communist delegation frequently defied their Moscow masters, particularly when it was clear that the Soviet forces were being withdrawn. 
152
153
Misunderstandings plagued the negotiations as far as the Americans and Soviets were concerned. President Reagan was eager to punish the USSR in Afghanistan and inflict a Vietnam-style defeat on what he termed an 'Evil Empire' . He was therefore surprised that his own negotiating team had agreed to stop all financial assistance to the Afghan Mujahideen at the point when the Soviets agreed to withdraw, even though Soviet military and financial assistance would continue to support the Karmal regime. Reagan felt that would give the Soviets a decisive advantage and perhaps enable them to crush the Afghan resistance. His repudiation of any deal of this nature in December 1987 came after Gorbachev's announcement that the Soviet forces would withdraw, and there was a risk the talks would collapse entirely. The Americans clarified the US position that it would discontinue its support if the Soviet Union continued to exercise restraint. 
154
The Accords provided for four elements of a peace settlement. The first assured Afghanistan and Pakistan of mutual non-interference and non-intervention, covering territorial integrity, sovereignty and economic stability. Article II (8) spelled out that there should be no 'training, equipping, financing and recruiting of mercenaries from whatever origin for the purpose of hostile activities, sending of such mercenaries into the territory [of each country]and accordingly deny facilities including the financing of training, equipping and transit of such mercenaries' . Article II (12) was even more specific in its requirements to deny bases, support or training to any group which aimed to disrupt the other country. This element of the Accords gave Afghanistan a free hand to tackle its own insurgency and removed the threat of intervention.
The second element of the Accords dealt with international guarantees from the United States and Soviet Union not to interfere or intervene in the internal affairs of Afghanistan, and obliged them to support the bilateral agreement set out in the first element. The third part of the Accords provided for the voluntary repatriation of refugees from Pakistan with assistance offered by the UN. The fourth and final element of the Accords stated that there should be a 'settlement of the situation' in Afghanistan, and stated that the troops of the Soviet Union would begin a phased withdrawal, starting on 15 May 1988 and concluded nine months later.
The Accords were a good example of how limited objectives, persistence in negotiation and realistic expectations could produce a settlement. 
155
The exclusion of the Mujahideen parties may have made the process easier for the states involved, and prevented Pakistan from using them as a lever for advantage in the talks, but in every civil war those that have done the fighting expect to have a significant voice in the outcome. As William Maley points out, the failure to address who would govern in Kabul and the nature of that government, which had caused the unrest in the 1970s, was not addressed. 
157
The further deterioration of the stability of the Afghan state was exemplified by the attempted coup by General Tenai in 1990. His failure led to an erosion of confidence in the regular security forces. The government, unable to rely on the Afghan Army and looking to achieve consensus with rural leaders, formed larger militias to replace the regular troops. These forces were soon so large that they were unaccountable to their local areas, in contrast to traditional lashkars. When the funding stopped abruptly with the collapse of the USSR, the militias abandoned the government. The most powerful commanders became 'warlords' with personal fiefdoms across the country, but there were multitudes of small-scale groups which attempted to control smaller zones. Thus a new and perhaps even more lethal phase of the civil war had begun.
The Geneva Accords can be criticized on the basis of excluding the key warring parties of the resistance, and similar charges have been made against the Bonn Agreement in 2002 which did not include the Taliban leadership. It is a reminder that negotiation with the enemy, however fractured their structures, is a prolonged but necessary element of the process. Moreover, as Walter argues, keeping sight of the long-term security guarantees, as well as addressing the root cause of conflict, is essential. The Geneva Accords served the interests of the USSR and, to a lesser extent, the communist government in Kabul. Pakistan may have had the reassurance of non-intervention, but there were no guarantees of greater stability on its western border. The continuation of the civil war practically compelled Pakistan to take a more proactive approach to resolving the conflict by backing its most favoured factions. Similar calculations were made by Iran and the Central Asian republics after 1992. This page intentionally left blank 7 THE CIVIL WAR, THE TALIBAN AND THE INSURGENCY, 1990-2011   Some 15,000 Soviet soldiers died in the Afghan war, and the number of Afghan civilian casualties has been estimated to be between 600,000 and 2.5 million.

The Afghan government forces made extensive use of air power to pound Mujahideen positions around the city, and they even deployed Scud missiles. Fired ballistically, Scuds gave no warning. General Greshnov believed the Mujahideen 'were psychologically unable to cope when these rockets were employed against them' . He summed up the operations in terms that the Soviets would have understood: 'Losses among the civilian population could be counted in thousands, and the battle itself acquired such a massive and brutal character that it could be compared in military terms perhaps only with the battle for Stalingrad' .

We forced the communists out of our country; we can force all invaders out of holy Afghanistan-Had it not been for the Jihad, the whole world would still be in the communist grip. The Berlin Wall fell because of the wounds which we inflicted on the Soviet Union and the inspiration we gave all oppressed people. We broke the Soviet Union up into fifteen parts. We liberated people from communism. Jihad led to a free world. We saved the world because communism met its grave here in Afghanistan!

The Afghan Civil War (1993-6) led to the collapse of any unified authority, and Pakistan is the nation that Afghans blame most for the war. Abdul Salam Zaeef argued that Pakistan was treacherous towards everyone and sub-sequently betrayed the Taliban.

Pakistan and Iran were the only two external players left trying to influence the chaotic division of the country. However, Hekmatyar, Pakistan's favoured candidate to lead the country, was initially excluded from the Afghan negotiations for a new government. His response was to make rocket attacks on the city. Rabbani, then heading the interim government, decided to offer Hekmatyar a government post, but this failed. Hekmatyar's militia then clashed with the fighters who belonged to the Shura-i-Nazar (Council of the North), a coalition of minority groups. As a result, the capital was the arena of violent faction fighting. In the north of the city were the fighters of Masoud. In the centre was the Jumbesh-e Meli Islami, the faction of General Dostum. To the west were the Hezb-e Wahdat Shia fighters of Mazari and also the rival Ittehad-e Islami, the Saudi-backed Sunnis. Outside the city was Hekmatyar. In 1993, Wahdat attacked Ittehad whilst Hekmatyar launched an offensive against Masoud's men. Masoud and Ittehad then united to fight Wahdat, and Dostum joined them, thus creating the 'United Front' . In the fighting there were massacres of civilians, and it is estimated that as many as 10,000 were killed. Looting was widespread. Sectarianism, which had always been a feature of the conflict, worsened with a particularly notorious massacre of Shias at Afshar in February 1993.
In 1995, there was a brief interlude of peace when Ittehad and Masoud's Shura-i-Nazar gained control of Kabul, but a new force now entered the con-flict. It was ironic that, just as there was a possibility of order being restored, a new faction backed by Pakistan deepened the war. The Taliban, disaffected former resistance fighters from the Soviet War and younger Pashtuns recruited from the refugee camps and religious schools of tribal north-west Pakistan, were armed and supplied by the ISI.

Hekmatyar, now out of favour with Pakistan, finally accepted a government post as Prime Minister, but the withdrawal of his men from the outskirts of Kabul occurred at just the moment when the Taliban were preparing for a major offensive. Masoud mined the approaches to the city and took up a defensive position at Sarobi. 
12
Aware that Hekmatyar was prepared to resist more stubbornly, the Taliban had initially bypassed his stronghold at Ghazni, but Hekmatyar had struck against them in a counter-offensive on 19 January 1995. While the fighting escalated, the governor of the city defected to the Taliban and the city itself fell without a struggle. Hekmatyar tried to launch a new thrust against Ghazni soon after his rival Rabbani sided with the Taliban to help defeat the offensive. Hundreds of Hekmatyar's men were killed in the outskirts, and they were forced to fall back to their headquarters at Charasiab. 
13
However, the Taliban's aura of invincibility was shattered by the fiasco of their offensive against Herat. As they advanced towards the city, they were strafed by General Ismail Khan's private air force, and, following a Herati request for help, a lashkar of 1,000 Tajik experienced fighters from Masoud's command were airlifted in. Although the Taliban dug in around Dilaram, 200 miles south of Herat, they were thrown into confusion when their commander, Mullah Mohammed, was killed. In August they were being driven out by Ismail Khan's forces and harried all the way to the Helmand River.

Pakistan lost control of its Taliban partners. Islamabad had hoped that the Taliban would provide Pakistan with 'strategic depth' , a secure hinterland, a ready supply of Pashtun volunteers, and potentially oil resources from the north of the country (and perhaps from post-Soviet Central Asia too) so as to be able to conclude the Kashmir question with India. 
17
Mullah Omar, who had emerged as the leader of the movement, stage-managed the idea that Afghanistan was the model Islamic state. He claimed that since Allah's power was not divisible, there could be no democracy in Afghanistan. He and his Taliban confederates idealized the past; they claimed that it was they who had driven out the communists and destroyed the Soviet Union. Osama bin Laden, who had been compelled to abandon his base in Sudan, soon found refuge in the new Afghanistan. Memories of his construction of hostelries for foreign fighters and funding of their families during the Soviet occupation were refreshed. He reciprocated the hospitality of the Taliban by praising their efforts, but he was focused on more distant objectives. He saw the Taliban's regime as a platform for the training of legions of Mujahideen who would fight the 'Jews and Crusaders' who controlled the Middle East. Like the leader of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Ayman al-Zawahiri, he was particularly eager to recruit men who would engage in covert operations against the West. He wanted to harness the idealism of the Taliban and take it beyond Afghanistan into a global Jihad against all unbelievers. If the Mujahideen had defeated the Soviet Union, he reasoned, why not the United States too?
Their ideological doctrines, and continuing armed resistance, convinced the Taliban that Afghan society needed security and protection. In 1996, Masoud was still defiant in the north-east and acted as leader of the United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan, known to the West as the Northern Alliance. 
18
19
In 2000 serious fighting flared up again, with the most effective resistance in the north-east. The Taliban used tanks and aircraft against Masoud, who, despite being increasingly short of equipment and supplies, was able to beat them off. Taliban tactics left much to be desired. There were no elements of organization which typify regular armies: there were no combat estimates or appreciations, no fire plan, and no assembly areas. Instead, rockets or light artillery were 'fired in the general direction' of the enemy, accompanied by a 'hail of bullets from automatic weapons' whereupon 'hopefully the rival militia surrenders' . 
20
The Taliban's fear of uprisings and resistance led to fierce repression. Afghans often refer to the Taliban years in power as wahshat (terror). The Amir-e bil Marouf Wa Nahi Anil Munkar, the Department for the Preservation of Virtue and Elimination of Vice, banned the private ownership of televisions and radios and claimed to want Afghanistan to be 'weapons free' (except, of course, their own). 
21
22
The greatest error of the Taliban was allowing Osama bin Laden to establish his training camps in Afghanistan for his global Jihad. The Taliban leadership soon lost control of those they hosted. Abdul Salam Zaeef, a former member of the Taliban, believed that allowing al Qaeda to operate from Afghan soil was likely to have repercussions, but Mullah Omar allegedly felt obliged to honour those who had fought the Soviets with him. 
23
24
The decision to harbour Osama bin Laden was not an easy one, since relations were somewhat strained and al Qaeda was as much an ideology as a movement. It represented the aspiration to create a unified Muslim world, purged of its modern-Western 'impurities' , corruption and immorality. Its objective was not just spiritual but territorial in the sense that it aimed to recreate the Arab empire of the eighth century. The means to this end was the waging of total war. In 1996 bin Laden issued a fatwa, without authority, which argued that since Western civilians voted for their governments they shared the responsibility for the 'crimes' of the West, and therefore killing them, wherever they could be found, was 'justified' . Indeed, the death of Westerners was to be considered the duty of every Muslim. This world view was intolerant of sectarianism in the Islamic world, since there would be no room in their future for the Shia, Sufi and other branches of the faith. It was also an ideology that implied exterminism and grandiose dreams of a single caliphate, despite the historical failure of every similar enterprise from the Umyyads onwards. In fact, al Qaeda simply lacked the capacity to mobilize the fractured Muslim world, and their dreams of empire concealed their sense of humiliation that Islam, which they regarded as the superior way of life, was weak in comparison with the modern, wealthy and militarily powerful West. Some of the Taliban resented bin Laden's fatwas and the Arab hubris, calling their Arab brethren 'camels' , although it is also true that some embraced the global idealism of al Qaeda. A Taliban fighter known as Haqqani believed: 'We gave those camels free run of our country, and they brought us face to face with disaster. We knew the Americans would attack us in revenge' . 
25
The Global War on Terror announced by the administration of President George W. Bush appeared to be a vague expression of strategic objectives, and it was unclear just how America's overwhelming military power would be deployed against terrorist organizations, which tended to be concealed within civilian populations. In fact, the 'war on terror' coincided with wider American concerns about failed or rogue states, the state sponsorship of terrorism and the transfer of Weapons of Mass Destruction. In the pursuit of their goals it seemed likely that the United States would launch air strikes into Afghanistan and perhaps use ground operations to neutralize al Qaeda's training camps, along with its command and control structures. Bush gave an ultimatum to General Pervez Musharaf, the Pakistani head of state who had hitherto asked for 'understanding' towards the Taliban, that Pakistan would have to terminate support for the Taliban or face American financial and perhaps even military action. The Pakistan president complied. Uzbekistan, eager to gain American approval, also opened up its air space to the Americans.
Operation Enduring Freedom consisted of a rapid air campaign in support of 'Northern Alliance' militias. Teams of Special Forces, primarily from the United States and the United Kingdom, were inserted alongside the Northern Alliance while independent units carried out reconnaissance deep in the interior, hunting for al Qaeda. They enlisted a number of local clan militias to assist them. Under a heavy air bombardment, the Taliban were decimated and many chose to switch sides. The Taliban withered under the air bombardment in which some 12,000 bombs were dropped and 6,700 guided munitions were used. AC130 gunships strafed Taliban positions and cruise missiles destroyed the training camps and infrastructure. One Taliban fighter called Akhunzada recalled: 'When the bombing started, I was commanding some 400 fighters on the front lines near Mazar-i Sharif. The bombs cut down our men like a reaper harvesting wheat. Bodies were dismembered. Dazed fighters were bleeding from the ears and nose from the bombs' concussions. We couldn't bury the dead. Our reinforcements died in their trenches' .

After three weeks of resistance, the Taliban had collapsed. Their remnants were soon being pursued southwards and eastwards, some making for the sanctuary of Pakistan's North West Frontier Province where they could rely on fellow militants for support. The rest, aware of the power of American forces, melted back into the rural areas and urban centres and looked to join any new government.
Meanwhile, in the far south, the Taliban tried to move 1,000 fighters in Toyota pick-up trucks to Tarin Kot, the provincial capital and concentration point for resistance in the mountains of Uruzgan. Of the 100 vehicles in the column, 30 were destroyed in a single air strike mission. The destruction of this Taliban formation at Tarin Kot and the fall of the small Taliban garrison of Kunduz on 26 November 2001 concluded a very one-sided campaign. Only on the eastern border of Afghanistan, where the mountainous terrain made pursuit more difficult, was there any sign of further resistance. Al Qaeda fighters and their allies were making use of extensive cave systems at Tora Bora to protect themselves from air attack and tried to hold out for some time, but they were driven into Pakistan where the international border gave them sanctuary.
At the Bonn Conference on 3 December, six neighbouring states, Russia and the United States agreed that Afghanistan should have a multi-ethnic, freely elected government, and a number of Afghan factions were consulted on the shape of a future administration. 
28
There was some disquiet amongst Afghans that government and opposition candidates had not been prosecuted for their alleged war crimes. The loyalty of the warlords to the regime was very much in doubt. 
29
As corruption flourished amongst government officials and their security forces, the Taliban's argument that they aimed to root this out as well as driving out the foreigners gained greater currency and fuelled their resurgence. The badly paid ANP used extortion to maintain their influence, and brigandage became common in rural areas.
After 2001 there was a severe shortage in the manpower requirement for the security of Afghanistan, not least when US forces were reallocated to conduct operations in Iraq in 2003. The Americans encouraged other NATO partners to assist in the security of the country in 2006, as the recovery of the Taliban became more evident. However, the restrictions against operational flexibility by troops of some European countries, caused by their governments' aversion to risk, affected the security envelope that could be achieved. Each nation had a different interpretation of what a military force or a provincial reconstruction team could do, resulting in patches of insecurity and uneven development.
In the south, British forces were not given permission to tackle the opium fields which they believed funded the insurgency, since this, they were told, was the remit of the Afghan government. Moreover, their mission of extending the authority of the government antagonized many local power brokers, including those ostensibly allied to the Kabul government but deeply implicated in narcotics, and created grievances that were exploited by the insurgents.
In January 2003 a force of eighty Taliban fighters was intercepted at Spin Boldak by an American patrol. Unlike guerrillas, this Taliban detachment fought for twelve hours and was practically destroyed when the Americans called in air support. In the same period, American patrol bases in Regional Command East were subjected to rocket attack and aid workers were assassinated. These incidents illustrated the new direction the Taliban were taking. They believed that foreigners would only be driven out by inflicting significant losses on them, the assumption being that Westerners cannot sustain casualties for political-strategic reasons. The attack at Spin Boldak nevertheless showed that the Taliban was tactically inept. Trying to defeat an isolated patrol in such a large grouping invited destruction from American airpower, just as had occurred two years before. The enthusiasm for their ideological struggle seemed to have taken precedence over the need to engage in a more clandestine campaign.
Operating from Miranshah in Waziristan, Jalaluddin Haqqani, the former Taliban Minister for Tribal Affairs, was said to be a member of the Ruhbari ('Quetta') Shura but also close to Osama bin Laden. His methods were characteristically more ruthless and extreme than the 'old' Taliban, especially against Pashtun maliks of the North West Frontier Province and eastern Afghanistan, and they exemplify another change in the Afghan way of war.

During the Soviet War, the Pakistani ISI had armed and equipped men from the largely Pashtun refugee population when they escaped the ravages of war in Afghanistan. Fearful of Pashtun nationalism, not least because the refugees were accommodated amongst Pakistan's Pashtun population, which had conducted an insurgency to obtain an independent Pashtunistan only a few years before, the ISI emphasized religious solidarity between the Pakistan state and the Pashtuns in order to mobilize the population against the Soviets. The ISI had maintained discipline by controlling supplies to selected leaders, and this tended to elevate Pashtun commanders in wealth, status and military power.

Hekmatyar's call for a centralized Islamic state was opposed by other groups that did not wish to lose their autonomy to a centralized polity and a single leader. Even though Afghan Pashtuns looked to the Pakistani Pashtuns for support, they could not overcome rivalries here either.

I watched as wounded, disabled, and defeated Taliban fighters straggled into Wana and the surrounding villages, along with Arabs, Chechens, and Uzbeks. Every morning as I went to school I could see them wandering around town, almost like homeless beggars. Little by little, the tribal people started helping them, giving them food. Some people even took them into their houses; at first these once proud jihadis survived, thanks to the people's charity. 
40
Once proud Taliban mullahs and fighters changed the way they dressed so they wouldn't be recognized. No one wanted to be identified as a Talib. Friends and relatives who had respected me while I was a commander now turned away. I had no money or job. I moved my family to a village in Punjab, far from Afghanistan, to become a day labourer, but I was a failure at it. I couldn't speak the local language, and no one would hire me. So I returned to Peshawar and started selling vegetables from a basket in the market. 
41
At first I didn't hear the Afghans talking about going back to fight. But the Arabs did, and they encouraged the Afghans and the local tribal people not to give up. Nothing much happened for the first year or so, but then the Arabs started organizing some training camps. The first one I heard about was at Shin Warsak village, near Wana. When I had some time off from school, I decided to visit. I was really impressed. There was more than one camp. One was run by Arabs, and another by Chechens and Uzbeks-Nek Mohammad Wazir [killed June 2004] gave the Arabs places to train and access to weapons and other supplies. They moved openly on the main roads and in the towns and villages, showing no concern about security. I decided to leave my studies and join their resistance. 
42
A former fighter, Haqqani, described the moment when the Taliban was reconstituted in early 2003:
The Taliban's defence minister, Mullah Obaidullah, came to see me-the first senior Taliban leader I had seen since our collapse. He was travelling around Pakistan to rally our dispersed forces. Half the Taliban leadership was back in touch with each other, he said, and they were determined to start a resistance movement to expel the Americans. I didn't think it was possible-Obaidullah told me: 'We don't need you as a deputy minister or bureaucrat. We want you to bring as many fighters as you can into the field' . 
43
44
The first thing I learned was to shoot, field-strip, and maintain an AK-47. Then we did ambush and guerrilla-war exercises day and night in the hills. The Arabs taught us how to make an IED [Improvised Explosive Device] by mixing nitrate fertilizer and diesel fuel, and how to pack plastic explosives and to connect them to detonators and remotecontrol devices like mobile phones. We learned how to do this blindfolded so we could safely plant IEDs in the dark.
Discipline was strict. Any trainee who broke the rules could get a severe beating. You had to wake up before dawn every morning for physical exercises and to run in the mountains. Recruits were awakened at all hours of the night so they would learn to be alert in an emergency-After two months of hard training, we graduated. There were 200 of us: about 160 local tribals, a few Punjabis, and about 40 Afghans like me. We were divided up into 10 groups [and sent to different provinces in Afghanistan]. Each had two or three Arabs assigned to it as commanders and instructors.

The Taliban, who were gearing up for an offensive in 2003, were able to present the idea to the Helmandis that the British were coming to occupy their land, to break up their livelihoods with a counter-narcotics programme, back the warlords and to 'get their revenge for the Battle of Maiwand' . The British were asked by the Provincial Governor to establish small posts around the province that would signal that the government of Afghanistan was the only legitimate authority. Because their doctrine directed them to follow the host-nation government's lead, the British were obliged to construct posts at Musa Qala, Now Zad and Sangin, and to protect the dam at Kajaki. These had the advantage of being close to areas of population and therefore held out the opportunity to meet with and perhaps win over the local communities, protect the local bazaar and its economic activity, and control routes. However, it soon became apparent that some of the local police were in league with the Taliban, and no sooner had the bases been established than they came under attack. The sight of the Forward Operating Bases being constructed seemed to prove to the local Helmandis that Akhundzada's warnings were true. The Taliban rushed to encourage resistance and threw their own forces into action.
The British in northern Helmand were surprised by the ferocity of these initial assaults. There were almost 100 days of continuous combat at Now Zad. Small detachments of the brigade were forced to fight for days as the Taliban enveloped their positions. The Taliban and their local allies knew that the small garrisons of 'Platoon Houses' were relatively isolated and might be overrun. Every effort was made to engage with small arms, RPGs fired in volleys, sniper rifles and mortars. The fighters often got to close quarters. However, not one of the small garrisons was defeated or overrun. Backed by airpower, plenty of ammunition and sheer determination, the British detachments held every attack at bay. Some Taliban would adopt a 'shoot and scoot' tactic, trying to ambush a foot patrol or fire on a base and then disappear, just to exhaust the British troops. As the British tried to send out patrols to engage the population, they were ambushed and attacked. As soon as the British patrols fell back, the insurgents would swarm after them. From the cover of the Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) milan and Javelin missiles were used alongside small arms and medium machine-gun fire. Longer-range weapons, and air power, proved invaluable in the destruction of buildings that provided the insurgents with cover or which concealed their assembly areas. The firefights lasted into the night, with individual Taliban fighters trying to work their way closer. Some firefights took place within yards of the patrol base walls. Taliban and local Helmandi casualties were heavy, and it is estimated that 1,800 of them were killed between April and July 2006. 
47
The situation seemed even more acute when there appeared to be a step change in the skills and abilities of the insurgents. The British suspected that a sudden improvement in accuracy of mortar fire, RPGs and sharp shooting was the result of external support. The insurgents were improving in their accuracy, as trained Taliban personnel came up, while new equipment and weapons, including night vision gear and sniper rifles, began to make themselves felt. Some evidence suggests that Pakistan was being used as a conduit for these specialist tools and personnel. However, insurgent losses deterred further direct assaults. In 2007, the attempts to overrun the British posts were abandoned.
In light of the initial battles in Helmand, the British changed their force structures and tactics. FOBs were consolidated and reinforced, and more troops were deployed, although still far short of the numbers required to cover the entire province. There were still too few men to give the brigade commanders a reserve for manoeuvre. This led to innovation. When the Royal Marine Commandos were deployed in 2006-7, they took advantage of the traditional winter lull to take the fight to the enemy, and, treating the open areas of dasht (desert) like the open sea, they established a more aggressive patrol pattern that gave them back their mobility through MOGs (Mobile Operating Groups). New efforts were also made to win the support of local leaders and farmers, but violence in Helmand remained at a higher level than any other province of the country. The insurgents tried to counter the Marines' mobility with more improvised mines or ambushes from the broken terrain around the more densely populated 'Green Zone' .
By 2009 American Marines had joined the British, and they began to secure the north, west and southern 'green zone' (known as the 'Fish Hook'), allow-ing the British to concentrate their forces in the centre around the provincial capital of Lashkargah. There was therefore a chance to carry out a traditional counterinsurgency strategy, namely to shape (influence the population), clear (drive out the insurgents), hold and build (making improvements to local infrastructure). Nevertheless, the insurgents kept up their violent disruption and intimidation.
From 2003 the Taliban made a series of attacks, the most frequent being across the Pakistan border. Younas, a young imam serving as a fighter, described an operation typical of the south and eastern fronts:
One night in April [2003], we crossed the border in five pickups and one larger truck. Once we were safely across, we sent the vehicles back to wait for us on the Pakistan side. Our target was a U.S. base just across the border at Machda in Paktika. We attacked at dawn. I think we really surprised them. We shelled them with 122mm rockets and mortars for about 30 minutes.
However, the chief problem was Western airpower, for which they had no answer: '-we didn't get close enough to fire our Kalashnikovs; before we could move in, American helicopters came, raining rockets and bullets on us. Terrified, I crawled and ran to escape death. Amid the noise and explosions, dust and smoke, I remember seeing six of us cut down and killed: two Arabs, three [Pakistan] tribals, and an Afghan' . 
48
Typically, Taliban teams operate in groups of 8 to 12 men, which could either concentrate into groups of 30 (or 100 in the eastern provinces) for attacks on outposts, or split into groups of 5 or pairs for smaller tasks, including lay-ing IEDs. On election day in 2009, two IEDs intended for Western military convoys detonated prematurely in RC-South, killing the bomb layers. Nevertheless, there were 2,000 IED strikes in 2006, rising to 7,000 in 2009. The IED attacks in 2009 killed 275 ANA and Coalition troops.
The Taliban fighter Haqqani stated that it was Arab expertise which explained the improvements in tactics: [After 2004] Arab and Iraqi mujahideen began visiting us, transferring the latest IED technology and suicide-bomber tactics they had learned in the Iraqi resistance during combat with U.S. forces. The American invasion of Iraq was very positive for us. It distracted the United States from Afghanistan. Until 2004 or so, we were using traditional means of fighting like we used against the Soviets: AK-47s and RPGs. But then our resistance became more lethal, with new weapons and techniques: bigger and better IEDs for roadside bombings, and suicide attacks. 
49
50
Many Afghans expressed a readiness to fight, regardless of allies or the enemy. One SAS officer operating near Spin Boldak noted that 'killing was a way of life' for them and they 'would pick up a gun for the slightest of reasons, and fight under the flimsiest of flags' . 
51
52
The Taliban fighter Mohammed explained how heavy-handedness by security forces changed the situation for the Jihadists:
[In 2004] The Afghan Taliban were weak and disorganized. But slowly the situation began to change. American operations that harassed villagers, bombings that killed civilians, and Karzai's corrupt police and officials were alienating villagers and turning them in our favour. Soon we didn't have to hide so much on our raids. We came openly. When they saw us, villagers started preparing green tea and food for us. The tables were turning. Karzai's police and officials mostly hid in their district compounds like prisoners. 
53
It is difficult to ascertain a single conception of the insurgent strategy, not least because of the sheer variety of armed organizations fighting in Afghanistan. Many seem to have only a vague idea of what constitutes victory. One Taliban fighter expressed the view that: 'One year, a hundred years, a million years, ten million years-it is not important, we will never stop fighting' . 
54
Higher up the chain of command, there is a more coherent conception of planning. There have been significant attempts to mount strategic offensives. In 2006, the offensives through the Helmand Valley and the Arghandab were defeated, and the latter was particularly costly. The Arghandab was a major base being prepared for operations against Kandahar, but a Canadian-led counter-offensive concluded with a major battle at Pashmul and the dispersal of the Taliban. In 2007, the Taliban announced Operation Kamin (Ambush), which focused on increasing the number of tactical, guerrilla attacks but which scaled back the large-scale light infantry attacks which had proved costly in Helmand and the eastern provinces. Heavy casualties amongst the commanders seriously disrupted this offensive.
In March 2008, the Taliban launched Operation Ebrat (Lesson), which aimed to sever provincial security and destroy the development work of the Provincial Reconstruction Teams; consolidate the Taliban's grip on areas near Lashkargah and Gesreshk; and intimidate the population by targeted assassinations of recalcitrant khans and government officials. Mobile phone broadcasting towers were also targeted, because of concerns that mobiles were being used by those loyal to the government to warn of Taliban movements.
In 2009, there was clear intent to make attacks on the capital not only for its symbolic effect but also in an attempt to ring the city and gradually tighten a blockade. Part of the plan involved attacking convoys of supplies destined for the insurgency further south. Indeed, during major Western-led operations in Regional Command-South (and, since the subdivision of the south in 2010, Regional Command-South West), the Taliban felt compelled to make attacks on Kabul in retaliation and to divert resources back to the north. Operation Nasrat (Victory) in Helmand in the spring of 2009 continued its focus on attacking convoys with IEDs, trying to inflict casualties on ISAF personnel and all government officials or their contractors. However, it was also notable that, having withdrawn some senior Taliban leaders due to more accurate ISAF targeting the previous year, the Taliban felt compelled to push new leaders back into the province and across the south. Throughout 2009 and 2010, however, the steady attrition of field commanders was a serious problem for the insurgents.
The Taliban were forced to recalibrate their plans several times between 2003 and 2010. When the British were beginning their deployment to Helmand in 2006, the Taliban were preparing for what they believed was their 'final offensive' . They had been gearing up for three years, and assumed that the Iraq War, which had tied down thousands of Western troops, would keep the Coalition forces in a weakened state in Afghanistan. There had been months of booby traps, IEDs, assassinations and widespread intimidation. Local Afghans who refused to assist the Taliban were threatened, 'disciplined' and eventually shot. The Taliban were determined to ruin Western development projects and burned down schools, threatened Non-Governmental Organizations, or kidnapped family members of wealthier families to exact a ransom. The Taliban had targeted disgruntled communities, and offered to support them in return for loyalty to their cause. The Taliban felt they could call upon thousands of volunteers, including enthusiasts from militant Pakistani madrassahs, to launch an offensive that would overwhelm the poorly trained Afghan security forces, and persuade the West to abandon Kabul.
However, the Taliban's success was not so much in their military operations but their ability to align, integrate and accommodate local clan dynamics. The treatment of civilians, casualties and the continuing conflict were particularly important in recruiting rural Afghans into the insurgency. Nazar Mohammed, a farmer, blamed foreign occupation forces for the violence on his property near Kandahar: 'It's very obvious. Right now we see foreigners with tanks driving through our fields. They destroy people's orchards… they break through walls and just drive across. When they take up positions in the village like this, nobody can co-operate with them' .

To win hearts and minds, the Taliban learned to be more protective of local communities, warning villages of planned attacks on Coalition forces in a process of 'losing tactical surprise, but gaining solidarity' .

After the chaos of Mujahideen fighting, the exhausted Afghan populace, according to David Edwards, welcomed the 'reputation for keeping security [which] preceded them into each new area' .

In contrast, the government of Afghanistan struggled to be accepted by the Afghan population. David Kilcullen, the counterinsurgency specialist, argued that the Kabuli government was simply being 'out-governed' by the Taliban.

To augment the number of counter-insurgents in Afghanistan, and to pave the way for the Afghan government to take control of its own security, the Americans launched an ambitious plan to increase the size of the Afghan National Army (ANA) to 100,000 by 2011 and eventually to 250,000, to build a fully functioning Afghan National Police (ANP) force of 82,000, and to expand the National Afghan Air Corps. The much publicized 'surge' was not only about Western forces, but involved a growth in the ANA from under 79,000 in 2008 to 95,000 in February 2009, and the final scale of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF) was planned to be 400,000. The rapid growth of the ANSF was to be matched by a corresponding improvement in quality and professionalism, measured by 'Capability Milestones' . In July 2009 it was claimed that 47 per cent of ANA units had reached CM1, the 'ability to operate independently' . However, only 24 police units had reached this total in the same period, while 447 remained at CM4, 'formed but not yet capable of conducting operations' , reflecting the slower rate of development of the police in Afghanistan more generally. These improvements in quality were considered essential when police abuses and army heavy-handedness were blamed for antagonizing the population, thereby fuelling the insurgency.
However, building an army in the midst of a war has been a challenging undertaking. ANA recruits were young, three in ten were drug addicts, nine out of ten were illiterate and 25 per cent per year were prone to desertion. 
85
86
Afghan recruits were not untypical in finding it hard to adjust to life in barracks and a timetable that planned their day from dawn until dusk. 'Some were mystified by the socks that came with their uniforms. Like soldiers around the world, they complain particularly about the food' . 
87
Because of the relative inexperience, the insurgents preferred to target ANSF rather than ISAF, but it was also a question of firepower. The ANA had fewer armoured vehicles and found it more difficult to call for air support. It is difficult to call in an air strike if one cannot read, or navigate a map. Crucially, the insurgents' targeting resulted in a rising casualty toll that affected recruiting. Colonel Karimullah, the officer in command of army recruiting in Kabul remarked: 'The boys themselves are not afraid, but it is their parents who make the decisions to let them join, and when they see all this on TV, they don't think it's worth it' . 
88
In 2001, the United Nations was keen to see a comprehensive process of nation-building get underway and it insisted that the occupying powers assist in extending the writ of the Afghan government in Kabul over the whole country. In the south, particularly in Helmand, narcotics had long been the mainstay of the local economy. In the 1990s and 2000s, Afghanistan became the chief exporter of opium, supplying 90 per cent of the world's addiction to heroin. Poppy production rose by 169 per cent between 2005 and 2006, and locals and narco-traffickers were eager to protect their income. In 2010 opium production generated $2.3 billion, and in some places it has been far more lucrative than other types of farming. This drug money was being used by narco-leaders to run protection groups, ensure patronage and buy off their enemies. It was often unclear whether these narco-leaders were also members of the Taliban or simply cooperating with them. When the British Army was tasked with the support of a counter-narcotics programme and the extension of the Afghan government's jurisdiction in Helmand in 2006, the centre of drug production, it put them on a collision course with a number of vested interests.
In fact, although the British did not realize it at the time, drug money was being used by the lower echelons of the government to buy positions and patronage too. Local police forces were also getting pay-outs from the drug barons, indulged in clan rivalries or were so badly paid by the government that they simply robbed local citizens.

In parts of rural Afghanistan, where the wage rates traditionally equate to $1-$2 a day, opium labourers have been paid at least $3 a day, and as much as $6 a day during harvest time.

It was not until June 2003 that Mullah Omar reconstituted his 'shadow government' in the form of the Quetta Shura, but military command and control for the Taliban have been at the lowest possible level in order to exploit local clan relations and ground conditions. The Taliban created a centralized network in which each field commander creates sub-networks in order to generate revenue, attract recruits and accommodate local interests in line with the Taliban's higher objectives. These sub-networks are operationally independent from the Taliban senior command, but are reliant on them for munitions and larger funds. Decision-making in operations has been devolved to the local commanders. Competency is valued over prestige: field leaders often 'exercise considerable power despite being from a region where age and experience are valued' . 
98
99
101
The Taliban commanders also showed that they could regenerate, adapt and respond. In December 2008, ISAF had launched Operation Sond Chara and cleared parts of Nad-e Ali in Helmand after Taliban re-infiltration earlier that year. A large number of weapons and communications equipment had been seized. Similar American operations at Garmsir were producing the same results. To recover the initiative, the Taliban conceived a bold and daring plan to make a four-pronged assault on Lashkargah. The aim was to divert Western troops from their offensives, to get into the urban space to engage in a closequarter battle which would neutralize Western air power, and to score a propaganda victory akin to the Tet Offensive in Vietnam. On 11 October, 200  Taliban fighters were detected advancing on the provincial capital, with an eastern group attempting to set itself up as a blocking force to cut off reinforcements. Apache helicopter gunships and air strikes broke up the attacking columns in a firefight lasting four hours. The Taliban are thought to have suffered more than sixty casualties, but they had failed to pierce the perimeter. On 14 October the Taliban made a second attempt, seeking to wipe out ANP posts on the city's outskirts. Another 18 Taliban were killed in the assault. Yet, they claimed they had created insecurity in the provincial capital and showed that they could attack when they chose to do so.
In April 2009 there was another attempt to assault Lashkargah. The aim was to move Taliban volunteers from Waziristan up their concealed routes and to deploy pre-positioned four ZPU-1 anti-aircraft guns to assault Marjah before pushing on to the provincial capital. There were delays to the operation caused by the poppy harvest, the death of a local clan elder and an ANA assault on Marjah in which sixty Taliban were killed. A much smaller offensive was there-fore planned for 15 May 2009, but this was hit by airstrikes as Taliban fighters concentrated, which resulted in twenty-two killed including six commanders. The only operation that could be mounted in the end was an eight-man assault on a police post and some opportunity attacks, including IEDs.
To add to these setbacks, the Taliban were finding that ambushes against mobile patrols and columns were becoming less effective. ISAF were detecting more IEDs than could be detonated, and columns invariably outgunned the smaller Taliban detachments. Battles with dismounted patrols were more effective in inflicting losses on ISAF but Taliban casualties were also inevitably that much higher, especially when the Coalition brought in air support. Feints, secondary attacks from a second axis and a main assault from a third axis, have sought to confuse and disorientate the ISAF troops. As a result of the setbacks, however, the Taliban have tried to focus on re-infiltration amongst the population, as they managed in March 2009 in Spin Masjid and Amin Kalay in Helmand. They have also used motorbike-borne suicide attacks, individual vehicle bombs and even attempted a swarm-attack using a number of suicide bombers, styled Fedayeen, armed with assault rifles and grenades.
The Taliban have struggled to maintain high tempo resistance with a very insecure supply system, but they have shown a determination to learn from their mistakes. One fighter, Khan, stated:   By the end of 2005 the Taliban's ranks in Ghazni were increasing. There were new recruits like me and more former Taliban returning home from Pakistan. At the same time, we started receiving shipments of RPGs, rockets, mines, and bombs, most of which were old and rusty. My group only had three RPG launchers and only one mortar tube, and a few rounds for each. We had a few rusty Russian mines that only worked about 30 percent of the time. So we could only carry out very quick and limited attacks on convoys, construction crews, and district compounds. At first we didn't have much success. But we were learning. 
102
Our men are watching American bases 24 hours a day. They inform us of American movements. We used to hit the Americans with roadside bombs and then disappear. Now when we explode an IED, we follow that with AK and RPG fire. We now have more destructive IEDs, mostly ammonium-nitrate bombs that we mix with aluminium shards. We get regular deliveries of these fertilizers, explosives, fuses, detonators, and remote controls. 
103
Then American helicopters arrived, firing rockets and machine guns. We fought [from just before dawn] until sunset. We lost 12 Taliban to martyrdom, largely to the helicopter fire that comes down like heavy rain. We cannot compare our military strength to that of the Americans. But we have learned how to stay protected behind rocks and mountains. Even with all their advanced technology, we forced them to withdraw. 
104
However, this does not mean that all Afghans welcome the insurgents, and many are resentful of the constant fighting. It is not unknown for Afghans to applaud when ISAF troops drive the insurgents out of a village. Part of this can be explained by the insurgents' arbitrary punishment of alleged collaborators. Propaganda is accompanied by physical and psychological coercion to ensure compliance. Moreover, they do not observe the law of armed conflict and will actively seek to exploit the more restrictive rules of engagement of the Western forces. For example, during an engagement, if events turn against them, the fighter will conceal his weapon and emerge unarmed, knowing that ISAF troops will not attack him. Firers will arrange to have supporters change their clothes after a shooting incident in order to escape recognition. Reconnaissance missions are conducted and rehearsed without weapons to avoid arrest. Women or children are sometimes used as shields in compounds, and in some cases are encouraged to crowd around a firer so that ISAF will not return fire. In one instance in Nad-e Ali in Helmand, insurgent casualties were transported in minibuses with women to prevent their capture.
The insurgents believe that, following a skirmish with Western forces, the most likely course of action is that ISAF ground troops will withdraw to a nearby base. Insurgents therefore initiate battles at the forward edge of a contested area with sufficient force to discourage ISAF from moving deeper into insurgent-held territory without a significantly larger force. Many of the ISAF and ANSF patrol bases are limited in their ability to free troops for offensive operations, and manpower considerations have often restricted the area that can be brought under government control. By default, this has given the insurgent greater freedom of movement. Moreover, insurgents will often initiate an ambush as the ISAF troops are returning to base, knowing that the patrol will have been out for a long time and therefore is more likely to break off the engagement. The insurgents then use this in their propaganda as evidence that ISAF have been driven off.
Despite the apparent alignment of physical resistance with 'information operations' , the insurgents still lack the ability to coordinate their actions effectively, and there are frequent disagreements about operational priorities or the ways in which local Afghans should be treated. There are patterns to their behaviour, too, that ISAF forces are able to exploit. Soldiers observe that insurgents are often creatures of habit, frequently re-using the same sites as firing points or the same choke points for IEDs. It has been noted that insurgents will rarely operate at night and only move into position after dawn. Given the time taken to get into position, the need to rest during the hottest part of the day, and their desire to break off engagements a few hours after dark, Coalition forces can predict the 'battle rhythm' of the insurgents. ISAF troops have often surprised the insurgent teams by their night operations.
It is reported that insurgents have been particularly fearful of attack helicopters which they call 'wasps' . When helicopters have been airborne, insurgents have attempted to get under cover and not move. The helicopters' ability to hover, loiter and strike with precision results in insurgents remaining stationary, and this effect has been exploited by some units to fix insurgents in place and guide ground teams towards their position. However, insurgents recognized that if they ceased activity while helicopters were in close proximity, they only needed to do so for a limited period as the helicopters tended not to remain in position for long periods.
Many Afghans, including the insurgents, lack education about modern weapons. In Helmand, a malfunction in an unmanned aerial vehicle led to a patrol being tasked to recover it, whereupon a local farmer explained he had tied the aircraft to a tree because he 'didn't want the bird to fly away' . There were also rumours amongst the population that insurgents thought the ISAF was training mice to fly the smallest unmanned aerial vehicles. It is clear that the insurgents have consistently underestimated the comprehensiveness of Western surveillance capabilities.
Insurgents' prestige weapons have been scarce and valuable, and have only been utilized when they assessed it was safe to do so without immediate interdiction. As in the Soviet war, the further from the border areas the insurgents are, the more difficult it has been to supply the heavier weapons and the ammunition required. Rocket attacks, even on fixed positions, have been problematic because of the logistics burden of the ammunition, the difficulty of avoiding detection in transit, and the risk to the firer from remaining in position long enough to ensure accuracy. However, sharpshooting attacks are much less risky for the insurgents in this regard. It is far easier to conceal a single firer and screen the firing point than it is to set up cumbersome and less accurate indirect fire weapons. A sharpshooter also conserves ammunition, needing only a few rounds to inflict a casualty, although multiple attacks have been common. In one incident near Char Coucha in Nad-e Ali in Helmand on 25 October 2010, a patrol was attacked by sharpshooters having been distracted by a more general attack from small-arms fire. Some members of the patrol became casualties, and, as they attempted to extract their colleagues, a command wire IED was detonated. It is possible that insurgents in this area had, probably more through accident than design, shaped the tactics of the local patrols because, until that attack, they had previously used short-ranged grenade attacks from compounds. This had forced ISAF troops to use more open terrain in an attempt to mitigate the threat, but that had allowed the insurgents to use lon-ger-ranged, accurate sharpshooters. The sudden change in the technique of attacks enabled insurgents to cause multiple casualties. It was also ascertained that the fields in the area had been flooded deliberately in order that ISAF would be forced to use the tracks or particular ground.
After the initial offensives of 2006, the insurgents have not been able to mass and coordinate large numbers for a major assault. The majority of insurgents are not prepared to die unnecessarily and they will seek to carry out operations in which they have a good chance of remaining alive to fight another day. They have not sought martyrdom at the expense of an operation's success. Where there were determined assaults against ISAF patrol bases in 2006, by 2009 the emphasis was instead on breaching these defences using ANP turncoats or allies within the perimeter. Moreover, the insurgents have preferred to strike against weaker government forces or their militias rather than take on the full might of the Western Coalition. Nevertheless, they believe the ability to overrun a police post and raise the Taliban flag provides them with a propaganda opportunity as powerful as inflicting casualties on foreigners.
It appears that the insurgents' willingness to fight has been undermined by perceptions that they are outflanked, that the ability to extract casualties or a withdrawal route is blocked, or that they cannot locate where all counter-insurgent forces are and may therefore be surprised. The principles for engagement have been to understand the layout of their enemy forces before an attack; to initiate an attack, with surprise, from multiple positions, each of which is protected by obstacles; to use deception and create confusion in order to overload ISAF or ANSF communications; to maintain security and secrecy of identity, and to change position frequently and at speed to outrun any pursuit or avoid being fixed by the enemy's greater firepower.
Insurgents have retreated when pursued and they have gone into hiding to avoid detection. However, they have been willing to take risks, to assault a position which they assess they can overrun, and they have not been averse to an exchange of fire from close range. Harassing fire from a safe distance has been their first preference, and they have used linear features to guide their aim. This fire has also been used to cover moves elsewhere, or has acted as a deception measure to draw attention away from where logistics were being assembled or IEDs laid. It has been common for them to try to use a screening feature, such as a line of trees or compounds, to obscure firing points and to delay any ground forces that pursue them. There has been a development in shooting, not only towards the use of sharpshooters, but also in close-range engagements from 'murder holes' , namely concealed apertures in thick compound walls, from which they then make a rapid escape. Like many insurgent attacks, they have rarely inflicted many casualties, but they have been very carefully prepared and rehearsed and have looked to guarantee inflicting just one or two losses on their adversaries. Insurgents have even, on occasion, dug trenches with overhead protection to take on Coalition or ANSF patrols.
Digging is much more common in the placement of IEDs. In Nahr-e Saraj in Helmand in July 2010, a local farmer indicated to the neighbouring ISAF forces that a number of IEDs and booby traps had been entrenched close to a patrol base and in an area that helicopters were likely to use. No fewer than four large devices were uncovered, with a command wire running along an irrigation ditch to a firing point about 200 metres away. It is not certain when the preparation took place and it could have occurred during the day or night, but the fact that insurgents had managed to emplace these devices without detection demonstrates their audacity. Moreover, insurgents have created IEDs with increasing skill. This has been due, in part, to external supporters, but also reflects a natural evolution in insurgent tactics through trial and error.
Digging in was also a feature of the insurgents' approaches to constructing defences. At Kajaki Olya in Sangin, an area considered to be their safe haven, there were multiple layers of IED belts, bunkers and firing points. A screen of scouts constantly monitored the approaches. However, the insurgents were powerless to prevent a night-time infiltration by ISAF forces and were taken by surprise. Unable to mount resistance as they had planned, the insurgents fled on motorcycles or on foot. It is clear that in this example the insurgents' system of signalling had failed. In another example in October 2010, it was noted that a Taliban white flag was flying on a pole outside a compound. Several days later, after an operation in which ISAF successfully pushed the insurgents back, the flag had also moved back into 'Taliban territory' . The position of the flag here indicated the loss of a compound, but the use of flags has also been an indicator for the loss of a route into a particular area, to indicate the arrival of foreign insurgents into unfamiliar territory, an attempt to indicate local sympathies or as a warning by the Taliban to locals about their presence which should not be defied. White flags have sometimes been used to mark the limits of insurgent influence and to warn locals of where a front line was located.
The localized nature of the insurgency means that insurgent commanders have the freedom to make decisions about what to do in their own area. Insurgent commanders will, for example, tailor levels of intimidation specific to local conditions and levels of support. An insurgent presence is established by vehi-cle checkpoints, by targeted threats and beatings, or by clandestine messaging. One journalist in Qalat in 2009 known to the author received threats that should he continue to operate in the local area after two warnings, he would be killed. After the second threat, he and his family moved hurriedly to Kabul. Shabnama (night letters) have been pinned to the doors of mosques or left at compounds by insurgents moving through villages after dark, giving warnings about talking with ISAF or issuing orders such as curfews.

A serious assault was made at Wanat at dawn on 13 July 2008 when the Taliban attacked an American outpost in Kunar province close to the Pakistan border in Regional Command East. It was a short, sharp battle that left nine Americans and more than thirty insurgent fighters dead, using tactics that were intended to neutralize American air power and their response times, but it also demonstrated the continued asymmetry of the conflict. The US troops were drawn from 2 nd Platoon, Chosen Company, 2 nd Battalion, 503 rd Infantry Regiment. This force of forty-five men had begun building a patrol base in the Waygul Valley, close to the village of Wanat. Three US Marines had joined the outpost in order to continue the training of a dozen Afghan National Army soldiers. As the work progressed, successive days of bad weather prevented any American air cover, which gave the insurgents the opportunity to approach the base undetected, concentrating from distant hide-outs via side valleys and nearby gullies. As the insurgent fighters reached their final assembly area, they opened an irrigation dam, so the sound of rushing water would cover the noise of their footsteps and whispers. Some Taliban fighters managed to locate the Claymore directional mines on the approaches to the base, and turned them around. Others used previous reconnaissance intelligence to point out the location of American heavy weapons.
Just before the commencement of the battle, the American base was still far from complete. There had not been time to build entrenched observation posts on high ground around the base. The base itself lacked construction materials and, because of the high Afghan summer temperatures and intense work required, the garrison had almost run out of water. However, a more danger-ous situation had developed with the local Afghans. In an attempt to win hearts and minds, the Americans had been talking to village elders for several weeks, trying to persuade them to let a base be built in Wanat. However, it seems that the Taliban knew of the discussions, and used the negotiation time to prepare a major attack before the base was fully operational. The Americans were eager to find and arm local tribesmen who would work with them in order to increase the allied forces available, but this eroded rather than enhanced their security. There simply weren't enough American troops to cover every valley and protect every community in Kunar from Taliban fighters, who could slip across the Afghan-Pakistan border with relative ease. Hitherto, American forces in the province had frequently engaged in firefights and battled for their survival. The shortage of manpower and the nature of the fighting meant that base security had to be provided by the same troops engaged in construction. This meant round-the-clock labouring for tired men, and it also implied that it was impossible to mount enough patrols beyond the new base to dominate the ground and deter attacks.
At 04.20 hrs on 13 July 2008, volleys of rocket-propelled grenades began to land on the half-constructed base. This was the preliminary bombardment to an assault by between 100 and 200 Taliban fighters. The first salvoes concentrated on the Americans' heavy weapons, namely a 120 mm mortar, a TOW missile system, and a 0.50 calibre machine gun. One soldier described the barrage as feeling like 'a thousand RPGs at once' .
With the heavy weapons knocked out, the Taliban rushed forward to fight at close quarters in order to make it impossible for the Americans to call in air strikes. Just like their forefathers, the Taliban threw rocks into the Americans' trenches, hoping they would mistake them for grenades and jump out, whereupon they could be killed. The Taliban closed in from several directions, bringing as much fire to bear as possible. The Americans were simply unable to move because of the weight of fire on their positions.
One soldier described the intensity of the battle: 'I continued to lay suppressive fire with the 240 [machine gun] but it was difficult because I was unable to stand due to wounds in both legs and my left arm' . When this soldier ran out of ammunition he realized he was the only one still alive in his corner of the patrol base. The Taliban were so close he could hear them talking. As the Taliban tried to move right into the base, they were forced to leave their cover, or were silhouetted against the sky. Here they presented a clear target. The Americans were thus able to cut down the Taliban as they tried to swarm over the base perimeter. The 0.50 calibre machine gun had also survived the initial barrage and engaged the Taliban fighters at relatively short range.
The Taliban knew it would take at least thirty minutes before American air support was available, although the battle lasted an hour before the fighters withdrew with their wounded and dead. The exhausted defenders were too preoccupied with identifying who was still alive and tending to the wounded to pursue them. Some 9 Americans were killed and another 27 were wounded, representing 75 per cent of the initial strength of the post, but the Taliban also took heavy losses: it was estimated that between 21 and 52 fighters were killed by the defenders. The final toll could not be verified. The Taliban had failed to complete their objective. Even with the element of surprise, greater numbers and all the intelligence they needed, they had been unable to overrun the Americans.
The insurgents also struggle to maintain the fighting fronts when terrain or weather conditions are unfavourable. A Taliban fighter, Masiuddin, noted: [In June 2008] we began carefully planning an attack. One of our men said that the mission would be hard even if the Americans only threw stones at us, as we'd be attacking up a steep mountain. Everyone laughed at him, but we knew there was some truth in what he said. I asked for volunteers, and everyone signed up. As usual we prepared a medical team, including donkeys and stretchers to evacuate our wounded. But as I divided up weapons, ammunition, explosives, and communications gear, it started to rain heavily. The Americans have heavy boots and other mountain equipment that allows them to move up and down the steep rocks. But our men mostly wear leather sandals that don't give us any grip. So we postponed the attack for two weeks. 
106
Then you British came, 150 years ago. You had 60,000 troops and the best artillery, but it was Pashtuns who surrounded Kabul and killed 17,000 of you as you tried to escape. The rulers of your empire thought this was an accident: they couldn't accept such a defeat, so they attacked again, in 1880. We killed 12,000 of you that time, at Maiwand. The same with the Soviets in 1979: most of their original army was destroyed. What makes you think it will be any different for America this time?
Apart from the obvious errors in statistics here, the final analogy is perhaps the most revealing. America is not an 'imperial' power but part of an internationally-backed, UN-sanctioned Coalition acting on behalf of the sovereign Afghan government. As General Sir David Richards, a British officer who commanded ISAF in Afghanistan recently, put it: 'It is true that, in Afghan military history, the Afghans have always won, but, this time, we are fighting on the same side as the Afghans' . 
107
The process of negotiation with an enemy tends to follow a pattern. First, there is the decision to negotiate; second, there are calculations about the ground conditions prevailing; third, the terms are offered and the process of negotiation gets underway; fourth, terms are implemented; and finally, there is the realization of perceived or desired outcomes. The latter will often determine the ability of the belligerents to trust the other party, and to make decisions about the advantages and disadvantages, risks and opportunities that might arise from ending a military campaign. However, the process is often asymmetrical, and the location of power (including the possession of military force) is far more important than any apparently cultural considerations, although Afghan identities and values permeate the decision-making process.
In the First Afghan War, ground conditions (namely a significant shift in power in Kabul after a successful revolt and a military victory at Beymaru Ridge) opened the way for negotiations, but attempts to subvert the process and the failure to guarantee the Afghans' preferred outcome led to a resumption of fighting. The fractured nature of the Afghan groups made a unified and coordinated response very difficult, especially when trust in the negotiating process was broken and the opportunity to inflict a crushing defeat and loot the British garrison was presented. In the case of the Soviet War, a third party was far more important to Soviet interests than to Afghan ones. Indeed, only the Communist puppet regime was engaged in the process of negotiation, and it seems that the Karmal delegation at Geneva was acutely aware that Afghan interests were unlikely to be well served by the Accords. The Mujahideen were not engaged in the process and thus continued the war against the regime of Najibullah until 1992. Failure to create a united resistance during the period of the Accords was a major factor in the subsequent division of factions, civil war and warlordism that followed.
During the various conflicts in Afghanistan, local truces, bargaining and negotiations between bouts of violence were the norm. The fractured nature of Afghan society meant that such arrangements were pragmatic and necessary. The nature of the insurgency in Afghanistan after 2001 bears similar hallmarks, but it is interesting to note that the Afghan government and the Western military forces have so far preferred to negotiate only on terms of reconciliation with the Karzai regime in Kabul.

Western perspectives tend to focus on reconciling Afghans to the government in Kabul, but it is not clear whether the emphasis should have been on traditionalists, in order to reconstruct the political and social system that existed before 1973; on the new generation, who envisage more radical change and progressive politics; or on the aggrieved, specifically those who have lost land, status or political power. There has been a division of opinion on how to approach the insurgents, but broadly the categories are: the local fighters, who might have been persuaded to lay down their arms; the 'Tier 2 Taliban' , who may have needed a mixture of coercion and incentive to end their conflict; and the 'irreconcilables' , who, for ideological reasons, were not expected to negotiate at all.
There have been significant obstacles to reconciliation efforts. Few Western official sources acknowledge that reconciling to the regime in Kabul has been itself the key problem, although there are many references to the corruption of the administration, the fact that it has been staffed with former warlord leaders with murderous pasts to a senior level, and that narco-dollars and patronage have distorted the machinery and policies of the government. Ethnic rivalries have prevented reconciliation too. Some Tajik-Afghans have been concerned that peace with the Pashtuns would mean reunification and the empowerment of their old enemies. Mindful of the brief period of Tajik-Afghan ascendancy in 1929 and the bitter repression of the Taliban in the 1990s, it has perhaps been in Tajik-Afghan interests to keep the Pashtuns divided. Cutting across the ethnic boundaries, many in the government's ser-vice have been keen to sustain the conflict. Poorly paid Afghan National Police officers have been criticized, for example, for augmenting their income with protection money, arrests for cash returns, bribes and even kidnapping for ransom. Former Taliban in the government administration have been keen to keep those who would take revenge at arm's length, while some in the Wolesi Jirga sympathized with the Taliban. Those Taliban in the field who wish to end the fighting feared they would be betrayed and assassinated by fifth columnists. Some Taliban fighters expressed fear of their comrades, of the 'Quetta Shura' headquarters and even of the ISI, if they tried to turn themselves in.
Afghans are aware, like any other community, that information is power. Negotiations and offers are unlikely to stay secret for long if any individual or group feels that it would profit or lose out in any negotiations. The egalitarian ideals of the Pashtuns have made this especially problematic, as no individual feels he can truly be represented by someone else. Moreover, even the idea of reconciliation, however secret, can be perceived as treachery by another party. Abdul Haq, a former Mujahideen leader, was eager to reconcile members of the Taliban, but his secret plan was revealed by the freelance journalists known as the Ritchie brothers in late 2001. As a result, Abdul Haq was kidnapped, tortured and murdered and his body was strung up in Kabul.
In 2007, Michael Semple and Mervyn Patterson were ordered out of Afghanistan by the Karzai government on the charge that they had been secretly doing deals with the 'irreconcilable' Taliban in a way that was detrimental to the interests of the administration in Kabul. These men, acting on behalf of the British, had some experience of 'back channels' negotiations in Northern Ireland, with the Ulster Volunteer Force, and in Anbar province in Iraq. Semple had also worked with NGOs in Afghanistan and spoke Pashto. He believed that the insurgency was very localized in Helmand, and, observing that the 'Taliban' tended to follow local leaders, he set out to open a dialogue with them. Governor Wafa aroused the suspicions of the government, fuelled perhaps by rival former Taliban in the Kabul administration, and Semple and Patterson were ordered out in December that year. Assadullah Khalid, governor of Kandahar province, alleged that the British were offering money; 'it was a business deal' , he said, although the fact that Britain and not the Afghan government appeared to be in the lead was the main cause of concern. 
110
The Americans had driven the agenda on negotiations with the Taliban on their own terms in 2001. As Karzai led a force south towards Kandahar, when the Taliban forces collapsed and fled under the American bombardment, he had allowed the Taliban fighters to return home to avoid defeat and destruction. Taliban leaders, including Mullah Obeidullah and Mullah Naqib of the Alikozai, accepted the arrangement and they joined forces with Hajj Basher Noorzai to keep order in the city. The Americans nevertheless overturned this decision, and Obeidullah fled to Pakistan where he joined the insurgency.
There were further errors in the case surrounding Wakil Ahmad Mutawakil, the former Taliban Foreign Minister who was traced to Kandahar in 2002. The Afghan government had planned to reconcile him to the regime, not least because his brother had been killed by the Taliban, but American troops arrested him and took him to Bagram where he was held for three years. When he was released he joined the Afghan Wolesi Jirga, but an opportunity had been lost for him to speak out against the neo-Taliban and to promote the merits of reconciliation. The Americans were eager to track down any associates of Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden, but the tactical success was allowed to obscure the greater strategic advantage that could have been gained.
In negotiations, tangible benefits in the long term are required and assurances reinforced during the process of dialogue. In 2005, Abdul Wahid Rais al-Baghrani, an influential figure amongst the Khalozais of the Alizai, was deterred from cooperation with the Afghan government by the lack of any evident benefits or security guarantees. In 2004, he had urged the Khalozai to participate in parliamentary elections, and, having fought alongside Rabbani and the Tajiks in the Soviet War, he was eager to see the country reunited. After consulting his people, he called for reconciliation with the government in a public meeting in Kabul in 2005; but when he returned to the south, he had nothing to show for his efforts. Suspicions grew, and the expectation that development aid might flow into his area as a result of his announcement remained unfulfilled. In 2006, his people were engulfed by fighting in the south between insurgents and the Coalition. The fate of al-Baghrani and his people suggests that the allocation of development aid needed strategic direction. Much development money appears to have had little effect on loyalties, and there is criti-cism that Western development funds often ended up in the hands of the insurgents or just one or two influential pro-government clans. Concentration of funds into areas actually controlled by the government would appear to be a far better way of incentivising cooperation and peaceful reconciliation.
The existence of List 1267 has also been seen as a significant obstacle to successful negotiations. The list, named after UN Resolution 1267, details Taliban and al Qaeda leaders subject to travel bans, frozen assets and embargos against the carrying of weapons. About 250 names were thought to be included, but the list soon became subject to myth. 
111
The Afghan government wants to remain in charge of all negotiations with the insurgents, but its own efforts are not trusted by other parties. The United Kingdom has assisted the reconciliation effort by funding the Program Tahkife Solh (PTS), which was headed initially by Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, but neither the British nor Mojaddidi were trusted by the Taliban. Mojaddidi was widely respected as a peacemaker, but he was also seen by many Pashtuns as the man who had effectively handed over power in 2001 to the Tajik factions without a fight. The British believed that the PTS should have an Afghan Special Co-ordinator with a committee of Afghans drawn from a wide variety of communities and UN officials. They also wanted a programme that took account of returnees. The process of reconciliation involves initial contacts, checks on their links to extremists, the issue of a certificate and then the allocation of a job, land or a place to live. However, the continuing harassment by Western Special Forces or ANP, the lack of security for reconciled personnel, and the feeling that the British were behind attempts to alter the country or provide the coercive backing to a corrupt and greedy government in Kabul destroyed any faith in the system. In Musa Qala in 2006, the British had favoured the reinstatement of Mullah Salam, an ex-Taliban leader who could be persuaded to work with Task Force Helmand. Salam claimed he received no support from the British, a fact underscored by the death of his son, and he argued that he felt safer under the Taliban. The British tried to establish a deal to hand over the town to the local elders and withdraw an otherwise irksome presence, but the plan foundered when the Taliban reoccupied Musa Qala, and a subsequent operation had to be mounted to retake the settlement a second time in 2007. The lack of any development activity during the period of British occupation was remarked upon by those who joined the insurgency. Mahmud Khan, an insurgent leader, commented: 'we gained our freedom from Britain 160 years ago, and should remain free. We don't accept their claim that they are here to rebuild our country. They have done nothing for us' . 
112
The year 2006 marked a turning point for negotiations in Afghanistan. There was a general shift in Afghan public opinion away from the Karzai regime, an intensification of the insurgency and increased numbers of civilian casualties. ISAF attempted to extend the writ of the Afghan government just as the Taliban prepared a major offensive to overrun the south. Neither side had significant channels open for dialogue at this stage, and, since the insurgency developed as a result of the weaknesses of the Afghan government, the Taliban, who wanted to overthrow the Karzai regime, had no incentive to talk. 
113
The UN is unlikely to be able to act as a third party in any future insurgentgovernment negotiations, because the Islamist factions regard the UN as a tool of the Western powers. The UN offered its 'good offices' under Resolution 1868 (23 March 2009), but the results of its meetings in 2006 with the Taliban were not encouraging. 114 Foreigners were simply not trusted and the Afghan government was regarded as too weak to offer binding agreements, which were subject to foreign approval anyway. But UNAMA remains optimistic that reconciliation is a social norm in Afghanistan; that the long duration of the conflict lends itself to negotiation for peace; and that there are lessons from past failures that can now be applied. However, the UN is aware that its own offices and the ISAF forces are effectively operating under the same remit, namely Res-olution 1868, which compromises its independence in negotiations. The failure of ISAF to be entirely selective in its targeting and the Taliban's ruthless punishment of those it suspects of treachery and apostasy have increased levels of bitterness on all sides. Afghan civilians are increasingly of the view that foreign occupation is prolonging the fighting. 
115
116
The Organisation of the Islamic Conference or one of the prominent Gulf States might offer a viable alternative. Equally, the uncompromising values of many of the insurgents mean that their demands are unlikely to be acceptable to the Karzai administration or the Western powers, but a diplomatic offensive by leading Islamic scholars and authorities could be effective if presented alongside a package of practical measures. That said, in 2010, after many delays, Karzai initiated the 'peace jirga' concept, and talks have continued for some time with various groups and leaders. Some of these have agreed to end their campaign, but other previously neutral elements have taken up arms against Kabul. The only terms likely to be acceptable to the insurgent groups, particularly the Taliban and Hezb-i Gulbuddin, are some sort of power-sharing and new legislation that strengthens the role of the ulema, the Sharia and social controls (particularly with regard to women). The fate of former anti-Taliban 'warlords' , rival qawms and families who have fought each other will not be easily resolved but are likely to be key concerns for the negotiators. Ethnic differences between the Tajiks, Hazara and Pashtuns will underlie most of the process too.
Intervention to enforce a peace in Afghanistan will be extremely difficult, and it is unlikely that any states will be willing to assume the mantle of the Western military that has borne the burden of security for ten years. As a result, it is difficult to see how trust-building measures and enforcement of the negotiation process can be achieved. Accusations of betrayal and reprisals of the type seen in the First Afghan War seem likely. Any process that fails to engage the actual belligerents, like the Geneva Accords, would appear to be doomed. Successful negotiations would therefore need to emerge from the Afghan factions with the lead taken by the Karzai administration or its successors. Emphasis on reconciliation as equals, based on the precepts of the Qur'an and the Hadith and supervised by relevant external authorities, might assist the process. Significant benefits available at the end of conflict might also hold out a sufficient incentive to each of the belligerents. As historical examples show, shifts in ground conditions can alter the prospects for negotiation dramatically, and even then the process is likely to be very protracted, interrupted by episodes of renewed violence and lacking in any guarantees. Indeed, the tensions of violence and negotiation have always been a feature of Afghanistan's history. Where once the traditional values of rural society provided a check or balance, increasingly this role will be demanded from the state. But until the Afghan state is accepted by the people, the civil war will almost certainly endure.
The recent neo-Taliban resistance since 2003 has followed the pattern of many historic insurgencies, although it is overlaid with new challenges for the Western and Afghan government security forces who oppose it. There have also been many distinctive features of this conflict which differentiate it from previous foreign interventions in Afghanistan, and it is interesting to note the frequency with which commentators have tried to draw lessons from previous wars, or even suggest that the conflict which began in 2001 is a repeat of historic struggles. Much is made of the iconic episodes of history, especially the British retreat from Kabul in 1842, the battle of Maiwand in 1880, the murder of Envoys, or the immutable Afghan Mujahideen guerrillas operating from the inviolate hills and mountains. In the attempt to make these direct comparisons, history is selected and reduced to stereotype: Afghanistan is rendered simply as 'the graveyard of empires' and therefore, by definition, a hopeless, irredeemable place of perpetual conflict. The implication of this attribution is that Afghanistan is not worth the West's effort and is doomed to failure.
Alongside the key events and traits, the Afghans themselves are reduced to manageable categories and attributed with timeless characteristics. Afghans are still deemed to be 'cold-blooded, treacherous' , 'cruel and avaricious' , 'ferocious and fanatical' . The protracted character of the conflict of 2001 has perhaps enhanced the temptation for policy-makers and commentators to see Afghans at war as unchanging, although this is not an assumption of the soldiers, marines and police forces who fight the insurgents. They are all too aware of the insurgents' ability to adapt and change. A search for greater understanding of the Afghan population and the techniques of the Taliban fighters is required by counter-insurgent forces in order to drive a wedge between the Taliban and the civilian population and apply practical solutions. This is especially problematic when so many 'Taliban' are local nationals fighting to protect their livelihoods, property and territory, or when rural Afghans look to gunmen to ward off predatory policemen and favour the quick and rough justice offered by the Taliban's itinerant qazis (judges) over the state's dysfunctional criminal justice system. There are multiple problems associated with revisiting Afghanistan's history. The chief difficulty is applying historical lessons to entirely new situations in the present. The campaign in Afghanistan has been plagued by a mismatch between the policy requirements in the West and its doctrines of counterinsurgency on one side, and the actual character of the fighting and other demands of the situation on the other. The urgent search for solutions has produced a tendency to reach for simple templates in many Western fora, whereas those 'on the ground' know all too well that in Afghanistan things take time and the 'friction' of war means that things never quite fit the comprehensive plan.
Many scholars have tried to identify national ways of war or military cultures. However, others have criticized the tendency to perceive caricatured, and rather unchanging war-fighting characteristics. The British and Indian Army's military manual on Afghanistan of the 1930s advised British officers to conduct vigorous offensives because Afghans are 'easily discouraged' , and noted that the tribesmen were patient, always watching for an opportunity to strike. Small successes were said to animate them 'extraordinarily' . In mountain warfare, British soldiers were advised to watch for sudden 'swarm' attacks especially against isolated posts, to secure heights and routes and maintain tight security. Inactivity was discouraged and troops were told to 'do as the Afghans do' by setting ambushes, conducting night operations and carrying out deception. Afghans were able to hold a position with determination unless flanked, and they were likely to pursue any withdrawing force as a matter of honour. The 1933 Manual also advised British officers to punish Afghans collectively with 'stern and drastic measures' and to avoid trials or tribunals which, it was claimed, Afghans did not respect. Equally, British troops were told to avoid surrendering to an Afghan when in a tight corner because of the likely 'barbarous' mistreatment of prisoners. Soldiers were informed that it was better to fight it out to the death to preserve their honour.
Many would be tempted to look for direct similarities with the Taliban insurgents today, and it is understandable that there should be a search for patterns of behaviour. Rather than there being unchanging characteristics, it would be more accurate to say that Afghans adapt to the forces and tactics used against them, through time and contingent upon the situation. Moreover, the problem with these historical assessments is that they convey values that have since been discredited in the West, and troops today would not be permitted to breach the Geneva Convention and international law in this way. Equally, new weapons and techniques, including sniper rifles and IEDs, and new forms of justification, including militant, violent ideological interpretations of Islam, now prevail and have altered the environment. The asymmetrical stance of Afghan insurgents after 2003 is a direct result of being too weak to confront Western and Afghan security forces in any other manner. An emphasis on information operations by the Taliban leadership reflects the need to subvert the more effective physical security the West can install and the West's vulnerability to 'public opinion' and open communications. In other words, we should be extremely circumspect of the historical record as a means to glean lessons for current operations. That said, aside from the enduring influences of climate and topography two areas of warfare in Afghanistan are perhaps still worthy of consideration: the use of Islam in war and the character of guerrilla warfare.
Islam is used selectively by Afghans to justify and legitimize a variety of actions in war. Islam can motivate but does not determine how or why Afghans fight. The anxiety for many Afghans is that prolonged contact with non-Islamic ways can threaten the Afghan-Muslim way of life, and therefore foreign, Western influences have to be held at arm's length or opposed. But the reality is also that Islam often provides the only unifying element between Afghans of such diverse and embittered backgrounds. It is not surprising that Taliban leaders, eager to overcome clan and qawm divisions that threaten unit cohesion, not only stress Islamic justifications for waging war but often claim to be mullahs in order to advance their own legitimacy and credentials with their fighters.
Islam can provide a unifying bond for some fighters, but equally it is the line of division for many Hazaras and Pashtuns, and, in the civil war that has effectively lasted from 1978, fractures in Afghan society on political, ideological, ethnic and generational lines are often far more important than any unity that Islam might have fostered. The conflict that has plagued Afghanistan since 2001 is a continuation of an Afghan civil war that has rent the country asunder. From a grand strategic perspective, the Afghans were surrounded by hostile states and often failed to secure allies, even amongst their Muslim neighbours, the exception being the period after 1980. Nevertheless, Afghanistan has found that those it considered allies, including Muslim ones, can all too quickly become forces of malign influence or of occupation. Inherent weaknesses in Afghanistan's conventional forces, for all the Islamic rhetoric, meant the Afghans were invariably defeated, leading towards localized, low-intensity, guerrilla operations.
Islam is much more recognizable as a motivating feature of war, but hard cash has been just as influential. A reassessment of Afghanistan's military history illustrates the strategic role of money in determining the actions of Afghan factions, a feature often overlooked or downplayed in standard histories.
The terrain remains a more predictable constraint in Afghanistan, altering tactics, force structures and equipment, as well as channelling and limiting all operations. Britain's experience of fighting irregular opponents in its colonial wars in the late nineteenth century prompted Charles Callwell, the author of the famous Small Wars, to admit that guerrilla wars in difficult terrain, like those conducted against the Afghans and frontier Pashtuns, were 'the most unfavourable-for regular troops' . 
1
The fighting against Afghan irregulars and on the North West Frontier of India went through several phases of development and variations in British policy, but there were consistent characteristics involving advances into the hills to carry out a punitive destruction of elusive tribal lashkars or their vil-lages and crops, known as 'butcher and bolt' , subsequently followed by more extensive deliberate operations that required a short-term occupation of a large area and the imposition of fines or restrictions.

Too often Western officers overlook the problems that confront the Afghan resistance. Their command and control is often chaotic, and disunity remains a constant threat. Disloyalty, changing sides and clan rivalries can only be overcome with strict discipline and shared hardships on campaign. The leaders are vulnerable to assassination and their logistics are often limited, which places further constraints on the timing and location of their operations.
In periods of civil war, internal divisions, specifically the ethnic, qawm, sectarian and clan fissures of Afghan society, were deepened and became more embittered. The British and the Soviets struggled to exploit these divisions (hoping instead for a unified, stable state modelled on either colonial or Soviet lines), but through them Afghan leaders like Dost Mohammed, Abdur Rahman and Najibullah were able to remain in power.
In the Soviet case, external support to the various Afghan factions was also critical. The injection of money, munitions and arms, and the availability of training and external advisors, prevented the Soviets from buying off resistance groups or being able to suppress them effectively. The Mujahideen groups learned to disperse and concentrate rapidly, to conduct complex ambushes from multiple firing points, and to lure motor rifle formations into a battle in depth (which ended in prepared positions). However, they frequently suffered crippling casualties, exaggerated their successes, and failed to defeat Soviet forces tactically. Crucially, they remained divided despite the existence of 'foreign' occupation.
During the civil war of the 1990s, guerrilla forces were no more successful than before. The militia armies of the warlords and the Taliban in the 1990s had to hold ground and provide internal security in their own territories. This necessitated the development of mobile, light infantry force structures, and it was these that provided obvious targets for the Western air forces in 2001.
The regrouping of the Taliban and the emergence of new insurgent groups since 2003 have been motivated by the idea of resistance to foreign occupation and the rhetoric of a more hard-line version of Islam. Yet insurgents are still opportunists and look for the chance to extend their power and prestige, their esteem amongst their peers, to acquire experience and therefore greater respect, and to justify their presence as protectors of the people, articulated through women, land, livelihood and law. They also wish to protect their narco-profits in the south-west against their rivals within the state apparatus of government of Afghanistan. Many Taliban aspire to be an Afghan Hezbollah, with jurisdiction over schools, clinics and security. The majority of Afghans, however, are 'hedging' , waiting to see which side is the most likely to win. It is worth noting, therefore, that the insurgents of the 2010s are still plagued by the problems they have always faced: the shortage of skilled advisors and facilitators, disloyalty and disunity, logistical weaknesses and heavy casualties amongst commanders and comrades.
Money and power continue to affect the course of the conflict in Afghanistan. The insurgents play a critical role in Afghan economic relations as a guarantor of secure trading routes, essential in an economy that imports far more than it exports. Guerrillas are able to align incentives effectively and efficiently for many rural Afghans. The Taliban embodies a modern transformation and reconciliation of traditional and modern forms of legitimacy, creating an identity that is a potent nexus between pan-Pashtun identity, the traditional role of neutral Islamic mediators, and the legacy of an Afghan national sovereignty, but it does so on the basis of guarantees about the moral and material future of Afghans. The Taliban also has an effective strategy of building local capacity through social networks, creating what could best be characterized as a robust network-state grounded in local relationships and a sense of security. However, this sense of material security is contested by the Afghan government and the West. The offer of development aid, alternative livelihoods and work creation schemes that absorb unemployment; the creation of physical security at village level, the control of routes, access and economic conditions; and the evolution of improved communications through mobile phone technology, all point to the possible withering of the appeal of the insurgents. Material gain, moral security and evident military power will, ultimately, determine the loyalty of the majority of Afghans.
Assumed characteristics are misleading generalizations. Afghans are not culturally determined in their actions, but are reactive and adaptive. Their operations are shaped and influenced by a cultural 'lens' , but they are also pragmatic. Pashtunwali, for example, is an ideal type of behaviour for Pashtuns that can be adapted and sometimes abandoned altogether. They will assess new situations and act accordingly. Non-Pashtun Afghans share this sense of pragmatism, adaptability and opportunism. We should be sceptical of over-arching theories about behaviour and character, and guard against the temptation to look for patterns while ignoring diversity. Above all, we should be conscious that Afghans adapt and change, even if their interpretations and their cultural lens appear to be immutable. This book has attempted to reassesse the Afghan wars, including those fought by Britain, Afghanistan's civil wars, the Soviet war and the recent insurgency, to examine Afghan strategy and operational planning, motivation, force structures, leadership, command and control, tactics, and attitudes towards negotiations. What emerges is a catalogue of consistent problems and constant change. Ultimately, war is still about friction, perception and human will, and, like humans, war remains a specimen beyond absolute scientific classification. Thus, it is well to be reminded of the Pashtun Warrior's Farewell:

1. The question of who the Pashtuns are is not easily resolved. The British used the term Pathan, a corruption of the Indian pronunciation of Pay'than, to describe the frontier tribes from the Khyber to South Waziristan, but there was also an acknowledgement that these peoples were linked to the Pashtu-speaking groups in southern Afghanistan. Some of the problems of definition are dealt with later in this chapter, including origin myths. 2.
