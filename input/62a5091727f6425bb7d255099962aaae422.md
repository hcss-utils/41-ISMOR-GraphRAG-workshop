High vulnerability becomes apparent in the Venezuela case.
Russia would be very hard pressed to deploy long-range fighter aircraft to support this deployment at each leg of the journey.
It would be equally hard pressed to deploy combat ships to escort its transport vessels from Russia to Venezuela.
Even a limited escort capability would be highly vulnerable to the worldwide strike assets available to the United States, should it choose to intervene.
These threats include B-2 stealth bombers that can attack globally from the continental United 35 Note that the IADS rings in the figure are purposely imprecise and included for illustration only.
States; combat ships, including aircraft carriers supporting strike aircraft and refuelers; and long-range attack submarines.
In the notional Venezuela scenario, Russia deployed 24 SAM systems, three anti-aircraft artillery systems, and two missile ships.
This firepower is inadequate to defend against a dedicated U.S. military strike.
The figure includes examples of U.S. expeditionary ground combat forces-the 82nd Airborne Division, the Marine Corps, and the 75th Ranger Regiment-to highlight the vulnerability of the deployed Russian force at the objective area.
