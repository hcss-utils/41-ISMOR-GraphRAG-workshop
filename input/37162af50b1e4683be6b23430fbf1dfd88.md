With the collapse of oil and gas prices in 2014 and the economic sanctions imposed for its behavior in Ukraine, it remains to be seen whether Russia can sustain its military spending in the years ahead.
Nevertheless, Russia's military performance in Syria and Ukraine suggest that its forces are much more capable than they were during the Georgia war.
Russian forces have demonstrated a notable ability to conduct joint expeditionary operations integrating fixed-and rotarywing operations and missile strikes with ground forces, although the range and complexity of the operations they have undertaken do not yet compare with those that U.S. forces can conduct.
