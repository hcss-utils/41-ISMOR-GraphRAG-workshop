This report presents the findings of our study. It should be of interest to Air Force personnel in operations, plans, intelligence, and acquisition organizations. It should also be of interest to aviators in the sister services. Finally, it is our hope that the report will help soldiers, marines, and sailors better appreciate the contribution that aerospace forces can make to joint urban operations. The report is intended as both a reference source and an informative piece of writing. For this reason, clarifying information may be repeated in different chapters.
Motivated by a recent spate of urban operations in Panama, Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, the Department of Defense is now putting considerable effort into identifying and correcting shortcomings in the ■ United States' ability to successfully conduct urban military operations. The Joint Urban Working Group (UWG), sponsored by J-8, is writing new joint urban doctrine as well as identifying problems and potential solutions relating to individual equipment, communications, navigation, surveillance, and weapons employment. The U.S. Air Force (USAF) has taken a keen interest in the UWG and took the lead in preparing the Handbook for Joint Urban Operations, a document intended to provide Joint Force Commanders and their staffs a primer on urban operations, bridging the gap until joint doctrine for urban operations is published.
At the request of General Ralph Eberhart, then-USAF Vice Chief of Staff, and with the sponsorship of Major General Norton Schwartz, Director of Strategic Planning, Headquarters USAF, Project AIR FORCE undertook a year-long investigation of the role that aerospace forces can play in joint urban military operations. This study sought to help the USAF better understand how the urban physical, social, and political environment constrains aerospace operations, to identify key operational tasks that aerospace forces can help accomplish, and to develop new concepts of operation to enhance the contribution that aerospace forces make to joint urban operations. • Global urbanization, particularly in the developing world, makes it highly likely that many-if not most-future military operations will have an urban component (although not necessarily one involving fighting).
• However, an increase in urban operations does not mean that conflict has become primarily an urban phenomenon or that non-urban military operations have been eclipsed. Rather, builtup areas are yet another environment in which military forces must be prepared to operate.
• Urban areas, with their physical and social complexity, are extremely difficult to operate in. Where possible, U.S. forces should avoid them. Aerospace forces can help preclude some urban military operations through deterrence, early warning, and rapid humanitarian or military intervention. Along with ground-based long-range fires, aerospace forces can also interdict adversary forces, potentially preventing them from reaching urban areas.
• Where urban operations cannot be avoided, aerospace forces can make important contributions to the joint team (air, land, sea, and space forces working together): detecting adversary forces in the open; attacking them in a variety of settings; and providing close support, navigation and communications infrastructure, and resupply for friendly ground forces.

uations, and humanitarian assistance. Their development should be encouraged.
• Three-dimensional mapping and GPS relays also have the potential to substantially improve the situational awareness of friendly ground forces, allowing the smallest units as well as their commanders to know their location (both GPS coordinates and position in buildings). Coupling these technologies with laser rangefinders should allow friendly forces to quickly map the location of engaged adversary forces.
• Automated integration and pattern analysis of inputs from large, multiphenomenology sensor networks (i.e., sensors that use acoustic, infrared, seismic, chemical, and radar detectors) will be necessary to interpret the massive volume of activity found in most urban areas.
• But, in the type of limited operations this report emphasizes, we think it unlikely that automated classification of weapons, adversary personnel, or vehicles will be sufficiently reliable to permit lethal fires to be put automatically on targets. Rather, we expect that practical limitations of automated fusion, coupled with political concerns about collateral damage and civilian casualties, will dictate at least one human decisionmaker remaining in the loop between sensor and shooter.
• As long as human decisionmakers remain in the loop between sensor and shooter, human-machine interfaces will be a critical information-architecture issue. A major challenge will be developing the organizational processes that make quick decisions possible in light of the likely uncertainly and ambiguity associated with real combat. Without a responsive and agile command and control system, an elusive and adaptable adversary is likely to be there and gone before weapons can be brought to bear.
Are urban-centered conflicts becoming more common? Are they a new form of warfare that will supplant traditional maneuver warfare in the open? These intriguing questions deserve serious and careful xvi Aerospace Operations in Urban Environments consideration by defense planners and researchers alike. At this point, there is insufficient evidence or analysis to answer these questions. Defense planners-who must walk a narrow path between apocalyptic and complacent visions of the future security environment-should focus, at least for now, on ensuring that the U.S. military can meet a broad range of urban-operation challenges, whether in major wars or small-scale operations.
The best argument for improved capabilities for urban operations is that, despite its best efforts to avoid cities, the U.S. military has had to fight in them in diverse circumstances. As well, in an increasingly urbanized world, noncombatant evacuations, humanitarian relief, and other noncombat operations are likely to take place in urban settings. The military is tasked in many such operations, because armed interference is a possibility. Although U.S. forces have usually been able to avoid combat during these operations, they must be prepared to conduct urban evacuations and humanitarian relief in the face of armed opposition. In short, whether in conventional conflicts or in smaller-scale contingencies, there is a good chance that U.S. forces will be called upon to operate in urban settings. The probability or desirability of urban operations need not be overstated to acknowledge that prudent defense planning requires that the United States develop the doctrine, training, organizations, equipment, and concepts of operations to be effective in this unique and difficult environment.
Planners also need to distinguish clearly between the problem of conducting military operations in the midst of a civilian population and that of fighting in the rubble of a largely abandoned city. The former problem is more complex and deserves analytic attention. As the Department of Defense (DoD) places more emphasis on peace, relief, counterterrorism, and other operations at the lower end of the conflict spectrum, planners, operators, and analysts must all gain a deeper understanding of the human and physical intricacies of the urban environment.
Owing to their political, legal, and military complexity, operations at the lower end of the spectrum will be the most common and challenging urban missions the USAF will face. Although the USAF can improve its ability to conduct urban operations against conventional foes, the major shortcomings will be in situations where unconventional foes are conducting limited operations; therefore, we present new concepts directed at those situations.
It may be possible in future limited operations to identify and attack critical adversary centers of gravity or key nodes. However, historical experience suggests that this is the exception rather than the rule. In most limited conflicts, strategic objectives are more likely to be achieved through the cumulative effect of persistent surveillance and strike than through the destruction of a fairly small target set (e.g., an adversary's headquarters).
For example, in a notional peace operation that included an urban component, U.S. objectives might be to stop the violence, resetüe the population, and achieve a return to normal in which routine civil and economic activities could take place without disruption. To accomplish these objectives would require, above all else, that friendly forces control the streets. The operational task of controlling the streets would, in turn, require that a variety of tactical tasks be accomplished. Table

The fielding of new urban surveillance, strike, and navigation technologies, when combined with innovative concepts of operation, could yield a significant improvement in USAF and joint capabilities for urban operations. In particular, the integration of ground sensor networks, low-flying air-launched UAVs, and more-traditional surveillance platforms with other platforms carrying limited-effects weapons could make joint forces much more effective in constrained urban operations. Developing the ability to detect, identify, and eliminate room-sized targets without collateral damage is a natural step in the ongoing evolution of aerospace power, simply continuing current trends in command, control, communication, intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (C3ISR), battle management, and precision strike.  For these capabilities to be realized, several areas will require more focused attention:
• Air-launched offboard sensors
• Limited-effects munitions and associated platforms
• Non-imaging sensors for ground networks (particularly weapondetection and explosives-detection technologies)
• Three-dimensional mapping and databases
• Sensor fusion
• Joint command and control of aerospace and ground forces.
Budgetary realities and current modernization priorities mean that funds available for enhancing USAF urban capabilities are limited.
For that reason, we recommend that the USAF continue modest re-Summary xix search in this area to identify the most-promising and versatile technologies. Additional research and testing will have to be done before there is sufficient data on performance and cost for the USAF leadership to make informed decisions on whether to field systems such as those discussed in this report.
For the near term, we recommend that one of the USAF major commands or a battle laboratory be given responsibility to do additional research and development of these systems. To make the most of limited R&D funds, USAF laboratories should seek to partner with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other interested parties-perhaps under the auspices of an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program-to build and test prototypes of the more-promising systems. U.S. allies are likely to be important players as well; they have developed a variety of nonlethal, countersniper, and other systems that apply in urban operations.
Ultimately, urban operations are a joint problem. Theater commanders, the joint staff, and DoD will have to determine which mix of capabilities offers the most robust force for urban operations. Specific sensor and weapon choices will have to be made on the basis of some combination of coverage rate, resolution, versatility, responsiveness, cost, proportional/adjustable effects, and ease of delivery. Urban-specific measures of effectiveness (MOEs) maybe needed to evaluate options for accomplishing the various tasks. As promising technologies are identified, realistic field testing, simulation, modeling, and red-teaming

It would be unfortunate, however, if excessive concern about budgetary constraints, combined with somewhat outdated views of the limitations of aerospace power, prevented promising new capabilities from being fielded. Ironically, airmen are often as likely as infantrymen to narrowly define the settings in which aerospace forces can contribute. A more expansive vision of aerospace power would see the urban canyons of the world as part of the continuum of the vertical dimension that runs from the ground to orbital altitudes and would embrace nontraditional systems-such as air-dropped UAVs-as simply another tool in the airman's kit bag. The USAF excelled during the twentieth century at going higher, faster, farther. To meet the challenges of the early twenty-first century, the USAF may also need to exploit unmanned and robotic systems so that it can go lower, slower, and closer against unconventional threats to U.S. interests.
For several millennia in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and the Americas, the city has played a unique role as a center of economic, political, and cultural activity. As well, the city has long played a military role. Built as fortified settlements, many early cities have been used as anchors for defensive lines. 
1
The fall of major cities in war has typically been associated with final defeat. Thus, it is no surprise that battles for cities have been central to both civil and international conflicts from the Peloponnesian War to Bosnia. They also have been very common: Urban battles number in the thousands. 
2
Despite the importance of cities and extensive U.S. experience with urban combat in WWII and, to a lesser extent, in Korea and Vietnam, urban military operations received little attention during the Cold War. However, since the end of the Cold War, the U.S. defense community has grown increasingly interested in urban combat.

Are recent urban operations in Panama City, Khafji, Mogadishu, Port au Prince, Grozny, and Sarajevo an anomaly or a harbinger of the future?
According to a variety of hypotheses that have been posited, 
6
By all accounts a fundamental demographic transition does seem to be occurring in the developing world. The world's urban population is growing four times as fast as its rural population, and 150,000 people are added to the urban population of developing countries every day. By 2025, two-thirds of the earth's population is projected to live in urban areas, and 90 percent of the growth will be in the developing world. 
7
Some observers believe that, as populations shift from rural to urban areas, the focus of existing conflicts-whether tribal, ethnic, religious, or ideological-will shift to urban areas also. For example, insurgents in El Salvador, Peru, Angola, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Afghanistan, and Egypt all shifted their focus to cities over the past two decades. In some cities, the slums have become urban sanctuaries for insurgents, much as isolated rural settings were during the insurgencies of the 1960s. 
8
For example, some believe that the marginal living conditions of some urban areas in the developing world, particularly in the unsanctioned shantytowns that surround them, will lead to unrest. 
9
Yet another argument for an increase in urban conflict sees urbanization as denying the open space to conduct traditional maneuver warfare. For example, Rosenau argues that "the amount of open space is decreasing, thus increasing the odds that land forces will have to fight in urban areas." 
10
That said, land-use patterns by themselves are not sufficient to argue for an increase in urban conflict globally, because the amount of urbanized terrain is still small compared with open space-forest, farm, mountain, or desert. For example, in 1994 37 percent of the earth's land surface was farmland or pastureland. 
11
Another argument is that future U.S. adversaries will not want to fight wars in open spaces (at least not against the United States) and will actively avoid confronting the United States in places and under conditions in which its advanced sensors and weapons are most effective. Rather, among other clever strategies, they will take advantage of the land-use patterns that Rosenau identified and seek out built-up areas to counter U.S. technological dominance of the conventional battlefield. Their ability to do so will vary with their objectives and a host of military and political factors. However, the United States should expect future adversaries to increasingly embrace such strategies.
Perhaps the most compelling argument for future urban operations is also the most simple: Many U.S. objectives cannot be achieved without controlling key cities (or parts of them) for some period of time. For a special operation, this control might last for a matter ot minutes or hours; for a noncombatant evacuation operation (NEO), it might last for days; for peace operations, it might last for years. We saw this in recent operations in Somalia, Panama, Haiti, Kuwait, and Bosnia, where U.S. forces were assigned cities as major operational objectives. Noncombatant evacuations-such as those that occurred in Somalia (1991), Liberia (1996), the Central African Republic (1996), Republic of Congo (1997), and Sierra Leone (1997)-are invariably centered on the capital or other major cities.
Cities were also core objectives in other operations in the 1990s. In Kuwait, the capture of the country's capital city was an essential part of the larger objective of liberating Kuwait. In Panama, removing the national leadership and disarming Panamanian Defense Forces } Introduction spective, is straightforward compared with military operations in a city whose civil lifeblood still pulses.
During the Cold War, most defense professionals understood urban operations to mean house-to-house fighting between conventional ground forces seeking to hold or take a city in the context of a major war such as World War II. Fighting of this intensity usually turned city landscapes to rubble and disrupted the routine economic and social activities of cities, typically causing mass evacuations and refugee flows. Thus, as urban battles wore on, the civilian population and its associated activities became less and less a factor. The all-out nature of WWII also meant that commanders were focused on defeating enemy forces whatever the cost. To constrain operations because of concerns about civilians would have risked defeat. The urban-operations challenge was primarily to find solutions to the tactical, logistics, engineering, and command exigencies of operating in this unique physical environment.

These lesser conflicts have received more attention in the military literature both because they are more difficult to plan for than all-out war and because many believe such conflicts will become increasingly frequent, which has led to some definitional confusion in the broader defense community.
The urban-operations writings are paralleled by a more bureaucratic debate in Washington, and some services have seized upon urban operations as a mission they wish to claim as theirs exclusively.
Redefining Warfare, Not Service Roles Some authors and senior U.S. Marine officers use urban operations increasingly as a shorthand for what they believe will be the most prevalent form of conflict in the future-civil wars, insurgencies, and transnational terrorism in the world's cities-rather than its traditional meaning of all combat in built-up areas. 
16
Airmen have responded to this new view of urban military operations in a variety of ways. Some have noted that aerospace power has Introduction played an important role in most urban battles the United States has fought, either through interdiction of enemy forces or by providing surveillance, reconnaissance, aerial resupply, and/or close support to friendly ground forces. Other airmen have simply dismissed urban-based lesser conflicts as secondary in importance to major wars. Still others have introduced their own redefinition, arguing that precision strikes in Baghdad or Bosnia during Operations Desert Storm and Deliberate Force constituted urban combat.
Rather than embrace any one of these perspectives, we suggest that defense planners cannot afford to focus on one type of urban conflict to the exclusion of others. Defense planners need to identify those capabilities that the United States will need for diverse urban operations that will vary on at least the eight dimensions listed in Figure 
1
As we think through the many potential permutations, it becomes clear that the kinds of capabilities the United States needs for urban military operations are going to vary greatly, depending on the par-RANDMfiT 187-1. 1   Nature of opponent (e.g., nation, subnational group) Type of adversary forces (e.g., regular, irregular, heavy, light) Rules of engagement (e.g., restrictive to permissive) Physical environment (e.g., high-rise or low-rise, compact or sprawl, permanent or shantytown, town or city) Social environment (e.g., degree of popular support for adversary, city populated or evacuated) U.S. objectives (e.g., enforce peace agreement, liberate friendly city) Adversary's objectives (e.g., capture territory, overthrow government) Adversary's strategy (e.g., city hugging, urban insurgency) NOTE: City hugging occurs when conventional forces use urban terrain to hinder the defender's attempts to detect and attack them with standoff sensors and weapons.  Aerospace Operations in Urban Environments ticular situation. For example, at least some of the tasks 17 the U.S. military would be called upon to accomplish in an urban battle during a major theater war can be expected to be different from those associated with an urban counterinsurgency operation, urban peacekeeping, or opposed NEO in an urban setting. Even when the tasks are the same (e.g., detect, identify, and attack adversary forces), the means used to accomplish them will vary according to the rules of engagement, social environment, and so on. Consequently, the relative contribution of air, land, sea, and space forces will also vary with the specifics of a particular scenario.
It would be risky to posture U.S. forces for only one of the many potential scenarios or to rely exclusively on any one type of force element for the diverse challenges of urban military operations. The smoke from the interservice competition for resources should not obscure the fact that each service has roles to play in urban operations. 
18
The objective of this report is to help the USAF and others in the defense community better understand the role of aerospace forces in future urban military operations. Because urban stabilization operations-peace operations, counterinsurgency, or humanitarian 17 One challenge for future researchers in this area is to develop task lists for various missions in an urban environment.
aid-are likely to remain the most common, the emphasis of the report is on improving USAF capabilities to tackle these problems.
Recognizing the difficulty of predicting future military challenges and seeing a role for aerospace forces in urban operations across the spectrum of conflict, this report addresses both conventional and unconventional challenges. Chapter Two explores how aerospace forces can be used to deter or prevent conventional attacks on urban areas. Chapter Three discusses the unique legal and political constraints on urban military operations, from classic strategic air campaigns to peace operations.
The remainder of the report focuses on enhancing the contribution of air and space components in lesser urban conflicts. Chapter Four presents data on urban geospatial forms and analyzes how the urban physical environment constrains air operations. Chapter Five presents new concepts of operation to accomplish key military tasks in light of the challenges and opportunities identified in the previous chapters. Chapter Six identifies key technology areas in which investments will be necessary to achieve the capabilities envisioned in Chapter Five. Chapter Seven presents the conclusions and recommendations. Appendix A shows how trigonometric calculations in Chapter Four were done. Appendix B discusses microwave recharging of UAVs. Appendix C provides additional details on countersniper technologies. Appendix D presents an analysis of lessons learned from previous urban air operations.
A common tendency of recent discussions of urban military operations has been to portray urban combat as the most likely form of global strife in the decade ahead. Former Marine Corps commandant General Charles Krulak set the tone for such portrayals when he declared in 1996 that "the future may well not be 'Son of Desert Storm,' but rather 'Stepchild of Somalia and Chechnya.'"

The most attractive option available to U.S. decisionmakers and theater commanders in the face of such contingencies may well be to "preempt the enemy from using complex [i.e., urban] terrain in the first place" 
9
For these and other reasons, it is doubtful whether the United States will ever enjoy the comparative force-employment advantages in urban combat that it now enjoys for more open engagements against fixed targets and fielded forces. Instead, U.S. commanders will have little choice in such cases but to fight in less-than-ideal tactical circumstances. Because of these uncongenial facts, it has long been a given in U.S. military doctrine and practice that "commanders should avoid committing forces to the attack of urban areas unless the mission absolutely requires doing so." 
10
11
As later chapters of this report show, U.S. aerospace power already has the potential to do more by way of helping theater commanders mitigate the worst aspects of urban operations than it is usually given credit for. For example, aerospace power can help isolate cities through enforcement of no-fly or no-drive zones. Moreover, with selected technology improvements and new concepts of operations aimed at making the most of existing systems (e.g., AC-130 gunships, UAVs, and the Joint Surveillance and Target Attack Radar System [JSTARS]), U.S. aerospace power should be able to contribute even more toward making urban operations less onerous for friendly ground forces. 
12
Aerospace power offers U.S. decisionmakers a unique opportunity for avoiding some of the uglier urban situations. Indeed, its potential for keeping urban showdowns from getting out of hand is arguably aerospace power's single longest suit in the urban-warfare context. In a typical scenario, U.S. or allied forces are attempting to enforce a peace agreement or defeat an insurgency. Efforts to use aerospace power as a way of precluding urban combat in such scenarios will be driven, first, by a desire to avoid needless friendly casualties. They also will appeal to planners because of their ability to reduce the chances of civilian casualties, as occurred in Somalia during the infamous "Bloody Sunday" shootout in Mogadishu.
It is worth dissecting what happened in Mogadishu because it illustrates the complexity of contemporary urban military operations, particularly in making distinctions between combatants and noncombatants. Somali fighters, who wore no uniforms or distinctive clothing, hid behind mobs of unarmed men, women, and children as they moved toward the helicopter crash sites and as they fired on U.S. personnel. Although some of these mobs were composed of curious bystanders, the overwhelming majority were acting in support of the Somali fighters. Many times, when a fighter was shot and fell to the ground, an unarmed "noncombatant" in the crowd would pick up the weapon and begin firing at U.S. troops. Entire Somali families acted as gun teams (dad firing, mom propping up the weapon, and kids sitting on top); others helped as spotters or ammo carriers. In one famous incident, a U.S. Ranger refrained from firing at a woman with a baby until she pulled a weapon from behind the baby and began firing. 
13
In pursuing such an approach, it makes sense to take a CINC's view of the problem from the top down, rather than either a going-in aerospace power perspective or a bottom-up ground perspective. Such a view offers a ready antidote against the danger of succumbing to the law of the instrument and predetermining the answer. 
14
First, aerospace power can rapidly project U.S. power and presence, including people and modest amounts of equipment, worldwide. In situations where enemy conventional forces threaten invasion, the likelihood of urban combat occurring will be inversely related to how quickly U.S. aerospace power can be brought to bear. Conventional urban combat is likely to occur in settings where there is not a nearby U.S. military presence. For such a presence to be realized, suitable nearby operating bases must be readily available.
Second, aerospace power can observe from the highest of high "ground" and, in so doing, expand the situational awareness of friendly forces at all levels. Air and space surveillance systems can aid in intelligence preparation of the battlefield when a developing contingency might threaten to degenerate into an urban confrontation. UAVs, for example, can make imagery available to tactical commanders and provide near-real-time updates as necessary. JSTARS and other airborne systems with Moving Target Indicator (MTB modes can detect and track moving vehicles in the open, day or night, in most weather. Such an information edge can help maximize U.S. maneuver advantages by enabling the bypassing of defensive urban fortifications and allowing precision attack systems to find and take out deployed enemy forces in the open. It also can provide needed awareness and force protection for U.S. forces potentially deployed in harm's way. The result will be to reduce the friction and uncertainty that might otherwise beset a U.S. or allied ground commander. U.S. air-and space-based ISR capabilities already offer greatly improved situational awareness for all command echelons in a joint operation. They cannot, at least not yet, address the legitimate concern voiced by some land warriors over finding and identifying a notional "enemy company in the basement of a built-up area" or "the 12 terrorists mixed in with that crowd in the village market." 
15
Third, aerospace power can deny the adversary a night sanctuary and, from standoff ranges, can destroy an adversary's fixed assets in his homeland, with virtual impunity. Other direct-action opportunities for aerospace power in preventing urban combat include cutting off an adversary's sources of resupply, creating and enforcing exclu-LtGen. Paul K. Van Riper, USMC (Ret.), quoted in Clashes of Visions: Sizing and Shaping Our Forces in a Fiscally Constrained Environment, Proceedings of CSIS-VII Symposium October 29, 1997, Washington, D.C: Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1998, p. 38.  sion zones, and enforcing no-drive zones. Working with friendly ground forces, aerospace power can also help seal off parts of a city, physically isolating an adversary from the population and, by jamming or preempting commercial radio and television stations, psychologically isolating him from encouragement by the population. It can destroy or neutralize detected adversary armor before it gets into built-up areas, substantially reducing the threat to friendly ground forces. In addition, it can cue friendly special operations forces conducting urban-containment missions and protect the movement of people and material from base to base.
Fourth, aerospace power can deny entry to an adversary. This option is perhaps the most challenging task for aerospace power, since air and space sensors and air-delivered weapons cannot easily prevent clandestine units from entering cities. Yet, with timely warning and adequate presence, these sensors and weapons can deny potential adversaries the option of pursuing city-hugging strategies by eliminating their ability to move into a defender's cities, confronting friendly forces with a fait accompli.
The ability of aerospace power to do all of this with minimal friendly losses, thanks to stealth and advanced suppression of enemy air defense (SEAD) capabilities, makes such preclusion options particularly credible.
All in all, today's U.S. air and space capabilities enable constant pressure on an adversary to be maintained from a safe distance, increased kills per sortie, selective targeting with very littie unintended damage, substantially reduced reaction time, and, at least potentially, the complete shutdown of an adversary's control of large mechanized forces. 
16
As for preclusion strategies themselves, theater CINCs can consider first using aerospace power to disincline adversaries from indulging in threats against friendly cities. For example, at the most benign end of the conflict spectrum, the timely resort to aerospace power can preempt urban fighting by providing early humanitarian assistance. That failing, CINCs can consider using aerospace power, along with early-entry ground forces, to foreclose enemy options by sealing off a town, blocking avenues of approach within cities, and otherwise making the urban environment nonpermissive before the situation degenerates into an urban nightmare. The challenge for the Joint Force Air Component Commander (JFACC) in such cases will be to determine what enables an adversary to engage in urban combat and then to take that ability away preemptively.
In this regard, the earlier-cited perspective offered by Army MG Scales (1998) would seem to be almost tailor-made for making the most of American air and space assets in heading off the worst kinds of urban warfare contingencies. By being patient and playing a waiting game, U.S. commanders can strive to run would-be urban opponents out of both time and latitude to control the local populace. Such use of the awareness and direct-action opportunities made possible by aerospace power could include augmenting hostnation forces, prepositioning equipment, and blocking avenues of approach to cities. Those options failing, aerospace power might still enable a CINC to keep urban combat at arm's length by avoiding a direct assault on adversary forces, establishing a cordon around a city, controlling the flow of information into the city (through electronic jamming and friendly psychological-warfare radio/TV broadcasts), creating sanctuaries to which the populace could escape, and enforcing safe passage for those who wished to escape. For such a preclusion strategy to work, General Scales cautions that planners would require reliable information on the extent of enemy popular support, on the population's willingness to endure suffering, on the city's ability to be self-sustaining, on the presence of defensible nearby sanctuaries, and on the coherence of occupying adversary forces, among numerous other things. 
17
Aerospace power can deter aggression or compel an end to aggression directed against cities by threatening strikes against known adversary centers of gravity, including targets in their homeland cities. In Operations Allied Force and Deliberate Force, and during the earlier 1991 Gulf War, U.S. aerospace power demonstrated an ability to identify key military, political, and economic targets and destroy them with great lethality and precision.
Aerospace power also can detect and destroy adversary forces as they move through open space to get to friendly cities. If U.S. air reconnaissance and strike assets are in place for locating, engaging, and attacking such adversary forces, those forces need not pass through much open terrain to suffer debilitating attrition from air attack. Aerospace power might prevent urban combat by defeating an adversary before he reached the cities that were his objective.
Developments that could hinder the use of aerospace power in preclusion strategies might include the unintended privation of innocents, surprise assaults on cities or indifference to losses caused by U.S. air attack, asymmetric adversary countermoves, and a batüe for time in which the adversary enjoyed the edge in patience and stamina.
In crafting preclusion strategies aimed at circumventing such untoward developments, there is ample room for more-creative thought about involvement of joint forces than what the respective roles of air and land forces will be. In this respect, a USAF planner concerned with urban combat has recently remarked that "we can bring our technical superiority to bear only through joint operations Ground forces need the perspective of a city that is obtainable only from air and space if they are to operate there effectively. Likewise, aerospace forces may need the perspective of a city that is obtainable only from troops on the ground if they are to bring their power to bear most effectively."

Callard, USAF, "Aerospace Power Essential in Urban Warfare," Aviation Week & Space Technology, September 6,1999, p. 110.   ^ery close coordination among force elements will be necessary to separate aircraft and weapon flight paths and to avoid fratricide. Urban operations will require a level of jointness and integration of C3I well beyond that achieved to date. 
20
As a baseline for contemplating the possibilities and associated requirements of alternative prevention strategies, it might be useful to revisit some past urban operations that did not occur or were substantially minimized by the fortuitous application of aerospace power.
The battle of Al Khafji during the third week of Operation Desert Storm is a particularly revealing example. Once it had become clear that the allied air campaign might be open-ended, Saddam Hussein sought to draw U.S. ground forces into a slugfest that would send body bags home and turn American opinion against the war.
Toward that end, on January 29, 1991, Saddam launched a multipronged attack from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia in the vicinity of Border Observation Post 4 in the west and near the abandoned and unprotected coastal town of Al Khafji in the east. Whether Saddam sought to capture, reinforce, and defend Khafji or drive farther south (perhaps toward the forward logistics base at Kibrit) may never be known. Thus, we cannot know for sure that a significant urban battie was avoided. But the effectiveness of air strikes against follow-on Iraqi forces illustrates the potential for interdiction as a preclusionary strategy.
A battalion-sized element of Iraqi troops occupied the evacuated and undefended town on January 29. In the process, they unknowingly trapped two U.S. Marine reconnaissance teams. Coalition ground forces evicted the Iraqis on January 31 with minimal casualties.

Later, JSTARS aircraft detected a second wave of Iraqi columns forming up to reinforce those that had initially attacked Al Khafji. At first, the Tactical Air Control Center (TACC) did not react to these indicators of Iraqi forces on the move; its airborne sensors had been focused on areas to the west, in support of the counter-Scud operation and because Central Command's (CENTCOM's) leaders, despite the initial Iraqi foray into Al Khafji, were not expecting enemy forces to launch a major move against Saudi Arabia. However, once it became clear that a sizable ground advance was forming up on the night of January 30, the senior Central Air Force (CENTAF) officer in the TACC swung JSTARS to the east and began diverting coalition fighters to engage moving ground targets in Kuwait. Upon being apprised of the Iraqi troop activity, the JFACC saw an opportunity shaping up to engage the Iraqi column before it made contact with allied ground forces. Affirming the decision to divert coalition aerospace power from its original Air Tasking Order (ATO), he committed more than 140 aircraft against the advancing column, which consisted of two brigades from the Iraqi 3rd Armored and 5th Mechanized Divisions.

The hero of this story was the E-8 ISTARS, which was still in the early stages of development at the time the war began. 
23
24
From then on, Iraq's forces hunkered down to absorb the coalition's punishment. The USAF chief of staff at the time, General Merrill A.
McPeak, later summed up the role played by coalition aerospace power in preventing a potentially worse situation when he declared that "history may judge that the most significant battle of Desert Storm was, in fact, the one that did not happen at Al Khafji."

The battle of Al Khafji was not the only recent instance in which friendly aerospace power successfully precluded or limited urban combat. The retaking of Kuwait City by coalition ground forces during Operation Desert Storm is another. Only after the allied air campaign had wreaked havoc on Iraqi armor, command and control, lines of communications, and, most important, the will to fight, did coalition forces launch the ground offensive that freed Kuwait. Kuwait City proper was freed with virtually no urban fighting, Iraqi forces having fled the city previously.
Finally, we cite Israel's recurrent exposure to urban challenges since 1982 in dealing with Palestinian guerrilla operations conducted against Israel from southern Lebanon as an example of an urban experience gone bad that led to a decision to resort to aerospace power the second time around.
Israel launched Operation Peace for Galilee against Lebanon in June 1982, on the heels of a Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) assassination attempt against Israel's ambassador to London that left him gravely wounded. That invasion by an Israeli Army division eventually reached as far as Beirut. The Israelis occupied Beirut and engaged in urban fighting for more than two months before PLO forces finally agreed to vacate the city. More than 18,000 people, mostly Lebanese civilians, were reported killed and 30,000 injured during the invasion and ensuing occupation. According to a reputable account, the invasion "drew Israel into a wasteful adventure that drained much of its inner strength and cost the IDF the lives of over 500 of its finest men in a vain effort to fulfill a role it was never meant to play." 
26
27
In some cases, aerospace power has neither eased nor prevented urban fighting. Russia's abortive war in 1994-1996 against the breakaway republic of Chechnya offers an example. 
28
Russia's concept of operations sought to blockade the city. However, as the invasion unfolded, weather complications confronted Russian aircrews with ground fog, blowing snow, severe icing, and a heavy cloud buildup with a low ceiling and tops above 15,000 feet, making both high-and low-angle manual bombing impossible and also pre-eluding the use of electro-optical or laser-guided weapons. Instead, the Russian Air Force was forced to resort to day and night level bomb releases 29 from medium altitude (15,000-20,000 feet) against radar offset aimpoints and to inertial bombing of geographic coordinates through heavy cloud cover. The inaccuracy of those weapon deliveries resulted in many Russian losses to friendly fire.
The battle for Grozny soon degenerated into close-quarters urban combat. Yet, instead of trying to ferret out rebel defenders from their positions, Russian troops just blew up their suspected hiding places with tanks and artillery and accepted the collateral damage. Russian forces finally captured Grozny on March 7, after nearly three months of heavy fighting. For two more months thereafter, Russian aircraft continued to conduct daily attacks against the outlying road net and associated villages harboring enemy units. By that time, rebel forces had taken refuge in the surrounding mountains, from which they prevailed over Russia the following year.
In all, the war claimed the lives of four Russian Air Force pilots through the downing of two Su-25s and an Su-24. Ten Russian Army helicopters were also shot down. Most of the helicopter crews were rescued, but there were reports that at least one of the crewmembers was captured and executed by Chechen soldiers. After the war ended, a veteran's organization estimated that 4,379 Russian soldiers had been killed in the war and 703 more were missing. The Russian Air Force commander later reported that his aircraft had flown a total of 14,000 sorties since the onset of hostilities, all to no avail. 
30
However, Russian aerospace power did have at least one perceived success. Months after the heaviest fighting had ended, aerospace power was apparently the instrument of choice that finally killed the Chechen leader, Dzhokar Dudayev. In an operation that probably reflected a blend of proficiency and good luck, Russian intelligence was said to have zeroed in on Dudayev's position and transmitted coordinates to Russian ground-attack aircraft, which then fired radio-frequency homing missiles that targeted Dudayev while he was talking on a satellite field telephone. According to Russian press accounts afterwards, two missiles were electronically guided by signals bouncing between the portable phone's antenna and a relay satellite. 
31
Coordinating attack helicopter operations with those of other Russian force elements also proved to be a problem, because there was no single joint-force commander. And, since rotary-wing aviation, previously assigned to the Soviet Air Force, had been transferred to army ownership in 1990, many ground commanders had only the vaguest idea of the capabilities of helicopters and of the restrictions on their use with respect to weather, aircraft and weapons limitations, weapons range, airspeeds, and aircraft load-carrying capacity, As a result, the helicopters showed the effects of a less-thanseamless integration with the ground forces. For their part, the Chechen rebels made effective use of ambush tactics, concealing their presence and shooting from multiple directions once a helicopter entered their zone of fire. Ground-forces aviation personnel were not ready to risk taking hits from rooftop snipers. Indeed, their commander stated as the formal doctrine of his community that "urban combat is not suited to helicopters." 
32
Yet the ugliness of the battle for Grozny and Russia's ignominious defeat by the Chechen rebels should not be read to suggest that Chechnya somehow represents the wave of the future for global conflict. To begin with, the war was wholly a matter of choice for President Yeltsin. It could have been avoided altogether in favor of other approaches toward dealing with the Chechen resistance. Even taking the war as a fait accompli, Russia could have used its air assets more intelligentiy.
Because of chronic underfunding and a consequent lack of aircrew training and proficiency, Russia's Air Force was anything but ready to go to war. It also lacked the fielded technology in the form of a JSTARS-equivalent that might have been used to enforce a no-drive zone in and around Grozny. Nevertheless, from a weather perspective, Russian air commanders could have insisted on a better time to commence air operations. They also could have forgone carpet bombing, which only ensured the everlasting enmity of the surviving civilian populace. Instead of being used as flying artillery, aircraft on Paul Beaver, "Army Aviation in Chechnya," Jane's Defense Weekly, June 10, 1995,  p. 79.  could have isolated the central part of the city from outlying sectors, provided better force protection for Russian troops deployed within the city limits, and shown greater concern for avoiding collateral damage. For their part, the Russian Army's attack helicopters could have avoided flying repeatedly into enemy kill sacks in urban canyons, and Chechen radio and television stations could have been jammed rather than bombed into silence.
In these and other ways, Russia's aerospace power could have been used in lieu of an immediate ground invasion, which could have been deferred until the weather and enemy resistance were more manageable.
Three years later, the Yeltsin government had another opportunity to "get it right" when it went to war a second time against Chechnya in August 1999, this time in response to a spate of apartment bombings in the Moscow region that it alleged to be the work of Chechen terrorists. In that second attempt to subdue the Chechen rebellion and impose Russian control over the separatist republic, both the Yeltsin leadership and Russia's military commanders showed evidence of learning from past experience when they combined massed firepower and a refusal to get drawn into urban combat into what amounted to a siege strategy centering on annihilating the Chechen resistance from a safe distance. This time, Russian commanders avoided close-in urban engagements and opted instead to use their air and artillery assets in standoff attacks against assumed rebel targets in the city. In late December, Russian ground forces did enter the city, replaying the earlier experience of bloody fighting and large loss of life. Fortunately for the Russians, ground fighting in the city was fairly short-lived this time around. This 6-month siege eventually led to a victory for Moscow in late January 2000, after Russian firepower had finally reduced Grozny to a smoldering shell and driven what remained of the rebel forces to flee the city and continue their resistance from the surrounding mountains. This time, as if to emulate Israel's resorting to standoff operations during the second challenge it faced from southern Lebanon, the Russians avoided committing large numbers of their infantrymen to early urban combat and sought instead to surround Grozny, sever the supply routes to the surrounding mountains emanating from Grozny, and block the southern passes toward Georgia through which fleeing rebels might seek to escape. Those in command admittedly chose a better time of year, from a weather perspective, to commence air operations, and they definitely sought to employ aerospace power as a substitute for a ground invasion. Moreover,* although the Russians had suffered 1,500 or more combat fatalities by the time the heaviest fighting had ended, they succeeded in minimizing their losses to friendly fire this time by taking determined care not to insert their own troops into areas in and around Grozny where Russian bombs would be falling.
However, this second Russian experience in Chechnya was by no means any more an effective use of aerospace power in mitigating urban combat than the first. On the contrary, rather than using aerospace power to minimize collateral damage, the Russians applied it both indiscriminately and even wantonly to destroy civilian structures outright and to terrorize the civilian population. In effect, they conducted combat operations not in an urban environment but rather against one. Through some 5,000 Su-24 and Su-25 sorties all together, they used their aerospace power once again merely as flying artillery, and they showed no significant improvements in tactics or proficiency over their earlier performance in 1994-1995. 
33
As the preceding discussion has sought to show, aerospace power should be viewed, first of all, not as a means for prosecuting urban combat more effectively but, rather, as an instrument for preventing 
33
David Fulghum, "Air War in Chechnya Reveals Mix of Tactics," Aviation Week & Space Technology, February 14,2000, p. 77. 34
or controlling urban strife before it degenerates into the kinds of situations typified by Somalia and Chechnya. As airmen ponder the various ways in which U.S. air and space assets can help a CINC handle the worst kinds of urban contingencies, they should educate CINCs in the many ways in which those same assets, used in a timely manner, can make handling such contingencies unnecessary.
At the same time, airmen must take care to avoid the opposite extreme: defining away the urban-combat challenge by fiat by assuming that aerospace power's comparative advantages for prevention will always be applicable to the needs of a CINC. Adversaries will be tempted to pursue urban options as a means of end-running U.S. technology advantages; therefore, urban contingencies can arise almost anywhere along the conflict spectrum, from humanitarian airlift and assistance through humanitarian intervention, NEOs, and small-scale shooting contingencies, to major theater wars. In such contingencies, adversaries will seek to gain the safety of hardened positions, use civilian populations and facilities as shields, and generally make the most of urban settings for concealment and deception. They also will try to prevent the use of airlift terminals and lines of communication, maximize U.S. and allied casualties, and render conflicts drawn-out enough to stretch U.S. endurance to the breaking point.
Accordingly, airmen must recognize and accept that aerospace power is not a universally applicable tool for solving every urbanmilitary-operation challenge that might arise. Insofar as urban fighting typically stems from internal conflicts in which all of the players are in place before U.S. forces have arrived on the scene, preemptive strategies that might work well enough on a pristine playing field will be ruled out before the fact in most urban challenges confronting U.S. planners. There will be times when exigencies of the moment-humanitarian, political, or military-will leave U.S. leaders with no choice but to engage in urban operations: for example, finding and seizing weapons of mass destruction (WMD) facilities in defended urban settings, rescuing friendly hostages or prisoners of war (POWs), extracting noncombatants, providing humanitarian assistance under fire, and supporting friendly governments against urban insurgents. Under such contingent circumstances, U.S. aerospace power-as for all U.S. force elements-will have little choice but to react as best it can.
That said, although U.S. air and space assets may at present have only a limited ability to perform certain tasks in the messier sorts of future urban contingencies, they may eventually offer the promise of greater versatility. For example, current and projected aids to battlespace awareness afforded by U.S. air and space assets give U.S. joint force commanders tremendous advantages over potential opponents in their ability to integrate and orchestrate various force elements to seek the greatest efficiencies in a given operational situation.
Circumstances can be imagined in which the possibility of high-intensity urban combat would be a part of the operational situation from the outset. For example, if war again breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, friendly and enemy forces will be in contact from the opening moments of fighting. Granted, North Korean troops might bypass Seoul rather than attempt to seize and occupy it. On the one hand, their leaders could endeavor to bottle up the city and isolate it rather than hazard the perils of going downtown with armor and mechanized infantry. On the other hand, the possibility of South Korean towns being overrun by the enemy, or of portions being seized by enemy agents and previously inserted special operations forces, could create a need for allied forces to starve out or root out the enemy from cities at the outset of a counterattack. Moreover, should urban operations become the norm, aerospace power need not always be defensive and supporting. It can also be offensive, featuring different problems and opportunities. For example, in the context of a conflict involving significant casualties, rules of engagement may be much more permissive and allow a CINC broad discretion in engaging adversary forces in urban areas. The threat of urban engagements would not necessarily have to slow down a counterattack's rate of advance, and the CINC could call on offensive aerospace power as the option of choice for performing the needed destruction.
35
What aerospace power cannot currently do very well is impose sustained force against urban insurgents or discriminate between adversaries and innocents in an urban setting. Accordingly, aerospace power will tend to perform best when the desired outcome involves affecting adversary behavior rather than seizing and holding urban terrain. The challenge will be to minimize the risk to friendly combatants, employing ground forces as a last resort and only after aerospace power has adequately paved the way for them.
In sum, when aerospace power cannot preclude urban operations, it can seek to mitigate their worst aspects. When it cannot mitigate, it can strive to control by isolating adversary combatants, then supporting the CINC's efforts to engage them in detail. 
36
Before turning to new concepts to better exploit aerospace power where an urban operation cannot be avoided, we first look at a variety of constraints on air operations in urban settings, beginning in Chapter Three with a look at the urban legal and political environment.
Recent U.S. and coalition operations in the Balkans and elsewhere have been marked by heated controversy over target selection. Demonstrating the difficulty of balancing the often-competing concerns of avoiding collateral damage, minimizing risk of U.S. casualties, and maximizing military effectiveness, they show that many of the most limiting constraints on future U.S. urban military actions are going to be legal and political, not technological or operational.
To be sure, legal and political constraints are not independent of technological and operational constraints. Expanded capabilities or new operational concepts may provide the means of reducing or avoiding collateral damage and enhancing force protection, and they may inform the public perceptions that drive legal and political constraints. However, in planning for urban operations, the most salient limitations on U.S. military action are often those the military places on itself by adhering to international legal norms and restrictive rules of engagement (ROE) to satisfy public and diplomatic pressures.
Urban environments may pose enormous difficulties for those planning and conducting military operations within the boundaries of international law and self-imposed constraints on the use of force. The speed and agility of aerospace power, combined with its ability to deliver firepower precisely and with fairly low risk to U.S. personnel across the spectrum of conflict, often make it the military instru-merit of choice for decisionmakers. However, the heightened risk of collateral damage when operating in urban environments partially offsets U.S. technological superiority and provides adversaries with expanded opportunities to exploit U.S. adherence to certain norms. As a result, the urban-combat options available to planners and decisionmakers are generally far narrower than the domain of the feasible.
Effective planning for future urban operations, with its consideration of new technologies and operational concepts, requires first an appreciation of the factors that will govern whether and how those technologies and concepts will be used. This chapter aims to place urban aerospace operations in their legal and political context, thereby laying the foundations for assessing USAF urban-combat capabilities across the range of potential tasks. It gives particular attention to urban MOOTW, because air operations in this context are especially difficult (owing to the inherent constraints associated with MOOTW) and may be common in the near future. But the issues presented in this chapter apply to conventional combat operations as well. The chapter also draws on air campaign planning experiences during the Vietnam and Persian Gulf Wars and, more recently, NATO operations over Kosovo-operations that, while lying outside the focus of this volume, spotlight the most pertinent competing pressures that constrain planning of all air operations.
The body of norms regulating the conduct of states and combatants engaged in armed hostilities is the law of armed conflict. 
1
The term "law of war" is often used interchangeably with "law of armed conflict," even though the legal requirements placed on parties sometimes depend on the type of conflict or operation being waged. This chapter is concerned with the legal norms that apply across the spectrum of conflict and, for clarity's sake, employs throughout the term "law of armed conflict." negotiated at the peace conferences of 1899 and 1907, and the Geneva Conventions, as well as from numerous agreements that limit the means and conduct of hostilities.

The United States has a strong interest in upholding international norms, which tend to be stabilizing forces and increase the predictability of state actions. Beyond a general commitment to upholding the law of armed conflict, U.S. planners place a premium on the perceived legitimacy of military operations. That legitimacy often turns, in part, on the perceived legality of those operations, although, as discussed below, demands to maximize U.S. force protection and military effectiveness sometimes create strong countervailing pressures that must be balanced. Planners strive to maintain support among three sets of audiences-the domestic public, the international community, and some parties local to the areas of operations; adherence to international law can bolster this support.
While interpretations of some international legal provisions shift or remain unsettled, many of the basic principles (e.g., proportionality) embodied in the law of armed conflict have, over time, been internalized in the highest levels of strategic planning down to the lowest levels of tactical decisionmaking by individuals, when commitment to legal norms helps motivate and sustain the morale of U.S. servicemen.

International regulation of armed conflict begins with the principle of military necessity, "the principle which justifies measures of regulated force not forbidden by international law which are indispensable for securing the prompt submission of the enemy, with the least possible expenditures of economic and human resources." 6 In pursuing military victory, however, parties are also governed by the principle of humanity, which forbids the infliction of injury or destruction not necessary to the achievement of legitimate military purposes.
To a degree, the principles of military necessity and humanity complement each other, both reflecting the notion of economy of force. Yet, there is also a tension between them that the law of armed conflict seeks to mediate, between allowing sufficient military flexibility to subdue an enemy and restricting that flexibility to reduce the destructive impact of conflict. Many of the specific rules contained in the law of armed conflict attempt to balance, on the one hand, the latitude necessary for military forces to carry out their functions, with, on the other hand, a desire to minimize human suffering. 
7
7
• The right of belligerents to adopt means of injuring the enemy is not unlimited.
• It is prohibited to launch attacks against the civilian population as such.
Together, the principles of military necessity and humanity underlie the rule of proportionality, which demands that parties refrain from attacks, even against legitimate military targets, likely to cause civilian suffering and damage disproportionate to the expected military gain. 
8
Embedded in these principles and rules is the idea of distinction (or discrimination) between military and civilian persons or property. Planners and commanders are obligated to distinguish between military and civilian targets, restricting their attacks to the former only. In broad terms, international law prohibits attacks on civilian populations as such, as well as acts or threats of violence having the primary purpose of spreading terror among the civilian population. 
9
10
• Distinctions must be made between combatants and noncombatants, to the effect that noncombatants be spared as much as possible.
(a) Do everything feasible to verify that the objectives attacked are neither civilians nor civilian objects...
(b) Take all feasible precautions in the choice of means and methods of attack with a view to avoiding, and in any event to minimizing, incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, and damage to civilian objects; and
(c) Refrain from deciding to launch any attack which may be expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. 
11
Aside from the general rule prohibiting direct attacks on civilian objects, narrow rules also proscribe attacks on specific objects granted special protection. The 1949 Geneva Conventions protect hospitals and other medical assets. Religious and cultural buildings and monuments are also promised special protected status under international law.

So far, this outline of legal constraints has been one-sided; it has focused on regulating the attacker's actions. 
17
Efforts during the past several decades to codify the law of armed conflict have emphasized the reciprocal duties of attackers and defenders. Article 58 of Protocol I demands that parties endeavor to segregate military objectives from their civilian population and take steps to protect civilians from the dangers of military operations. 
18
19
The same principle applies to specially protected sites. For example, Article 19 of the Geneva Convention for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field (1949) establishes that "the responsible authorities shall ensure that the said medical establishments and units are, as far as possible, situated in such a manner that attacks against military objectives cannot imperil their safety."
Protocol I, article 51(7). This admonition is similarly articulated in Air Force Pamphlet 110-31 (1976, p. 5-8), which explains:
The requirement to distinguish between combatants and civilians, and between military objectives and civilian objects, imposes obligations on all the parties to the conflict to establish and maintain the distinctions.... Inherent in the principle of protecting the civilian population, and required to make that protection fully effective, is a requirement that civilians not be used to render areas immune from military operations. Civilians may not be used to shield a defensive position, to hide military objectives, or to screen an attack A party to a conflict which chooses to use its civilian population for military purposes violates its obligations to protect its own civilian population. It cannot complain when inevitable, although regrettable, civilian casualties result. basic principles of the law of armed conflict. Note, however, that a defender's violation of these principles-for example, its deliberate placement of civilians in the vicinity of military targets or its use of specially protected sites to house weapons-does not eliminate all legal obligations on the attacker. Among other things, an attacker would generally remain bound by proportionality principles and obliged to refrain from attacks likely to result in civilian damage that is excessive in relation to military gain. Nevertheless, the relative protections normally granted those civilian persons and objects is weakened. As elaborated below, adversaries, especially those that show little regard for international law and do not face political or diplomatic pressures similar to those faced by the United States, have exploited the asymmetry of constraints for strategic or tactical gain, with some success.
Compliance with the principles of discrimination and proportionality is confounded by the structure and organization of urban centers. From a planning viewpoint, these principles contain a foreseeability element: Planners must consider collateral damage and likely injury to noncombatants or civilian property and must take reasonable actions to avoid or minimize these effects. By connecting and tightly packing both military and civilian resources, not only may the urban environment increase the chances that military attacks will harm civilians, but it may increase the likelihood that even precise attacks can unleash substantial secondary effects on the urban population. For example, a perfectly executed attack on a power plant might not harm a single civilian directiy, but thousands could be harmed indirectly through effects related to the loss of electrical power in the city.
The density of civilian populations in urban areas may increase the chances that even accurate attacks will injure noncombatants. In addition, the collocation of military and civilian assets in urban environments multiplies the chances that military attacks will cause unintended, and perhaps disproportionate, civilian damage. The proximity of civilian and military targets in urban environments exists in the horizontal dimension (military and civilian structures situated side by side) as well as the vertical dimension (military and civilian assets stacked one above the other, within the same structure).
Horizontal proximity of civilian and military sites raises both the possibility that an attack will accidentally hit nearby civilian buildings or the possibility that a direct hit on a military site will damage adjacent civilian ones. A primary objective for U.S. forces during the early phases of Operation Just Cause was the Panamanian Defense Force (PDF) general headquarters, the Comandancia, located in the middle of a poor Panama City neighborhood {El Chorrillo). During U.S. shelling of the headquarters and subsequent efforts to squelch sniper fire, several fires broke out and spread through nearby civilian residences, leading the human rights organization Americas Watch to conclude that "inadequate observance of the rule of proportionality resulted in unacceptable civilian deaths and destruction," 20 a conclusion disputed by other post-operation analyses. Most urban air operations were conducted with direct line-of-sight precision weapon platforms, which were more accurate than indirect-fire weapons, thereby reducing the risk and extent of collateral damage. 
21
22
Regardless of whether these targeting restrictions were strictly required from a legal standpoint, they illustrate that civilian and military sites need not be immediately adjacent to complicate decisionmaking that seeks to avoid collateral damage.  " Military Law Review, Vol. 133,1991, p. 54.  22 Most estimates put the total number of civilian deaths resulting from the Panama invasion between 220 and 300. (Parkerson, 1991, p. 55). Americas Watch (1990, p. 19) reported that the attack on La Commandancialeft about 15,000 persons homeless and resulted in 50-70 civilian deaths.
The Gulf War Al Firdos bunker incident demonstrates how proximity of military and civilian targets can operate in a vertical dimension, especially in an urban environment. On the night of February 13,  1991, U.S. F-117 strikes destroyed the bunker, a building that intelligence gatherers had identified as a command and control facility. The true nature of the facility remains disputed, but on the night it was destroyed it housed families of government officials in its upper levels; the strikes thus resulted in dozens of civilian deaths. Vertical proximity creates similar potential problems for neutralizing an urban sniper without harming civilians in rooms above or below, as well as beside, his.
The legal regime recognizes the difficulty of military decisionmaking in war. It thus obligates planners and commanders to base their decisions on information available at the time, not in perfect hindsight. The fact that civilian and military targets may be stacked on top of each other in urban environments complicates the assessment of potential civilian risk in attacking certain sites, as well as the ability, even after information is gathered, to destroy only military targets. As elaborated below, both horizontal proximity and vertical proximity of military and civilian targets present adversaries with opportunities to exploit legal and political constraints to immunize legitimate targets from attack.
Particular difficulties emerge from the collocation of civilian and military assets in urban environments when air defenses are concentrated near key targets. Not only does the emplacement of air defense systems or even the possession of hand-held anti-aircraft weapons by local forces in densely populated areas compound the problem of civilian-military asset mingling, but it can increase the chance of civilian damage resulting from air attacks on military targets, because attacking aircraft may now be forced to take evasive actions, jettison ordnance, or operate at higher altitudes. As Hays Parks has explained, "The purpose of enemy defenses is not necessarily to cause aircraft losses; the defender has accomplished his mission if he makes the attacker miss his target." 
23

"When objects are used concurrently for civilian and military purposes, they are liable to attack if there is a military advantage to be gained in their attack." U.S. Department of Defense, Conduct of the Persian Gulf War, Final Report to Congress, Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO), 1992, p. 613. 
26
However, the interconnectedness of resource systems in a modern society means that attacks against certain elements can have unexpected ripple effects. As one post-war analysis of these strikes explained: "Unfortunately, it is simply not possible to segregate the electricity that powers a hospital from 'other' electricity in the same lines that powers a biological weapons facility." 
27
28
29
As just outlined, the law of armed conflict imposes obligations on attackers and defenders to take precautions to reduce the risk of collateral damage and civilian injury. The risk of such damage from air operations may be magnified in those urban settings where military and civilian assets are collocated and difficult to distinguish. As a result, legal constraints on air operations will often be most tightly felt by planners and operators in urban environments.
These legal obligations are supplemented by an additional set of constraints on planners that are driven by political forces. Public and coalition sensitivity to friendly casualties and collateral damage often reduces operational flexibility more severely than does adherence to the international law of armed conflict. They may also push in opposite directions. For example, a requirement that U.S. groundattack aircraft fly at higher altitudes to minimize risks to crews could make it harder to identify vehicles or personnel on the ground and, under some circumstances, might lead to unintended attacks on civilians. As happened in Kosovo, flying that high resulted in misidentification of civilian-vehicle traffic as an enemy. Flying at lower altitudes might have allowed pilots to recognize the convoys as civilian, but at a much greater risk to the aircrews.
Political constraints derive from the need to maintain certain minimum levels of support for military operations among three audiences: the domestic public, the international community (most notably, the United States' major and regional allies), and the local population in the conflict area. The relative weight of these audiences' opinion on U.S. decisionmaking varies considerably with context and type of operation. For example, when vital U.S. interests are at stake, decisionmakers are less likely to adapt operations to placate international dissent; when peripheral interests are at stake, the relative importance of diplomatic backlash naturally rises and decisionmakers will tailor operations accordingly. During full-scale combat operations, the demands of the local populace will typically concern U.S. decisionmakers and planners less than they will during peacekeeping or humanitarian operations, in which perceived impartiality and maintaining consent of factional parties may be critical to success. Even when U.S. vital interests are at issue, these pressures affect strategic decisions about when and whether to conduct mili-tary operations at all, as well as operational decisions including choice of forces, weapons, and ROE.
In this section, we look at issues that affect the domestic publicsensitivity to American casualties-and the international community and local population in the conflict area-sensitivity to collateral damage and civilian suffering-as well as operational decisions.
Today, U.S. military operations are planned and conducted with high sensitivity to potential U.S. casualties. Policymakers and planners generally fear that U.S. casualties will-or at least may-erode support for sustained operations. Force protection is therefore paramount in designing operations.
Contrary to the predictions of those who saw Desert Storm as putting the Vietnam experience behind, the low American death total in the Gulf War relative to Vietnam likely raised public expectations of "bloodless" foreign policy, as well as the perception among policymakers and military planners that public expectations in this regard have risen. The further erosion of already-fragile American public support that followed the October 1993 deaths of 18 U.S. servicemen in Mogadishu suggests the strong pull that casualties can exert on U.S. policy. The extended deployment of U.S. ground forces to enforce the Dayton peace accords in the former Yugoslavia only confirms this tendency: Unlike troops of other NATO partners, U.S. troops patrol in convoys and have avoided actions likely to provoke hostile responses from local factions. 
30
31
Adversaries often view casually sensitivity as a critical element of the United States' "center of gravity": its political will to sustain operations. Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed reportedly told Robert Oakley, the U.S. special envoy to Somalia during the U.S. intervention there, "We have studied Vietnam and Lebanon and know how to get rid of Americans, by killing them so that public opinion will put an end to things."

In part because of casualty sensitivity, U.S. foreign policy also exhibits a tendency to choose military instruments such as cruise missiles or manned aircraft, which either put no U.S. personnel in harm's way or minimize the number at risk. A long-standing tenet of the "American way of war" has been a reliance on materiel over manpower, high-technology over low-tech mass.

U.S. military operations are also planned with concern for minimizing collateral damage. As with American casualties, policymakers' and the public's sensitivity to collateral damage depends on the context. On the one hand, during the Vietnam conflict, many perceived that the U.S. and South Vietnamese forces were conducting indiscriminate operations-perceptions that appeared to be validated by coverage of My Lai and other actual or alleged atrocities. These perceptions combined with the indecisiveness of the war to fuel public disaffection.

support will probably become less stable and, hence, potentially more vulnerable to unpredictable dips. Moreover, as with U.S. casualties, collateral damage is likely to undermine public support when combined with the perception that U.S. victory is unlikely. 
38
Even when the U.S. public appears willing to tolerate collateral enemy civilian injury, other members of the international community may not, and the risk of either public or international backlash is typically enough to severely constrain U.S. air operations. The added political constraints present in coalition operations are described in more detail below. But even in planning unilateral operations, the sensitivities of allies and other international actors can restrict military planning.
Often, operations must be planned with attention to minimizing enemy combatant casualties, in addition to minimizing injury to civilians. At the end of the Gulf War, near the Kuwaiti town of Al Jahra, allied aircraft destroyed hundreds of civilian and military vehicles that Iraqi forces were using to flee north. Reports of the carnage on the "highway of death" led General Colin Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to worry that the brilliant American military performance would be tarnished by images of the carnage and excessive violence against retreating forces. 39 So long as enemy forces in such situations have not signaled their surrender, they remain legally targetable. This example illustrates how other concerns can in sometimes overlay a supplemental set of tighter constraints than international law. During the planning of Operation Deliberate Force, General Bernard Janvier, Forces Commander of the United Nations Peace Forces, ex-A survey by the Pew Research Center in May 1999 suggested that public support for NATO air attacks on Yugoslavia decreased because of unintended civilian casualties, combined with public concern that the attacks were ineffective.

Powell's concerns are discussed in Atkinson, 1993, p. 453. It turned out that the "highway of death" air strikes destroyed many vehicles but killed few Iraqis (most abandoned their vehicles and fled into the desert). The images were more powerful than reality.
pressed concern to NATO planners regarding Bosnian Serb army casualties; targeting choices were therefore amended to reduce the likelihood that military personnel would be hit.

Political constraints emanating from concern over collateral damage have for the past several decades severely limited planning options during conflicts. During much of the Vietnam conflict, and in every military operation since, political and diplomatic pressures-especially those related to civilian damage and injury-have translated into restrictions on which targets could be struck from the air, as well as when and how. This is not to say that U.S. forces have always operated in accordance with the law of armed conflict. Interpretations of legal obligations and factual circumstances vary. Moreover, some political pressures push against, rather than with, the humanitarian goals of the legal regime: Whereas concern for collateral damage may caution tremendous restraint in conducting air operations, concern for force protection, military effectiveness, and even financial cost may lead planners to undervalue civilian costs to operations, arguably beyond legal bounds.

Note that the figure omits an important independent variable referenced briefly above: The United States may be willing to accept both a great risk to civilians and significant casualties if the stakes are high enough. As well, higher prospects for success are likely to increase political tolerance of casualty and civilian risks.
A key planning challenge is to select from among the politically, and legally, acceptable options while still achieving satisfactory levels of military effectiveness (and all within financial and resource limitations). Political concerns about friendly and civilian casualties impose ceilings of acceptable risk along the two featured axes. As higher levels of military effectiveness are demanded, the aperture of practicable options will become smaller.

ROE and targeting restrictions are sometimes subject to major revisions during the course of crises or conflicts. They may be modified to expand targeting options and operational flexibility. The Nixon administration was frustrated with unproductive air attacks on North Vietnam, which led it to remove many of the Johnson administration's limitations, particularly those that circumscribed urban areas.
A similar loosening of restrictions took place during NATO's Operation Allied Force, when allied governments allowed NATO planners greater leeway to attack strategic targets after initial waves of attacks failed to move Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic's regime. 
49
As operations continue, incidents or claims of excessive collateral damage can generate pressure for even tighter constraints. After the North Vietnamese accused the United States of flagrantly attacking civilian areas during December 1966 air strikes against railway targets near Hanoi, allegedly causing massive suffering, Washington responded by prohibiting attacks on all targets within 10 nautical miles of Hanoi unless specific presidential approval had been given.

These constraints would be challenging even if both sides felt their effect equally. In practice, however, it is often the case that the United States and its allies operate under these constraints while their adversaries do not. This section explores the implications of this asymmetry.
Adversaries will typically be less constrained than the United States and its allies by international legal norms. The United States generally benefits from stability and international order; its adversaries are often interested in overturning that order: "Since law is generally a conservative force, it is more likely to be observed by those more content with their lot." 54 Apart from possible differences in commitment to international norms and preservation of international law in general, some adversaries are likely to view the United States, with its vastly superior military technology, as a manipulator of the law of armed conflict for its own benefit.
Strategic setting is critical to this analysis: What is a small-scale contingency for the United States may be a major war for an adversary.
Conflict with the United States may implicate an adversary state's or regime's most vital interests and may strain its willingness to remain bound by international legal rules that, at a given time, may favor U.S. military dominance.
Uneven adherence to the law of armed conflict between the United States and adversaries provides these adversaries with manifold opportunities for strategic and tactical exploitation. Adversaries often expect that U.S. political resolve will erode as collateral damage, civilian injury, or U.S. casualties mount, especially when the most vital U.S. interests are not at stake or allied support is shaky. 
55
In adopting these techniques, adversaries hope that the potential for U.S. casualties or political backlash resulting from anticipated collateral damage will deter U.S. intervention. If the United States intervenes, these techniques aim to confront U.S. planners with a dilemma: refrain from attacking (or attack under extremely tight operational restrictions) certain targets, therefore risking degraded military effectiveness, or attack those targets effectively and risk collateral damage or perhaps higher levels of U.S. casualties. An adversary's ability to exploit constraints on U.S. operations depends on a number of factors, including the adversary's own bases of support, its strategy, and its propaganda capabilities. Autocratic, dictatorial regimes typically maintain tight control over the media. While manipulating the content of information flowing to its own population, these regimes can also influence the timing and, indirectly, the substance of information disseminated abroad by selectively permitting journalistic inspection.
The Viet Cong and North Vietnamese were both notoriously obstructive and invitingly supportive of Western television, depending on the situation. Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic displayed a similar pattern of cracking down on independent media each time crises flared with the international community. 56 During NATO's Operation Allied Force, Milosevic shut down independent newspapers and radio stations inside Yugoslavia, used state-run television to stoke nationalist reactions, electronically jammed some U.S. and NATO broadcasts intended for the Serbian populace, and prohibited the Western press from much of Kosovo (while granting it permission to film bombed sites, especially in major cities such as Belgrade andNoviSad).
To be sure, the efforts of an adversary to profit from civilian casualties often fail and may even prove counterproductive if the American and international public views the adversary leadership as being at fault. But even when adversary efforts to exploit collateral damage do not result in a tightening of the United States' self-imposed constraints, they publicly put U.S. policymakers on the defensive and may harden the resolve of adversaries who expect American political will to dissolve.
The characteristics of urban environments discussed earlier-population density, the proximity of civilian and military targets, and shared civilian-military assets-provide adversaries with many opportunities to exploit asymmetrical constraints. The potential for large civilian death or injury tolls, the ease of situating military assets near or camouflaging them among civilian assets, and the intense media scrutiny surrounding incidents of collateral damage facilitate adversary shielding tactics. Evidence from recent conflicts demonstrates the tendency of adversaries to employ such tactics, frequentiy with some success.
Adversaries often deliberately commingle civilian and military assets or persons in an effort to shield them from attack. In Somalia, U.S. and UN forces frequently encountered hostile militiamen firing from behind women and children. U.S. forces trying to aim at armed threats from the air found that militiamen took advantage of crowded streets to open fire and then disperse or blend into crowds of civilians.

In MOOTW, such as efforts to maintain order or separate local combatants, strategic demands on planners may place premium costs on destroying civilian property if doing so would inflame local popular resentment. In each of the above cases, the potential efficacy of shielding depends on the relative costs of civilian damage that each side must internalize, as well as the relative commitments of each side to international legal obligations. As pointed out earlier, human-shield tactics may backfire, particularly if viewed locally or abroad as barbaric. But some adversaries seem willing to bear that risk in the face of otherwise overwhelming U.S. military might.

In order to promote the protection of the civilian population from the effects of hostilities, combatants are obliged to distinguish themselves from the civilian population while they are engaged in an attack or in a military operation preparatory to an attack. Recognizing, however, that there are situations in armed conflicts where, owing to the nature of the hostilities an armed combatant cannot so distinguish himself, he shall retain his status as a combatant, provided that, in such situations, he carries his arms openly: 1) during each military engagement, and
Calculating proportionate military responses is especially vexing against irregular forces, because the blurred distinction between armed foes and civilian bystanders confuses determinations of threats. During a September 1993 ambush of UN forces by Somali militiamen using women and children as shields, U.S. Cobra helicopters shot into the crowd. Italy and other coalition members protested vehemently that the U.S. response was excessive, to which Major David Stockwell, the UN military spokesman, replied: "In an ambush there are no sidelines for spectators." 68
The Somalia case also illustrates that nonstate military organizations often have tremendous ability to manipulate domestic and international public opinion, even when they lack monopoly control over state infrastructure. Aideed garnered support both within and outside Somalia by exploiting civilian casualties resulting from engagements with UN forces (many of them attributable in part to Aideed's deliberate use of civilian crowds to shield his militia personnel), despite the fact that Somalia lacked high-technology communications systems for disseminating propaganda. 69
Legal norms and political pressures will constrain all U.S. military operations. Experience since the Vietnam War teaches that competing concerns offeree protection, collateral damage, and other political issues can severely restrict operational flexibility. Air planners face the daunting task of designing strategically effective operations under pressures and duties that partially negate USAF capabilities. But just as policymakers need to understand how tight restrictions they may impose on tactical and operational choices may reduce military potency, military planners need to appreciate that satisfying political and diplomatic demands may be vital to sustained support

CO "^James O. for military operations. In other words, the same restrictions that an operator views problematically as "constraining" may be critical enablers of military options at the highest strategic levels.
These legal and political constraints are tightest, and their effects most magnified, in urban environments. While striving to keep U.S. forces out of harm's way and design operations sufficiently capable of achieving strategic objectives, planners and operators must avoid unintended civilian injury. Because urban environments are characterized by dense populations and collocated or shared civilian-military assets, the range of available options that satisfy these competing objectives will often be narrow.
Lacking an equivalent degree of commitment to international norms and facing very different political, diplomatic, and strategic exigencies than the United States, adversaries are likely to exploit the asymmetrical constraints to the maximum extent possible.
Adversaries operating in urban settings will have tremendous incentive to breach their own legal obligations, hoping to capitalize on the propaganda effects of collateral damage. Furthermore, urban environments provide adversaries with convenient means to do so; the features of urban environments that already pose problems for U.S. planners also facilitate deliberate mingling or camouflaging of civilian and military targets in an effort either to shield military assets from attack or to increase the potential political or resource costs to the United States of hitting them.
An appreciation of these political constraints-from both the U.S. planner's and operator's perspective and from the adversary's-is critical to designing USAF concepts of operation. The unique capabilities of U.S. air forces, enhanced by continued technological advances in key areas, will give the USAF a key role in future urban operations across the spectrum of conflict. The USAF's contributions will be maximized by tailoring its operational concepts around the legal and political context in which its missions will arise.
Having explored the legal and political constraints associated with urban air operations, we now turn, in Chapter Four, to the challenges associated with detecting and striking targets in the urban physical environment.
To examine how urban terrain affects the requirements for demanding missions such as identifying, tracking, and targeting individual people or small groups in streets, on rooftops, or in rooms in a complex urban environment, we have divided this chapter into three main sections. The first section presents general observations on the nature of urban topography and shows how important physical characteristics of the urban environment, such as street width, building height, and wall thickness, can be used to divide a city into militarily useful Urban Terrain Zones (UTZs). It presents also some data on the proportion of overall urban areas that fall into each UTZ.
The second section examines the challenges that different UTZs present for airborne surveillance and reconnaissance and outlines how those challenges might be met. The third section looks at the difficulties associated with employing aerial weapons on urban terrain. The final section deals with airlift in urban environments.
A number of characteristics of urban terrain make it unique from a military perspective. First, and most obvious, are the man-made buildings, streets, and other structures that dominate urban terrain. These structures vary widely in size, height, type of construction, wall thickness, number and size of windows and doors, etc. However, they share certain basic characteristics that give urban terrain its most distinctive macro features.
The most striking differences between urban terrain and most natural types of terrain are the verticality and regularity of man-made structures. The following passage from a study that Richard Ellefsen led for the U.S. Navy emphasizes these differences:
What are (the) shapes and forms found in the city and how are they similar to or different from forms found in non-urban settings? Some broad similarities occur since cities, after all, are built upon a segment of natural terrain. Relief is a factor, though modified (usually reduced) by cutting and filling. Drainage must be provided (in modified form by streets and drains). Land and water interfaces are present but are often sharpened by levees and dredging. Weather and climatic extremes are modified through the absorption and reradiation of heat by building and street surfaces. Residential landscaping also reduces extremes. Precipitation may be increased by the injection of more hygroscopic nuclei into the atmosphere over a city and wind patterns are altered by buildings and street "canyons."
Special shapes and patterns result from the creation of cities. Planimetrie shapes, especially the regularity of a grid street pattern, have virtually no counterpart in nature; some geologically dictated drainage patterns vie to only a small degree. But, it is in its profile that the city differs most markedly from natural forms. The cluster of towers of a city's core is indeed symbolic of the traditional conceptual view of a city. The most significant contribution to its nonnatural character is the visual impact of the contrast between the horizontality of streets and building tops and the verticality of the building walls. Natural terrain counterparts, e.g. Devil's Tower or the Grand Canyon are few and rate special recognition. The unique character of urban terrain dramatically restricts line of sight (LOS). Imagine an observer standing on a sidewalk in the middle of a block on a straight street bordered on both sides by threestory row houses. The observer can see across the 15-25-meter-wide street and a great distance down the street. However, the observer, who is effectively at the bottom of a shallow "urban canyon," cannot see what is on the other side of the facing row of buildings. Now imagine there is a tall pole next to our observer and the observer begins to climb it. Not until the observer climbs to a height greater than the surrounding buildings do the roofs of buildings across the next street over become visible, then the upper floors, and finally the entire building faces. If the observer climbs higher still, the sidewalk and then the next street over itself will become visible.
How high the observer will have to climb to see over intervening buildings will depend on two characteristics of the urban terrain in the area: the tallness of the buildings and the distance between the buildings. The taller the surrounding buildings are, the higher the observer will have to climb to see over them. Similarly, the shorter the distance between the buildings, the higher the observer will have to climb to see over them. Figure

Note the middle building in all four views. No matter how high the observer may climb, the right-hand face of that building will not be in view, nor will that of the building on the right. In other words, it is impossible for any single observer to have LOS to all of the building faces in a city at any one time. This is an important point that we will return to in the surveillance and reconnaissance discussion in the next section. First, we turn our attention to quantifying and classifying the aspects of urban form discussed above. 
Most readers will have seen aerial photographs of large urban areas, such as Los Angeles or New York, or the cities themselves from the air while flying in commercial, military, or private aircraft. The initial impression these images provide is one of a teeming jumble of buildings of all shapes and sizes. A closer inspection (or further recollection) would show that, in fact, buildings and streets in different parts of the city are different shapes and sizes but tend to be similar in shape and size to their neighbors.
This should not be surprising, since the same economic considerations that lead a property owner to build a ten-story apartment building will lead another to do the same. The same holds true for commercial and industrial districts of a city. Furthermore, at a certain time, economic development tends to be concentrated in particular districts, so that many of the buildings in a particular area will have been constructed at roughly the same time with similar mate-rials and techniques. In addition, zoning laws in developed countries tend to reinforce these economic factors by grouping buildings according to function (residential, industrial, commercial, etc.).
These systematic differences between, and similarity within, different parts of a city make it possible to classify urban terrain into different zones according to the physical characteristics of the buildings and streets in a given area.
During the late 1970s and early 1980s, Dr. Richard Ellefsen, a geography professor at San Jose State University working as a consultant for the Naval Surface Weapons Center (now the Naval Surface Warfare Center) and Aberdeen Proving Ground, began to develop a militarily useful urban terrain classification system based on the physical characteristics and spatial patterns found in different parts of cities. He based his Urban Terrain Zones (UTZs) on extensive data on the size, height, type of construction, separation, etc. of buildings in samples of cities throughout the world. The city data were generated from painstaking examination of aerial photographs. Measurements and estimates were confirmed by visiting each city and conducting a ground survey of small portions of various areas. Obviously, to develop the detailed data required to accurately divide cities into UTZs requires a great deal of human effort, making it too expensive and time-consuming to select a large, random sample of cities for analysis. Instead, Dr. Ellefsen used his judgment to develop a strategy for selecting cities in each of his studies. 
2
Given the carefully stated criteria Dr. Ellefsen used in selecting his samples, it is probably safe to assume that conclusions based on the characteristics of these cities are fairly robust and accurately reflect the physical characteristics of most urban areas around the world.
Our confidence in the validity of conclusions based on these purposive samples was increased by two factors. First, people in cities everywhere respond in similar ways to the universal economic incentives mentioned above. Second, since the 1960s, there has been an increasing convergence, or universality, of construction techniques and materials throughout the world. 
3
In his most recent work (completed in 1999), Dr. Ellefsen has collapsed his original 16 UTZs into seven new classifications. Table

In this latest study, the following 14 cities were used in the purposive sample: Helsinki, Finland; Braunschweig, Germany; Stuttgart, Germany; Vienna, Austria; Uppsala, Sweden; Salzgitter, Germany; Bremen, Germany; Tel Aviv, Israel; Tunis, Tunisia; Colombo, Sri Lanka; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia; San Jose, Costa Rica; Panama City, Panama; and Caracas, Venezuela.

Unless otherwise noted, street width is used as shorthand for building separation in this chapter. It includes sidewalks in city centers and yards, sidewalks, open space around buildings, as well as streets in suburban and industrial areas.  With the preceding discussion of urban form as background, and before moving on to a discussion of surveillance and reconnaissance issues, it is worthwhile to take a look at how urban terrain changes the ground-based threat to air operations. The next subsection discusses some of the more salient aspects of urban air defenses.
Our analysis focuses primarily on more-limited operations, ranging from peace operations to NEOs. In these situations, the most common threat to aerospace operations stems from manportable air defense systems (MANPADS), small arms, and smaller mobile surfaceto-air-missiles (SAMs; such as SA-8s). Of these, the MANPADS threat is the most worrisome.
While it might be possible to deploy some small radar-guided SAM systems, such as the SA-8 or Crotale, within urban areas, in many instances the presence of intense near-in clutter and buildings blocking the radar's field of regard would limit those systems to a fraction of their normal capability.
Anti-aircraft artillery 20mm or larger would also be difficult for U.S. adversaries to use effectively in more limited conflicts. These weapons are very large, must be towed or vehicle-mounted, require several crewmembers, and could not take full advantage of their range unless emplaced in clear areas or on top of buildingscharacteristics that would make them easy to detect and attack before they could cause much trouble. Therefore, the primary threats facing U.S. air assets operating over urban terrain are likely to be shoulder-launched SAMs, heavy machine guns, small arms, and other infantry weapons.
MANPADS. While large numbers of small arms and machine guns can be lethal below 3,000 feet (ft), the shoulder-launched manportable air defense systems (MANPADS) pose the greatest threat. These small missiles, usually with infrared guidance, can be carried, targeted, and launched by a single person. Older systems, such as the 1960s-vintage Russian SA-7, are available in large numbers throughout most of the world. They are effective against helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft operating at altitudes as high as 10,000 to 15,000 ft and at ranges between 3 and 4 nautical miles (nmi). Over the past decade, newer, more-capable systems manufactured in Europe and the Far East, such as the French Mistral and Chinese QW-1, have been widely exported. If this trend continues, more-modern systems-with maximum effective altitudes up to 20,000 ft and vastly improved guidance systems-could become increasingly common throughout the world within a decade.
However, MANPADS are not without shortcomings. MANPADS are difficult to detect and/or attack prior to launch, because they rely on visual (as opposed to radar-guided) target detection. But this very mode of target acquisition, which relies on a single operator, sometimes assisted by a spotter, often causes MANPADS to miss targetengagement opportunities, either because operators do not see the targets while they are in range or because targets are acquired while in range but fly out of range before they can be engaged. Adversaries operating in intact cities could take advantage of emerging wireless data-transfer technologies, such as cellular phones or wireless modems linked to laptop computers, to enable a number of MANPADS teams to share target information. Alternatively, they could link a network of observers with one or more MANPADS teams.
Such a network would greatly increase MANPADS effectiveness by providing early warning of approaching targets and by allowing tar-gets detected by one team, or observers, to be engaged by another team in a better firing position. In addition, it could make the MANPADS teams even harder to detect and attack by allowing them to remain hidden on the upper floors of buildings until a target, tracked by unarmed observers around the city, entered their engagement envelope. Using advance knowledge of target location, speed, altitude, and heading, they could rapidly acquire the target and launch their missile, then disappear back inside.
MANPADS networks such as this would pose a serious threat to many USAF platforms, such as AC-130s and Predator-currently the most useful platforms in urban operations-particularly if these platforms attempted to operate at altitudes between 5,000 and 10,000 ft. At these altitudes, their sensor and weapon systems are most accurate and effective, but the platforms are also clearly visible and well within the engagement envelope of even the oldest MANPADS. Helicopters would also be extremely vulnerable to a MANPADS network such as the one described above.
6
These considerations do not mean that the low-to-medium-altitude regime will be denied to U.S. forces in every future urban military operation, particularly if advances in infrared countermeasures (IRCMs) can spoof or damage IR seekers. However, at least some of the time, these altitudes will be dangerous for manned aircraft, and it may be necessary to perform reconnaissance and surveillance using a combination of high-altitude aircraft, such as Global Hawk, and small, inexpensive unmanned platforms, such as low-altitude mini-UAVs, micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs), or unattended sensors. 7
The next section looks at individual UTZ average building height and separation in greater detail as it explores the geometry of urban surveillance and reconnaissance. It emphasizes using small, survivable UAVs, unattended ground sensors (UGS), and other methods that do not require manned platforms to be put at risk when exposed 'Research conducted by Randall Steeb and others at RAND suggests that deploying low-cost UAV decoys (6 decoys per real surveillance UAV) can significantly increase the survivability of the UAV surveillance platforms in high-threat air defense environments.
to the type of MANPADS threat just discussed. The final section of this chapter deals with the challenge of urban weapons delivery. It is concerned with venting (seeing and shooting through openings such as windows and doors), as well as building height and street width.
The alternating vertical and horizontal surfaces that dominate as the features of urban terrain present unique and difficult challenges for surveillance and reconnaissance. Unlike open, rural spaces such as rolling farmland, prairie, or desert, buildings on urban terrain block sight lines so that large sensor platforms that require a clear LOS to their targets (such as JSTARS) cannot effectively sweep huge areas, looking for moving vehicles and other targets on the ground. In addition, in many situations, day-to-day activity continues in the city and provides a dense clutter of moving people, vehicles, and electromagnetic signals that can be exploited as cover by paramilitary forces opposed to U.S. interests or operations. During Operation Allied Force, for example, Serb army units often used the mass of Kosovar Albanian refugees moving on the province's rural roads to help mask their movement, mingling their convoys with refugees. Several times, NATO aircraft bombed these intermingled groups of vehicles, causing substantial civilian casualties. Although occurring in rural settings, these incidents underscore the need for high-resolution sensors or ground observers to positively identify targets in environments where "bad actors"-whether terrorists, guerrillas, paramilitary groups, or conventional military units-are likely to be mingled with civilians or friendly troops.
Urban surveillance and reconnaissance are more demanding than surveillance and reconnaissance on most other types of terrain for two reasons. First, poor LOS and intense clutter make large cueing sensor platforms that work so well in more-open environments of much less value in an urban setting. Second, the potential for intermingled civilians, friendly forces, and adversaries-especially, but not exclusively, in limited urban operations-makes it critical to clearly identify all targets with high-resolution sensors or ground observers before attacking targets from the air.  The sensor platform can detect vehicles in a huge area, almost 10,500 square nautical miles, because there are few obstructions to block the radar signals from reaching targets out to the system's maximum range of 100 nmi. At this range, the depression angle is approximately 3°.

The difference in performance is dramatic. The sensor platform is looking for moving vehicles and must be able to see over buildings and into the city streets to do so. If we assume that traffic moving one way on a given city street is roughly as heavy as traffic moving the other way, then our sensor platform only has to be able to see half of the street to detect some movement. However, even this reducedcoverage requirement is very restricting. It means that our sensor platform must be able to view a spot on the ground just 25 m away from a 20-m-tall building. The minimum depression angle for this view is 38°, 
9
Apartment building ► -33,000 ft = 5.3 nmi 1.5 nmi 5.3 nmi Therefore, over urban terrain, the same sensor platform that performed so well over open, flat terrain is only able to monitor an area of about 19 square miles-less than two-tenths of 1 percent of the area it could monitor on open, flat terrain-and it must fly close to the city, potentially within range of SAMs, to do so. For comparison, even a moderately large city such as Stuttgart, Germany, covers about 28 square nmi. Furthermore, the platform can see an area 1.5 nmi deep and over 12 nmi wide. Such a thin strip does not match the typical shape of urban concentrations well and would make systematic surveillance even more difficult and time-consuming.
Even if we set aside the LOS problems just discussed and assume that somehow our sensor platform could get a clear view of all the city streets, our cueing problems are not solved. Detecting a large string of moving vehicles 100 nmi deep in enemy territory during a conventional conflict is extremely useful. Such a string of moving vehicles is almost always military. Knowing the number of vehicles, and their speed and direction, is of great value to friendly commanders: It allows them to anticipate an adversary's plans and even to attack the formations before they are able to reach the front.
In an urban peacekeeping mission, by contrast, being able to see all of the moving vehicles in a city is of less immediate value. The vast majority pose no threat to the peace U.S. forces have been sent to maintain. They simply represent the normal economic and social activity of the city. A very small number may carry guerrillas, arms, explosives, etc., but which moving vehicles those are will not be apparent from the radar display.
Urban Sensor-Cueing Concept. In short, a single large sensor platform is not adequate for sensor or target cueing in an urban environment. We need to think differently about how to perform sensorcueing tasks in an urban setting. Instead of a single large, long-range sensor platform, the short sight lines of urban settings require a mix of small, distributed air-and ground-based sensors to detect and track small, distributed targets in the urban clutter. The unattended ground sensors would also perform the critical task of cueing mini-UAV and other aerial sensor platforms. These sensors should take advantage of radar, seismic, acoustic, chemical, multispectral image processing (MSI), electro-optical (EO), infrared (IR), and magnetic phenomena.

as video cameras for short periods if, for example, smoke made observation from aerial platforms difficult.
The UAV relays the sensor inputs to a battle management/command and control facility. At this facility, the data are analyzed to look for human-and vehicle-traffic patterns, classify vehicles, find people carrying weapons, etc. Data from different sensors looking at the same potential target are compared to reduce false alarms. This information is then used to cue mini-UAVs flying at low altitudes. Using high-resolution EO sensors, the operators of these mini-UAVs would positively identify and track targets.
Another important use of the data collected by these sensors is to compile a longitudinal database so that human-and vehicle-traffic patterns can be established and anomalies in current traffic investigated. Changes in traffic patterns could serve as important earlywarning signals for U.S. forces, indicating that segments of the civilian population are avoiding areas they normally frequent because they have advance knowledge of ambushes, car bombs, or other violent acts. In addition, traffic-pattern analysis could serve as yet another cue for high-resolution EO sensors.
Recall that, in many peace operations, the goal is to monitor activity in open areas and detect specific threats to the normal social and economic activity of a city. A sensor network like the one described above would be a good first step toward improving the ability of aerial forces to contribute more substantially to urban missions. However, once suspicious activity has been detected, specific targets must be identified, tracked, and eventually engaged or neutralized if normal activities are to be protected. The next subsection discusses some of the challenges of identifying and tracking targets in an urban environment.
The target identification and tracking task in the urban environment is very demanding. Cities are full of moving people and vehicles. Simply seeing a group of people or a vehicle moving in the city is not enough. Once some suspicious or unusual activity is detected by the sensor cueing network described above, high-resolution EO sensors take on the critical tasks of determining what exactly is happening, whether it poses a threat, and who is involved, and then track them. To do all this, the sensor operators or target-recognition software must be able to distinguish between the following:
• Civilian vehicles of similar makes, models, and colors • A civilian construction crew repairing pipes under a roadway as opposed to guerrillas laying mines
• A plumber with a pipe as opposed to an urban guerrilla with a rifle
• An adversary soldier with an AK-47 as opposed to a friendly soldier with an M-16
• A civilian looking out a window as opposed to a guerrilla waiting in ambush.
These few examples show the kinds of subtle and demanding distinctions urban sensor operators will have to make if they are to be effective in the urban environment. They will require National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS)-9 quality imagery and intensive training in order to accomplish their demanding task.
Owing to atmospheric attenuation, weather, and other factors, sensor platforms must be below about 5,000 ft above ground level (AGL) and within 2 to 3 kilometers (km) of their targets to provide images of this quality. 
12
For a discussion of these and related issues, see Alan Vick, David T. Orletsky, John Bordeaux, and David A. Shlapak, Enhancing Air Power's Contribution Against Light Infantry Targets, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND, MR-697-AF, 1996, Chapter Three. This document also contains the following description of the NIIRS scale: "A variety of metrics is used to measure the quality of an image (e.g., ground-resolved distance). The National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale (NIIRS), developed by professional photo interpreters, is the standard used in the intelligence community. It takes into account image sharpness, contrast, and other factors, rating images on a scale from 0 to 9. For example, an image of an enemy airfield in which taxiways and runways could be distinguished would be NIIRS 1. At the other end of the scale, an image in which vehicle registration numbers (i.e., license plates) on a truck could be read would receive an NIIRS 9 rating" (p. 21, fn 16). below 4,000 ft, Predator is reasonably large, unmaneuverable, and slow-moving, making it vulnerable to a wide range of weapons at low altitude. 
13
What is needed is a smaller, quieter platform that will be invisible and inaudible at the ranges and altitudes required: a mini-or micro-UAV to serve as an urban EO sensor platform. Something between the size and capability of the two Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) mini-UAVs might work well (see Table 
4
The NRL Sender was developed to carry EO sensors, chemical-/ biological-agent detectors, or a tactical jammer. It can be recovered via a belly-skid landing but is cheap enough to be expended if necessary. The Swallow is an experimental UAV with a biological-agentdetector payload. Both UAVs have electric motors and a limited endurance of about 2 hours.
It should be possible to develop a UAV with dimensions between these two that could operate at approximately 1000 m (3,300 ft) AGL. Such a mini-UAV could be powered by a well-muffled piston engine or a rechargeable battery and electric motor. 
14
This approach has some difficulties. The first is choosing an operating altitude that would get the sensor as close to the target as possible to maximize image quality, which would require the UAV to fly as low as possible. However, flying lower increases the chance that the platform will be spotted from the ground and perhaps shot down. In addition, flying lower decreases the area in which the sensor platform has LOS to streets or building faces (see below). So, the trick is to find an altitude at which sensors have sufficient resolution, the platform is invisible and inaudible from the ground and high enough to cover the widest possible area of the city. These difficulties make it impossible for UAVs like those we have described here to accomplish some very demanding tasks, such as identifying individual people, at altitudes and distances where they have any reasonable chance of remaining covert. 
15

6
problem might be to build a large number of low-cost decoys. The decoys would have the same structure and engine as a real mini-UAV but would have no sensors, communications link, or other payload. Instead, they would simply be programmed to fly to, or orbit around, pre-selected Global Positioning System (GPS) coordinates, giving an adversary the impression that U.S. surveillance platforms were more numerous than they actually would be. This subterfuge could suppress adversary activity in the open over a much wider area than could actually be viewed at any given moment. In addition, if an adversary chose to engage the mini-UAVs with air defense weapons, many missiles would be wasted. VTOL UAVs. One possible alternative to fixed-wing UAVs would be to use vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) UAVs to identify and track targets in an urban environment. These would have the advantage of being able to hover and, if conditions permit, land on rooftops or other areas to observe stationary targets, important intersections, or buildings. However, it is not clear that they can be made quiet enough to remain covert as they land on or near occupied buildings. Moreover, unless they are built to look like a rooftop vent or some other part of a building, they may be easy to detect while perched. 
16
With a comprehensive network of cueing sensors such as the one described in the previous section, mini-UAVs like those described above could quickly investigate, identify, track, and, if necessary, designate any suspicious activity on rooftops throughout a city. In almost all cases, the mini-UAVs will have unobstructed LOS to almost any roof. 
17
Recall the example of the observer and the pole from the beginning of this chapter. The ability of airborne sensor platforms to see over buildings and into streets is affected by the same set of variables as for the observer on the pole: altitude above the ground, the height of intervening buildings, and street width. Unlike the earlier example in which observer height changed with different combinations of building height and street width, for most of this section we will keep sensor platform altitude constant at 1,000 m AGL and see how different building-height and street-width combinations affect how far the sensor can see. Before examining how these real-world combinations affect what can be seen from the air, we can get a feel for what to expect by looking at an example of a fictitious city that is made up predominantly of 100-m-square blocks, all with 15-m-wide streets and over which a sensor platform is flying at 1,000 m AGL (Figure 4.6).
Since all of the streets are the same width and our sensor platform is flying at a fixed altitude over the city, the only variable left to affect how far our UAV's sensors can see is building height. The sensors can see three-fourths of a 15-m-wide street over a 1-story building, out to about 1100 m.

The total area of Averageburg is 5,514 hectares, or 55.14 square km. 21 Table 
4
21
However, these UAV numbers are based on some unrealistic assumptions-for example, that all of the buildings and streets in each UTZ are the average height and width, and that each zone is made up of a number of areas that perfectly match the surveillance capability of our UAV for each zone. But to assume that UTZ V is made up of 14 circular areas exactiy 625 m in diameter so that only 14 surveillance UAVs are required to have LOS to rooftops or at least three-fourths of any street in the zone has little relationship to any real city.
The actual number could be either more or less than those shown. It could be more, because in any real city the shape and size of UTZs will not conform to sensor-platform capabilities as assumed here.
Inefficiencies will result, because some areas are double-covered to eliminate gaps. And it is unlikely that continuous LOS to all streets and rooftops in a city would be needed. A short delay and some gaps in coverage would enable UAVs to be moved to where they are needed at up to 100 kt (their maximum speed). We might be able to get by with far fewer UAVs covering Averageburg. The purpose of these numbers is not to accurately predict how many surveillance UAVs would be required to monitor a city but to show that, owing to the extremely steep viewing angles required-81° is the minimum average viewing angle in UTZI-aerial platforms must be almost on top of targets in UTZs I and II. Therefore, the bulk of the air and unattended ground sensor effort expended in the average city will be focused on UTZs I and II. These areas, the city core, account for only 4 percent of the land area of Averageburg but 260 of the total of 301 UAVs (86 percent) required to watch the rooftops and streets of Averageburg. The tall, closely spaced buildings in UTZ I alone require 252 UAVs, or almost 84 percent of the total. This 81° viewingangle requirement results in very short maximum sight lines for UAVs operating over this UTZ. UTZ II requires minimum viewing angles of about 57°. In contrast, the remaining 96 percent of Averageburg requires viewing angles of about 20° or less and only about 40 UAVs, or about 14 percent of the total. 
22
23
The geometry associated with attempts to view targets inside buildings from airborne sensor platforms is similar to that associated with looking at targets in the streets or on rooftops, but more complex.
In some ways the demands are less stringent. Figure 
4
The figure shows two UAVs looking over the same building. The UAV at the top is looking for targets in the street; the lower UAV is looking for targets in windows of the building on the left. The UAV looking for targets in windows can fly lower and/or farther away, because it is able to take advantage of the full street width, which allows much lower minimum viewing angles-about 22° as opposed to about 60° for UTZ V, for example-when looking at building faces rather than in the street. 
24
24
Openings. There must be an opening in the building to look through. This will most commonly be a window, and the discussion that follows assumes that it is, although it could also be an open door or any other opening in a wall. This can be a real problem in most parts of a typical city. 
25
4
UTZs IV and VII (closely and widely spaced industrial storage buildings, respectively, with only 5 percent of their wall area devoted to windows and doors, offer particularly poor prospects for interior viewing. UTZ III (attached houses near the city core) is not much better. Only 15 percent of the wall area for these buildings is devoted to windows and doors. However, Ellefsen notes that the 15-percent figure is for front and rear walls only, so the actual figure is probably closer to 7-10 percent. 
26
Both horizontal and vertical viewing angles greatly affect the perceived size of windows and other openings in buildings, a factor that is critical for two reasons. First, windows are apertures into rooms, so the size they are perceived to be directly affects how much of the room, theoretically, can be seen from an aerial platform. Second, aerial weapons often will have to enter rooms through existing openings, so a smaller perceived window (opening) size will make weapons delivery more difficult. 
27
As the observer's altitude above the window increases, so does the viewing angle. At 45°, the window appears to be only 71 percent as tall as it did at 0°. At 60° vertical viewing angle, the window appears to be only half as high as at 0°. At 75°, it seems to be only 25 percent as tall. As viewing angle increases further, perceived window size rapidly decreases, so that it is zero at 90°. 
28
29
Views. Small perceived window size is not the only problem associated with high vertical viewing angles. Interior views shift as vertical viewing angle increases. Imagine a sensor platform level with a window and directly in front of it. The sensors can see all the way to the back of the room. As the platform altitude increases, the terminus of the sensor's view shifts down the wall and onto the floor. As viewing angle continues to increase, the terminus shrinks with perceived window size and moves closer and closer to the window. At 75°, or even 60°, the sensor is sweeping only a very small area of the room within a few feet of the window. Figure 
4
The same perceived window size and interior view phenomena are at work in the horizontal dimension, making matters even worse. Figure 
4
Angles are measured from the observing UAV's perspective, with angles increasing from the horizontal (0°) to full vertical (90°).
Airborne sensors will often enjoy much more modest viewing angles to the upper floors of tall buildings, which could make them much more effective against targets, such as snipers, on the upper floors oftall buildings. One way to improve the chances UAV sensor platforms see something useful when they point their lenses at windows is to position the platforms so that they maximize their perceived window size. This could be done by avoiding azimuth and elevation combinations that result in perceived window sizes below, for example, 50 percent. With a few exceptions at low azimuths, this practice would essentially limit sensor platforms to the upper-left-hand quadrant of the various combinations of azimuth and elevation shown in Figure 
4
How do we achieve this positioning? We can maintain a particular elevation angle by flying a constant altitude, recognizing that much of the urban core cannot be seen at that angle. Horizontal angle is trickier, since it changes as the surveillance platform approaches, then passes, the target. Unless, the surveillance platform flies a 104 Aerospace Operations in Urban Environments -^.  faces. This is the limit of its capability. In order to look over buildings of five stories or more in height on 15-m-wide streets, the UAV would have to look down at an angle greater than 45°.
From the preceding discussion, we know that angles greater than 45° present increasing difficulties for surveillance of targets inside buildings; therefore, Figure 
4
No View of Building Side Closest to Platform. Another constraint on aerial sensor platforms attempting to look into buildings is that they cannot see any of the windows in the building faces on the side of the  Summary and Conclusion. In theory, for most UTZs, a sensor at 1,000 m looking at building faces can see an area at least 10 times larger than the same sensor can see when looking at streets. So, even with the doughnut-shaped sensor coverage area depicted in Figure 
4
30
Many missions will take place in intact cities. Therefore, even if the strict geometric limitations discussed above are observed, sensors will still have to contend with reflection off windows, tinted windows, shadows within rooms, and curtains and blinds that will hide much of the activity taking place behind windows within LOS. In addition, buildings in about 55 percent of a typical city's wall area will either require extreme depression angles or have 25 percent or less window area in their outer walls. Therefore, there is little promise that airborne platforms using electro-optical sensors can effectively observe building interiors in most built-up areas.
In most cases, alternative sensor platforms or other means of surveillance will be required. Unattended ground sensors, delivered either from the air or by ground personnel, are one option for getting sensors close enough to detect, identify, and designate targets inside a building. Another option is to use teams of ground personnel. Still another is to use VTOL UAVs that land on nearby buildings, observe, and then move on. Finally, mini-or micro-UAVs small enough to fly down streets at window level may be an option for some missions. These options are discussed in detail in Chapter Five.

U.S. aerospace power has greatly improved its ability to strike specific urban targets in strategic air campaigns directed at targets deep in an adversary's homeland. This is an important capability that continues to improve. However, many of the weapons that are so effective at destroying large buildings, bunkers, bridges, etc., with minimal collateral damage in such campaigns, are not suitable for attacking targets often encountered in more limited urban operations, for two primary reasons: incompatibilities between existing weapon trajectories and delivery angles dictated by the geometry of urban terrain, and the explosive yield of the vast majority of current USAF weapons, which would produce unacceptable risks of collateral damage and/or fratricide if used in many urban situations. 31
The angle at which a weapon strikes a building wall or roof is of great importance. The best angle for a weapon to strike a flat surface such as a wall or roof is 90° (perpendicular to the surface). At this angle, the kinetic energy of the weapon is concentrated on the smallest 31 Notable exceptions to this general rule are the 105mm, 40mm, and 25mm guns carried by AC-130s. Individual rounds from these weapons are accurate and (with the possible exception of the 105mm) generally have room-sized rather than the buildingsized effects typical of other aerial weapons. This makes AC-130s far more suitable for many urban targets than other USAF weapon-delivery platforms. However, the proliferation of advanced MANPADS and the vulnerability of the AC-130 to these systems may make it difficult for AC-130s to operate at altitudes where they can be both safe and effective. possible area, maximizing the possibility of penetrating the wall or roof. In addition, the velocity vector of the weapon at 90° to the target surface ensures that there is negligible chance that the weapon will glance off. It may fail to penetrate if the wall or roof is strong enough, but it will not be deflected.
Impact angles of 90° are almost impossible to achieve with air-delivered bombs against walls. While some laser-guided bombs (LGBs) can maintain level flight, or even climb, for short periods, the terminal phases of their flights are governed by the forces that affect any bomb: gravity, forward velocity at the time it was dropped, and aerodynamic drag. In general, these forces combine to cause LGBs dropped from level flight by modern U.S. fighters to fall at an angle of between 15° and 20° (relative to the ground); therefore, they impact at angles of about 70° to 75° relative to the wall. This is not really a problem, since the probability a projectile will glance off a wall does not markedly increase as long as impact angle relative to the wall is above about 60° (30° or less relative to the ground).
Attacking horizontal targets, such as roofs, at exactly 90° with LGBs is also very difficult, but for different reasons. Many LGB guidance systems contain small auto-pilots that use inputs from gyroscopes and the laser seeker to control movement of the bomb's canard control fins. If the bomb's attitude is too close to vertical the gyroscopes tend to tumble, sending erroneous inputs to the auto-pilot, which, in turn, sends erroneous inputs to the control fins, sending the bomb out of control. To avoid this and still allow the bomb some freedom to make downward corrections, the maximum dive angle for most LGBs is about 60°.

The figure systematically underestimates the ability of 17° bomb deliveries to hit city walls. To maximize the delivery angle required to hit a target for each combination of building height and street width, the estimates assume airborne attackers are always shooting at targets on the lowest floors of buildings. If delivery angle is greater than 17°, the figure assumes a 17° delivery cannot hit any of the walls in a given UTZ. Deliveries of 17° could probably be used successfully against targets on the upper floors of buildings in many situations where the figure assumes they cannot. The same bias exists for 30° and 60° delivery calculations, but it is smaller. At these angles, even with this conservative estimation method, over 90 percent of the wall area of a typical city is vulnerable to attack. increases the chances that a weapon will be deflected off the structure's walls and land in the street. In addition, even if a weapon penetrates the wall on a 60° trajectory, the weapon's steep angle means that it will be much more likely to penetrate the floor of the room it was aimed at, increasing the chances of killing innocent people or friendly troops below. This brings us to the issue of weapon effects, which are discussed in the next section.
However, before moving on to that discussion, it is worth noting that the areas that cannot be attacked with 30° or even 60° weapondelivery angles are the same city-core areas (UTZs I and II) in which aerial surveillance and reconnaissance are so difficult. As with surveillance and reconnaissance, these relatively small, but important, areas of cities demand new and different approaches to weapon delivery. Several potential operational concepts for delivering weapons deep into urban canyons are described in Chapter Five.
Weapon-delivery geometry is the first problem in delivering weapons against urban targets. The second problem is that the vast majority of weapons in the USAF inventory were designed to destroy entire buildings or armored vehicles, not produce limited effects in a single room. Their kinetic energy, blast, fragmentation, and other terminal effects are far in excess of what is required or advisable for many urban targets. Table 
4
The table makes it clear that the vast majority of USAF weapons are unsuitable when the situation requires that lethal effects be limited to a room or other small area. For example, the smallest standard
LGB available to USAF fighter crews is the GBU-12, which uses a standard Mk-82 500-lb bomb as its warhead. If guided by a laser designator on a surveillance UAV or deployed with a ground team, this weapon can be very accurate. 
33
Only three currently available USAF weapons fit into the room-sizedeffects category. One of them, the Low-Cost Autonomous Attack

The USAF does have a few guided weapons with much smaller warheads than the GBU-12. For example, the USAF has a laser-guided training round. As the name suggests, the chief purpose of this device is to help teach fighter crews how to drop LGBs without expending expensive live munitions. The training round consists of a metal tube about 4 in. in diameter and 6 ft long, with a laser seeker, guidance RANDMmT87-4.T4 Figure 4.14-Large USAF Warheads Make Damage Limitation Difficult for Many Urban Targets and control unit, control fins attached to the front, and fins at the rear. It is possible to attach a small warhead to the back of the training round to give some explosive punch. The impact of this weapon is far less than that of a GBU-12; however, because it is designed to mimic its larger brethren, it arrives at the target moving near the speed of sound. An object weighing the better part of 100 lb moving at this speed has more than enough kinetic energy to smash through floors and walls or the rooms at which it is aimed.

Although this report focuses on sensor and shooter challenges in the urban setting, we do want to acknowledge the importance of airlift in the urban environment and the difficulties airlifters can face.
Fixed-wing airlifters, such as C-17s, C-5s, or C-130s, face a number of challenges. The airfield itself may be damaged by the fighting, limiting the availability of runway lighting, navigation aids, and support equipment. As the USAF experienced in Sarajevo and Mogadishu, mortars, artillery, heavy machine guns, and snipers all pose a threat to aircraft, support personnel, and passengers when the aircraft are on the ground. On approach and takeoff, small arms, machine guns, anti-aircraft artillery (AAA), and manportable surface-to-air missiles in the surrounding area threaten aircraft. There are few good counters to these threats. Friendly ground forces can help by controlling some of the approach and takeoff terrain and the more-prominent structures around an airfield, and IR countermeasures on the aircraft help some. However, at times, urban airfield operations may simply have to be shut down in the face of the more severe threats.
Airdrop operations can take the place of some airfield deliveries, but the lack of large open areas, air defense threats, and the presence of civilians or adversary military personnel will hamper them. The lack of large areas means that airdrops must be spread out over multiple passes or that some loads risk landing in woods, on buildings, or elsewhere in the city. The presence of civilians means that innocent people might be hurt by errant loads and, along with adversary personnel, pose the problem of the airdropped material falling into the wrong hands. GPS-guided parafoils or higher-speed delivery concepts (see Chapter Five) have the potential to increase the accuracy of airdrops in urban settings, avoiding these problems.
Rotary-wing aircraft are key to U.S. Army and Marine doctrine for urban operations and are relied on by all services to move personnel and resupply. Their primary problem is survivability, since they fly low and fairly slowly, making them vulnerable to small arms, AAA, and MANPADS. Although IR countermeasures provide some protection, new concepts will be necessary if rotary-wing aircraft are to survive on the urban battlefield. Optical dazzling devices, smoke, and acoustic nonlethal weapons are a few of the possible protective options that might disable opponents long enough for rotary-wing aircraft to land, take off, and leave the area. Other challenges faced by rotary-wing aircraft include city lights washing out night-visiongoggle visibility; dust kicked up during hover, producing zero visibility; obstructions to low-level flight (powerlines, towers, buildings); and debris kicked up by rotor wash. Three-dimensional maps and GPS pseudolites, discussed in Chapters Five and Six, have the potential to allow rotary-wing pilots to safely navigate between buildings when dust limits visibility.
These and related issues are complex and important and deserve detailed treatment in future studies.
The three main sections of this chapter presented information on urban form and how physical characteristics of the urban environment can be used to divide cities into militarily useful UTZs. In addition, the chapter analyzed how the physical characteristics of the various UTZs enhance or negate the ability of aerial platforms to conduct surveillance and reconnaissance missions and to deliver weapons. The information presented in this chapter leads to the following conclusions:
• Over 90 percent of urban land area is covered with buildings less than 20 m (about 6 stories) in height.
• Short sight lines and resulting increased depression angles relative to operations on flat, open terrain greatly restrict the capability of long-range sensor platforms to provide adequate targeting information on urban terrain.
-A new surveillance and reconnaissance concept emphasizing unattended ground sensors for cueing and mini-or micro-UAVs carrying EO sensors for identification and tracking is required in the urban environment.
-Developing the technology, tactics, techniques, and procedures to effectively monitor urban areas with a combination of air and ground sensors will require extensive experimentation, simulation, and modeling efforts.
• There is little promise that traditional airborne platforms can effectively observe building interiors in most built-up areas.
• Outside of the city core, standard weapon-delivery trajectories can be used to attack targets in streets and almost all buildings.
• In the geographically small but important city core:
-Sight lines are so short that aerial surveillance and reconnaissance of lower floors of buildings and ground targets is extremely difficult and resource-intensive.
-Extreme delivery angles prohibit use of most current weapons to attack targets where room-sized effects are desired.
-New concepts are required to track and attack targets in the city core.
• Current USAF weapons are too powerful for many situations, even when delivery geometry would allow attacks.
-New limited-effects munitions, delivery modes, and targetdesignation techniques are required to limit the probability of collateral damage and/or fratricide.
As noted earlier, it is our judgment that most urban operations will fall at the lower end of the spectrum of conflict. Although there are improvements that the USAF can make in its ability to conduct urban operations against conventional foes, we see the major shortcomings as being in the ability to detect and attack unconventional foes.
It may be possible in future limited operations to identify and attack critical adversary centers of gravity or key nodes. However, historical experience suggests that this possibility will be the exception, not the rule. Rather, in most limited operations, strategic objectives are more likely to be achieved through the cumulative effect of persistent surveillance and strike than through the destruction of a small target set.
For example, in a notional peace operation that included an urban component, U.S. objectives might be to stop the violence, resetüe the population, and achieve a return to normal in which routine civil and economic activities could take place without disruption. To accomplish these objectives would require, above all else, that friendly forces control the streets. The operational task of controlling the streets would, in turn, require that a variety of tactical tasks be accomplished. Among the more prominent tasks 1 are the following:
• Stop movement of combatants, vehicles, equipment.
• Provide rapid, high-resolution imagery for target ID.
• Detect and neutralize adversary ambush positions.
• Detect and neutralize snipers.
• Monitor high-priority targets.
• Resupply isolated friendly ground forces.
• Provide close support to friendly ground forces.
The most robust solution to any of these tasks involves the combination of air and ground elements working in harmony. As we look to the future, unmanned ground-sensor networks may be able to reduce the number of ground personnel put at risk, just as unmanned air vehicles are doing for air operations. Nevertheless, it will likely always be the case that it is better to have some personnel on the ground to supplement unmanned ground sensors. This chapter presents new concepts of operation to accomplish the above tasks. For each task, we discuss the nature of the challenge, then suggest a new concept of operation to accomplish it.
Peace operations often require that friendly forces control the city's streets. The amount of control may vary by situation; at the least, militias, irregulars, and various combatant forces must be denied the
We also believe that the detection and neutralization of adversary manportable surface-to-air missiles will become increasingly important as more-advanced versions of these proliferate. These weapons could seriously impede all urban air operations, both rotary and fixed wing. A related task is the insertion and extraction of personnel, equipment, and supplies in the urban environment. MANPADS, AAA, heavy machine guns, and small arms are all capable of downing rotary-wing aircraft. It would be valuable to have counters to these common weapons or alternative means to move personnel, equipment, and supplies. As the October 1993 shootdown of U.S. Army helicopters in Mogadishu, Somalia, showed, even simple weapons (in this case, RPGs) can down aircraft that are flying low and slow.
New Concepts for Accomplishing Key Tasks in Urban Operations 121 freedom to mass, move, and operate, whether on foot, in modified civilian vehicles, or in armored vehicles.
For operations in which the control of the city is contested, it is vital that adversary forces not be allowed to act as a governing force (e.g., collecting taxes, arresting people, patrolling with visible weapons). Such activities undermine the legitimacy and credibility of the local government the United States is supporting and present the adversary force as an alternative. U.S. forces may not always be able to prevent adversary forces from moving covertly, but they can readily detect and stop overt operations (roadblocks, weapons displays, vehicle convoys).
Not confined to peace operations only, detecting and stopping combatant movement may be necessary in noncombatant evacuation operations, hostage rescues, and other special operations. A traditional approach to this problem would put friendly ground forces throughout the city, manning observation posts and roadblocks, patrolling, and generally making it difficult for adversary forces to move without detection.
Both ground sensor networks and airborne platforms have the potential to reduce the manpower demands and risks to friendly forces associated with these operations. Although friendly ground forces are likely to still be required, they could be more effective if cued to problem areas by unmanned sensors. In some cases, such as a NEO or hostage rescue, airborne platforms (e.g., an AC-130) might operate independently to detect and interdict hostile forces. In Bosnia, JSTARS aircraft accomplished the surveillance task in rural areas by ensuring that the Bosnian, Serb, and Croatian forces lived up to the terms of the Daytön Agreement and kept their armored and other combat vehicles in holding areas. In some urban situations, JSTARS may have a role to play also; however, in urban core areas, building shadows and the commingling of adversary vehicles with civilian traffic (e.g., as Somali "technicals" 2 were) will make it difficult to monitor vehicle movement, and JSTARS is unlikely to be able to distinguish between them. In our judgment, a distributed sensor system ^Technicals were pickup trucks and jeeps with machine guns mounted on the back. will be necessary to detect combatant movement under these conditions.
A distributed sensor system could combine imaging and nonimaging sensors on both air and ground platforms. The imaging sensors would look for military vehicles, "technicals," and other, more-overt displays of weapons. Non-imaging sensors would look for hidden weapons or explosives or use pattern analysis to detect anomalous vehicle or personnel movements. Initially, these sensors could supplement ground-force monitoring in the more dangerous or problematic parts of the city.
If unmanned ground sensors prove to be effective and some of the more exotic technologies become cheap and reliable, sensors could be placed throughout much of the city. These sensors would alert a weapon controller, who would then direct airborne sensors or ground patrols to take a closer look. When adversary ground forces could be clearly identified (e.g., massing at a militia leader's compound as they did in Mogadishu), airborne strike platforms could be used to destroy them; or ground forces could be alerted to investigate further.
In this more-ambitious vision, the role of ground forces shifts to that of quick-reaction force for situations where a person on the ground is needed because of problems with target identification or because combatants are too intermingled with noncombatants for attack with standoff weapons. This concept might allow for a reduction in the number of required ground forces; if a small number were deployed, they would need some means to move quickly to the site of the problem. One advantage that ground forces have over most airborne platforms is their ability to detect and fire on fleeting targets. The longer the time of flight of the weapon, the harder it is to engage targets moving quickly in and out of cover. 
As the USAF discovered in Kosovo, from medium altitudes it is often impossible to distinguish between various types of vehicles or between adversary and friendly dismounted personnel. To aid in situations in which ground observers are not available to assist in target ID, it would be enormously useful if combat aircraft (whether E-16s or AC-130s) had access to offboard sensors flying at lower altitudes. If Predator or other UAVs are on-station, they may be available for this role. However, the limited number of such platforms and concern about their survivability at lower altitudes may mean that combat aircraft cannot always count on UAV assistance.
In addition to these surveillance platforms, we propose the development of a set of air-launched disposable sensors for target ID in urgent situations. It would be possible for the parent platform, either a fighter, AC-130, or larger UAV, to drop a miniature glider with a small, low-light-level TV camera, GPS receiver, auto-pilot, and data link. The mini-glider could be folded into a container until deployed. However, a system like this would take many minutes to glide down from 15,000 or 20,000 ft to low altitudes-less than 500 ft-where its camera could provide the high-resolution images necessary for target identification. During that time, many things could happen. For example, the target could move away or, in an urban environment, move into a building. Therefore, it is important that any disposable identification sensor arrive at low altitude near the target very quickly.
One possibility would be for an F-16 or other fighter aircraft to carry a mini-UAV in a canister on one of the wing weapon stations. When the F-16 detected a situation requiring target ID and some endurance was desired, the UAV canister would be released and fall quickly to lower altitudes. A drogue chute would slow the canister and, at a few thousand feet altitude, a folding-wing UAV would be deployed. That UAV would fly at low altitudes, providing imagery back to the friendly aircraft for up to a few hours to allow confident target identification, attack, and battlefield damage assessment (BDA) or, as in the Kosovo example, to avoid accidental attacks on civilians. This kind of endurance over the target would often exceed that of the fighter deploying the UAV and would allow a UAV deployed by one fighter to provide imagery to its replacement onstation.
Another possibility is to build a container for the sensor package. The container would be shaped like a lifting body, with small control surfaces. 
3
tude, but would generate enough lift to allow it to maneuver to coordinates anywhere within a few miles of the launch aircraft. However, a shape that is well adapted to rapidly maneuvering to a given set of GPS coordinates at low altitude is poorly suited for taking even a brief close-in look at whatever may be of interest there. It would not be capable of maintaining level flight or circling a target at close range without rapidly depleting its airspeed, which would result in an almost equally rapid aerodynamic stall and crash.
Therefore, we envision the lifting body deploying a small, controllable parafoil as it passes about 1,000 ft AGL. By the time it reaches 500 ft AGL, the parafoil should be fully unfurled, slowing the container. At about this altitude, it would begin a slow spiral around the GPS coordinates of interest. The diameter of the circle might be selectable before launch to allow the operator to tailor the resulting view, somewhat, to the suspected target and environmental conditions. Something as simple as "Near," "Medium," and "Far" circle diameters (determined through empirical tests during sensor development) might be sufficient.
The container could be suspended so that the camera looks to the inside of the descending turn. In its simplest form, a system like this would just continue to fly descending circles about the target coordinates, sending back images to its parent craft all the while, until it hit the ground. More-sophisticated versions might allow operators to steer the parafoil to change the camera's azimuth view and include some means of controlling camera elevation view. These more complicated schemes would probably require a human to control the expendable camera once the parafoil deployed. This might make them more appropriate for multi-place (i.e., two or more crewmembers) aircraft or large UAVs, such as F-15Es, AC-130s, or Predator, so that crewmembers or operators can dedicate their full attention to operating the expendable camera for a short time. However, the simpler autonomous version would still be a valuable target-identification tool for single-seat fighter or attack aircraft operating at medium altitude.
In Figure 
5
High-resolution low-light TV or IR images are relayed back to the AC-130. The parafoil can spiral all the way down onto hostile forces or can carry the camera clear of them. Either way, very high-resolution images should be obtainable as the parafoil passes below 500 ft, perhaps passing tens of feet over the target. The AC-130 by this point has made the determination that the people are in fact hostile forces being resupplied and attacks them with 40mm or 105mm rounds. Such a capability would be enormously valuable in a host of situations in both rural and urban terrain. As advanced MANPADS proliferate around the world, it is likely that manned platforms will increasingly avoid loitering at lower and medium altitudes near threat forces. Air-deployable offboard sensors would give combat aircraft all the surveillance advantages of loitering with none of the attendant New Concepts for Accomplishing Key Tasks in Urban Operations 127 risks and many of the capabilities of more-expensive surveillance platforms in a package they control.
The ambush is a common technique that adversary forces are likely to use against friendly forces. Although their size and the type of weapon used can vary, classic infantry ambushes involve a small unit (squad or platoon) surreptitiously taking up hidden positions (often under cover of darkness) and waiting for an adversary patrol, convoy, civilian vehicles, or other targets to enter the kill zone. The ambushers use assault rifles, machine guns, antitank weapons, grenades, and mines to create a horrific volume of fire, often at very close range, against the victims. Careful siting of weapons is used to put fire down and across the road or trail so that there is no cover for the ambushed force. The suddenness and volume of fire can wipe out a patrol in seconds. The ambushers may take weapons and intelligence materials off the bodies or simply cease fire and leave.
If the ambush is badly sited or executed, adversary forces may be able to return fire and maneuver against the ambushers, particularly in ambushes against forces that are too large to be contained entirely within the kill zone. In those cases, the forces not in the kill zone are likely to maneuver around the flanks of the ambushers to bring fire on their positions and to cut off their escape. Also, nearby forces may come to the aid of those caught in the ambush. To avoid these dangers, ambushers do not linger. A well-executed ambush may be over in under a minute and rarely extends to more than a few minutes.
Weak forces may use ambushes to maintain the initiative, control territory, demoralize adversary forces, or gather intelligence (from maps, radio codes, and other operational information taken from the bodies of ambush victims). In an urban setting, adversaries may use ambushes to inflict heavy casualties and, thereby, so intimidate friendly forces that they are afraid to patrol particular sectors of the city. These areas could then come under the de facto control of, for example, insurgent forces or criminal elements. Alternatively, adversaries may seek to inflict casualties, on a peacekeeping force for example, as a way of undermining international support for the inter-vention. Since patrolling is essential in many operations, U.S. forces need to find ways to better protect small units from ambushes.
Ideally, we would like to be able to detect and neutralize ambushes from standoff. As the above discussion illustrated, there are four components to an ambush: movement to the site, hiding at the site, the ambush itself, and escape. In urban operations, the ambushers may move to the site overtly; however, in the kind of operations we envision predominating, they probably will move in a more covert way. Thus, visual observation will probably not allow them to be singled out from the background civilian traffic. One exception would be if they attempt to move covertly at night but are detected by airborne or ground-based low-light TV or IR sensors. Even if their weapons were hidden, their movement could stand out if the streets were deserted and they were moving in rushes to minimize visibility from street observers. Also, environment-shaping measures such as curfews can help by making any activity at certain times or places suspicious. Alternatively, unmanned ground sensors might detect the ambusher's body heat, weapons, or explosives if the ambushers passed by them. This would require either a large network of sensors or careful siting to maximize the probability of the ambushers passing by the sensors. 
4
For this reason, ambush detection will need to be focused on specific streets or buildings for specific periods of time. For example, each foot or vehicle patrol could have an unmanned sensor platform (ground or air) precede it in search of suspicious activity, which would focus the sensor on the area of primary concern to the patrol and at the critical time. Such a platform could be controlled either by the patrol leader or at a rear command post. To the extent that moreexotic sensors such as chemical sniffers (to detect ammunition and explosives), weapon-detecting radars, etc. become feasible, this platform might be able to detect the actual ambush positions. The positions might also be detectable by IR, visual, or multispectral sensors.
If the ambushers are hiding inside of buildings (probably just below or beside windows), they will be very difficult to detect, requiring more-intrusive approaches. These approaches might include riflelaunched sensors that would fly through a window and attach to a wall, micro-UAVs doing essentially the same thing, or perhaps sensors that could be rolled or thrown into a room. Sometimes, adversary forces will be able to set up an urban ambush without local civilians detecting it; other times, locals will be aware of the ambush because it is being set up in the building they live or work in. To the extent that local civilians are at odds with the adversary force, they may warn authorities of the ambush. Even when the locals are supporters, perhaps even involved in helping set up the ambush, they may take steps to protect themselves or family members, or otherwise engage in nonroutine behavior that can be observed.
An experienced operator (either a member of the patrol or rear-area sensor operator) may detect changes in the social and physical landscape that suggest there is something wrong, although he cannot see the actual ambushers. For example, an infantry patrol leader might notice changes in people's behavior, number or location of vehicles, whether shop windows or doors are open or closed, presence or ab-sence of children, dogs barking, unusual silence, or other signs that would indicate danger. The more experience the patrol has with a particular patrol route, the more likely they will be to detect such changes. Many combat infantrymen and policemen have reported detecting such anomalies and being saved from imminent attack, sometimes without being conscious of what exactly is wrong with the picture. Unfortunately, these signs are not always clear and the patrol may not detect them until it is too late.
Rather, what we need is a way to observe these patterns safely from standoff and in a more systematic and reliable way. The UAVs discussed above could be used to extend the vision of the patrol or other observer. Using experience or a database of photos taken at similar times and days of the week, the patrol or observer could compare the current picture with the baseline. There is some danger that the appearance of an unmanned platform would be recognized by adversaries as a precursor to the arrival of the patrol, but this seems a small price to pay for the increased security. Also, there are a variety of techniques that could be used to make the UAV more covert.
An alternative method (illustrated in Figure 
5
From a force-protection perspective, it would be best to have both the wide-, or at least wider, area surveillance associated with the ground sensors and a small UAV (perhaps even multiple UAVs) providing imagery and other data directly to the patrol.
This Monday 4 PM
Snipers are a perennial problem in urban military operations. Threatening civilians and military personnel alike, snipers can shut down civil activities, hurt morale, cause politically significant casualties, perhaps even stop a NEO from an urban embassy. Snipers armed with the increasingly popular .50-caliber rifle (using incendiary or armor-piercing bullets) can threaten lightly armored vehicles and hovering or landing helicopters.
For our purposes, a sniper is a single combatant (sometimes teamed with an observer) who selectively engages targets from a location that offers superior fields of view. He may be a specially trained sniper, a regular infantryman, or a civilian irregular.
An untrained sniper may fire from a balcony, rooftop, or window with a standard assault rifle such as an AK-47, using either the weapon's iron sight or a scope. Most sniper casualties in recent civil conflicts (e.g., in Bosnia and Somalia) were probably the work of untrained snipers, either irregulars or soldiers with only basic marksmanship training. U.S. forces encountering such snipers during operations in Somalia found that countersniper teams flying in helicopters or on the ground were able to routinely detect and dispatch these threats because the snipers failed to use cover or tended to fire too many times from one location.

The U.S. practice, for both police and military snipers, is for snipers to operate in pairs, rotating between shooter and observer duties. The observer uses a spotting scope to help adjust fire and provides security. He typically is armed with a semi-automatic weapon. Adversary snipers may operate as individuals or in pairs. Finally, the professional sniper will take only a few shots from his position before Tony Capaccio, "U.S. Snipers Enforced Peace Through Gun Barrels," Defense Week, January 31,1994, p.

There are three situations in which U.S. forces are likely to need to counter snipers:
• The first is in the defense of U.S. or allied facilities or groundforce positions. U.S. embassies, air bases, airports, ports, barracks, allied governmental buildings, television, or other public facilities might come under attack from snipers. At best, such attacks are a nuisance; at worst, they have the potential to cause serious loss of life or damage to high-value assets such as parked aircraft.
• A second situation is when friendly patrols come under sniper fire. Routine sniper attacks on patrols could seriously disrupt their ability to interact with the local populace, observe activities, and collect intelligence. Force-protection concerns could limit patrol frequency, locations, and duration; undermine morale; and cause the patrols to be so defensive that they were ineffective in their primary mission.
• Third, civilian populations can be harassed and intimidated through sniper attacks on foot traffic, marketplaces, parks, and other places where civilians congregate. For example, during the Bosnian civil war, Serbs in the suburban hills surrounding Sarajevo routinely fired into the center of Sarajevo, particularly down "Sniper's Alley," a road near the Holiday Inn.
U.S. forces have traditionally used their own snipers to stalk and kill adversary snipers. 
10
To supplement infantry countersniper teams and allow them to focus on priority missions, DoD has been exploring other countersniper concepts. Acoustic, radar, passive IR, and scanning lasers have all been tested for their applicability against snipers. The Stingray scanning laser system on the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, for example, can be used to detect sniper optics (telescopes or nightvision devices) and alert the gunner; in automatic mode, it can engage and neutralize optics. 
11
5
For fixed facilities and known problem areas, unmanned ground sensors would be deployed by ground forces or air. 
12
In our concept, we use an unmanned sensor equipped with a scanning laser, laser designator, 
13
14
To deter random sniper attacks on civilians or attacks on friendly patrols, we propose supplementing the fixed sensors with a passive IR system like Lawrence Livermore's Lifeguard system, on a UAV. The UAV would also be equipped with an EO/IR camera, concentriccoded laser 15 ' 16 designator, and mini-glide bombs with small warheads. When the passive IR sensor detects a hot bullet against the cooler background of the air, it uses a ballistic model to backtrack to the firing location. Separate calculations are done for each bullet fired, enabling the sniper's location to be determined with sufficient accuracy for counterfire. When used in the fixed ground mode in the line of fire, the Lifeguard system slews a camera to the sniper location, allowing a friendly sniper or other weapon operator to engage.
For an airborne platform it is possible that the sensor would have line of sight to the bullet in flight, but not to the firing location, which might be blocked by another building. Thus, slewing a camera to the sniper will not always be possible. Rather, the UAV fire-control computer would need access to the 3-D city database so that the ballistic track could be compared and the likely firing location determined. 17 If it were not already in a position with line of sight to the sniper's location, the UAV would maneuver so that it was. The EO/IR camera A circular laser puts energy around the window but not on it. The weapons would be programmed to fly through the middle of the laser circle. Concentric-coded lasers would put several laser rings around the target, using different frequencies of lasers to convey information about target location to the weapon. 1 fi As noted in Chapter Four, one problem with laser designation in urban environments is that the laser energy may reflect off window glass or, where windows are missing, go into a structure but not reflect enough energy out to guide a weapon. One possible solution would be to put laser energy on less-reflective surfaces around the window, perhaps in concentric circles. The simplest near-term concentric coding might involve a purely spatial code that could be traced using technology similar to that employed in laser light shows. For example, the pattern closest to the target might be two nearly concentric circles with slightly offset centers, so that the distance between them appears to be larger at the top of the circles than at the bottom. As the seeker scans across the pattern, the amount of separation would indicate whether the seeker is approaching high or low but, also, by virtue of the number of circles, would indicate the distance to the target. In the future, a more advanced laser could be used to provide similar data by varying the laser frequency or by modulating the laser signal.
A simple algorithm could rule out interior spaces and windows on the far sides of buildings, identifying the most likely firing position along the ballistic track.
New Concepts for Accomplishing Key Tasks in Urban Operations 137 would then be directed at the sniper location so that the controller could put eyes on target before releasing a weapon.
At this point, a mini-glide bomb

In addition to more-general surveillance requirements, urban operations-particularly counterterrorist, counterdrug or WMDrelated-may require continuous monitoring of a building or fairly small area. There may be a need to observe or listen to activities in a particular room; to monitor personnel, equipment, or vehicles entering or leaving a building; or to otherwise observe activities at a town square, park, or other fixed site.
Most of the time, AC-130s, Predators, and other existing platforms using EO, IR, or radar sensors have sufficient resolution to accomplish these missions covertly
22
Mini-and micro-UAVs (with wingspans from 8 ft or so down to bird size) have much utility in urban settings. They can fly down into urban canyons, thereby gaining excellent viewing angles through windows and of streets, alleyways, and other narrow passageways. However, it does not appear that they can conduct enduring covert surveillance with EO or IR sensors. The problem is the mismatch between what the UAV needs to do to monitor the site and what a human observer at the site needs to do to detect the UAV. The UAV sensor would need resolution on the order of inches to identify specific individuals or very small packages. To get this resolution requires that the UAV either carry a camera with a long-focal-length lens or get very close to the target.
In exploring various combinations of UAV size, associated payload, and sensor range, we could not find one that would allow the UAV to get sufficiently close to identify a human and still remain undetectable to the adversary observer. For example, a typical slow-flying UAV with a wingspan of 8 ft can carry roughly a 5-lb payload. A standard 5-lb optical-sensor package has sufficient resolution to identify a specific person (e.g., Osama bin Laden as opposed to Saddam Hussein) in daylight at a distance of about 1,400 ft. 
23
Alternatively, we could use micro-UAVs, insectoids, or a collection of ground sensors on nearby buildings to avoid detection. Micro-UAVs or insectoids (either flying, hopping, or crawling) would use their small size to get extremely close to or inside a target building. Once on or in the building, they might attach themselves to a wall and observe. Such sensors and platforms are being explored at Los Alamos and other laboratories, but a host of aerodynamic, power-supply, navigation, and communication challenges need to be overcome before they have much operational utility. These systems offer promise for some high-priority, specialized surveillance missions; however we view them as being unlikely to be practical for routine surveillance missions in the near term.
The only enduring, high-resolution covert sensor that is practical in the near term is either an unmanned ground sensor or a ground observation team. Even with these alternatives, there is some chance of discovery upon insertion or at some later point. Inserting ground sensors covertly is tricky and requires either ground personnel (perhaps disguised as maintenance workers) or a precise and quiet airborne mode. Also in cases where enduring surveillance is required, ground sensors may fail and have to be replaced and ground observers must be rotated or resupplied.
In our concept, we envision deploying miniaturized ground sensors by VTOL UAV.

Sensor raises telescopic arm to observe target Sensor crawls to VTOL UAV hovers surveillance locati and drops sensor ^^ to visit the rooftop, the sensor housing would need to be designed to blend in with the surroundings, masquerading as a piece of electrical equipment or other cultural artifact. Alternatively, sensors might be designed for emplacement on walls or other hard-to-reach places. In these cases, they also would need to be designed to blend in with the surroundings.
As Figure 
5
Another possibility would use a medium-altitude UAV to provide interim coverage until the VTOL UAV was able to take over, although lines of sight to the target would be sporadic in urban-core areas, particularly if the target made many turns.
The most robust concept would use some combination of ground personnel (on foot and in vehicles), unmanned ground sensors, and airborne platforms. USAF and joint exercises (as well as many years of law-enforcement experience) using airborne platforms and ground personnel have shown this to be a highly effective way to covertly follow vehicles.
During urban operations, friendly ground forces may become isolated and need resupply from the air. We specify urban operations, because isolation is much more likely to happen in urban settings because of the difficulty of preventing adversary infiltration of friendly lines. Also, friendly patrols or special operations forces often will be operating in contested or adversary-controlled terrain. In many cases, adversary roadblocks, downed bridges, or rubble in roads will mean that such forces cannot be resupplied via ground routes.
This is exactly what happened to Task Force Ranger in Mogadishu when the operation went awry. Unable to withdraw or be reinforced by ground, the task force-in desperate need of ammunition, intravenous fluid bags (IVs), water, and other supplies-found shelter in a few small buildings. One helicopter did manage to hover over one friendly group and drop some supplies, but it was so badly shot up in the process that it barely made it back to the airport. No other attempts were made. 
25
In the concept illustrated in Figure 
5
Basic engineering and field tests will have to be done to determine the feasibility of this concept. However, the combination of shockprotected compartments, air bags, and a drogue chute should allow precision resupply in urban settings. 
As noted above, it is easy for small ground forces to become isolated in urban settings. Urban structures limit both visibility and fields of fire, horizontally and vertically, making it difficult for ground forces to provide mutually supporting fire. Traditional fire support from artillery is often limited in urban areas because of its low-angle trajectory. Mortars, which fire at much steeper angles, are better able to get over buildings. However, both mortars and artillery are insufficiently accurate to use in situations where collateral damage must be minimized. Air forces can provide immediate and accurate fire support to friendly ground forces engaged in close combat. The GPS coordinates of the adversary force are relayed, along with their fire-support request, to a friendly command facility. The controller enters the GPS coordinates into a 3-D map/urban database and receives basic information about the building. From this, the controller learns that the adversary force is firing from an apartment building occupied by noncombatants. Under these conditions, strict ROE must be observed to minimize civilian casualties. A controller directs a friendly aircraft equipped with armed mini-UAVs to provide fire support.
The aircraft-in this case, a fighter-releases the UAV, which uses GPS signals to fly toward the adversary's position. At this point, its onboard guidance system determines the best approach route, using an onboard 3-D map to negotiate the city streets, and the UAV detects the laser reflection off the adversary's position and flies a path directly in front of it, firing multiple grenade-sized explosives or perhaps a nonlethal incapacitating agent through the windows. The UAV would have a multiple-shot capacity and could return to fire again if necessary. Although such a limited-effects weapon might not disable or kill all the adversary combatants, it would probably produce sufficient shock to allow the friendly forces to escape.
Ideally, such weapons would carry variable-effect munitions, Which allow the amount of explosive power to be adjusted for each mission. Again, the technical details of such a weapon have yet to be worked out, but the concept is fundamentally practicable.
To summarize, the key characteristics of this weapon are its small size and slow speed. Both characteristics enable it to maneuver in the urban canyons and to either fly by a window, firing a weapon as it passes, or to turn and fly through the window and detonate inside.
The small size and weight and the slow speed of this weapon would minimize penetration and collateral damage in civilian structures.
In the type of urban operations we emphasize in this report, we think it is unlikely that sensor detection of weapons, adversary personnel, or vehicles will lead to lethal fires being put automatically on the target. Rather, we expect there to be at least one human servicemember in the loop between the sensor and the shooter: a controller in the air or on the ground in the rear who has responsibility for a sector of the city in major operations in large cities or for the entire city in smaller operations. Controllers would develop situational awareness from ground-sensor inputs, communications with supported ground forces, airborne imagery, and background intelligence on expected adversary operations. They also would have knowledge of major civilian and friendly military activities planned for that day in their sector. For these concepts to work, the controller must have access to a 3-D database, be supported by sophisticated software that aids decisions by providing basic information about target coordinates (e.g., what building, what floor, who is thought to be there normally, where known friendly and adversary forces are), and have the power to authorize lethal fires. We illustrate this process in the following paragraphs.
Imagine a ground sensor detecting weapons moving through a building entrance, alleyway, or some other constricted feature. The controller's console gives an alert with basic information about the situation. For example, the standard message might say something like "Alert: Weapons, Type: Long-barrel small arms, Count: five and counting, Location: Lat, Long, altitude." The controller would select a database check (or perhaps this would be triggered simultaneously with the alert), and the coordinates would be compared to the urban database, providing additional information (Location: alley between Palms apartment building, 2100 East St, and abandoned warehouse at 2200 East St, Adversary forces: No current reports, Friendly forces: Foot patrol 5 blocks to east moving toward location, Civilians: Apartment building occupied, Recent operations: Friendly patrol ambushed 2 blocks west on 8/17/05).
Most ground systems would have multiple sensors to reduce false alarms and allow target ID. In this case, we envision a low-light TV or IR camera on the same system that detected the weapons. Alternatively, the camera might be located on a different system or airborne. The camera would be turned on and slewed automatically to the location where the weapons were detected. In this case, made simple for the sake of the illustration, the controller is able to observe the suspect personnel setting up an ambush in the alley. With many options at this point, the controller can request additional ground forces to surround and attack the ambushers or can bring in airborne fire support. In this case, the controller alerts the friendly patrol and also an AC-130 or other fire-support platform orbiting over the city.
The coordinates are uploaded to the AC-130, and a glide bomb is dropped on the adversary forces.
Precisely because of the complexity of these situations and the need for superior judgment, we see the controller playing a critical role in integrating airborne surveillance and fire support assets in urban operations. Many difficult command and control issues would have to be resolved before this system could be put in place. Such a control center would be a cross between a standard ground-element command center and a Combined Air Operations Center. Given the level of integration required, a joint operations center for urban operations would need to be staffed by airmen, soldiers, sailors, and marines to ensure that all the necessary expertise is available.
In this chapter, we presented new concepts to accomplish some of the more important and vexing operational tasks confronting U.S. joint forces in urban settings. We focused on capabilities that could plausibly be fielded within a decade rather than on long-term possibilities. Nevertheless, the capabilities envisioned here will not just happen; to be realized, they will require focused R&D and prototype development. The next chapter identifies and assesses the state of the art in six technology areas that have promise for improving the contribution of aerospace forces to joint urban operations.
Chapter Six
Aerospace forces have made important contributions to urban operations from World War II to the present (see Appendix D). Chapter Three identified some important limitations on the use of these forces in situations with very strict ROE and tight political/legal constraints. Although many would not even consider the use of aerospace forces for some of these operations, Chapter Five illustrated many ways that such forces could accomplish tasks that today can only be done by putting ground forces into very risky situations. With the right investments, DoD and the USAF can develop new capabilities that will allow the United States to achieve key objectives in urban operations more efficiently, minimizing risks to friendly forces in the process. In this chapter, we discuss both the latest advances in these areas and the technical hurdles that must be overcome to make the capabilities explored in Chapter Five a reality.
Building high-quality 3-D maps and effectively integrating them with geospatial information represent a serious challenge for the Air Force, but one with a potentially great consequence for both air and ground operations in urban areas. The challenge can be divided into four key elements:
• Acquiring and processing data-acquiring current 3-D maps of urban areas and producing raw Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of areas of interest
• Extracting terrain and surface object features for classification
• Associating feature data with geospatial information
• Updating the scene with dynamic information.
Air Force decisionmakers must tailor their technological investments in proportion to the extent and nature of their participation in each of these four key elements. The USAF needs to determine which, if any, of these elements are most appropriate for investment, and also how to address the division of responsibilities with organizations such as the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA). Of particular concern is the extent to which it is appropriate and necessary for the Air Force to undertake these activities independently rather than rely on other agencies for critical products. These issues, while not strictly technological, are central to understanding the relevance of different technology options.
The first phase of the urban modeling effort is building the baseline map for the area of operations, a task usually done and updated by NIMA in the course of normal tasking requirements. A Digital Elevation Model consists of sets of latitudes and longitudes, along with height information relative to a standard geodetic datum. 
1
2
A geospatial information system (GIS) 3 can be used to store the DEMs, along with other data of interest, and thereby greatly increase the value of what is collected by specialized assets. For instance, having a DEM with just the observed elevation (terrain with features) is useful for many applications such as route planning for low-altitude aircraft and missiles. However, when the data are married to other geospatial information (e.g., whether the object on top of the terrain is a stand of trees or a building, the object's function, street address, type of construction), the value of the data increases dramatically, along with the number of potential users.
The value of the data is increased further when dynamic information is added to the static data in the GIS, providing a current situational picture. This addition involves sensing dynamic and emerging static elements (obstructions in roadways, damaged buildings, etc.) as in the first stage, updating DEMs with information on feature changes and alterations of objects on the surface, then inserting transitory elements such as personnel and vehicles.
Most of the activities outlined above are classic intelligencecollection functions. Building the initial DEMs, compiling basic information on the area of operations, and populating the GIS fall within the domain of the intelligence community, with some division of responsibility between national and theater components.

Obtaining updates on features in the DEMs, adding dynamic elements, and ensuring the connection with both weapon systems and command and control elements is the business of the services.
Capabilities overlap, particularly in building DEMs. If feature changes over a significantly broad area are to be included for purposes of mission planning and weapon employment, then many of the data-collection and -processing elements necessary for basic DEM construction could either be under the control of the service or levied on the national intelligence and mapping agencies as additional requirements for timely updates. Failure to clearly spell out responsibilities and funding obligations increases the likelihood that gaps will develop. Moreover, some technologies, if properly deployed, can be used to bridge potential gaps in capabilities.
In the next six sections, we describe three techniques for collecting data to construct 3-D urban models-laser radar mapping, stereoscopic electro-optical imaging, and interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR); compare the three techniques; discuss trade-offs involved in selecting collection platforms; and describe the computer software the warfighter needs to display and manipulate the models.
Used for decades in the civilian sector for conducting airborne surveys, laser radars currently dominate the imaging field. Laser radars are similar to conventional pulsed radars, except that light pulses are emitted instead of radio-frequency pulses. Typical commercial laser radar systems, including ancillary equipment, weigh between 100 and 250 lb.

The ability to collect from high altitude is perhaps best illustrated by the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), carried aboard NASA's Mars Global Surveyor. In March and April 1999, MOLA collected 27 million laser measurements of the Martian surface through the thin Martian atmosphere, to form a 3-D map of much of the planet. To operate at the orbital altitude of 400 km, the laser receiver was equipped with a large, 50-cm-diameter, parabolic mirror and a sensitive silicon-avalanche photodiode detector.

The main impediments to high-altitude operation are weather and degraded angular resolution, which results in degraded horizontal resolution for the map. If the MOLA laser, with its beam divergence of 0.46 milliradians (mr),

Stereoscopic imaging is the basis for human depth perception. When we view a nearby object, the observation angle from each of our two eyes is slightly different, an effect known as parallax. The amount of parallax displacement depends on the range to the object and the separation between our eyes. Without our having to think consciously about it, our brains are able to convert the parallax offset into an estimate of range, which we perceive as depth. But, how are the two "eye views" seamlessly combined into one? Conceptually, the eyeviews are warped until every point is remapped into a single, unified picture. The amount of warping required to match up a point is a measure of its parallax. The tricky part is that identifying corresponding points sometimes requires paying attention to the content of the image, which is easy for brains but hard for computers.
An image collected by a single spaceborne electro-optical (EO) sensor contains only two-dimensional information, analogous to a single human eye. It is possible to recover the third dimension by measuring parallax between images obtained from two satellite or aircraft locations, but the positions and pointing directions of the optics must be known precisely.
Intensive research is under way to completely automate the process of extracting depth from stereo imagery. Currently, however, smart workstations and software tools exercised under human supervision are relied on for such extraction. The near-real-time production of urban models that laser radars can offer today may not be possible with EO for some time.
Nonetheless, EO can provide higher-resolution information on exterior details of buildings, e.g., the placement of windows, thickness of walls, and construction materials, than can laser radar. Typical large EO sensors used for reconnaissance have ground resolution of 0.6 to 0.3 m from the Global Hawk altitude of 60,000 ft. Spaceborne EO sensors could have ground resolution as good or better than this from a 600-km orbit.
Interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a technique for coherently combining two SAR images taken from two slightly offset positions, either simultaneously with two or more antennas, or separated in time with one antenna (see Figure 
6
14
When SAR images are first synthesized, each resolution cell has associated with it an amplitude and a phase angle between 0 and 360°; when displayed, the phase information is usually suppressed. The phase is a measure, but an ambiguous measure, of the two-way distance, d, between the antenna and the point on the ground.

Enabling Technologies for Urban Aerospace Operations 157 RAND MR1187-6. 2   Figure 6.2-Single-Pass InSAR Geometry way distance r 2 from the top antenna to some resolution cell on the ground is slightly longer, by an amount Ad, than the two-way distance to the bottom antenna, T t . If we subtract the phases between the two SAR images, producing a phase-difference map, this resolution cell will have the phase corresponding to Ad.
If, instead of the ground, the resolution cell in question contains a raised structure, the difference in distance from the two antennas to the roof of the structure will not be Ad but some other value, Ad', depending on the height of the structure. In this way, the phasedifference map encodes information about a third dimensionelevation-that is not available in a single SAR image (see Figure

In composing a SAR map, a simple transformation is performed to convert the slant-range data into ground range. If the SAR is viewing the scene at low depression angles, slant range and ground range directions are almost the same, and the resolution is not seriously degraded in transforming between them. At higher depression angles, the resolution along the ground is degraded in proportion to the secant of the depression angle; for example, a 1-m-resolution SAR has a ground-range resolution of 2 m at 60°, 2.9 m at 70°, and 5.8 m at 80° depression angle. At sufficiently high depression angles, the groundrange resolution is so poor that the imagery is not worth collectinghence, the nadir hole.

Urban areas can also be troublesome to SARs because of shadowing and layover effects (see Figure 
6
In their finest mode, typical military airborne SARs have resolution between 0.3 and 3 m. The SARs for both Predator and Global Hawk have 0.3-m resolution. As noted in a preceding paragraph, these values increase in the ground-range dimension at high depression angles.
SAR payloads for both aircraft and satellites have been used to generate InSAR maps. Although multipass InSAR imaging does not require additional hardware (each of the two platforms uses a single antenna), single-pass InSAR requires that additional apertures be offset along the cross-track direction. The primary requirement for handling InSAR data is that the coherent images (with the phase data intact) be datalinked to the processing center.
A good deal of work has been done in the last few years to automate the process of extracting height from InSAR maps (counting the phase cycles through 360° a process called phase unwrapping) and creating 3-D databases for computerized display. Recent improvements in the algorithms have reduced requirements for human intervention to a low level. However, the problems associated with building extremely precise maps in urban areas still require a great deal of human intervention.
Both civilian and military agencies have plans for spaceborne collection of worldwide topographic data using InSAR mapping. This strong interest is driven primarily by the prospect of providing highresolution digital terrain elevation data (DTED). However, another particularly useful side benefit with InSAR maps is that they can detect change exquisitely, at the level of inches of vertical deflection. In cities, new construction shows up readily as a random mismatch of the phases between the "before" and "after" InSAR maps. Such change detection could also be used to observe changes in roads that might indicate obstacles or other key features changing within a tactically relevant time-scale.
Each of the three methods for obtaining 3-D urban data discussed has its pros and cons with respect to weather limitations, automated processing, resolution, and constraints on slope or depression angle.
Only the InSAR has all-weather capability. Clouds or fog can obscure the ground and deny useful imagery to laser radar and EO sensors, which operate in the optical bands. It is therefore advisable to use laser radar when possible, but have InSAR as a backup, when developing militarized payloads.
Each sensor technology offers other features that are useful and unique. Laser radar provides the most automated and rapid processing. EO provides the best horizontal resolution, and a great deal of qualitative information about structures. InSAR processing is reasonably well-automated, provides the best vertical resolution, and is all-weather, but it is somewhat constrained in imaging steep slopes and high depression angles.
It is likely that high-quality urban mapping will depend on combining data from all three techniques in the future. Today, a number of agencies routinely produce maps combining pairs of sensor types, most frequently EO and SAR, or EO in several bands. Although this combining is usually still performed by a human operating a workstation, the operator is using tools that are rapidly increasing in sophistication.
As to the likelihood that fusion and accurate geolocation of multisensor images will be fully automated before too long, we adduce three factors for optimism:
• No underlying physical barriers to broach or looming engineering paradigms to shift
• The presence of a large and active community, including universities, civilian agencies such as NASA, and the intelligence community, devoting significant resources to the problem • Expansion of processing power at the rate predicted by Moore's Law (doubling every 18 months) for at least another decade, as expected by computer engineers.
The platforms used for data acquisition fall into two categories: airbreathing and spaceborne. The factors governing the choice of platform are the sensor type, area of coverage, level of threat, and political sensitivities.
The types of air-breathing platforms that can be used for imagery collection vary considerably, including small UAVs, small manned aircraft, business jets, fighter aircraft, high-altitude long-endurance UAVs, high-altitude manned aircraft, and larger transport-type aircraft.
Microwave and laser radars and electro-optical sensors have been deployed on both aircraft and spacecraft; in aircraft, they have been deployed over the full range of altitude. As noted in Chapter Four, the presence of manportable air defenses and light anti-aircraft artillery can preclude the use of UAVs like Predator at low altitude. Radarguided tactical SAMs can be overflown with high-altitude aircraft such as U-2s and Global Hawks. Modern high-end SAMs such as SA-10s and SA-12s can engage these aircraft, thus potentially denying access to all but spaceborne collectors before a successful SEAD campaign.
Lasers and EO cannot penetrate cloud cover and dense fog and are degraded by atmospheric attenuation. Consequently, subject to threat considerations low-altitude operation has the advantage of extending the spectrum of weather conditions under which optical sensors can collect data. Low-altitude operation is also favored for optical sensors because their resolution improves with decreasing altitude. Optical sensors can operate at nadir; SARs cannot, because they depend for image formation on slant-range resolution, which degrades at nadir. The area sweep rate for EO depends primarily on the sensitivity, efficiency, and size of the detector elements, the size of the aperture and focal plane, and the speed of the aircraft. Since EO sensors are passive and not usually power-limited, they can gen-erally be made to cover area more rapidly at high resolution than can SARs.
Microwave radar is nearly impervious to weather. However, heavy rainfall will blind it at frequencies above 10 GHz. The resolution of synthetic aperture radar does not depend on altitude as long as there is sufficient power to preserve a high signal-to-noise ratio. The demands for higher power and processing throughput usually decrease the area coverage rate with finer resolution.
Spacecraft offer the advantages of worldwide coverage, better covertness, and the ability to operate over areas denied by threats or political considerations. Disadvantages include higher initial procurement costs, greater complexity, long revisit time (depending on orbit), and unfavorable absentee ratio. Absentee ratio refers to the long time the spacecraft spends outside the viewing range of the area of interest due to its orbital motion. Many surveillance instruments use change detection, which requires a baseline image against which to compare the new image. Spaceborne systems have a unique ability to obtain baseline data without requiring permission of the host country for imaging.
In the commercial sector, Digital Elevation Models (terrain plus features above the terrain) are extensively used to support a wide range of activities, from helping urban planners deal with land-use decisions and make water-drainage assessments, to predicting fires and exploiting telecommunications. Indeed, the wireless telecom munications industry's use of DEMs for siting cell-phone towers represents one of the more prominent applications of this kind of technology, and there are many parallels with applications in the military sector.
DEMs provide obstruction data, along with other parameters associated with signal propagation, which enable the optimal placement of transmitters. Analogous applications for the military include the placement of terrestrial communications relays, observation platforms, or anything that requires line-of-sight calculations, such as countersniper operations.
In the military context, software for exploiting the vast amount of data coming from capable sensors has received somewhat less attention than have sensors and surveillance and reconnaissance platforms. The problem of fusing and presenting data to decisionmakers is, in many respects, a more technically challenging problem than collection. For instance, ambiguities in target identification, geolocation, and sensor measurements make associating multisource information a major challenge, as do difficulties in constructing the underlying GIS. Thus far, the complexity involved in designing generalized fusion techniques has rendered the building of an effective, full-scale fusion system infeasible.
For achieving fusion, there are circumstances under which simpler approaches will yield substantial results. For example, simply combining essentially raw data from sensors with information stored in a GIS is often adequate to allow a skilled human operator to understand what is occurring.
The first step toward building a useful product is to combine imagery and DEMs to generate 3-D perspectives of target areas. These perspectives can be viewed using computer-based visualization, a technique employed for some time in mission-planning systems.
The next 'step is to add in geospatial data and apply predictive algorithms. A common GIS can be used for the basic infrastructure, which avoids the cost of designing a system from scratch while providing the ability to capitalize on a wealth of commercially derived software. However, the most difficult parts of the problem remain: populating the database with current information and interfacing with a host of real-time intelligence and battle-management systems.
Once the database is formed, there are many pathways toward military utility. Some, like the countersniper example discussed in Appendix C, exemplify the use of very basic information to assist in an operation. More-sophisticated applications might allow the operator to formulate queries to understand the construction, use, or other aspects of structures in an area of interest.
Communication and the reception of navigation signals within the urban environment are bedeviled by multipath 
18
19
The weakening of signals by obstruction can be exacerbated by low power if the signal source is a MAV or propagation loss if the signal source is an in-building radio. MAVs, weighing a fraction of a pound in total, must restrict their communications payloads to a weight of several grams, with power consumption of perhaps 1W. Obstruction from using cell phones for communications from inside buildings may reduce effective power to a fraction of a watt in passing through concrete block walls. 
18
Even with image compression, a data rate on the order of 100 kilobytes per second (kB/sec) may be required to transmit imagery. To transmit within an extremely tight weight and power budget will require the development of specialized receivers-on-a-chip. The impulse radio techniques discussed in the next subsection may also contribute to the solution.
DARPA has an ongoing program to develop a UAV relay payload for Global Hawk, called Airborne Communication Node (ACN). 
20
To potentially overcome many of the obstacles to communications in the urban environment, communications equipment using ultrawideband (UWB) impulse waveforms is being developed and tested.

Promising features of this technology include low probability of intercept (LPI), non-interference with nearby users, relative immunity to multipath and jamming, and ability to penetrate structures. 
21
22
The ability to hide the time-modulated waveform in noise makes it difficult for hostile receivers to intercept. The receiver is resistant to jamming because it is receptive to signals only when they come within the short time interval during which a pulse is expected and because it is designed to sense the rapid increase in signal amplitude at the start of a pulse. The waveform is also resistant to multipath, the potentially destructive interference between signals arriving along slightly different paths, for example, a direct path through the air and one that bounces once off the ground or a building. The very short pulse width ensures that only propagation paths with lengths differing by as litüe as 0.3 m will mutually interfere-a situation that applies to only a very small fraction of multipath bounces, even when communicating inside a building. 
23
24
The typical center frequencies of impulse radio fall between 650 MHz and 5 GHz. Frequencies at the lower end can penetrate structures, such as concrete block walls, with minimal losses.
Impulse radios developed by Time Domain Corporation and Multispectral Solutions, Inc. (MSSI) are small and lightweight and have low power consumption. 
25
However, the future of UWB radios is threatened by concerns about interference with navigation systems. 
26
Pseudolites are ground-based or airborne transmitters that supplement or replace GPS for navigational purposes. The civilian world is interested in pseudolites primarily for improving accuracy. Civilian applications include precision approach and landing of aircraft and land surveying. Recent flight tests have been conducted to determine the value of integrating a pseudolite into the FAA's ground-based Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS). The LAAS is intended to bolster GPS to permit all-weather landings at airports. 
27
Several technological challenges have been encountered in developing airborne pseudolites:
28
• Accurately determining the location of the pseudolite platform
• Transmitting ranging signals that can be received by GPS receivers
• Injecting pseudolite position data into a format compatible with existing GPS equipment
• Avoiding signal degradation from interference with satellite GPS signals.
None of these challenges appears overly daunting.
The feasibility of a pseudolite payload for Global Hawk is being investigated by DARPA/Sensor Technology Office (STO), and DoD is planning a UAV flight test in the near future. The concept is for a pseudolite with a sophisticated antenna to receive the GPS signal (for its own localization) by placing deep nulls on jammers. The pseudolite then broadcasts its own ranging signal, which can be picked up by slightly modified GPS receivers.
29
A revolution in imaging sensor technology is under way and will profoundly affect the design of surveillance payloads in the next decade. 
30
• Large focal plane arrays (FPAs), in the megapixel class, in all the optical bands
• Large, uncooled FPAs operating in the IR bands
• Microsensors suitable for expendable implants and MAVs.
As digital cameras, large FPAs operating in the visible band have been highly commercialized, which has significantly reduced their cost. Large FPAs offer high resolution, large field-of-view, rapid readout, good dynamic range, and frame rates adequate to surveil scenes that change quickly.
Large cooled FPAs operating in the IR will have improved sensitivity, enabling them to detect in multiple bands for improved discrimina-tion. Their tolerance for higher operating temperatures will reduce weight and power requirements.
Uncooled IR FPAs have extensive commercial applications-for security, police work, medical sensing, traffic control, etc.-and the competitive dual-use market is already whittling down the cost of FPAs of modest size. The obviation of requirements for cooling and temperature stabilization will decrease the complexity and expense of these systems.
Microsensors employing large FPAs in both the visible and IR bands represent a completely new category of imaging sensors. They will be sufficiently small and light weight to serve as payloads for MAVs or as expendable implanted sensors.
Apart from the visible-band cameras, numerous technical challenges must be met before these new sensors are available for urban surveillance. The uncooled FPAs need improved sensitivity, and the large megapixel arrays, for which the commercial market may be thin, must undergo innovations to reduce their cost. The microsensors share these two challenges, as well as the need to miniaturize electronics, reduce power requirements, compensate for temperature deviations in lieu of stabilization, and find commercial markets. The challenges for cooled FPAs are to decrease non-uniformity, shrink pixel size to accommodate multiband detectors, and raise FPA operating temperature to minimize cooling loads.
In the domain of urban operations, all the imaging technologies mentioned above have worthwhile applications. As stated in Chapter Four, a major challenge for aerospace operations is the lack of highresolution sensors that can identify adversaries who are potentially mingled with civilians or friendly troops. Confidently identifying people is not a strong suit of IR sensors, which lack adequate resolution except at very close range. Even then, IR sensors do not supply the characteristic cues that humans rely on to "check people out" in the visible band.
The most appealing solution is to employ a visible sensor having good low-light-level capability, supplemented by active laser illumination at night or when looking through windows into darkened rooms.

A mini-UAV is likely to be detected acoustically, then optically, at a range of 150 m by an alert human "target." Therefore, it might be better utilized for surveillance tasks short of human identification.
Although detectable at 25 m, the MAV can probably fly in under the cover of night and perch on buildings adjacent to the target building.
An added advantage of this approach is that the MAV need not exhaust its batteries and cease functioning in a mission of just 1 hr. The MAV also has an opportunity to recharge batteries, as discussed in Appendix B.
The resolution associated with NIIRS 9 depends on design details of the optics, focal plane, and processing, as well as on atmospheric and lighting conditions; however, for the clear-weather/daylight case represented in the figure, a typical NIIRS-9 resolution is in the range of2.5to3.8cm. 
33
This section discusses some non-image options for overcoming the difficulties associated with imaging sensors, such as bandwidth problems and weather restrictions, and the challenge of interpreting massive amounts of imagery.
Seismic and acoustic devices have been considered an integral part of unattended ground sensors (UGS) for decades, during which steady advances have been made in sensor technology, particularly in signal processing. 
34
The battlefield sensing problem involves detecting, classifying, and geolocating wheeled and tracked vehicles. Detection ranges of hundreds of meters to kilometers are typical, and networked sensors are able to establish locations with modest accuracy by measuring timedifference-of-arrival (TDOA) to several sensors in the network. Geolocation is complicated by the need to correctiy associate detections made by different UGS in the network. 
35
Enabling Technologies for Urban Aerospace Operations 175 and detection dropouts caused by the masking of distant sources by proximate sources leave too few independent detections to perform TDOA.
All the complexities of the battlefield are amplified in the city. Beyond short ranges, high levels of ambient traffic and anomalous propagation can make hopeless the resolution of ambiguities in associating targets. An appropriate role for seismic and acoustic sensing in the urban environment is to count and classify vehicles passing at close range over key roads or through key intersections.
Classification by seismic and acoustic sensors is based on recognizing the characteristic frequency content of a particular class of vehicles. 
36
There remain significant challenges in signal processing for classification. Data describing line series for a wide variety of vehicles have been collected by, for example, Sandia National Laboratories. Algorithms need to be perfected that can classify line series in the presence of line overlaps and that can deal with the overlap of whole spectra occurring when closely spaced vehicles pass by.
Two radar technologies have been developed in recent years that are referred to as "through-the-wall": (1) motion detectors, developed by GTRI 37 and Hughes Advanced Electromagnetic Technologies Center °°J.

The current version of the flashlight is designed to be operated while stationary, a limitation that current development efforts are laboring to overcome. As with airborne Doppler radar, the messy problem is how to reject clutter that has relative motion of comparable magnitude to the target. If successful, packaging for a mini-UAV might be feasible.
A motion detector developed by HAETC is a briefcase-sized device operating around 900 MHz. At this low frequency it is able to penetrate through 3 ft of concrete-block wall. The radar does not use Doppler processing but, instead, detects small phase changes when the position of any objects in the room changes. When the received 38 F.

Ultra-wideband (UWB) radars have been the subject of intense research for nearly a decade.
41
UWB radars offer a means to enhance wall penetration and range resolution simultaneously. They can operate at the lower radar frequencies that penetrate earth, concrete, etc., with smaller losses than at higher frequencies, and they have the wide bandwidth that is required to obtain good resolution in range. The very fine resolution of UWB radars (typically = 15 cm) also affords relative immunity to multipath, a feature that is held in common with UWB communications.
Both Time Domain Corporation and Sanders have operated UWB radars in the synthetic-aperture-radar mode, obtaining through-thewall images of objects in a room. The Sanders device, developed under DARPA's Smart Module Program, is called Hand Held Synthetic Aperture Radar (HHSAR). Its 2-GHz bandwidth translates into a resolution in range of 9 cm. Usually, a large enough aperture is synthesized to achieve the same resolution in cross-range as in range. For a room measuring 5 m in depth from the radar aperture, the radar has to be moved laterally a distance of 4 m to accomplish this resolution.
The relative location of the radar across this synthesized aperture must be known to within a few centimeters. Sanders is looking into coupling a miniaturized GPS/Inertial Navigation System (INS) module to the radar for this purpose. Final packaging will determine whether this kind of device is suitable for mounting on robotic vehicles or, perhaps, mini-UAVs. A small package implies that the lowfrequency antenna will be inefficient; that inefficiency will be compensated for somewhat by reduced propagation loss through the wall and improved coupling into the target.
UWB SARs with very fine resolution are a technology worth pursuing for urban operations. They can detect and localize (though not identify) individuals inside buildings, which is more instructive than merely detecting the presence of lifeforms. In addition, impulse SARs have the potential for object recognition based on target impulse response. 
42
Irradiating an object, such as a rifle, with an electromagnetic pulse causes the radar echo to display similar tell-tale resonances, if the spectrum of the incident waveform contains significant energy at the resonant frequencies of the object. Typically, an object's lowest frequency resonance occurs at a wavelength twice the length of the object. This amounts to about 2 m for a gun barrel, corresponding to a radar frequency of 300 MHz. For discriminating rifles using reso-nances, we infer that we need to operate the UWB SAR in the VHF band, much lower than the Sanders device. The Army Research Laboratory (ARL) has attempted to detect buried mines using an impulse UWB SAR with its spectral peak in the VHF band-with discouraging results for a small mine buried in loose soil. Results looked promising for larger objects on the surface and closer to a meter in length.
Since SARs can produce an image of the objects in a room, the most effective use of target resonances would be as discriminants for testing objects that appear to be weapons. The imagery would allow the orientation (i.e., compass direction and angle up or down) of the possible weapon to be estimated. Orientation is a required input for estimating the resonant signature. A VHF impulse SAR, if packaged similarly to Sanders' HHSAR, might be an effective ambush detector.
Remote listening occupies a unique niche: It enables human intelligence to be collected covertly without agents on the ground. This capability could play a role in ambush detection and, in concert with other implanted sensors, in general surveillance.
Laser remote-listening devices were developed decades ago. The concept involves illuminating windows with a low-power continuous-wave laser and recovering conversations in the building from the reflected signal. Acoustic waves impinging on the window cause it to vibrate, much like a microphone diaphragm. This vibration modulates the phase of the laser beam. Of course, unlike the microphone, the window is far from an ideal, high-fidelity transducer.
With the advent of solid-state lasers and miniaturized processors, it is possible to package remote-listening lasers as payloads for mini-UAVs or as implanted sensors. 
43
The latest entry into the remote-listening field is a research effort by Sandia Laboratories to develop a microwave remote-listening device. 
44
Employing higher radio frequencies and millimeter waves instead of microwaves could help. With a typical window spacing of 3 m and a 1-m-diameter antenna operating at 95 GHz, the range could be increased to approximately 1.5 km before two windows are in the beam. To extend the listening range even further, operation could be bistatic, with the illuminator on a UAV and the receiver an implanted or parked device on a facing building. If the implant has a 6-in. antenna and is situated 50 m away, its receive beam would be only 1 m across, the width of a single window. Under remote control, it could interrogate any of the windows illuminated by the UAV's beam and, being passive, would consume very little power, primarily for its data link.
Several rapidly developing technologies may lead to chemical-/ biological-sniffing payloads for mini-UAVs in the near term. Applications to urban operations include detection of explosives (car bombs and weapons caches), mines, drugs, and releases of chemical or biological weapons. Because of this potential for military applications,

Sensor fusion is the process whereby information from different sensor types is integrated and presented on a single display. For example, visual, IR, and SAR images can be combined to give a richer picture than any single sensor could provide. Sensor fusion can also be used to reduce false alarms. For example, the sensor-fusion system might be programmed to ignore seismic detections, unless nearby acoustic sensors also detected the unique signature of a vehicle engine.
Effective sensor fusion has proven difficult when more than a few sensors are involved, phenomenologies differ, or the types of errors are significantly different. As well, daunting problems remain in processing, network design for ease of scaling, and algorithm development. As the number of nodes having overlapping coverage in the sensor network increases, the number of operations involved in fusing the information grows extremely rapidly. Achieving a common picture requires the ensemble of sensors viewing each event to be reconciled. This nonlinearity implies that achieving fusion through brute-force processing power is a dubious proposition. The problem is compounded by the tendency to increase the dimensionality of the data to more fully characterize the targets being observed.
Fortunately, short of full-scale data fusion, two steps can provide utility:
1. Assist the operator by collecting multiple sources of information at a single point and allowing the overlay of various data elements. In assisting with visualization, the various sources are largely accepted as ground truth and are usually correlated only within each data type. For instance, if acoustic sensors report three discrete targets and radar reports four targets in the same very small area, the actual count would be ambiguous. It would be difficult to know which, if either, source is reporting the correct number. Consequently, a visualization system might present one set of results, present both sets, or contrive a rough correlation without really addressing some of the ambiguities and resolving the issue fully. Perhaps the greatest value would be in highlighting discrepancies among sensor types.
2. Assist the operator by filtering the data from a large array of sensors so that unusual activities that might warrant a closer look by other sensor systems can be detected and brought to the operator's attention. The system would aid in understanding what is happening by providing, for example, a screen, a monitor that flags unusual events, or a backstop to human observation of the data network. The technology for anomaly detection builds upon the GIS outlined earlier in this chapter. It includes a statistical analysis of both patterns of dynamic, activity and unusual changes in objects that can be located again. A now relatively mature technology, anomaly detection can alert human operators of command and control (C2) systems to investigate activities that differ from the norm.
At work in both commercial and military domains, many of the basic technologies for simple fusion are based on neural nets that are "trained" to recognize normal and abnormal activities and to cue humans for intervention when critical thresholds are crossed.
Extensive training is required for the neural networks to establish proper baselines of behavior and to establish acceptable falsepositive and false-negative rates.
The critical weakness of all current approaches for anomaly detection is that they have a significant high false-positive rate under realworld conditions. Whereas systems that simply look for change can be set to flag changes, dynamic environments require the software to cull abnormal changes from a large array of normal changes that occur on a day-to-day basis. Consequently, these computer-based systems often perform more poorly than a skilled human examining the same data-but they can examine much more data than a human can, and will do so without becoming bored or tired.
Traffic monitoring in a peacekeeping situation is an illustrative application of such a system in an urban area. Here, a large number of sensors might be used to create an estimate of normal traffic patterns as a function of date, day of week, and time of day. By flagging areas of unusually low or high activity, such a system could be used to warn of trouble and could alert controllers to dispatch close-look sensor platforms or patrols appropriately. It could also be used by logistics support groups, operators, and others planning operations in the urban area to better take into account the traffic in and around areas of interest.
As discussed in Chapter Five, air-launched sensors have the potential to greatly improve the ability of manned platforms to detect and identify adversary forces. In some cases, a mini-UAV or airimplanted ground sensor would accomplish this detection by putting an EO/IR sensor close enough to the target to collect highresolution imagery. In other cases, small ground sensors could be implanted from the air in locations that friendly ground forces did not have access to.
These sensor platforms could be mini-or micro-UAVs, parafoils, other airborne platforms, or remote ground units. In all cases, they would have to be simple-and cheap enough to be disposable, which might limit the type and number of sensors they could carry.
Depending on cost and weight, these platforms could exploit the full spectrum of sensor phenomenologies, including acoustic, seismic, EO/IR, magnetic, chemical, and radar.
A variety of mini-UAVs, both battery-powered and gas-powered, with wingspans as small as 4 ft and endurance up to 2 hr, are already flying with small sensor packages. Thus, the technical challenge is less in the design of the aircraft and more in its packaging and deployment. And, as was pointed out in Chapter Five, "Provide Rapid, High-Resolution Imagery for Target ID," a means is needed to quickly get the offboard sensor from the medium altitudes at which manned platforms typically operate at down to its operating altitude of 1,000 ft or lower. A small, light UAV would simply take too long to fly down to its operating altitude.
To solve this problem, an aerodynamic container could be used for a UAV. It would be carried on a hard point on the aircraft exterior or could be deployed through the back right personnel door on the AC-130. It could be guided or ballistic. At the appropriate altitude, it would need to slow and be stabilized in order to deploy the UAV. This might be done with a drogue parachute. The UAV would need folding wings that deployed once it was released from the container. Some aerodynamic and control issues would have to be solved. Once deployed, the UAV would fly autonomously or be remotely piloted to the surveillance area and would broadcast imagery back to the launch platform.
Alternatively, as discussed in Chapter Five, a lifting body/parafoil could carry the sensors, all in a container on the aircraft exterior or launched from the inside of larger aircraft. Some aerodynamic challenges are associated with designing a small lifting body that carries its own parafoil, but, again, the engineering details do not appear excessively demanding. Stabilization and control of the sensor optics could be challenging, since the parafoil may have oscillation problems not encountered on winged air vehicles. These difficulties might be overcome by avoiding dramatic changes in direction. Once the parafoil was established in a constant descending circle over the target area, it should be possible to get a reasonably stable field of view. Clearly, tests with prototype vehicles will be necessary to fully explore these issues. Given the simplicity and light weight of the vehicle, they should not be particularly difficult or expensive.
When more enduring surveillance of a particular building or other site is needed, it is difficult to meet both high-resolution and covertness requirements from airborne platforms. Also, some sensor phenomenologies have such limited range that airborne application is not feasible. Thus, we may want to implant ground sensors from the air for some missions. However, air-implanted ground sensors appear to be more technically challenging than the airborne sensors discussed above. Dating back at least to the Igloo White program of the Vietnam era, the two approaches-high-speed spikes that embed themselves in the ground and parachute packages designed to hang in trees-are designed for rural applications. Urban ground sensors will primarily need to be able to land on and adhere to rooftops, windows, or the sides of buildings. Urban foliage may offer some opportunities to hide sensors, but the sensors would have to be delivered with much greater precision and be much more covert than sensors dropped in vast woodlands or other isolated areas.
Several approaches are possible. In Chapter Five, we discussed implanting a shoebox-sized sensor package by VTOL UAV. The UAV might be able to place the sensor in the optimal surveillance location; however, to maintain covertness most of the time, the sensor would have to be dropped out of line of sight to the target. Even then, there is the possibility that the UAV would be detected acoustically.
Once in place, the sensor would need some limited mobility to get to its surveillance location. Although technically feasible, this approach has several weaknesses: requiring a fairly large UAV to hover within a few hundred feet of the target, leaving a detectable object on a roof where it might be discovered, and requiring sufficient mobility to get around and over rooftop obstructions.
Another approach would use a higher-flying manned aircraft, UAV, or munitions dispenser to drop a small, guided sensor. This sensor would fly directiy to its surveillance spot, ideally a building wall facing the target, and implant itself, which would have the advantage of minimizing the acoustic signature but the disadvantage of likely discovery. Technical challenges include precision guidance to fly the sensor to within inches or feet of its desired locations to avoid flying through windows; wall-adherence techniques to keep it attached to the building; and resolution so that the sensor would be small enough to avoid casual detection but large enough to see across a street or perhaps farther.
Still another approach, remote ground sensors deployed by agents or friendly forces, has great potential to enhance air operations. Lawenforcement and covert organizations have used such devices to supplement manned surveillance locations for years and have perfected a host of camouflage techniques. Hand-deployed sensors can often be placed very close to the target. Combined with very powerful telephoto lenses and high-quality optics, these systems have the potential to provide imagery of such quality that individuals can be identified-a common requirement in covert and law-enforcement operations.
This successful quality suggests that, as a hedge against the possibility that air-implanted sensors will be infeasible, the USAF R&D community, in concert with other services and agencies, might do well to explore the development of quality remote ground sensors. As well, not only must remote sensors not compromise technologies and techniques essential to other intelligence-collection operations-a key consideration in their development-but means must be developed to limit the consequences of discovery and analysis by adversary technical experts, since any remote sensor has the potential of being discovered. Various self-destruct techniques might be used to prevent the adversary from using or fully understanding key parts of the remote sensor. Since such techniques are never completely reliable, it is likely that the most-sensitive remote-sensor phenomenologies will have to be avoided and less-than-state-of-theart technologies used in many cases.
As discussed in Chapter Four, USAF weapons are optimized for precision attack against medium to hard targets and are extremely valuable in more-conventional urban fights. However, in operations in which restrictive ROE require that damage be limited within buildings, perhaps even to single rooms, these weapons have too much explosive power and penetration potential. Anti-personnel weapons, such as the 40mm and 105mm guns on AC-130 gunships, are more appropriate under these more-constrained conditions, but they also have limitations, particularly against interior targets in urban canyons.
A growing requirement beyond these more-traditional weapons is for highly discriminating weapons whose effects can be tailored to meet the unique needs of each situation. As the precision of airdelivered ordnance has improved over the twentieth century, effects have shrunk from citywide to blocks to individual buildings. It is only natural that airmen would continue this evolution, taking the next step and developing weapons that have effects limited not just to buildings but to individual rooms within buildings: kinetic-energy weapons; laser-guided hand grenades; miniature glide bombs, cruise missiles, and killer UAVs; and nonlethal weapons.
As discussed in Chapters Four and Five, several approaches can be taken to make air-delivered ordnance more discriminating in urban settings. The first approach would simply reduce the explosive yield of existing weapons so that the effects would be more limited. Some experimentation would be necessary to understand the effects associated with various smaller warheads. In the extreme, the explosives can be taken out completely, as in the laser-guided training round or the 2,000-lb bombs filled with solid concrete used against Iraqi air defense sites during Operation Northern Watch strikes in October 1999. 
50
Alternatively, it may be worth exploring very small, laser-guided weapons, such as the Marines have done with 2.75-in. rockets. A precision weapon of this class, a "laser-guided hand grenade" 51 if you will, could be delivered against targets in all but the steepest and narrowest urban canyons. It would require more-focused and moreprecise laser designators than are currently deployed, so that this small weapon would, for example, go through a window rather than bounce harmlessly off the outside of a building.
An alternative to this "hand grenade" approach would use a small, slow-flying platform (such as a UAV or a small cruise missile like LOCAAS) to deliver a small munition (weighing from a few ounces to 
50
51
a few pounds). The main challenges here are developing a platform that is so agile and accurate that it can maneuver down into the urban canyon and either fly by the target and fire a projectile sideways at the target or fly into the target. Lacking much penetration potential by design, both the laser-guided hand grenade and this concept would work best against targets in the open, in open rooms, or behind glass. They would also have to be exceptionally accurate, which is unlikely to be feasible without a navigation system integrating GPS pseudolites and 3-D maps, as discussed earlier in this chapter. This is probably the most technically challenging of the weapon options in this report.
Finally, there is the option of using nonlethal weapons against urban targets. 
52
Most nonlethal weapons are designed for close-in use by infantry or police, but several technologies have promise as air-delivered weapons. Many nonlethal weapons are already being deployed or are in development. The following paragraphs discuss a few of theseacoustic devices, optical effects, nonlethal barriers, high-powered 
52
Acoustic Devices. Acoustic devices, including beams, blast waves, curdlers, squawk boxes, and sonic bullets, are all possibilities for airborne weapons. Some can produce point effects; others produce effects over larger areas. As these technologies evolve, it may be possible to achieve more-precise effects.
Acoustic beams use high-power, very-low-frequency beams to cause body cavities to resonate at particular frequencies. The effects can range from mild nausea all the way to permanent injury and death, depending on range, decibel level, and exposure time. Acoustic blast waves can be generated by pulsed lasers, producing a hot, highpressure plasma similar to chemical explosives. Acoustic curdling produces a shrieking noise that can be used to disperse rioters. Another crowd-control device that might have utility as a countersniper weapon is the "squawk box," first used by the British Army in 1973 in Northern Ireland. It combines two ultrasonic frequencies that, when mixed in the human ear, produce "giddiness, nausea or fainting." The beam is reportedly so small that it can be directed at specific individuals. Finally, high frequencies can produce an impact wave that hits the target similarly to a blunt object, producing effects ranging from discomfort to death. 
53
54
Even longer range acoustic systems would require manned platforms to fly within the envelope of MANPADS and AAA. For these reasons, it might make sense to put acoustic weapons on low-flying UAVs.
Optical Effects. Optical effects can also be exploited to produce nonlethal effects. Bright lights, strobes, and flash/bang grenades can be used to stun, disorient, or even cause epileptic seizures. For example, high-intensity strobe lights flashing near human brain-wave frequency reportedly cause vertigo, nausea, and disorientation, and might cause epileptic seizures in some people. 
55
57
Nonlethal Barriers. Low-friction polymers (super-lubricants), highfriction polymers (sticky foams), aqueous foams, Caltrops (multisided steel barbs), and other devices can be used as nonlethal barriers. Low-friction polymers impede personnel or vehicle movement, producing an ice-slick surface impossible to stand or drive on. Sticky foams produce a gluelike barrier that cannot be penetrated; they were used during the withdrawal from Somalia. 
59
60
High-Powered Microwaves. High-powered microwaves (HPM), which are transmitted by a radarlike antenna or generated through an explosive device, have potential as air-delivered nonlethal weapons for both anti-personnel and antimateriel applications.
Some have advocated HPM weapons in the anti-personnel role because of their supposed potential to render personnel unconscious without permanent damage. 
61
HPM-induced changes in brain temperatures of a few degrees (in laboratory rats) caused convulsions, unconsciousness, and temporary blindness. 
62
64
HPM weapons create an electromagnetic pulse that produces a surge of power through unprotected electrical equipment, potentially disabling vehicles, radios, computers, and radars. Depending on the power levels experienced by the target, the damage may be transitory (e.g., requiring computers to be rebooted) or permanent (e.g., by physically damaging integrated circuits). Designed without significant protection against low-power accidental interference, commercial systems (especially communications) are usually more vulnerable to these type of effects. Consequently, if the military mission required that an adversary's systems be permanently damaged, the higher power required to do so would increase the chances that nearby civilian systems would be damaged also. This might limit the use of HPM near essential civilian electronics (e.g., telecommunications, hospitals, electrical-power facilities) and might rule out its use where civilian and adversary systems were located in the same building. In most cases, however, it appears that HPM can be tailored so that permanent damage is limited to quite small areas.
Chemical Agents. A variety of reactant chemical agents have been developed as antimateriel weapons. These include combustionaltering agents, super-caustic agents, and liquid-metal embrittlement. Some of these agents would be quite lethal if humans were exposed; their nonlethality assumes that humans are not nearby when they are used.
Combustion-altering agents either contaminate or change the viscosity of fuel, causing engine failure. They can be delivered as a vapor through engine air intakes or introduced into the fuel supply. Super-caustic agents are mixes of acids that will dissolve most metals. They could be used against buildings, roads, and vehicles. Liquid-metal embrittlement changes the molecular structure of base metals, potentially causing structural failure of bridges, buildings, aircraft, and ground vehicles. 
65
Biological Agents. Finally, a variety of biological and chemical nonlethal agents are available, such as tear gas, calmative agents, malodorous agents, and sickening agents. The practicality of these concepts varies, but as is discussed in the next subsection, we do not believe these weapons have much applicability in urban operations.
Proscriptions Against Anti-Personnel Nonlethal Weapons.
Nonlethal weapons clearly have utility in some urban military situa-tions, particularly those faced by special operations forces. However, several factors are likely to prevent anti-personnel nonlethal weapons from being widely used when civilians and adversary forces are intermingled.
First, nonlethals fail to meet mission requirements in many situations. Most of the time, U.S. forces want to permanently remove adversary forces from the fight by capturing or killing them or to undermine an adversary's morale by producing casualties. Consider an adversary sniper firing on friendly forces. Knocking him out with a nonlethal weapon would have the benefit of stopping him from harming any other friendlies at that time. Yet, unless friendly forces were able to find and capture the unconscious sniper, he would be fit to return to fighting soon thereafter. This also would have the undesirable effect of under-deterring violent actions. Also, not all nonlethal-weapon effects occur immediately. Timing the onset of effects and limiting their duration can be quite complex; one could not be certain that the adversary was incapacitated at the critical time, which suggests that, most of the time, lethal weapons would be the preferred option.
Second, there is the possibility that nonlethals would, in fact, kill or permanently harm civilians. Urban areas increase the probability that nonlethals could harm civilians because (1) the high population densities simply increase the number of people who might be exposed to an amount, or in a way, that would be harmful and ( 
2
Nonlethals are attractive because they might solve the targetdiscrimination problem when adversary forces and noncombatants are intermingled. A riot-control agent or acoustic weapon might be used to drive an intermingled group away or to incapacitate them until friendly forces could sort them out on the scene. Technologies already exist to drive people off with fairly low risk. But rendering people unconscious is a much trickier business; it has the potential of killing the young, old, or sick, or of causing permanent harm. Each of these concepts will need to be explored in great depth to ensure that the effects are sufficiently benign to use against noncombatants. However, if the alternative is firing lethal weapons into a crowd, such risks might appear small. The difficult question for policymakers is whether there are a sufficient number of such circumstances to justify developing and deploying these systems as backups.
Third, the U.S. is signatory to a number of agreements that may prohibit or limit the use of some nonlethal weapons. For example, states that signed the Biological Weapons Convention of 1972 agreed not to "develop, produce, stockpile or otherwise acquire or retain . . . microbial or other biological agents, or toxins whatever their origin or method of production, of types and in quantities that have no justification for prophylactic, protective or other peaceful purposes."

For more details on the potential implications of these treaties for nonlethal weapons technologies, see Barbara Hatch Rosenberg, "'Non-lethal' Weapons May Violate Treaties," The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, September/October 1994, pp. 44-45. en D3 CS gas is the most widely used riot-control agent. cause a crowd to panic and stampede or crush people to death in a rush to escape the gas. Adversary propaganda, local myths, and rumors could cause overreactions through misinformation about the agents (e.g., claiming that they were lethal, caused infertility, or carried other frightening effects).
Although, in many cases, the effects from nonlethals are less harmful or at least no more harmful than those of conventional weapons, the nature of the effects could produce disastrous political fallout. For example, imagine an operation that resulted in civilians being blinded or terribly burned with acids instead of being killed. The media and public reactions to the blinding and burning events would likely be much worse, at least in part because there would be survivors to photograph, interview, and write about. Therefore, they are likely to be a factor of great concern to U.S. leaders anytime the use of these weapons is contemplated.
In short, we recommend continued research and development of nonlethal weapons for appropriate situations but see them as having little applicability in most urban operations. For this reason, this study has emphasized more-conventional weapons.
This chapter has sought to show the breadth of technological developments relevant to urban aerospace operations. Many technical hurdles remain and some capabilities may be decades from being realized. However, many technologies are sufficiently mature to justify the development of prototypes and the initiation of operational testing. As noted at the beginning of this chapter, these systems have the potential to greatly enhance aerospace operations in urban environments, but they are unlikely to come to fruition without strong institutional support to take promising ideas out of the laboratory and into the field.
We now turn to Chapter Seven and offer some final observations about the role of aerospace forces in urban settings.
This report has sought to provide an overview of the varied challenges-from legal constraints to line-of-sight limitations imposed by urban geometry-facing airmen in urban military operations, and of operational concepts and new technologies for dealing with those challenges. Although the urban setting is a complex and difficult environment in which to operate, aerospace forces can make important and unique contributions to joint urban operations. We conclude this report with a short summary of our key findings, some thoughts on the importance of urban operations, and some caveats about the performance of sensors, weapons, and people in actual combat. Finally, we recommend some steps the USAF can take toward acquiring the capabilities discussed in this report.
Key findings of this study are as follows:
• Global urbanization, particularly in the developing world, makes it highly likely that many, if not most, future military operations will have an urban component (although not necessarily one involving fighting).
• An increase in urban operations does not mean that conflict has become primarily an urban phenomenon or that nonurban military operations have been eclipsed. Rather, built-up areas are yet another environment in which military forces must be prepared to operate.
The physical and social complexity of urban areas makes them extremely difficult to operate in. Where possible, U.S. forces should avoid them. Aerospace forces can help preclude some urban military operations through deterrence, early warning, and rapid humanitarian or military intervention. Along with ground-based long-range fires, they can interdict adversary forces, potentially preventing them from reaching urban areas.
Where urban operations cannot be avoided, aerospace forces can make important contributions to the joint team, detecting adversary forces in the open; attacking those forces in a variety of settings; and providing close support, navigation and communications infrastructure, and resupply for friendly ground forces.
Offboard sensors for manned aircraft, three-dimensional urban mapping, GPS relays on UAVs, and limited-effects munitions have the potential to enhance the ability of aerospace forces to detect and attack adversary forces where rules of engagement are highly restrictive, such as in peace operations, noncombatant evacuations, and humanitarian assistance. Their development should be encouraged.
Three-dimensional mapping and GPS relays also have the potential to substantially improve the situational awareness of friendly ground forces, allowing the smallest units, as well as their commanders, to know their own location (both GPS coordinates and position in buildings). Coupling these technologies with laser rangefinders should allow friendly forces to quickly map the location of engaged adversary forces.
Automated integration and pattern analysis of inputs from large, multiphenomenology sensor networks will be necessary to make sense of the massive volume of activity found in most urban areas.
But, in the type of limited operations this report emphasizes, it is unlikely that automated classification of weapons, adversary personnel, or vehicles will be sufficiently reliable to permit lethal fires to be put automatically on targets. Rather, we expect that practical limitations of automated fusion, coupled with political concerns about collateral damage and civilian casualties, will dictate that at least one human decisionmaker remain in the loop between sensor and shooter.
• As long as human decisionmakers remain in the loop between sensor and shooter, human-machine interfaces will be a critical information-architecture issue. A major challenge will be developing the organizational processes that make quick decisions possible in light of the likely uncertainly and ambiguity associated with real combat. Without a responsive and agile command and control system, an elusive and adaptable adversary is likely to be there and gone before weapons can be brought to bear.
Are urban-centered conflicts becoming more common? Are they a new form of warfare that will supplant traditional maneuver warfare in the open? These are intriguing questions that deserve serious and careful consideration by defense planners and researchers alike. At this point, there is insufficient evidence or analysis to answer them. In finding answers, defense planners must walk a narrow path between apocalyptic and complacent visions of the future security environment. They should focus, at least for now, on ensuring that the U.S. military can meet a broad range of urban-military-operation challenges, whether in major wars or small-scale operations.
The best argument for improved urban-military capabilities is that, despite its best efforts to avoid them, the U.S. military has had to fight in cities in a multitude of circumstances. And, in an increasingly urbanized world, noncombatant evacuations, humanitarian relief, and other "noncombat" operations are likely to take place in urban settings. The possibility of armed interference in many of these operations means that the military is tasked. Although U.S. forces have usually been able to avoid combat during these operations, they must be prepared to conduct urban evacuations and humanitarian relief in the face of armed opposition. In short, whether in conventional conflicts or in smaller-scale contingencies, there is a good chance that U.S. forces will be called upon to operate in urban set-tings. Prudent defense planning requires that we develop the doctrine, training, organizations, equipment, and concepts of operations to be effective in this unique and difficult environment.
Planners also need to distinguish clearly between the problem of conducting military operations in the midst of a civilian population and that of fighting in the rubble of a largely abandoned city. The former, more-complex problem deserves analytic attention. As DoD places more emphasis on stability, relief, counterterrorism, and other operations at the lower end of the conflict spectrum, planners, operators, and analysts need to gain a deeper understanding of the human and physical intricacies of the urban environment.
The concepts presented in this report have great promise, but we do not want to imply that the concepts or enabling technologies are a panacea that will make urban operations easy or guarantee U.S. dominance of the urban environment. The urban environment is too complex to lend itself to a simple technological solution.
Even with an extensive aerospace-ground sensor network, much adversary activity is likely to go undetected. Smoke (from fires and adversary smoke-generating machines), dust, inclement weather, night, electronic interference, building materials, and human activities will hinder intelligence collection at one time or another.
An adversary force's efforts at deception will, at times, confuse and confound U.S. attempts to detect and attack them. Adversary forces that are detected by ground-sensor fields may move out of sensor range or line of sight before they can be positively identified or attacked. Airborne surveillance platforms at times may be too far off to assist or may lose line of sight at critical moments. Around-theclock airborne fire support, which is feasible but demanding for platforms and crews, does not ensure that a weapon can be delivered anywhere in the city at a moment's notice. In many cases, adversary forces are likely to escape before the sensor-controller-shooter loop can be completed. A highly active adversary might swamp controllers with alerts, hampering the time-consuming task of visually identifying the targets. Or it might not be possible to identify the targets as hostile because the targets are intermingled with noncombatants.
There also will be occasions when weapons will be released but will miss the intended target because of these factors or adversary countermeasures. At least some of the time, both lethal and nonlethal weapons will injure and kill noncombatants and friendly forces.
Limited-effects munitions are also likely to be insufficiently lethal in some situations, allowing adversary forces to escape unscathed or with lesser injuries than they would have received from traditional weapons. Thus, although the weapons proposed here can substantially lessen unintended damage, they will at times fail to achieve the desired effect.
Finally, it must be recognized that the adversary is a thinking, adapting, often highly motivated independent actor who will do creative and surprising things to counter U.S. sensors, weapons, and concepts of operation. Concepts of operation will have to be flexible and evolve to stay one step ahead of such a thinking adversary.
The greatest advantage U.S. forces have over potential adversaries is their ability to integrate air, land, sea, and space forces. In the urban setting, highly integrated operations could allow a ground patrol to send GPS coordinates and/or an image of an adversary's position to a combat aircraft overhead. Alternatively, a UAV, manned aircraft, or satellite might send GPS coordinates, an image, or other data about a target that was around the corner or otherwise beyond line of sight to a ground unit. Mutual sharing of information and images could dramatically increase the effectiveness of both aerospace and ground forces as they gained a perspective on a developing situation impossible to achieve from either the ground, air, or space alone.
Integrating inputs from ground, air, and space sensors, along with human observations from patrols or forward observers, could also give commanders a rich, multidimensional view of the battlespace, improving the quality and speed of force allocation and other critical command decisions.
Fully integrated air-ground operations that capitalize on the unique strengths of ground and air forces should minimize U.S. susceptibility to an adversary's deception efforts and risks to U.S. personnel while maximizing the effectiveness of U.S. forces in detecting, identifying, and neutralizing adversary forces.
The caveats discussed above notwithstanding, the general approach presented here is sound and, if pursued, will yield a significant improvement in USAF and joint capabilities for urban operations. In particular, the integration of ground-sensor networks, low-flying airlaunched UAVs, and more-traditional surveillance platforms with platforms carrying limited-effects munitions will make it possible for aerospace forces to greatly increase the contribution they make to joint urban operations. Developing the ability to detect, identify, and neutralize room-sized targets without collateral damage is a logical step in the evolution of aerospace power, simply continuing current trends in C3ISR, battle management, and precision strike.
For these capabilities to be realized, several areas will require morefocused attention:
• Air-launched offboard sensors
• Limited-effects munitions and associated platforms
• Non-imaging sensors for ground networks (particularly weapondetection and explosives-detection technologies)
• Three-dimensional mapping and databases
• Sensor fusion
• Joint command and control of aerospace and ground forces.
In view of budgetary realities and current modernization priorities, we recognize that funds available for enhancing USAF urban capabilities are limited. USAF R&D is already directed at certain capabilities that would be useful in urban settings, such as loitering sensors/platforms and directed-energy weapons. However, programs would have to be initiated or redirected to develop other key urban capabilities. For that reason, we recommend that the USAF continue modest research to identify the most-promising and versatile technologies for urban settings. Additional research and testing will have to be done before there is sufficient data on performance and cost for the USAF leadership to make informed decisions on whether to field systems such as those discussed in this report.
For the near term, we recommend that one of the USAF major commands or a battle laboratory be given responsibility for conducting additional research and development of these systems. To make the most of limited R&D funds, USAF laboratories should seek to partner with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and other interested parties-perhaps under the auspices of an Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration (ACTD) program-to build and test prototypes of the more promising systems. U.S. allies are likely to be important players as well, having developed a variety of nonlethal, countersniper, and other systems that can be applied in urban operations.
Ultimately, urban operations are a joint problem. Theater commanders, the joint staff, and DoD will have to determine which mix of capabilities offers the most robust force for urban operations. Specific sensor and weapon choices will have to be made on the basis of some combination of coverage rate, resolution, versatility, responsiveness, cost, proportional/adjustable effects, and ease of delivery. Urban-specific MOEs may be needed to evaluate options for accomplishing the various tasks. As promising technologies are identified, realistic field testing, simulation, modeling and redteaming will be necessary to determine which, if any, of these are sufficiently robust under actual operational conditions to justify fielding.
Likewise, certain capabilities discussed in this report, such as urban pattern analysis and the fusion of aerospace-ground sensor inputs, should be developed under the auspices of joint initiatives. These capabilities belong in a joint fusion or command center.
Indeed, some of the most difficult issues are related to joint command and control of urban operations. For example, coordinating joint fires to prevent friendly forces from firing on one another will become a bigger problem if the number of standoff weapons used in urban operations is increased. If significant numbers of friendly forces are on the ground, will all urban air strikes be considered CAS? Or will aerospace forces operate more autonomously in some parts of the city? These are just a few of the many issues that need to be resolved before highly integrated urban aerospace-ground operations become feasible.
We also recognize that other potential aerospace applications may prove to be too expensive or too far removed from the core responsibilities of the USAF to justify the diversion of resources. However, it would be unfortunate if excessive concern about budgetary constraints, combined with somewhat outdated views of the limitations of aerospace power, prevented promising new capabilities from being fielded. Ironically, airmen are often as likely as infantrymen to narrowly define the settings in which aerospace forces can contribute. A more expansive vision of aerospace power would see the urban canyons of the world as part of the continuum of the third dimension that runs from the ground to orbital altitudes. It would embrace nontraditional systems-such as air-dropped UAVs-as simply another tool in the airman's kit bag. The USAF excelled during the twentieth century at going higher, faster, farther.
To meet the challenges of the early twenty-first century, the USAF may also need to exploit unmanned and robotic systems so that it can go lower, slower, and closer against unconventional threats to U.S. interests.
This appendix explains the trigonometric calculations behind much of the information presented in Chapter Four.
gives an example of how to determine the maximum horizontal distance, line AD, a UAV can be away from a street and still see three-fourths of that street over a building of a given height.  
4
First we find the tangent of angle a. The tangent of angle a is the height of triangle ABC divided by its base. In this case, this is the 20-m building height divided by one-fourth of the street width, 12.5 m.
Since angle a is the same in triangles ABC and ADE, we know that the tangent of angle a must also equal the UAV altitude The arctangent function on any scientific calculator (or table) can be used to find that angle a is about 58°. This is the minimum angle at which the UAV can see three-fourths of the street. If the UAV moves closer than 625 m, it will be.able to see more of the street; as it moves farther away, it will be able to see progressively less of the street.
Similar calculations form the basis of the information presented throughout Chapter Four. solar power with the sun directly overhead. For cases when the sun is not directiy overhead, we explore alternatives.
It seems unlikely that the mini-UAV can land in hostile areas for recharging, survive, then take off for another mission. If it can reach sanctuary, simple refueling of an internal combustion engine is the most efficient approach.
The MAV is designed to perch on buildings, with some chance for covertness. Recharging in this instance is practical. Assuming that the solar panels recharge the MAVs battery with an overall efficiency of 20 percent, 2.5 hr of sunlight would be required for the MAV to fly for 1 hr. A critical issue is whether the solar panels can be made light enough for the MAV to carry them.
Another alternative means of recharging the MAV is by beaming down microwaves from a Global Hawk-class or larger UAV at 60,000 ft altitude. The power per unit surface area obtained as a function of radiated power is shown in Figure 
B
Microwave Recharging of Mini-UAVs and Micro-UAVs 211
Supposing the conversion efficiency for microwaves to electricity is higher than for solar power, around 90 percent, a 100-kW radiator beaming down through all the daylight hours at 95 GHz would be required to recharge a MAV for 1 hr of flight. The radiated power is a factor of several times what Global Hawk can deliver in prime power, and the efficiency of antennas at 95 GHz is much worse than at X-band. Moreover, at this high frequency, the beam is very focused, and the MAVs undergoing recharging would be confined to the area of a city block (<2000 m 2 ).
In summary, whereas recharging mini-UAVs is not practical, refueling them may be, under some circumstances. Solar recharging of MAVs is practical, provided that flight can be restricted to roughly 1 hr out of every 3.5 hr and that solar panels that are very light, yet efficient, become available. The appendix is divided into three main sections: close air support, air logistics support, and air interdiction and siege support. Each of these sections initially describes the performance of aerospace power in the given functional role and subsequently analyzes the factors contributing to aerospace power's success or failure. In the final section, some observations are made regarding the overall effectiveness of U.S. aerospace power in past urban operations with the hope that these insights will be useful for planning the use of aerospace forces in future urban operations.
From Stalingrad to Grozny, close air support has compiled a mixed record of achievement in urban operations. 
With some notable exceptions, neither the Axis nor the Allied powers during World War II had much success in providing close air support in urban areas. As a rule, they employed air forces in the city massively and offensively to "soften up" and demoralize the enemy prior to a major ground assault. In such a role, aerospace power often destroyed countless civilian lives and property, without making a significant military contribution. For example, on July 23-24, 1942, German bombers mounted the equivalent of 2,000 sorties against the city of Stalingrad, killing approximately 40,000 people and, at least initially, causing widespread panic among the Russian population. By blocking roads with the rubble produced by fallen buildings, the preliminary air bombardment hampered the movement of Soviet military forces. But it also assisted the city's defenders by impeding the German ground attack. For their part, Stuka dive-bombers strafed defenseless civilians caught in the open but generally could not provide effective fire support to friendly units attempting to dislodge small groups of Soviet troops from the remains of Stalingrad's municipal buildings and factories.

The following is a list of factors that have contributed to the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of the preceding urban CAS operations. They are grouped into performance categories: weapons and equipment, command and control, rules of engagement, intelligence, tactics and training, logistics, ground-force cooperation, opposition countermeasures, atmospheric and light conditions, and geography and terrain.
In most cases, no one factor or performance category has been responsible for the overall effectiveness of a given urban operation. Nonetheless, certain conclusions can be drawn from the available historical evidence:
• Technological advances since the 1970s have generally enhanced the performance of CAS-related weapons and command and control systems in urban environments. • Passive and active countermeasures employed by opposing forces have degraded urban CAS performance from WWII on, despite advances in weapons and C2.
• Adverse weather and urban terrain have remained significant obstacles to close air support; however, improvements in precision guided munitions and aircraft navigation and targeting have reduced their impact to some extent.
• At Cassino and Aachen, U.S. air forces lacked heavy, delayed-action bombs that could reach into cellars and penetrate concrete emplacements occupied by German troops. 21
• Napalm proved to be the most effective ordnance at Hue because of the enemy's dug-in positions, proximity to friendly ground troops, and cover of well-constructed cement buildings.
Useful also was the delayed-action Snakeye bomb, which could be released at low altitude without knocking down the aircraft that dropped it.

• As a consequence of an overly complex air control system and the threat posed by Chechen gunfire to air controllers, Russian air forces operated virtually independently of ground units during the Battle of Grozny. This lack of communication resulted in many fratricides. 37
• During the Battle of Hue, allied concern for the safely of the city's remaining civilian residents initially resulted in restrictive ROE, which, along with the bad weather, countered U.S. and Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) advantages in aerial fire support.

• In Grenada, U.S. intelligence failed to anticipate the degree of initial resistance by Cuban advisers. Anticipating a short military intervention, planners were forced to put together a Tactical Air Control system on the fly. 45
• The complexity of the political-military situation during the U.S. peacekeeping operation in Beirut in the early 1980s made it extremely difficult to know whether any one position would be targeted and, if it was, who lay behind the attack. 46
• The tendency of XV Air Force bombers at Cassino to drop their munitions from too high an altitude, given the slight anti-aircraft threat and good visibility, meant that bombing accuracy was worse than it might otherwise have been.

Because the movement of fighter groups had not kept pace with the Allied ground advance, U.S. fighter-bombers were forced to operate from airfields over 100 miles from the front lines during the Battle of Aachen. The resulting logistics difficulties cost LX TAC almost one-third of its striking power. 54
• When military operations commenced in Chechnya, supplies of food, fuel, ammunition, and spare parts amounted to 50 percent of those required. The shortage in material resources compromised the ability of Russian aircrews to operate in adverse weather and to employ their weapons effectively. 55
Ground-Force Cooperation:
• At Stalingrad, Luftwaffe General Wolfram von Richthofen berated the German commander, von Paulus, for not taking better advantage of the suppressive power provided by von Richthofen's Stukas and Junker bombers so that ground assaults could be launched into the city. 56
• Likewise, U.S. Army Air Force's reports on the Battle of Cassino are critical of the infantry for not advancing quickly enough under barrage, as well as for relying too heavily on bombardment to neutralize German defensive positions. 
57
• Following the Grenada invasion, U.S. infantrymen were criticized for their failure to advance in the face of light opposition without overwhelming air and artillery support.

• Chechen rebels in Grozny countered Russian air superiority by deploying their tanks and guns in residential areas; attacking from hospitals, schools, and apartment blocks; and even breaking into Russian radio transmissions and directing Russian aircraft over the Russian's own troops. 67 Furthermore, the Chechen air defenses-which included SAMs (SA-13s and SA-16s) and radar-controlled AAA, in addition to heavy machine guns and RPGs-proved highly lethal to helicopters. As a result, the Russians used helicopters mostly for noncombat missions. 68
• During the first two days of the Bastogne battle, fog served as a protective screen for the American defenders and created confusion in the German ranks. However, the fog prevented Allied aircraft from providing support to engaged U.S. forces. 69
• At Hue, however, consistently low cloud ceilings, combined with restrictive ROE, prevented most close-support operations for three weeks. When aircraft were permitted to fly, they often did so at low altitudes, making it impossible to track targets. 70 67 NATO, 1995, pp. 2,6.

• Following the Panama invasion, AC-130 pilots indicated that smoke and fire may have obscured their targeting systems during the battle for La Commandancia, possibly contributing to the friendly-fire incident there. 
72
• During the initial assault on Grozny, poor weather-blowing snow, ice, and low cloud ceilings-ruled out visual bombing, as well as the use of electro-optical or laser-guided weapons. As a result, Russian Su-24 Fencers were forced to radar-bomb from medium altitude, which led to inaccurate deliveries and many Russian losses to friendly fire.

75
• At Cassino, the Germans made good use of the town's cellars and existing tunnels. Furthermore, their position atop Monte Cassino gave them unobstructed observation of Allied movements in the town, no matter how heavy the artillery fire or bombing. 76
• An integral part of the German Siegfried Line, Aachen had numerous strongpoints on each town flank and bunkers built of solid concrete that could stand up under a direct hit with a 500-lb bomb. 77
• In Beirut, Marine helicopter pilots claimed that they flew too fast to identify or hit targets in densely populated neighborhoods, even with the assistance of airborne FACs and gyro-stabilized binoculars. 78
• U.S. forces stationed in Panama had the good fortune of fighting over familiar terrain, thus reducing the psychological stress and uncertainty inherent in combat.
• With its open layout-of mostly low, modern buildings, practically devoid of civilian inhabitants-Khafji was a particularly favorable venue for the limited urban CAS conducted during that battie. 79
• On the one hand, the generally low-rise environment around Bakara Market, and the fact that most of the fighting was conducted in the open or from just inside buildings, provided relatively good fields of fire for attack helicopters flying close support operations on "Bloody Sunday." On the other hand, the low-rise environment and the neighborhood's narrow streets may have increased the danger to helicopters from RPG launchers. 80
From Leningrad to Sarajevo, aerial resupply and transport have played an important role in major urban operations. However, the inherent vulnerability of most logistics support aircraft has limited their employment and effectiveness in highly contested urban environments, particularly when the opposition has possessed significant air defenses. During WWII, aerial resupply operations were con-

Since the 1970s, technological advances have enabled airdrops to be made with great accuracy from high altitudes, at night and in poor weather. Even so, ensuring that the right people get the supplies has remained a problem. Furthermore, even well-executed airdrop operations cannot match the volume of cargo that can be moved through airport, sea, or ground alternatives.
Since WWII, the effectiveness of air-transport operations in contested urban areas has relied on one element: surprise. Prior to the 1960s, getting ground forces to the objective as quickly as possiblebefore the opposition had time to mount a coordinated defenserequired either that they be air-dropped or air-landed by transport plane or glider, preferably close to the target. To be effective, such an operation usually needed good weather, an exceptionally welltrained infantry force, a relatively weak opposition, and a large amount of luck.
Since the Vietnam War, helicopters have performed most trooptransport missions within urban areas. Their small size and maneuverability relative to transport planes-and, more recently, their aerial-refueling and nighttime capabilities-have enabled helicopters to drop off and pick up hundreds of individuals in fairly close urban terrain and to transport them safely over considerable distances. These characteristics have made helicopters especially useful in urban-related NEOs. Nonetheless, recent U.S. engagements in Somalia have demonstrated that even armored transport helicopters can be brought down by relatively unsophisticated weapons such as RPGs, making their employment problematic in nonpermissive urban situations.
Most of the major WWII air resupply operations conducted in urban areas ended in failure. During the siege of Leningrad, the early Soviet attempt to bring in emergency supplies by air transport fell far short of meeting the city's needs. The Soviet Air Force was able to fly in a mere 3,357 tons of food during the last two and a half months of 1941, even though the city's requirement for flour alone was 1,000 tons a day. Partly as a consequence, Leningrad seldom had more than one or two days of food in reserve before the Soviet government organized the massive resupply operations across Lake Ladoga.

The U.S. and its allies have had mixed results with regard to airborne and air assault operations in urban areas. During World War II's Operation Market-Garden in Holland, the British 1st Airborne Division suffered a disastrous defeat at Arnhem Bridge, losing all but 17 members of its original 509-man assault force.

Over the past several decades, NEOs in various corners of the world have tested U.S. airlift capabilities. Although no U.S. transport aircraft suffered combat damage during the evacuation from Saigon in 1975, poor contingency planning resulted in thousands of mostly Vietnamese evacuees being left to face the victorious Communist army.

The following is a list of factors that have contributed to the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of the preceding urban air logistics support operations. They are grouped into performance categories: equipment, command and control, political factors, intelligence, tactics and training, opposition countermeasures, atmospheric and light conditions, and geography and terrain. As with close air support, no one factor or performance category dominates. Nevertheless, the historical evidence appears to support the following conclusions:
• Aerial resupply technology has performed quite well since the Vietnam War; however, the vulnerability of transport aircraft remains a significant problem in contested urban areas.
• Political factors are important in special operations and NEOs that involve air transport.
• Superior tactics and training have played a large role in the success of air transport operations in urban areas.
• The presence or absence of significant adversary air defenses has remained a critical factor in urban air logistics operations since World War II.
• Although they have often created difficulties, adverse atmospheric and geographic conditions have generally not had a decisive effect on urban air logistics operations.
Somali RPG fire. During the October 3-4 firelight, two helicopters were shot down and three were damaged and forced to retire."
• In Bosnia, Kevlar armor was added to prevent small-arms rounds from penetrating the flight decks of allied transport aircraft. 
100
• AWADS was used for the first time since Vietnam during allied airdrop operations in Eastern Bosnia. There, airdrop accuracy was increased even further by a Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, which provided an aircraft's exact longitude and latitude and information on winds at drop altitude. However, whereas these systems are very effective for traditional, lowaltitude (e.g., 1500 ft) parachute drops, in Bosnia the concern over shoulder-fired infrared missiles had forced the C-130s to drop from altitudes between 10,000 and 24,000 ft. At these altitudes, the potential for substantial wind drift was great. Since winds at lower altitudes can vary greatly, it was enormously difficult to predict the exact landing spot. Thus, for accurate parachute delivery from medium altitudes, the parachute itself needs a guidance system, not just the aircraft. 102

Political Factors:
• For a long time, the Soviet government resisted dropping arms to the Polish Home Army during the WWII Warsaw rebellion, and it refused to allow British and U.S. planes to land on airfields under its control, dooming whatever slim chance the Allied airdrop operation had to succeed. 109
• U.S. and Belgian politicians in 1964 were sensitive to charges, by the Eastern bloc and other African states, of neo-colonialism with regard to the Congo, which delayed the initial airborne rescue operation in Stanleyville. After Paulis, that sensitivity was an important factor in preventing any further attempts to rescue European and American citizens caught up in the Congolese civil war. 110
• At the end of the Vietnam War, the U.S. ambassador's decision to delay the final evacuation of American citizens from Saigon left little time to notify and assemble those wishing to depart. Although planners provided for only a very limited number of helicopter sorties from the U.S. Embassy building, several thousand would-be evacuees showed up at that location, swamping the available transport. 111

Intelligence:
• At Arnhem, confusion over the location of German armored units and a mistaken belief that gliders could not land on polder (drained marshland) contributed to the British 1st Airborne Division's unfortunate selection of a staging site that was not only far from the intended target but turned out to be a rest area for an entire Panzer division. 113
• By contrast, inaccurate intelligence led the 82nd Airborne Division to plan for substantial armored resistance at Nijmegan, thereby assisting General Gavin's troops in dealing with less formidable German opposition. 114
• Because of the U.S. Embassy's initial overstatement of the threat to U.S. citizens and property in Monrovia, U.S. Marines received sufficient training and preparation time to carry off a remarkably smooth NEO when one became necessary during the summer of 1990. 115
• While not fatal to the operation, initial uncertainly about the location of the U.S. Embassy in Somalia hampered rescuers involved in the 1991 Mogadishu NEO. The embassy had moved from the center of Mogadishu to the suburbs 18 months before, but Marine amphibious forces in control of rescue helicopters had only a 1969 map of the city.

Tactics and Training:
• The Luftwaffe refused to allow army quartermasters to supervise the loading of transports. As a result, famished German soldiers at Stalingrad opened cases of worthless goods. 117
• During Operation Market-Garden, British and U.S. paratroopers employed different airborne landing tactics, with markedly different results. At Arnhem, airborne landings were spread out over three days, and 1st Division paratroopers were dropped 6 to 8 miles from their intended target of Arnhem Bridge. 
118
• The two Congo operations also featured a crucial difference in tactics. During the initial operation at Stanleyville, Belgian paratroopers waited for armored Jeeps to arrive at the airfield before moving into town, thus providing the rebels' time to begin killing their hostages. At Paulis, one company of paratroopers immediately moved out in search of hostages, probably saving a number of lives. 120
• At An Loc, the USAF's use of GRADS in an attempt to resupply the town from high altitudes was initially stymied by ill-trained Vietnamese parachute packers. Until the U.S. Army sent in packing specialists from Okinawa, parachutes regularly malfunctioned, causing bundles to drift outside the drop zone and into enemy hands.

• During the German airlift at Stalingrad, the Soviets reinforced their anti-aircraft batteries and sent fighters to harass German supply planes. 127
• During the Warsaw Uprising, German AAA made precision airdrops by the Allies impracticable. Further complicating precision, the insurgents occupied only small and widely spread enclaves by the time the resupply operation got seriously under way. 128
• Although enemy air defenses managed to knock down a number of airlifters, the first phase of the air resupply effort at Bastogne was assisted by the Germans, who directed very litüe fire on the drop zone itself. 
129
• The poor marksmanship of airfield defenders facilitated U.S. air transport operations in the Congo in 1964. 131
• At An Loc, the low-altitude Container Delivery System (CDS), initially employed to provide supplies to the besieged population, relied on surprise and limited adversary air defenses. However, the Communists quickly positioned AAA, and later SA-7 missiles, on all possible air approaches to the town. As a 127 Latimer (1985, p. 48) attributes most of the success in interdicting the German air resupply effort to the constant operation of Soviet pursuit planes. See also

result, several allied aircraft were lost, and transport planes were forced to fly above 10,000 ft in order to survive. 
132
• During the Bosnian War, the Serbs possessed many large-caliber weapons that could have been employed to disrupt the international air resupply effort in Sarajevo. This potential was particularly serious because the Serbs controlled the mountainous terrain surrounding the Bosnian capital. Although small-arms fire remained a problem, the threat of retaliation by the NATO allies seems to have constrained the Serbs from targeting airlifters with AAAandSAMs. 134
• Low clouds, fog, and blizzards appeared in the vicinity of Stalingrad in 1942, forcing German transport aircraft to detour to bases hundreds of miles away and leaving the increasingly isolated 6th Army without access to the planes' cargoes for several days at a time. This problem was exacerbated by winter icewhich tore up aircraft engines-and cold-which made it difficult for mechanics to perform necessary aircraft maintenance. 
135
• At An Loc, nighttime operations involved less risk to aircrews from hostile anti-aircraft fire than operations occurring during the day. However, they were generally less accurate, and ground parties and FACs had trouble observing where the packages were falling. 138
• By the time of the Bosnian War, night and adverse weather permitted allied transport aircraft to hide from optically or IRguided Serbian air defense weapons without degrading airdrop accuracy. However, deep snow made it difficult for besieged Muslims to recover fallen parcels. 
139
• Warsaw was at the maximum range of Anglo-American bombers attempting to resupply Polish insurgents during WWII. Without Soviet landing rights, Allied aircraft were forced to return to bases in Italy during daylight, over German-occupied Hungary and Yugoslavia, where the heavy planes were easy pickings for Nazi fighters. 140
• The availability of a large, clear, gently sloping field directly west of town was a positive factor in successful U.S. resupply operations at Bastogne. 141
• The small size of the drop zone at An Loc meant that many airdrops that just missed the target ended up in the hands of the enemy. 142
• During the Saigon NEO, the U.S. Embassy rooftop, which was used throughout the embassy evacuation as a landing zone for CH-46 transport helicopters, could not support the weight of the larger CH-53s. Consequently, CH-53 operations took place in the embassy parking lot. This location and the larger-than-expected number of evacuees caused the evacuation process to be extended far beyond the planned completion time.
143
• The location of the U.S. raid on "Bloody Sunday," in the heart of Habr Gidr clan's territory in central Mogadishu, led to the unraveling of the operation after Task Force Ranger became pinned down. With hundreds of thousands of clan members living in the vicinity, it was one of the few places where Aideed's forces could quickly mount a serious fight. In addition, the urbanized terrain of densely packed buildings and narrow streets offered few landing zones large enough for helicopters to extract ground troops.

Although not often considered as instruments of urban operations, air interdiction and aerial siege support have affected the outcome of city battles from Leningrad to Khafji. When successful, interdiction 146 has helped to isolate the urban battlefield, metering or disrupting the flow of opposition reinforcements and supplies and providing friendly forces with the long-term advantage in the close-in batüe. Historically, effective urban interdiction operations have required air superiority, an abundance of available bombers, good weather, moderately open terrain, and a mechanized opposition force with long and constricted lines of communication (LOC). Major factors inhibiting interdiction in the past have included the ability of some opponents to off-load supplies onto ever smaller conveyances and to perform logistics operations under the cover of darkness. However, the development of precision air-ground weapons, advanced C4ISR systems, and nighttime attack capabilities has added significantly to interdiction's effectiveness in recent years-to the point where coalition ground forces during the Battle for Khafji were able to quickly turn back a two-brigade Iraqi attack.
By contrast, aerospace power has had only moderate success as an instrument of siege warfare. Barring a sudden and massive attack on a city, urban residents generally appear to become accustomed to the terror and destruction of aerial bombing, sometimes to the extent that their suffering becomes a source of pride, fueling their desire to resist. This appears to have been the case during the Germans' 3-year siege of Leningrad during World War II. The experience of the Israelis with aerial bombardment during the 1982 siege of Beirut was somewhat more positive, possibly because they used aerospace power in a more discriminating fashion: as a means for dividing PLO fighters from the local Lebanese population. Still, Israel lacked the forces and the will to destroy the PLO through conventional bombing alone.
Attempts by both sides in the European theater during WWII to interdict the supply lines of forces moving toward urban combat zones proved more effective on the Western Front than on the Eastern Front. Although the Luftwaffe strafed and bombed Leningrad's "ice bridge" (a frozen lake that supplies were driven across in winter), particularly where large fissures in the ice caused a pileup of supply vehicles, it failed to halt traffic for long or, more important, to destroy the loading and unloading facilities on Lake Ladoga's shores. 
147
In addition, German artillery and aircraft struck Russian footbridges, making daytime river crossings nearly impossible. Nonetheless, nighttime resupply and reinforcement continued.

The following is a list of factors that have contributed to the effectiveness (or ineffectiveness) of the preceding urban interdiction and siege-support operations. They are grouped into performance categories: weapons and equipment, command and control, intelligence, tactics and training, ground-force cooperation, opposition countermeasures, atmospheric and light conditions, and geography and terrain. In general, the results indicate that the technical ability of first-class aerospace forces to conduct urban interdiction and siegesupport operations has improved considerably since the 1980s. Furthermore, incomplete intelligence information and misguided tactics have decreased operational effectiveness in recent decades, but usually not to a fatal degree. Finally, although quite significant during WWII, performance categories such as ground-force cooperation, opposition countermeasures, and atmospheric and geographic conditions appear to have mattered less in recent decades.
Weapons/Equipment:
• Once the Eighth Air Corps had been withdrawn from the battle, German forces outside Leningrad were left with few divebombers and only about 300 planes of all types. As a result, German aircraft could not bomb with sufficient intensity to significantly disrupt Soviet resupply operations. 155
• By contrast, with the exception of the British Bomber Command, every Allied air force spent considerable effort in the early weeks of Operation Overlord interdicting German forces. For example, during the first half of June 1944, Eighth Air Force strategic bombers devoted almost all their sorties to tactical interdiction. 156
• Still, Anglo-American aircraft during WWII had to expend a substantial amount of ordnance to destroy fixed interdiction targets 
155 Goure, 1962

157
158
• By permitting accurate attacks from medium altitudes (13,000 to 30,000 ft), the Persian Gulf War confirmed the superiority of PGMs over dumb bombs. Although the GBU-12 constituted nearly 50 percent of all smart bombs dropped by American forces, the Maverick missile, fired primarily from A-10s, proved highly effective in interdicting Iraq's mechanized forces outside ofKhafji. 160
Command and Control:
• By the time of the Ardennes counteroffensive, IX TAC had developed a highly efficient control system for fighter planes. That system included forward director posts, radar centers, fighter control stations, and a combat command. 161 Furthermore, Maj Gen Pete Quesada's fighter command was the first to integrate the Microwave Early Warning (MEW) radar and the SCR-584 anti-aircraft radar to provide navigation and precise control to fighter-bombers during ground-attack missions. 162
Khafji provides an example of how a well-oiled command and control system can help ensure successful urban interdiction operations. Once Iraqi offensive intentions were apparent, the Coalition Air Operations Center moved quickly to redirect already-scheduled sorties toward moving enemy forces. Air attacks were tunneled into the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (KTO) from different altitudes and directions using a grid of designated "kill boxes" 163 as a control measure.

• Following the withdrawal of the South Vietnamese army from the main fire-support base outside An Loc in 1972, the surrounding area was left devoid of friendly ground troops, which severely hampered allied intelligence efforts. USAF forward air controllers and remaining elements of the U.S. 1st Air Cavalry regiment were spread so thinly that they could provide little definite information about the locations of the three Communist divisions moving in the direction of the provincial capital.
166
• Subsequently, however, South Vietnamese intelligence sources provided accurate information on Communist plans to intercept an ARVN unit coming south from An Loc to assist forces attempting to relieve the town. This information resulted in a B-52 ARCLIGHT strike that totally decimated a North Vietnamese regiment.

• In Beirut, the Israelis made a distinction between PLO-controlled areas and camps in the southwest and the northwestern part of the city, where Lebanese Sunnis predominated. For example, PLO areas were subjected to numerous flyovers, flare drops, and sonic booms intended to intimidate the families of PLO members. 
169
• The Finns' refusal to close the Lake Ladoga corridor to Leningrad early on, and the subsequent failure of the German Tikhvin offensive, probably doomed any chance Germany had to halt the flow of supplies to Russia's second-most important city. 
170
• For Khafji, friendly ground forces in the area were limited to primarily border reconnaissance teams and the U.S. Marine Task Force Shepherd, a two-battalion screening force 172 for the 1st Marine Division down at Kibrit. 
173
• To counter direct enemy bombardment during the siege of Leningrad, the Soviets relied on significant air defenses, including over 100 fighters, numerous anti-aircraft guns, barrage balloons, and searchlights. 174
• The success of the Soviet "ice bridge" operation, in the face of German bombardment and severe weather, was ensured only after the truck convoy system was abandoned. That system hampered drivers willing to make several trips in a row across Ladoga. Egged on by local Communist Party, Komsomol, and NKVD officials, 175 individual truck drivers were able to make as many as four round trips a day during shifts lasting from 16 to 18 hours. 176
• At Stalingrad, German attempts at interdicting the Soviet LOC across the Volga and the Don rivers were hindered by several Soviet countermeasures, including protecting the railway lines with fighters and AAA, unloading supplies from trains onto trucks as far as 150 miles from the front, employing large numbers of troops to hand-carry supplies, and constructing pontoon bridges just beneath the river's surface to hide them from accurate artillery fire and dive bombers. 177

• In addition, the Palestinians in Beirut protected themselves from air attack by keeping their units small and highly mobile and by constantly changing their locations. Moreover, having had plenty of time to prepare for Israeli bombardment, they developed an extensive network of underground tunnels and trenches. 178
• Bad weather turned out to be a more effective interdiction asset against the Soviet resupply operation across Lake Ladoga than German air or artillery. For example, snowstorms and blizzards occurred on 22 days during the month of February 1942, requiring nearly constant snow-removal operations to keep the ice road open. 
179
• The weather worked against the German interdiction effort at Stalingrad. When the Soviets finally broke through the Don River barrier, both Soviet and German air forces were grounded by the weather. 180
• During the initial period of the Ardennes offensive, low cloud ceilings and snow prevented Allied fighter-bombers from making any substantial strikes against German columns. But as soon as the clouds cleared, U.S. and British planes took to the sky in large numbers, just when German supply lines were stretched to the limit. 181
• During the Khafji operation, aerospace power operated almost as effectively at night as during the day. The Low Altitude Navigation and Targeting Infrared for Night (LANTIRN)equipped F-15E scored first-pass kills against individual Iraqi vehicles at night and in bad weather. 
182
Geography and Terrain:
• In the battles of Leningrad and Stalingrad, the Soviets possessed certain geographical advantages that frustrated German interdiction efforts. Owing to the failure of the Finns to press their initial advantage against the Red Army and link up with German forces in the south, the Soviets retained a 50-mile-wide corridor between the city of Leningrad and the far shore of Lake Ladoga.
As suggested earlier, this became a significant advantage in resupplying the city once the lake froze and the "ice bridge" was constructed.
• The location of Stalingrad on the west bank of the Volga River permitted the east bank to be utilized as a fairly secure supply base and location for indirect-fire artillery. Because that artillery required vast quantities of ammunition, the Soviets may not have been able to meet their overall logistics needs in the initial period of the battle if the artillery had been forced to move across the river. 184
• The hilly terrain of the Ardennes, traversed by narrow rural roads with few exits, benefited Allied fighter-bombers attempting to interdict German armored reinforcements. Allied pilots were able to block entire columns with solitary strikes aimed at lead vehicles, taking out the remaining enemy vehicles at their Despite this extensive record, the effectiveness of American aerospace power in urban operations has varied so much throughout the years that no general trend is discernible. With regard to close air support, Cherbourg, An Loc, and Panama can be counted as successes, and Aachen, Hue, and Grenada as failures. Whereas CAS difficulties during World War II often stemmed from the inability of existing air weaponry to destroy fortified defenses, in recent times, they have had more to do with a heightened concern over friendly military and noncombatant casualties.
As to logistics support, U.S. air forces have been successful in resupplying besieged cities, such as An Loc and Sarajevo, but have had serious problems with troop transport in cities such as Mogadishu, where the opposition possessed numerous, albeit rather unsophisticated, means of air defense. For its part, the Air Force has demonstrated considerable success in observing and interdicting the movement of enemy forces and supplies bound for such urban battlefields as Cherbourg, Bastogne, and Khafji.
Because of the variety of examples, no simple formula for aerospace force success can be derived from past urban operations. Nevertheless, a few general historical observations can be made:
• Urban close air support has usually been easier to conduct when friendly ground forces were on the defensive (e.g., Bastogne and An Loc) rather than on the offensive (e.g., Cassino and Hue).
• Urban airdrops have at times been very precise and useful but, unless the target population was highly concentrated as at An Loc, usually have not replaced other means of resupply.
• Helicopter transport within contested urban areas has become quite hazardous.
• At least in conventional conflicts, interdiction of the approaches to a city occupied by hostile forces has often been the most effective means of aerial fire support.
• Employing aerospace forces to support siege operations, such as the Israelis did in Beirut, has become militarily feasible, but would probably be politically unwise for a democratic country like the United States.
Most of the same factors that have contributed to effective air operations in other environments have been successfully applied in urban settings as well, including the following:
Careful mission planning to ensure that air assets are used appropriately
The ability to suppress or circumvent opposition air defenses
Most important, identifiable and targetable adversary forces (i.e., not too dispersed, hidden, fortified, or intermixed with civilians and/or friendly troops).

Cueing. Imagine that we have a surveillance aircraft equipped with a sophisticated Moving Target Indicator (MTI)/synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and computers that can detect, track, and classify moving ground vehicles. This aircraft normally operates at altitudes of 30,000 to 35,000 ft. Assume that, on flat terrain, this aircraft can detect moving vehicles 100 nmi away. The maximum depression angle of the aircraft's radar beam is 45°. Our notional surveillance platform can sweep a sector 120° in azimuth. Figure 4.3 illustrates how such a platform would perform over fairly flat and open terrain.

In this context, as in all others in this report, aerospace power is a convenient shorthand expression that embraces not only air vehicles, sensors, and munitions, but also space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) and all the intangibles, such as training, tactics, command and control, and concepts of operations, that allow those hardware components to deliver desired operational effects. Aerospace power, moreover, is not limited to USAF equities but entails a medium of force employment in which all services have something important to contribute.
The law of the instrument stipulates that when all one has is a hammer, everything in sight looks like a nail in need of pounding.
For further development of these points, see Lt Gen George K. Muellner, USAF, "Technologies for Air Power in the 21st Century," paper presented at a conference on "Air Power and Space-Future Perspectives" sponsored by the Royal Air 1-orce, Westminster, London, England, September12-13,1996.

For example, the 1925 Geneva Protocol for the Prohibition of the Use in War of Asphyxiating, Poisonous or Other Gases and of Bacteriological Methods of Warfare prohibits the use of some types of chemical weapons.
The 1977 Protocols Additional to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 (often referred to simply as Protocol I and Protocol II) spell out specific sets of rules to govern international and internal conflicts. The United States has not ratified the Protocols; it has declared its intention to be bound by them to the extent that they reflect customary law. Michael J. Matheson, "The United States Position on the Relation of Customary International Law to the 1977 Protocols Additional to the 1949 Geneva Conventions," American University Journal ofInternationalLaw and Policy, Vol. 2,1987, pp
. 419-431.4  John G. Humphries, "Operations Law and the Rules of Engagement," Airp'owerJournal, Vol. 6, No. 3, Fall 1992, pp. 38-39, describes how international legal norms have been internalized by military planners and operators, particularly since the Vietnam War.
Article 51(5) (b) of Protocol I prohibits "an attack which maybe expected to cause incidental loss of civilian life, injury to civilians, damage to civilian objects, or a combination thereof, which would be excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated." The United States has accepted this provision as reflecting international law.Matheson, 1987, p. 426. Although this principle is almost universally regarded internationally as law, its precise meaning remains elusive, in part because of the inherent difficulties in measuring, and then weighing, expected military gain and civilian
harm.9 AFP 110-31,1976,

For a critical account of coalition attacks on the Iraqi electric system and its aftereffects, see Middle EastWatch, 1991, pp. 171-193. Note that the long-term effects of these attacks resulted, in part, not only from international sanctions but also from resource-allocation decisions by the Iraqi
government.29  See, for example, John A. Warden III, "The Enemy As a System," Air PowerJournal,  Vol. DC, No. 1, Spring 1995, p. 49, who argues that "[u]nless the stakes in the war are very high, most states will make desired concessions when their power-generation system is put under sufficient pressure or actually destroyed."
However, it must be noted that effectiveness and casually concerns are not entirely independent. For example, U.S. political leadership may be willing to tolerate higher risk levels of U.S. or civilian casualties, but only so long as they would ensure higher levels of effectiveness. And, as explained above, low levels of military effectiveness may erode public tolerance for casualties.

In theory, a large random sample of cities would yield data that more closely reflect the true mix of physical characteristics and spatial patterns found in all of the world's cities. However, the resources and time required to produce accurate aerial photographs, analyze and classify different areas within the cities, and confirm measurements are so large that the random-sample approach is probably not practical.
This situation highlights the need for the development and deployment of advanced infrared countermeasures (IRCM) to increase the survivability of aerial platforms operating over urban terrain.
The calculations here assume a flat earth so that simple trigonometry can be used. The actual angles are slightly different at long ranges such as 100 nmi. However, even at 100 nmi, the differences are quite small; at shorter ranges, there is almost no difference at all. depression angle is derived from simple trigonometric calculations similar to those in Appendix A.
Chapter Six explains how these and other sensors could be used to support the sensor-cueing concept discussed here. For now, it is worth noting that line-of-sight limitations would require an urban sensor network made up of hundreds or thousands of UGS, with the highest density of sensors in the urban core.
See Vick et al., 1996, Chapter Four.   
Chapter Six presents more details on, and an operational concept for using, VTOL UAVs in the urban environment.
Minimum viewing angles were computed using the street-width and buildingheight data from Table4.4 and trigonometric calculations like those shown in Appendix A.
In the long run, other sensor technologies, such as through-the-wall radar, might be used to supplement, or in some cases replace, EO sensors for targets inside buildings. Chapter Six describes these technologies.
This makes sense, because these buildings are attached to their neighbors on either side.

A11 of our concepts assume that the USAF will acquire the ability to do near-realtime three-dimensional imaging of urban environments and that this imaging will be used to produce a three-dimensional coordinate system for navigation, battle management, and weapon-system guidance.
We envision not only a lethal fragmenting warhead of roughly grenade size, but also incapacitating gas, a stun grenade, or other nonlethal weapons as other possibilities.
That is, they would be difficult or impossible to detect with the naked eye. If the adversary had radar coverage or advanced IR systems, these aircraft would be detectable.

Laser radars are routinely used by private-sector mapping companies to produce 3-D maps of cities. The radar-equipped aircraft must fly above certain minimum altitudes to avoid the risk that anyone on the ground might have their eyes exposed to dangerous levels/frequencies of laser energy.

This level of accuracy is achieved by processing out the GPS bias.
A milliradian, abbreviated mr, is approximately 0.0573°. At a range of 1 km, an angle of 1 mr subtends exactly 1 m, i.e., 1/1000th of the range-a convenient unit.
The smaller the spot size, the higher the resolution.
Azimuth information is obtained by Doppler-processing a sequence of these pulses as the sensor moves along its flight path or orbit.

The weather also forced a change of plan with regard to the 82nd's arrival at Torrijos International Airport. Rather than landing on the airport runway, the transport aircraft dumped the paratroopers from the air in three waves. In the process, paratroopers became intermixed with Rangers involved in clearing operations on the ground, some of whom were still engaged in minor firefights with the PDF.

A major drawback to employing very small, remotely piloted aircraft in certain scenarios in urban operations is that they may not have sufficient range or endurance to be recovered. Clearly, this may not be an issue if there are sanctuaries controlled by friendlies within the city, or not too far outside. The question we address in this appendix is whether it is feasible to reuse mini-unmanned aerial vehicles (mini-UAVs) or micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) by recharging them, using either solar energy or microwave beams directed downward by high-altitude UAVs.
The assumed characteristics of the UAVs are listed in Table 
B
1 » 2
The approximate ratio of the weights of the two aircraft featured in the table is nearly 100, yet, surprisingly, the average electrical power expended per unit area of wing surface is only 20 percent lower in the micro-UAV. For both platforms, interestingly, the power density is somewhat less than the maximum irradiance of the sun, i.e., 0.137 W/cm 2 . If solar panels were able to transform solar photons to electricity with at least 60-percent efficiency, the aircraft could fly on Muzzle blast and flash are the acoustic and infrared (IR) signatures associated with the ejection of the bullet from the sniper's rifle. 
1
The bullet's shock wave is a mini-sonic boom resulting from the bullet traveling at speeds faster than sound. 
2
However, this countermeasure reduces the sniper's ability to penetrate armor.
Like most aerodynamic bodies, the bullet sheds vortices in flight, creating disturbances in atmospheric pressure along its trajectory. These vortices produce gradients in the atmosphere's refractive index that can be detected, in principle, with laser radars. None of the systems in Figure C.l is designed to detect this signature.
The thermal signature of the bullet in flight can be detected with IR sensors out to several kilometers in range. Since the bullet is much hotter than "room temperature," it is detected most effectively in the medium-wave infrared (MWIR) band, with wavelength between 3 The object of detecting signatures of the bullet in flight is to estimate the bullet's trajectory and backtrack to find the location of the sniper. Acoustic sensors are passive. Taken singly, they can measure angles to the acoustic source, but not the range. To establish a track of the bullet requires that an array of acoustic sensors be deployed. 
3
Urban noise and glare make all of the systems that depend for initial cues on muzzle flashes or blasts subject to high false-alarm rates. For this reason, there is a trend toward multiple-phenomenology systems, which look for coincident detections of acoustic and IR events.
The backtracking process in the city is complicated by buildings, which may obstruct the view of the sniper's window. If much of the bullet track is visible, it is feasible to use the urban models discussed in Chapters Five and Six to complete the backtrack in the virtual world of the computer. This procedure could provide GPS coordinates for a weapon delivered from a UAV.
Laser systems that illuminate potential hiding places, or "hides," and detect retro-reflections from the sniper's scope are referred to as optical augmentation systems. These systems have the advantage of possibly detecting the sniper before he fires his weapon. The downside is that the sniper can employ antireflection filters that selectively block the wavelength of the laser. Tunable lasers may reduce the effectiveness of blocking filters in the future.
This report has investigated the conceptual, legal-political, physical, and technological underpinnings of present-day urban air operations. This appendix looks at the historical record to determine the role that aerospace forces have played in past urban batties, the tasks that they have been assigned, and the conditions that have contributed to their effectiveness or ineffectiveness. The result is an overview of urban air operations from World War II to Bosnia, focusing on battles in which a major purpose of aerospace power was to assist friendly ground forces and/or civilians in contested urban areas. We emphasize U.S. air operations but have sought to learn from any air force that conducted urban operations. The intention is to cover a range of operational examples from urban warfare to military operations other than war (MOOTW); include both successful and unsuccessful urban operations; incorporate a variety of aerospace power tasks; and examine the employment of fixed-and rotary-wing aircraft in an urban environment.
This appendix concludes that all four U.S. military services have accumulated considerable experience in providing air support to joint urban operations during periods of war and relative peace. Despite this extensive record, the effectiveness of U.S. aerospace power in urban operations has varied so much throughout the years that no general trend is discernible. Furthermore, although this appendix analyzes the circumstances where aerospace forces have and have not been effective, the wide array of past examples of urban operations makes it impossible to offer a formula for aerospace force success that would fit the majority of cases. That said, we should note December 23, P-47 fighter bombers from the XIX Tactical Air Command (TAC) carried out hundreds of precision strikes against German positions all around the besieged town, contributing greatly to the 101st Airborne Division's successful defense of this vital communications center.

That only 20 or so transport aircraft (out of 64) were operational at any time substantially diminished the ability of the Soviet military to supply the city of Leningrad by air.

^"However, the U.S. 82nd and 101st Divisions took better advantage of their limited transport resources than did the British 1st Division.
