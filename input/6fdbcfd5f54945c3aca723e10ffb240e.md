This research follows and expands a previous study that examined and compared the 30 insurgencies begun and completed worldwide between 1978 and 2008, published in 2010 as Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Sources of Success in Counterinsurgency. 1  This report supersedes that earlier publication in most respects. Like the original effort, the research documented here recounts the demonstrated effectiveness of a variety of counterinsurgency (COIN) concepts through case studies of insurgencies. However, the base of evidence has been expanded to 71 cases-all of the insurgencies completed worldwide between 1944 and 2010.
In addition to expanding the number and scope of the cases, the effort entailed broadening the accompanying analyses. All analyses conducted as part of the original effort are repeated, but several new ones have been added, including an analysis of the duration of insurgencies and of factors that are unique to cases involving support to the counterinsurgent force from an outside actor.
This report presents findings from all the analyses and explains the study's case selection and methods. It also presents an overview and in-depth assessments of the key concepts, practices, and factors that feature prominently in successful COIN operations. The 41 new case studies are summarized in the companion volume, Paths to Victory:
iv Paths to Victory: Lessons from Modern Insurgencies http://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR291z2.html). A companion volume to the original study, Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Detailed Counterinsurgency Case Studies, includes detailed case histories for each of the original 30 COIN campaigns.

30 insurgencies begun and completed worldwide between 1978 and 2008. 5
This research quantitatively tested the performance of 24 COIN concepts against the historical record. These concepts were identified through a survey of the existing literature and based on previous research in this area. Some of the concepts were drawn from classical perspectives on COIN from the previous century, such as pacification and resettlement; others are contemporary concepts suggested for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as "boots on the ground" and the concept implicit in U.S. Army Field Manual 3-24, Counterinsurgency. 
6
The selected cases are the 71 most recent resolved insurgencies, spanning the period from World War II through 2010.

The data include several subsets of interest. First, we divided the 59 core cases into 44 "iron fist" cases, in which the primary emphasis of the COIN force was preponderantly (and often almost exclusively) on eliminating the insurgent threat, and 15 motive-focused cases, with primary or at least balanced attention to addressing the motives for beginning and sustaining the insurgency. Second, we isolated the 28 cases in which a major power contributed forces to the counterinsurgent side, further dividing the set into the 13 cases in which such force contributions were limited to advisers, special operations forces, or air power and the 15 cases in which significant external ground forces were present.
Because this research was vast in scope, the results are rich, detailed, and sometimes complicated. Different readers may find different aspects of our findings to be particularly interesting or illuminating; this section presents findings that we have identified as particularly important to formulating and supporting successful COIN operations.
Table 
S
Seventeen of the 24 concepts had strong empirical support. 
8
In the discussion of the next key finding, we single out three of the strongly supported concepts for more detailed attention because they were identified as priority concepts that were always implemented by victorious COIN forces.
Effective COIN Practices Run in Packs, and Some Practices Are Always in the Pack: Tangible Support Reduction, Commitment and Motivation, and Flexibility and Adaptability One of the key findings reported in Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Sources of Success in Counterinsurgency was that "effective COIN practices tend to run in packs," meaning that COIN forces that defeated insurgencies implemented numerous effective practices rather than just a few. 
9
• tangible support reduction • commitment and motivation • flexibility and adaptability.
Implementation of all three of these concepts appears to be prerequisite for COIN success, based on the core historical data underlying this study.
Tangible support refers to the ability of the insurgents to maintain needed levels of recruits, weapons and materiel, funding, intelligence, and sanctuary. In every COIN win, COIN forces managed to substantially reduce tangible support to the insurgents; only two COIN forces managed to substantially reduce insurgent tangible support and still lost.
xxiv Paths to Victory: Lessons from Modern Insurgencies Tangible support is not the same as popular support. Although tangible support can come from a supporting population, it can also come from an external supporter-either a state sponsor or a diaspora or other nonstate sponsor. This report echoes the finding from Victory Has a Thousand Fathers that "tangible support trumps popular support."
10
Commitment and motivation refers to the extent to which the government and COIN forces demonstrated that they were actually committed to defeating the insurgency, rather than maximizing their own personal wealth and power, bilking external supporters by extending the conflict, or avoiding (or fleeing) combat. In all COIN wins, both the government and the COIN force demonstrated their commitment and motivation, whereas the insurgents won all 17 of the cases in which commitment and motivation were assessed as lacking. 
11
Flexibility and adaptability captures the ability of COIN forces to adjust to changes in insurgent strategy or tactics. While some COIN forces failed to adapt in (and lost) early or intermediate phases in cases that they still managed to win, all successful COIN forces made any necessary adaptations in the decisive phase of each case.
A regular theme in discussions about insurgency is that "every insurgency is unique." The distinct narratives for the 71 cases examined here lead the authors to concur, except that those distinct or unique characteristics do not matter at this level of analysis. All the findings of this study hold across the core cases without an exception for unique narratives or cases. 
12
S
Subtracting the total number of bad practices in the decisive phase of each case from the total number of good practices produces a scorecard score. If the score is negative (more bad practices than good), then the case was a COIN loss; if the score is positive (more good practices than bad), the case was a COIN win. This holds without exception. Table 
S
12
The COIN force reduced at least three tangible support factors.
The government realized at least one government legitimacy factor.
Government corruption was reduced/good governance increased since the onset of the conflict.
The COIN force realized at least one intelligence factor.
The COIN force was of sufficient strength to force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas.
Unity of effort/unity of command was maintained.
The COIN force avoided excessive collateral damage, disproportionate use of force, or other illegitimate application of force.
The COIN force sought to engage and establish positive relations with the population in the area of conflict.
Short-term investments, improvements in infrastructure or development, or property reform occurred in the area of conflict controlled or claimed by the COIN force.
The majority of the population in the area of conflict supported or favored the COIN force.
The COIN force established and then expanded secure areas.
Government/COIN reconstruction/ development sought/achieved improvements that were substantially above the historical baseline.
The COIN force provided or ensured the provision of basic services in areas that it controlled or claimed to control.
The perception of security was created or maintained among the population in areas that the COIN force claimed to control.
The COIN force used both collective punishment and escalating repression.
There was corrupt and arbitrary personalistic government rule.
Host-nation elites had perverse incentives to continue the conflict.
An external professional military engaged in fighting on behalf of the insurgents.
The host nation was economically dependent on external supporters.
Fighting was initiated primarily by the insurgents.
The COIN force failed to adapt to changes in adversary strategy, operations, or tactics.
The COIN force engaged in more coercion or intimidation than the insurgents.
The insurgent force was individually superior to the COIN force by being either more professional or better motivated.
The COIN force or its allies relied on looting for sustainment.
The COIN force and government had different goals or levels of commitment. Of perennial interest to scholars of insurgency are the force requirements for effective COIN. The granularity of data in these cases does not allow for conclusions regarding force ratios between COIN forces and insurgents, nor does it allow us to identify specific COIN force composition ratios of regular forces, police, special operations forces, or paramilitaries. These analyses do support some higher-level observations that should be of interest nonetheless. First, in no case did the COIN force win unless it overmatched the insurgents and could force them to fight as guerrillas by the decisive phase of the conflict. Governments that attempted to transition their COIN forces to overmatch the insurgents usually sought to increase both the quality and the quantity of their COIN forces. While quantity may have a quality all its own, COIN force quality appears to have been more important than quantity in every case in which it mattered among the historical cases examined here.
Second, most COIN forces used significant numbers of police, paramilitary troops, or militia personnel, with virtually no correlation with outcome. This was because, too often, these forces were inadequately armed or trained or otherwise ineffective. However, in the 23 cases in which police or paramilitaries were not ineffective, COIN forces won 69 percent of the time. This is another historical endorsement of the importance of quality of COIN forces and, further, an endorsement of the inclusion of such forces, if they can be adequately prepared. 
13
We repeated all the analyses for the subset of cases that involved forces from an external major power in support of the government (28 cases). The findings show that external or externally supported COIN forces Summary xxix win almost as often as wholly indigenous COIN forces. This suggests that using external forces is not inherently a bad COIN practice. Further, results for cases involving COIN support by external actors match results from the core data; the same concepts whose implementation was correlated with COIN success in the broader data were also correlated with success in the external actor cases.
The external actor analysis raised two cautions. First, as noted previously, commitment and motivation of the government and COIN force are critical to COIN success. This holds in external actor cases as well. No external COIN force or externally supported COIN force was able to prevail if the host-nation government was insufficiently committed. The caution, then, is for would-be external supporters: You can't want it more than they do! Second, every case that involved external professional forces supporting the insurgents was a COIN loss, unless it was balanced by external professional forces supporting the government. This caution applies to those who advocate a "light footprint" in supporting COIN forces or support restricted to advisers, special operations forces, and air power. History suggests that if insurgents have external conventional forces on their side, the COIN force needs such support, too.
The historical cases primarily followed one of two paths: The "iron fist" path, with a focus preponderantly (and often almost exclusively) on eliminating the insurgent threat, or the motive-focused path, with primary or at least balanced attention to addressing the motives for beginning and sustaining the insurgency. Figure S.2 shows these two new conceptual divisions and how they relate to one another.
While both paths can lead to success, historically, COIN forces following the iron fist path won only 32 percent of the time, while those on the motive-focused or mixed path won 73 percent of the time. Not only have iron fist COIN efforts failed more often than they have succeeded, but they have almost always involved atrocities or other COIN force behaviors that are considered "beyond the pale" by contemporary American ethical standards.
xxx Paths to Victory: Lessons from Modern Insurgencies While this finding appears particularly relevant to ongoing debates between advocates of population-centric and enemy-centric COIN, this report argues that different categories provide better context for these results and provide a more nuanced understanding of COIN going forward. Iron fist COIN forces struggle because of their focus on the insurgents at the expense of a focus on support for those insurgents, as well as their focus on kinetic action (fighting, killing, capturing) to eliminate the insurgents at the expense of efforts to diminish the motives for the insurgency (and for supporting the insurgents). Successful COIN forces find a balance on the spectrums of focal targets (insurgent support or the insurgents themselves) and focal actions (efforts to kinetically eliminate insurgents/support versus efforts to diminish the motives for insurgency/support). COIN forces on the motive-focused path succeeded not just because their main emphases included motive-diminishing actions, but because they also fought the insurgents and because they targeted both insurgents and their main sources of support. The (relatively small) number of iron fist path win- The durations of insurgencies vary widely. The median length of the 71 cases was 118 months (slightly less than ten years). 
14
15
These additional factors are also significantly associated with decreased duration:
• The COIN force was of sufficient strength to force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas (COIN force overmatch). • COIN or government actions did not contribute to substantial new grievances claimed by insurgents. • There were significant government reforms over the course of the conflict.
The analysis of postconflict peace intervals was much more limited, but it identified two factors significantly related to the stability of a COIN win and extending the length of the postconflict peace interval:
• There were significant government reforms over the course of the conflict. • There were significant ethical, professional, or human rightsrelated military reforms over the course of the conflict.
Note that government and military reform is a supported COIN concept (see Table 
S
Because the COIN scorecard presented in Table

17
One of the key findings from Victory Has a Thousand Fathers was that "poor beginnings do not necessarily lead to poor ends." In short, this means that COIN forces that get off on the wrong foot can adapt over the course of an insurgency. 
18
Taken together, these key findings suggest the following recommendations:
• Focus first on overmatching the insurgents, defeating their conventional military aspirations, and forcing them to fight as guerrillas.
• Identify insurgents' sources of tangible support and seek to reduce them. • Recognize that essential tangible support may or may not flow from the population. • Be prepared to continue good COIN practices for six or more years after a substantial balance of good COIN practices is first achieved. • Avoid the exclusively "iron fist" COIN path.
• Generate or retain capabilities to plan and pursue multiple mutually supporting lines of operation.
• When building host-nation security forces to fight an insurgency, balance quality and quantity, but favor quality. • Help host-nation governments reform-to improve their commitment and motivation and to increase legitimacy. • Retain leverage over supported governments and elites to encourage sufficient commitment and motivation; avoid creating perverse incentives or dependencies.
• Move away from strategic discussions that focus on a populationcentric versus insurgent-centric dichotomy, and add nuance by specifying spectrums for targets (insurgent support versus insurgents) and actions (diminishing motives versus kinetic diminution) with the goal of achieving balance. • Revise COIN doctrine to reinforce core principles and include key insights from this research.

Insurgency is a timeless mode of conflict and has taken many forms, including independence movements during decolonization, ethnic and sectarian conflict, regional separatism, and resistance to occupation.
The United States has spent more than a decade opposing-and supporting indigenous operations in opposing-insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan. In short, insurgency has been the most prevalent form of armed conflict since at least 1949, and it is not going away.

A 2010 RAND report, Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Sources of Success in Counterinsurgency, sought to answer these questions through detailed case studies of the 30 insurgencies begun and completed worldwide between 1978 and 2008. This report largely supersedes that previous study, incorporating its 30 original cases into a broader and more comprehensive database, with expanded research and analysis.

• Once good COIN practices are in place, how long must a COIN force sustain them before the conflict is resolved? • What factors can help reduce the duration of an insurgency?
What factors tend to extend insurgencies? • What factors contribute to a more durable postconflict peace?
• Do good COIN practices differ for external COIN forces (that is, COIN forces from another country)? If so, which COIN practices are most effective for these external forces?
In this report, we define counterinsurgency (COIN) as efforts undertaken by a government and its security forces (or the security forces of supporting partners or allies) to oppose an insurgency. However, unlike so many other definitions, the precise wording does not really matter. For us, counterinsurgency is whatever one does when oppos-
ing an insurgency. The term counterinsurgency does not and should not presuppose an approach to or theory of counterinsurgency, simply that there is an insurgency and there is someone who wishes to fight it. We offer this brief definitional note only because the literature on this topic often actively conflates the type of operation (countering an insurgency) with a specific concept for or theory of counterinsurgency (usually population-centric counterinsurgency, or the concept outlined in Field Manual 3-24, Counterinsurgency) by using the same term to denote both.

While there are many different possible concepts for counterinsurgency espoused in the literature (this report evaluates 24 such concepts), there are traditionally two core philosophies (or theories) of counterinsurgency: population-centric and enemy-centric.

12
While the population-centric/insurgent-centric duality is the classic division in discussions on counterinsurgency, our research adds nuance and promotes slightly different divisions. Rather than a single dichotomy, we propose two, establishing a spectrum between two forms of COIN actions: those aimed at diminishing motive versus strictly kinetic actions (using force to kill, capture, or constrain). We consider a similar spectrum for two forms of COIN targets: active insurgents and insurgent support.
Our previous study, reported in Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Sources of Success in Counterinsurgency, discovered that insurgents' continued ability to maintain their tangible support (recruits, weapons and materiel, funding, intelligence, sanctuary) is more important than where that support comes from (the population or an outside actor) in determining the outcome of an insurgency; this study confirmed that finding. This suggests that rather than distinguishing between a focus on the population and a focus on the enemy, it would be better to distinguish between a focus on the enemy and a focus on the enemy's sources of support, which may or may not come from the population.
Historically, COIN forces have diminished insurgent tangible support in a variety of ways: reducing the willingness of the population to offer support, reducing the opportunity for the population to offer support (through various measures to control or influence the population), 
13
These two dichotomies divide the theoretical space into four quadrants, as depicted in Figure 
1
Each of the 71 historical cases informing this report follows one of two COIN paths and falls broadly into two categories in this typol-ogy. COIN campaigns on the "iron fist" path fall primarily into the lower right quadrant, with a focus on kinetic actions against the active insurgency. The more effective of these primarily enemy-focused campaigns also devoted some effort to reducing insurgents' support, but almost always in an exclusively physical way (upper right quadrant). COIN campaigns on the motive-focused path fall primarily into the upper left quadrant, with a focus on reducing the motives for supporting or participating in the insurgency. Unlike the iron fist counterinsurgencies, the motive-focused efforts, though primarily on the motivefocused side of the equation, were often balanced with kinetic efforts to kill, capture, or constrain active insurgents (waxing over into the lower right and occasionally the upper right quadrants). 
14

these two paths, iron fist and motive-focused, when we describe how we divided the cases into subpopulations for further analysis in Chapter Three. These analyses found that primarily motive-focused and balanced COIN campaigns are much more likely to be successful than strictly iron fist efforts (see Chapter Six).
The research presented here tests 24 concepts for COIN drawn from the existing literature against the record of history. Moving beyond validation through one or two case studies, this research assembles a significant and systematic foundation of evidence from which to assess COIN concepts: detailed case studies of the 71 insurgencies begun and resolved across the globe between World War II (WWII) and 2010. 
15
Chapter Two describes the cases and case selection. In addition to considering findings across all 71 cases, we identify several subsamples, or classes, of cases of specific interest in Chapter Three. These include the 59 core cases (excluding poor comparative examples, such as the COIN campaigns fought against the postcolonial wars of indeof any single one." Kelly M. Greenhill and Paul Staniland, "Ten Ways to Lose at Counterinsurgency," Civil Wars, Vol. 9, No. 4, December 2007, p. 404.  pendence); the 44 iron fist cases in which the COIN force sought to prevail predominantly through the vigorous application of force; the 15 motive-focused, or balanced, cases in which COIN forces emphasized efforts to diminish the motives for the insurgency and its supporters over (or in balance with) the application of force; and the 28 cases in which an external actor (another country) committed military forces in support, further subdivided into the 13 cases in which the external actor committed only advisers, special operations forces, or air power and the 15 cases in which the external actor committed significant ground troops, up to and including cases in which external forces were-or were for a time-the primary COIN force. Our findings provide strong empirical support for some COIN concepts and strong evidence against others, as discussed in Chapter Four.
By analyzing the patterns of practices and factors that characterize COIN wins and COIN losses in these cases, we move beyond the testing of recommended COIN concepts. We developed a list of "good" and "bad" factors based, first, on strong a priori grounding in existing COIN literature and, second, on relationships observed in our data during preliminary analyses. Examining the patterns of presence or absence of these practices and factors in the data, we reached several interesting conclusions regarding the differences between those who defeated insurgencies and those who did not, which COIN practices were critical to success, what factors are correlated with the durations of insurgencies, and what factors are correlated with the length of postconflict peace intervals. Details of these results and supporting analyses are presented in Chapters Four and Five.
The remainder of this report is organized as follows. Chapter Two describes the methods used to identify the 71 insurgencies begun and resolved since WWII, details how we collected data for our case studies, and presents brief historical summaries of the 71 cases. Chapter Three identifies various subsets or subpopulations within the 71 cases that are most appropriate for answering certain kinds of questions. That analysis found that some of the cases, while individually interesting, are simply not good cases for comparison, so we constrained most analyses to the 59 core cases within the larger data set. Chapter Four introduces the 24 COIN concepts identified in the literature, describes the factors that represent them in the analysis, and tests them against the record of history by considering the impact of their implementation on the outcomes of the 59 core cases. Chapter Five describes our analyses of the impact on case outcomes of different patterns of practices and factors that are present or absent in the cases. That chapter also discusses the development and validation of a list of "good" and "bad" COIN practices and our attempt to mathematically reduce the host of strongly supported concepts for COIN to a minimally sufficient set. Chapter Five also examines factors that contribute to the duration of insurgencies and to the length of postconflict peace intervals. Chapter Six presents the results of the analyses repeated for the various subsamples (iron fist versus motive-focused and external actor cases). Chapter Seven draws conclusions and makes recommendations.
Seven appendixes and an accompanying volume of case studies support this report. Appendix A provides extensive methodological details supporting our analyses. Appendix B offers technical background and detailed results of one of the analyses conducted as part of the research, qualitative comparative analysis. Appendix C offers similar details for another technique used, survival analysis. Appendix D reviews the key findings from the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers study in light of the new data and analyses. Appendix E lists all the factors included in the data set for each phase of each of the 71 cases. (The full data are provided in a spreadsheet that accompanies this report.) Appendix F contains the checkbox scorecard that guided the analyses presented in Chapter Five; Appendix G presents scorecard scores for the 59 core cases based on that scorecard. Detailed case narratives for the 41 new cases added to the database for this analysis appear in a companion volume 
Seventy-one cases of insurgency form the empirical foundation for this research. This chapter begins by describing the process used to select the cases and to collect data for them, as well as how we determined whether the outcome of a case was a win or a loss for COIN forces. The bulk of the chapter, however, is devoted to brief summaries of each of the 71 cases. More extensive case-study details can be found in the accompanying volume, Paths to Victory: Detailed Insurgency Case Studies (for the 41 new cases), and in the previously published case-study volume, Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Detailed Counterinsurgency Case Studies (for the 30 cases studied as part of that earlier research effort). 1
The 71 cases explored here were drawn, in part, from a larger list of historical insurgencies developed by Martin Libicki as part of a previous RAND COIN study.

• They involved fighting between states and nonstates seeking to take control of a government or region or that used violence to change government policies. • The conflict killed at least 1,000 people over its course, with a yearly average of at least 100. • At least 100 people were killed on both sides (including civilians attacked by rebels). • They were not coups, countercoups, or insurrections.
To this set of 89, we added four cases from a separate list prepared by the Center for Army Analysis and The Dupuy Institute that were missing but appeared to meet Libicki's criteria, giving us a total of 93 cases.

We collected data for the case studies from secondary sources. The analyst assigned to each case thoroughly reviewed the available English-language history and secondary analysis of the conflict. Documentation proved voluminous for some cases (particularly those in Central and South America but also cases in which Russian or Soviet forces were involved); it was much more sparse for other cases (particularly those in Africa). In all cases, available information was sufficient to meet our data needs for the quantitative analyses (presented in Chapters Four, Five, and Six). The references listed at the end of the accompanying volume of case studies demonstrate the range and depth of the available literature. 
Because the approach and behavior of the COIN force, the actions of insurgents, and other important conditions can all change over the course of an insurgency, we broke all of the cases into between one and five phases. A detailed discussion of each phase of each case for the 41 new cases can be found in the accompanying volume; full narratives for the 30 cases included in the earlier research can be found in Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Detailed Counterinsurgency Case Studies. 
4
The phases are not uniform in duration. A new phase was declared when the case analyst recognized a significant shift in the COIN approach, in the approach of the insurgents, or in the overall conditions of the case. Phases were not intended to capture microchanges or tight cycles of adaptation and counteradaptation between the insurgents and the COIN force; rather, these were macro-level and seachange phases. Throughout the report, case data refers to the data for a single phase, the decisive phase of the case. Almost all analyses are at the case level and consider only the decisive phase, but some analyses consider data across phases within a case.
Because our analysis focuses on correlates of success in COIN, one of the most important elements of our case studies is the identification of the outcome of the cases (i.e., whether COIN forces actually succeeded). Many of these cases have complicated outcomes, in which neither side realized all of its stated objectives, and when the conflict was officially over-that is, when the fighting ceased-it was not exactly clear which side prevailed. While we report mixed outcomes in our case narratives, we also identify each case as either a COIN win or a COIN loss.
To adjudicate unclear case outcomes, we followed the logic illustrated in Figure

Case Outcome: COIN Loss Fought against the tide of history (postcolonialism)
In 1923, following its confirmation by the League of Nations, the British Mandate for Palestine became the legal commission for the administration of Palestine. It was British limitations on Jewish immigration into Palestine-which had been established as a Jewish homeland under the terms of the mandate-that spurred three underground Jewish organizations to launch an insurgency against the mandatory government. During the conflict, as many as 100,000 British soldiers, plus mandatory police and British Special Air Service forces, were involved in the conflict. The counterinsurgents' tactics included extensive cordon-and-search operations, massive numbers of arrests and detentions, and the imposition of martial law in some areas. Although these tactics were generally successful, the British were not as highly motivated as the insurgents in this conflict. Fighting against the tide of history, they ultimately capitulated in late 1947, withdrawing from Palestine.
As the Nazi occupation of Greece during WWII drew to a close and the Greek government in exile returned, the country's predominant communist insurgent group, the National Popular Liberation Army, decided not to demobilize. Instead, it attempted to seize power in Athens to avoid a return to the prewar political status quo. The British quickly came to the government's rescue, defending Athens with 75,000 British troops and forcing a quick and apparently successful surrender by the insurgents. However, many of the insurgents merely went underground, only to reemerge almost two years later to lead the Democratic Army of Greece (DSE), which aimed to democratize the country. With the Greek military still in the process of rebuilding itself after WWII, the insurgents were able to seize the upper hand in the second phase of the conflict. The DSE benefited substantially from the safe havens and external support provided by Greece's communist neighbors, which enabled the group to withstand the extensive military troops, training, and assistance that the British provided to the COIN effort. During the final phase of the conflict, external conditions led to a withdrawal of British support and its replacement by U.S. military aid, provided under the Truman Doctrine. At the same time, the insurgents' primary ally, Yugoslavia, closed its borders to their operations. Meanwhile, the insurgents made the strategic miscalculation of adopting conventional tactics prematurely, thus aiding the COIN force in securing a victory over the insurgency.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents)   French efforts to reclaim their lost colony after the conclusion of WWII appeared to get off to a good start but ultimately became too costly (in blood, treasure, and concessions). While the French maintained air and conventional battlefield superiority throughout the conflict, Viet Minh insurgents learned to expose themselves to that technical superiority only when the French could be significantly outnumbered, leading to a mixed conflict of constant low-intensity guerrilla warfare punctuated by short, sharp, and numerically overwhelming conventional engagements. Jungle and mountain terrain decisively supported this approach.
The conflict turned to favor the insurgents after the Chinese Revolution in 1949, with 1950 bringing support to the insurgents from both the Chinese and the Soviets. Even with a massive influx of U.S. money and materiel, French firepower and political concessions were insufficient to defeat a numerically superior foe that could and did use the jungle to blunt French air power, constrain French maneuver capabilities, stretch French supply lines, and conceal insurgent movements.
After the ignominious defeat at Dien Bien Phu, the 1954 Geneva conference divided Indochina at the 17th parallel and set the stage (or perhaps, baited the trap) for much greater U.S. investment in fighting communists in Vietnam.
Case Outcome: COIN Win An agrarian peasant movement aimed at reducing economic and social inequality, the Hukbalahap ("Huk," for short) insurgency was initially successful in winning extensive local support and perpetrating guerrilla attacks and robberies against a newly independent Philippine government. However, the Huks' increasing violence and the addition of common criminals to their ranks led the government to appoint a liberal congressman and former provincial military governor, Ramon Magsaysay, to the post of secretary of defense in September 1950. Magsaysay's appointment marked a turning point in the conflict, and he instituted sweeping reforms that succeeded in drying up civilian support for the insurgency, decreasing government and military corruption, and increasing the COIN force's tactical effectiveness against the Huks. These reforms fortuitously coincided with strategic errors on the part of the insurgents, as well as the addition of U.S. financial and military support. All of these factors combined to lead the COIN force to victory in the conflict's final phase.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents) "La Violencia" in Colombia was a distinctive case in which an internal political conflict rose to the level of all-out civil war for a decade before culminating in a negotiated powersharing agreement. Beginning as an ideologically and politically motivated insurgency/revolution fought by Liberal Party members and supporters against the suppression of their political power by Conservatives in the government, La Violencia morphed into an economically motivated conflict involving extensive rural banditry. The COIN force, composed of both the national police and the armed forces, employed a number of good practices at times, such as measures designed to win popular support. However, they did so inconsistently over the course of the conflict. In the final phases of the conflict, the government and COIN forces under President Gustavo Rojas Pinilla became so repressive, and the Colombian economy deteriorated to such an extent, that Liberal and Conservative Party leaders on the sidelines were willing to overlook their differences and reach a compromise to both unseat Rojas Pinilla and form a coalition government.
The British had already begun to cede government control back to the Malayan states following WWII, establishing a system whereby the states retained sovereignty under British protection. Still, dismayed at the extent of their disenfranchisement under the new government, Chinese communists launched a Maoist guerrilla war to expel the British from the country in 1948. Beginning the conflict with an understrength military and police force, the British immediately created a sizable special constabulary, employing conventional tactics and largescale jungle sweeps that proved wholly ineffective. However, the COIN force ultimately adapted to shifts in insurgent strategy over the course of the conflict, and the second phase ushered in a COIN strategy focused on population and spatial control as part of the Briggs Plan's massive resettlements. These strategies were largely successful and were continued and improved upon under the policies of Sir Gerald Templer. Along with efforts to win the "hearts and minds" of the population, Templer's focus on improved intelligence, as well as a better organized and larger COIN force and efforts to reach a political settlement to the conflict, contributed to the COIN force's success by 1960 by the time the conflict officially ended in 1960 (violence was infrequent following parliamentary elections in 1955). Notably, the Britain's efforts in Malaya are often held up as a paradigm of effective British COIN practice. , 1952-1956   Case Outcome: COIN Win Fought against the tide of history (postcolonialism)
The Mau Mau Rebellion was a brutal conflict that affected all of Kenya's Kikuyu people. The rebellion was an anticolonial struggle aimed at expelling the British colonial government from Kenya due to grievances over land rights, pay for African workers, and the underrepresentation of the Kikuyu people in politics. Entailing gross humanitarian abuses on both sides throughout all phases of the conflict, the main COIN strategies employed involved large-scale sweeps, arrests, detentions, and resettlement programs that were quite indiscriminate in nature. While the COIN force enjoyed the support of a majority of the Kikuyu people at the outset of hostilities, repressive COIN tactics were pushing the Kikuyu over to the insurgents' side by the second phase of the conflict. British and local COIN forces did win back some extent of popular support (particularly in the detention centers), but popular support, on the whole, does not appear to have been decisive in this conflict. Rather, it was the repressive, indiscriminate, and overwhelming force employed by the COIN force that eventually broke the back of the insurgency. This COIN success did not prevail over the long term, however, and Britain ultimately granted Kenya's independence less than a decade after the conclusion of the rebellion.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Fought against the tide of history (postcolonialism) Three hundred members of the National Liberation Front (FLN) guerrilla movement launched the French-Algerian conflict in 1954 with a series of uncoordinated bombing attacks, seeking an end to French colonial rule. Initially dismissed as "traditional banditry," the FLN attacks drew an increasingly forceful response from France as the insurgents gained strength and began targeting the French settler community. As a result, the French military employed brutal COIN tactics against Algeria's native Muslim population. France became more entrenched in battle in 1957 after the FLN initiated a campaign of urban terrorism in the city of Algiers. French special forces responded with roundups of civilians, "disappearances," and the systematic use of torture in interrogations that roused international condemnation. While the army was able to make significant tactical gains against the FLN with its subsequent employment of a system of quadrillage and the construction of cordons sanitaires along Algeria's borders, France was unable to recover from the political losses it incurred in the Battle for Algiers. After President Charles de Gaulle assumed power in 1958, the French army adopted more effective COIN tactics that targeted the FLN and provided humanitarian assistance to local communities, yet de Gaulle eventually announced his support for Algerian autonomy. This decision was violently opposed by members of the French settler community and radical army officers and led to the outbreak of a wave of attacks against Algerian Muslims and French officials. The violence ultimately failed to impede negotiations on France's withdrawal, however. After eight years of brutal conflict, the French government was forced to succumb to the growing pressure from the Algerian population, the public in metropolitan France and the international community to end the war and concede its political, if not its military, defeat.

The National Organization of Cypriot Struggle (EOKA), a nationalist, anti-colonialist insurgent organization composed of Greek Cypriots, launched a guerrilla conflict against the British colonial government in Cyprus in April 1955. Its aim was to compel the British colonial government to disperse its forces and cede Cyprus to Greece. Greek Cypriots were the predominant ethnic group in Cyprus at the time, and EOKA was a predominantly youth-based movement that had the support of more than 80 percent of the population and was also popular in neighboring Greece. Due to this extensive support, the insurgents were able to prevail despite the British colonial administration's reorganization of its COIN force structure, its imposition of martial law, and the creation of a Turkish-Cypriot paramilitary organization that actively supported the British in the second phase of the conflict.
The Cases 27
The hostilities ended in 1959 with a settlement negotiated by Britain, Greece, and Turkey that called for Cyprus to be granted its independence under a power-sharing constitution designed to allow representation for both Greek and Turkish Cypriots. However, this settlement did little more than intensify the acrimony between the two ethnic groups, and another war broke just four years later that left the country divided along ethnic lines.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Leading a socialist insurgency in Cuba beginning in 1956, Fidel Castro presented himself as aiming to restore a legitimate democratic system on the island. He was successful due to both internal and external factors. Internally, Castro's mastery of propaganda and his appreciation of the importance of local support for an insurgency paid off, and he continually won both local civilians and Cuban army personnel over to his side. In contrast, the COIN force opposing Castro was poorly trained, corrupt, and suffered from low morale, which led it to engage in activities that alienated the population. External support to the COIN force from the United States, primarily in the form of military equipment and weapons, served only to prolong the conflict by propping up a corrupt and mismanaged Cuban regime. The United States eventually withdrew its support following Cuban President Fulgencio Batista's loss of popular legitimacy on the island. The conflict subsequently ended with an insurgent win and Batista's exile on January 1, 1959.
Long-standing tensions between sultanate rulers in the coastal regions of Oman and rebellious tribes in the interior of the country fueled a separatist insurgency led by the religious Imamate in 1957. Saudi Arabia and Egypt supported the imamate forces, enabling them to maintain the upper hand in the conflict until the British intervened to shore up the sultan's limited defenses. The British initially contained the rebels' advance by offering minimal ground troops and air support to the Omani armed forces. Later, when the rebels retreated and began an intensive guerrilla campaign from their safe haven in the northern Jebel Akhdar Mountains, London offered more targeted military assistance, which included designated Royal Air Force aircraft and seconded British officers to command the sultan's armed forces. It was not until the British engaged its Special Air Service in the conflict to conduct an assault on the rebels' mountain redoubt, however, that the sultanate forces were able to establish full control over the interior of the country and achieve a decisive victory over the imamate insurgency.
The Darul Islam insurgency was a politically and religiously motivated rebellion that challenged the centralization policies of the newly independent Indonesian government and sought to establish sharia law. Throughout the 1950s, Darul Islam conducted an increasingly effective guerrilla campaign in West Java against a weak Indonesian army that was unable to provide adequate security to the population. As the insurgency threatened to spread to other regions of the country and pose a legitimate challenge President Sukarno's regime, the Indonesian government adopted a comprehensive pacification strategy in 1959 that was able to change the course of the conflict. The strategy combined civic action with cordon-and-search tactics and the forced engagement of the local population in security operations through a technique called pagar bettis, or "fence of legs." Within the course of three years-and benefiting from a lack of international scrutiny of its harsh COIN policies-the Indonesian army was able to restrict the insurgents' territory and eliminate the leadership of the Darul Islam movement to achieve a decisive victory over the insurgents.
The National Volunteer Defense Army at first posed a significant challenge to a heavy-handed Chinese occupying COIN force and, later, occupying government. While the COIN force practiced excessively
The Cases 29 brutal and demeaning tactics to assimilate Tibetans into the Chinese way of life, the relative deprivation of the population precluded any possibility of civilian assistance to the insurgents. External support from the United States and India prolonged the conflict and bought time for (and the possibility of) an insurgent win. However, a series of tactical and operational errors by the insurgents, exacerbated by intermittent suspensions of external aid and the overwhelming force employed by the Chinese to crush the insurgency, eventually led to the insurgents' downfall. The conflict ended with a COIN win following Nepal's withdrawal of territorial access from the insurgents in 1973.
For a 36-year period between 1960 and 1996, Guatemala suffered the effects of a bloody insurgency in which approximately 200,000 people were killed or "disappeared," with an additional 2 million internally displaced or exiled as refugees. The COIN force consisted of the Guatemalan government and armed forces, the traditional elite, and landowners, while the insurgents were a mix of leftists, nationalisticsocialist reformers, middle-class intellectuals, and peasants. Guatemala's COIN campaign employed extremely brutal tactics against the insurgents and their base of support, particularly the country's indigenous population. U.S. support during the first phase of the conflict included training and funding, which assisted the Guatemalans in smashing the insurgency and sending its remaining fighters fleeing to the hills. Not bound to the same standards as its U.S. partners, the Guatemalan government looked the other way as right-wing paramilitaries routinely raped, murdered, and mutilated civilians at will, leading Washington to distance itself from any tacit affiliation for extended periods of the conflict. Eventually, a war-weary population and a beleaguered government agreed to negotiations with an umbrella group of guerrillas, addressing a wide range of grievances and working to rebuild a country whose infrastructure was decimated by ongoing violence and instability.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Lamented as "the forgotten war," the insurgency in Laos was heavily influenced (and often overshadowed) by the conflict in neighboring Vietnam. A victim of geography, Laos experienced half-hearted fighting between different factions and may well have worked itself out in a lasting compromise if not for pressure from North Vietnamese communists to control areas of the country for the infiltration of troops and materiel into South Vietnam (the Ho Chi Min trail) and U.S. efforts to oppose the communist presence and influence.
Beginning in earnest in 1959, fighting pitted variously rightist Royal Lao forces supported by Hmong guerrillas against the leftist Pathet Lao (indigenous communists) and their North Vietnamese supporters. These participants were joined at times by other players, including U.S. advisers, Filipino troops, U.S. air power, Thai commandos and artillery formations, and "neutralist" Lao forces. Of the domestic forces, only the Hmong guerrillas were ever particularly effective. When fighting was primarily among the Lao, it tended toward stalemate. Periods of heavy North Vietnamese involvement, however, always led to substantial gains by the insurgents, who were fought off only with significant intervention on the government's side. After months of wrangling, 1962 finally saw another Geneva agreement, this time for a neutralized Laos with a coalition government representing the three major factions: the rightists, the leftists, and the neutralists. Part of the neutralization agreement included the removal of foreign forces from Laos. This agreement was only ever marginally embraced by the various external players, and ultimately served to improve the communist position. Consolidating their gains and marshaling their strength, the communists again quit the government and fighting increased in intensity.
By the time of the 1973 cease-fire and neutralization, the government of Laos controlled little more than the capital and the Mekong River valley-and that only by virtue of the Hmong and U.S. air power. With the withdrawal of U.S. support (both air power and funding) in 1973, the Hmong were demobilized and the Lao government was left to its fate; it would ultimately fall relatively quickly to the communists.
During the conflict, Laos was underdeveloped in every way: The government was corrupt and ineffective, the economy wholly dependent on outside support, and the military corrupt and ineffective.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Fought against the tide of history (apartheid)   To quell a burgeoning insurgency in southwestern Africa, South Africa initially deployed the South African Police Service, even as South African COIN forces were stretched thin by the African National Congress (ANC)-led insurgency within the country's own borders. The first decade of the war involved low-level but consistent fighting and an increasingly assertive insurgent force. Terrain significantly aided the guerrillas in their ability to elude South African security forces that were operating beyond their traditional zones of comfort. At the end of the first phase, the South African military took over responsibility for prosecuting the war and employed a significant special forces component. The COIN force was able to deny the insurgents permanent bases within Namibia and was effective in raiding Angola to strike at South West African People's Organization (SWAPO) fighters based in that country. SWAPO insurgents teamed with ANC fighters at different stages of the insurgency to conduct joint operations both within and outside Namibian territory. As the COIN forces did in neighboring South Africa, those deployed to Namibia consistently practiced good COIN techniques but fell victim to shifting political tides sweeping the region. The conflict ended when the South African Defense Force agreed to withdraw from Namibia in exchange for Cuban troops' withdrawal from Angola. Subsequently, SWAPO emerged victorious from a United Nations (UN)-monitored election for a constituent assembly.

Nelson Mandela and the ANC fought against the apartheid government of white minority rule in South Africa over a period of more than 30 years. Along with other antigovernment groups, including the South African Communist Party and various black nationalist groups, the ANC agitated for political change while also following a path toward political violence. The ANC and its armed wing, Umkhunto we Sizwe, or "Spear of the Nation," waged a protracted campaign of sabotage, assassination, and bombing against a militarily superior South African Defense Force. In the early stages of the conflict, the ANC was unable to establish a robust presence within South Africa itself, so instead, the insurgents operated from bases in other countries favorable to the ANC, including Angola, Namibia, and Mozambique, at different times throughout the conflict. The COIN force was never seriously at risk of being defeated by the insurgents militarily, though the ANC was adept at cultivating political support, both inside and outside of South Africa. COIN force heavy-handedness also took away from the legitimacy of the government. By 1990, international opinion had turned against the government in Pretoria, and apartheid as a system of government was deemed illegitimate, paving the way for Mandela's ascension to power and the end of white rule in South Africa in 1994.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Historical accounts of the conflict in Vietnam vary widely in the points emphasized and the explanations offered. Disputes are facilitated by the personal experiences of many direct observers who saw or participated in sometimes very different slices of the conflict at different times, at different operational levels, and in different parts of the country. What, if anything, could have been done to change the outcome of the war (and who is to blame for the outcome) remains fairly hotly contested. What the outcome was, however, is not contested: U.S. forces withdrew in 1973, and the Saigon government fell to the combined pressure of the insurgency and North Vietnamese regular forces in April 1975-unequivocally a COIN loss.
The 1954 Geneva agreement divided what is now Vietnam roughly in half. In the few years before the insurgency began in earnest, South Vietnam sought, with U.S. assistance, to build a state to
The Cases 33 govern itself and an army to defend itself. Neither effort proved particularly effective. A vigorous rural insurgency that began in 1960 would remove the government's representatives from rural villages and govern in their stead. With significant support from communist North Vietnam, the insurgents spread rapidly. South Vietnamese COIN efforts were heavy-handed, often alienating the rural population and increasing the ease of the insurgents' recruiting. U.S. military aid increased, often at the expense of other forms of development aid, and the United States became increasingly frustrated with the failure of the Saigon government to heed its advice regarding political liberalization and government reform. The year 1963 saw the first of roughly a dozen coups or other changes of government in succession, none being any more effective at governance or COIN than the previous.
The domestic insurgency, bolstered by infiltrations of personnel and materiel from North Vietnam, put sufficient pressure on government forces to prompt the United States to commit combat forces beginning in 1964. This commitment rapidly surged to more than 180,000 U.S. troops by the end of 1965 on the way to a peak of more than 500,000 in 1969. Constrained by a desire to avoid drawing China into the war, U.S. action against North Vietnam would never stem the flow of soldiers and resources to the south, and large-scale sweeps of jungle territory did little to pacify insurgent cadres and their peasant supporters. After 1965, U.S. forces regularly fought not only insurgent guerrillas but also substantial formations of North Vietnamese regulars. Employing air support and overwhelming firepower, the United States almost always prevailed in these engagements, but the southbound flow of support did not abate.
The infamous Tet Offensive, timed to coincide with the celebration of the lunar new year in early 1968, gave the lie to American claims of a "light at the end of the tunnel" as the insurgents staged coordinated attacks in virtually every urban center in Vietnam. Though psychologically devastating, these attacks were quickly beaten back, with heavy losses inflicted on the communists. The insurgents would never fully recover their strength, especially in the face of a subsequent new U.S. emphasis on the identification and elimination of their political apparatus and on security and pacification in rural villages. However, the damage had been done. Although the United States gained ground against the domestic insurgency, pressure from Chinese-and Sovietarmed North Vietnamese regulars continued to increase as domestic American support for the war waned. When the United States withdrew in 1973, it left a large and well-equipped South Vietnamese army that was no match for the combined might of the domestic insurgency and communist regular forces.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Ethiopia gained control of the former Italian colony of Eritrea and unilaterally annexed the region in 1962, which led to the outbreak of an insurgency. Initially limited to a small group of guerrilla fighters supported by Arab nationalist regimes, the insurgency developed into a broad-based secessionist movement supported by both the Muslim and Christian Eritrean communities. This broadening of the conflict occurred after the Ethiopian government launched a brutal COIN campaign that resulted in a high number of civilian casualties and significant population displacement. By the mid-1970s, the insurgency posed a serious threat to the Ethiopian regime and contributed to a Marxist coup against the monarchy. The new revolutionary government continued to employ repressive COIN tactics against the Eritrean population. Although it benefited from extensive Soviet military assistance, it could not defeat an increasingly resilient insurgency. Finally, weakened by years of war and famine and suffering from a withdrawal of Soviet support, Ethiopian forces were defeated in Eritrea. As a result, the government in Addis Ababa was toppled in 1991. Insurgent leaders were then able to establish a provisional government in Eritrea and were guaranteed a referendum on independence, which passed in 1993.
After decades of contention between the Kurdish minority in northern Iraq and the central government, a rebellion was sparked in 1961 by growing frustration with the nationalist Iraqi government's failure to
The Cases 35 deliver on its promise to provide the Kurds with political autonomy. Initially, Kurdish guerrillas, known as peshmerga, launched limited small-scale attacks on government forces. The Iraqi army responded with conventional counteroffensives, which served to widen the war and alienate the population. Despite various attempts to reach a ceasefire, fighting grew more intense as both sides benefited from increasing levels of external support from the Soviet Union, Iran, and the United States. Finally, in 1974, peshmerga forces, advised by their Iranian and U.S. supporters, attempted to launch a direct conventional attack on the Iraqi regime. This mistaken attempt was met with a full-scale counterassault that enabled the Iraqi forces to penetrate deep into Kurdish territory and threaten their mountain safe havens. Having obtained the military advantage, Iraq solidified its gains by negotiating an agreement with the Shah of Iran to withdraw his critical military support to the Kurds in exchange for a territorial claim to the Shatt al-Arab waterway. Once the Kurdish forces lost the support of the Iranian military, the rebellion was crushed.

The Angolan war of independence began in earnest in 1961 and continued unabated for the next 13 years. (A follow-on insurgency began immediately afterward and lasted for an additional 27 years.) The insurgency was divided among three separate insurgent groups for most of the first phase but still managed to inflict significant damage on the Portuguese COIN force. In the second phase, the COIN force implemented military and political reforms, separated the insurgents from the population, instituted development programs, and enlisted locals into the security forces. Toward the end of the insurgency, the COIN force had reduced troop casualty rates and began making tangible progress in pacifying the population. However, the April 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal led Lisbon to withdraw from Angola, essentially handing a tailor-made victory to the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA).
Led by Amílcar Lopes Cabral, the African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde (PAIGC) waged an insurgency to overthrow Portuguese colonial rule in Guinea-Bissau. The composition of the insurgency was divided sharply along ethnic lines; the leadership of the PAIGC was almost exclusively Cape Verdean, while most of its foot soldiers were ethnic Guineans. Throughout the conflict, both sides grew weary of the other's intentions, making cohesion more challenging. Of Portugal's three African COIN campaigns, Guinea-Bissau was considered the least valuable, and, as a result, troops fighting there were often left wanting for supplies and resources. The insurgents enjoyed several important advantages, including external sponsorship from a number of countries and safe havens in neighboring French Guinea (Guinea-Conakry). Relentless attacks by PAIGC guerrillas confined the Portuguese to large garrisons, further alienating the COIN force from the population. Despite a change in leadership in the second phase, which resulted in a reequipped and resupplied COIN force conducting operations beyond their garrisons, domestic political events in Portugal led to a withdrawal of troops and the establishment of an independent Guinea-Bissau.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Fought against the tide of history (postcolonialism) Mozambique was one of three concurrent insurgencies that Portuguese colonial forces battled throughout the 1960s and early 1970s. In the first phase of this conflict, General António Augusto dos Santos prosecuted a low-intensity population-centric COIN campaign characterized by psychological warfare and limited operations. In Phase II, General Kaúlza de Arriaga switched course, taking a comprehensive approach that included development, resettlement, recruitment of indigenous troops, and an increase in airborne search-and-destroy operations in an attempt to win the war decisively and bring the con-
The Cases 37 flict to a victorious end for the Portuguese. Despite a largely successful COIN campaign, the 1974 Carnation Revolution led Portugal to withdraw from its overseas colonies, leading to an insurgent victory and the ascension of the Mozambique Liberation Front.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss An insurgency was launched in North Yemen after the country's ruling imam was overthrown in a coup by Egyptian-trained military officers in 1962. Seeking to restore the old order, the imam rallied tribal forces, with support from Saudi Arabia, to launch a guerrilla campaign against the new republican government, which maintained a weak hold on the country. Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser responded to the growing insurgent threat by providing an increasing level of military support to the Yemeni government. Initially supplying military advisers and special forces teams, Egypt sent 60,000 troops to Yemen by 1965 and became the primary COIN force. Despite their overwhelming land and air power, the Egyptian forces could not adequately defend against the imam's attacks or achieve popular support due to their brutal COIN tactics and modern socialist ideology that was antithetical to traditional Yemeni culture. Nasser briefly agreed to mediation efforts after experiencing heavy losses but subsequently recommitted a large contingent of Egyptian troops to Yemen as he sought to fill the strategic vacuum left by Great Britain's withdrawal from South Yemen. It was only after experiencing a humiliating defeat in the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War in 1967 that Nasser decided to withdraw from the country. The Yemeni conflict continued at a reduced pace after Egypt's withdrawal, finally ending two years later when new leaders emerged on both sides and agreed to establish a more moderate government that provided the imam's supporters with significant political autonomy.
A Marxist-Leninist urban insurgency perpetrated by the Tupamaros in Uruguay, this conflict was motivated by the rapid decline of the country's previously successful economy in the early 1960s. The innovative Tupamaros-who at first were masters at solidifying public support and turning the populace against the government-were easily able to overcome Uruguay's inept COIN force, which was composed of police and, later, paramilitary forces, during the first two phases of the conflict. However, the insurgents' increasingly aggressive and violent tactics in the later years of the war led to an increase in popular support for the COIN effort and aided in the supply of human intelligence to COIN forces. At the same time, the COIN effort was strengthened by the Uruguayan president's decision to order the army to take control of the conflict from the inadequately trained and understrength police force. The army rapidly prevailed over the Tupamaros once it became directly involved in the conflict, in part by initiating psychological operations (PSYOP) campaign to inform the populace of the threat posed by the insurgents. Ultimately, the army was so successful that it became a menace in its own right, dissolving the country's democratic parliament and imposing military rule in Uruguay immediately following its defeat of the insurgents. The military continued to rule the country for 12 years after the end of the conflict.
The Dhofar rebellion began as a separatist movement by tribes seeking independence from the repressive rule of the reactionary Sultan Said ibn Taimur. After a Marxist government gained power in neighboring South Yemen, the insurgency adopted a communist ideology, and the conflict evolved into a regional war involving multiple external actors. Great Britain, Iran, and Jordan supported the sultan, while South Yemen, China, and the Soviet Union supported the "communist" insurgents. Despite extensive external support, the Omani military was unable to contain the rebellion due to the sultan's refusal to
The Cases 39 modernize his forces or to provide even the most basic government services to his subjects. After the sultan's son, Sultan Qaboos, took power in a coup, the Omani forces and their British advisers adopted a more effective COIN strategy that combined conventional operations with civil development and political reform. Once Qaboos addressed the needs of his population, seized the military initiative, and reduced the insurgents' access to support and sanctuary, he was able to achieve a decisive victory.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Fought against the tide of history (apartheid)
The Rhodesian conflict began when the British colony of Southern Rhodesia unilaterally declared its independence and asserted its right to maintain white-minority rule. This declaration prompted the country's two major black African nationalist parties, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and the Zimbabwe African People's Union (ZAPU), to launch a rural guerrilla insurgency to achieve political rights for the black majority. Initially, the guerrillas launched smallscale attacks against white settlers from bases in Zambia. The insurgency then expanded as ZANU and ZAPU established training and logistical bases along the eastern and western borders of the country and drew support from the local population in Rhodesia. The guerrillas were unable to gain the upper hand in the conflict, however, as the Rhodesian security forces adopted a series of innovative COIN tactics in road security, tracking, and reconnaissance and intelligence gathering that constrained the number of insurgent attacks and preserved military control over the country. It was only when political tensions became too great and external pressure weighed in against the government that Salisbury was willing offer concessions to the black majority and concede defeat.
Initially a socialist insurgency aimed primarily at restoring the power of exiled president Juan Perón, the insurgency in Argentina evolved into revolt against the government of the reinstated Perón and eventually became much more focused on military goals in lieu of political aims. Throughout the conflict, the country's political system morphed from military government to an elected socialist government, before shifting back to a military regime with the ousting of Isabel Perón's administration in 1976. Through these transitions, the government's COIN strategy shifted from one of relative leniency focused on legal mechanisms to one that adopted increasingly illegal, brutal tactics, culminating in the indiscriminate "dirty war" waged against large swathes of Argentine society after 1976 that ultimately crushed the insurgency.
As the conflict in neighboring Vietnam led North Vietnamese forces to make more and more use of logistics lines passing through Cambodia, and under U.S. pressure to join forces with the South Vietnamese, Cambodia's mercurial Prince Norodom Sihanouk walked a tightrope of pseudo-neutrality, allowing the North Vietnamese to operate unopposed in his country's hinterland but refusing to be drawn further into the war. This led to some peculiar situations. For example, Chinese materiel found its way from the North Vietnamese to both the Cambodian army (for the favor of port access) and the Cambodian communist rebels whom the Cambodian army had been fighting since an outbreak of leftist violence in 1967. Sihanouk's balancing act ended up alienating many key stakeholders both within and outside Cambodia and came to an end in 1970, when his government fell to a coup.
The new government declared war against the communists and joined the broader conflict on the side of the South Vietnamese and the United States, a move that dissolved the tenuous restraint previously shown by the North Vietnamese. North Vietnamese forces, when directly engaged by the Cambodians, cut them to ribbons in a series
The Cases 41 of campaigns in 1970 and 1971. They also bolstered their forces with Cambodian communists whom they had sheltered in exile since 1955.
The year 1972 brought a cease-fire in Vietnam as a prelude to the communist victory there, and Vietnamese troops began to withdraw from Cambodia. Assuming them to be puppets of the Hanoi regime, many were surprised when the Cambodian communists continued to fight. Massive U.S. bombing in the first half of 1973 postponed a communist victory (and killed an inestimable number of innocent Cambodians), but U.S. congressional action stopped the bombing and ended all hope for the feeble and kleptocratic Cambodian government. The communists' slow advance toward victory ended in April 1975, when they captured the capital, ushering in the horror of the Pol Pot era.
Case Outcome: COIN Win (Mixed, Favoring COIN)   The Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) waged a three-decadelong insurgency against the British Army and various Protestant paramilitaries during a period widely referred to as "The Troubles" in Northern Ireland. Support for the PIRA by Northern Ireland's Catholic minority, the Republic of Ireland, and the United States increased substantially following a clumsy and inchoate British COIN campaign in the first seven years of the conflict. In the late 1970s, the police assumed primacy over the army, and the COIN force focused on improving its intelligence capabilities. As a military stalemate settled in, efforts to transition away from violence and toward peace gained momentum on both sides. By the final phase of the conflict, both the Protestants and Catholics were war-weary. It was during this final phase that the insurgent leadership shifted the majority of its resources away from the PIRA and toward the organization's political wing, Sinn Fein. In 1998, after 30 years of fighting, the insurgents agreed to lay down their arms and joined a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland's parliament.
The Palestinian insurgency in Jordan was strongly influenced by political forces in the Middle East in 1970. The conflict evolved after the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War, which led the Palestinian national liberation movement and its fedayeen militia to establish their headquarters in Jordan. As the fedayeen gained political and military power, they posed a challenge to the legitimacy of the Hashemite regime, leading King Hussein to initiate a COIN campaign culminating in a full military assault on Palestinian strongholds in Amman and northern Jordan. Ten days of intense fighting followed, during which the fedayeen received only limited reinforcement from neighboring Arab armies whose support they had counted on. As a result, the insurgency was nearly crushed. Leaders in the Arab world provided sufficient support to the Palestinian fighters to enable them to sustain a low-level insurgency for an additional ten months. However, overriding concerns over the political stability of their own regimes, and the region more generally, prevented them from providing the military support necessary to turn the tide of the war. In July 1971 the Jordanian regime succeeded in defeating the guerrillas and from expelling the fedayeen from the country.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss The 1971 insurgency in Bangladesh was a separatist conflict launched in response to the Pakistani government's efforts to subjugate the Bengali people socially, economically, politically, and militarily. The impetus for the conflict was the overwhelming victory of an East Pakistani (Bengali) political party in the country's first general election, which spurred the West Pakistani leaders of the country to arrest the leader of the winning party and launch a military offensive throughout East Pakistan. The Bengali response, to declare Bangladesh an independent state and foment an insurgency, was met with overwhelming force, indiscriminate killing, torture, looting, the destruction of villages, and the mass, systematic rape of women and girls throughout the region.
With growing international attention being paid to the extent of the violence, India eventually launched a direct military intervention, bringing a decisive end to the conflict in two weeks. However, the COIN response to the insurgency was so brutal that it is widely considered to have constituted a genocide. In the nine short months of the conflict, an estimated 3 million were killed, 10 million fled to India as refugees, and 30 million were displaced within Bangladesh. Additionally, it is estimated that 200,000 women and girls were raped during the war.
Case Outcome: COIN Win (Mixed, Favoring COIN)   The Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF), a Muslim separatist movement in the southern provinces of the Philippines, waged an onand-off insurgency against the government of the Republic of the Philippines for approximately 15 years. Although its original aims included the establishment of an independent Muslim state in the province of Mindanao, it soon shifted its goals to the withdrawal of government troops from the southern Philippines, the return of lands taken from the Moros (Muslim Filipinos), increased autonomy, and the ability to implement Islamic law in Muslim-dominated areas. The government initially responded to MNLF activity with the imposition of martial law, and the Philippine armed forces engaged the insurgents in largescale conventional battle in the conflict's first phase. This was followed by a series of cease-fires and negotiations-some more successful than others-and a shift on the part of the MNLF from conventional to guerrilla tactics. In the middle of the second phase of the conflict, a change in the political players involved brought a new COIN strategy focused on civilian population protection combined with offensive force and a continued willingness to negotiate. It was this change in strategy that eventually led to the COIN force's mixed success in this conflict.
The 1973 conflict in Baluchistan was the fourth in a series of separatist insurgencies in the region since its incorporation into Pakistan in 1947. The Baluch People's Liberation Front (later, the Baluch Liberation Front) had widespread support from the Baluch people and employed standard guerrilla tactics to cut off major supply lines and transportation routes between Baluchistan and neighboring provinces. However, the insurgents were unable to prevail against the larger and better-equipped COIN force composed of Pakistan's army and a special forces unit, which successfully employed overwhelming force to crush the insurgency. Interestingly, the "crush them" concept worked somewhat more gradually and indirectly than in other cases, as the insurgents established bases in Afghanistan after the decisive period of the conflict and continued to wage a low-level insurgency across the border when possible. The basing of insurgents in Afghanistan did little more than prolong the conflict, however, which had essentially been decided before they moved across the border.
Case Outcome: COIN Win Shortly after the end of Angola's war of independence, the country descended into bitter fighting as the victors against the Portuguese failed to agree on which group would rule the postcolonial government. The United States and South Africa supported Jonas Savimbi and his National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) insurgents against the Cuban-and Soviet-backed People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) COIN forces. This conflict was a classic Cold War proxy battle and a centerpiece of the Reagan Doctrine to contain and confront communism throughout the globe. By the end of the 1980s, as Soviet support for its proxies dried up, UNITA seemed to be in a position to overtake the MPLA. Instead of capitalizing on COIN force weakness, however, Savimbi ordered an internal purge of his organization, which included both his fighters and the Angolan population. In the final phase of the conflict, no longer the beneficiary
The Cases 45 of U.S. or South African support, the insurgents turned to financing the conflict through diamond trafficking. The insurgency soon degenerated into criminality, and the COIN force finished off UNITA by killing Savimbi and bringing the conflict to a close.
The conflict in East Timor began soon after Portugal ended its colonial rule and departed from the region, leaving a Marxist-leaning group, the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (FRETILIN), as the strongest party in the Timorese independence movement. Indonesia responded to this potential communist threat by invading and annexing the region in July 1976. This conventional intervention by the Indonesian army devolved into a brutal COIN campaign over the next two decades that resulted in the deaths of as many as 200,000 civilians but failed to crush the insurgency. It was only in the mid-1990s that the course of the conflict changed, as FRETILIN adopted a more subversive urban strategy and drew greater international attention to its fight for independence. At the same time, the end of the Cold War left Indonesia without a clear rationale for its occupation of East Timor, and without the tacit support of the West. By 1999, Jakarta was ultimately forced to cede to international pressure and agree to grant sovereignty to East Timor, thus ending its COIN campaign in defeat.

The Lebanese Civil War lasted from 1975 to 1990 and quickly led to the breakdown of government structures as Lebanon was engulfed by anarchy, earning the nickname the "militia republic."

The conflict in Western Sahara began in 1975 after Spain withdrew as a colonial power, allowing Morocco to occupy the region. Morocco's occupation was contested by the Popular Front for the Liberation of the Saguia el Hamra and Rio de Oro (Polisario) movement, which launched an effective guerrilla campaign against the Moroccan army with external support from Algeria and Libya. By the mid-1980s, the Moroccan army was able to gain the upper hand against the Polisario by obtaining attracting military assistance from the United States and France and building more than 1,000 miles of defensive sand berms that cut the insurgents off from Saharan population centers and their sources of material support. A stalemate developed in 1988, with Morocco achieving the military advantage and the Polisario maintaining a diplomatic edge, as well as UN support for Western Sahara's right to self-determination. Yet, unlike in similar conflicts, the international community did not place sufficient pressure on the Moroccan government to agree to a political settlement. While a 1991 agreement call-
The Cases 47 ing for a referendum on independence effectively ended active fighting between the Polisario and Moroccan forces, the vote was repeatedly postponed, and diplomatic skirmishes continued, leaving the conflict largely unresolved for decades and the contested land in Morocco's possession.
The Aceh conflict began as a limited insurgency triggered by the centralization policies of the Indonesian government and the imposition of petroleum rents in the mid-1970s. Over the course of three decades, the insurgency evolved into a broader conflict of ethnic separatism prompted largely by the human rights abuses perpetrated by Indonesian COIN forces. Only after the fall of Indonesian President Suharto's regime in 1998 did the separatist group known as the Free Aceh Movement (GAM) gain widespread public support. The Indonesian government offered the GAM limited political autonomy in an effort to reach a negotiated settlement to end the insurgency. When this effort failed, the government imposed a state of emergency and launched a large-scale military initiative against the GAM. These forceful actions left GAM forces severely weakened and reduced their base of popular support. Still, the insurgency dragged on until a natural disaster altered the course of the conflict. In December 2004, an earthquake and tsunami devastated the province and left both sides more willing to compromise and eager to conclude a peace agreement to secure relief from the international community. A peace agreement, signed in 2005, provided for expanded political autonomy for Aceh but fell short of delivering full independence to the region.
From 1976 to 1995, the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) waged a protracted campaign of violence against the Mozambique Liberation Front (FRELIMO) in an insurgency that wracked the country and dragged in several outside actors, including Rhodesia, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Over a 17-year period, insurgent and state-sponsored violence contributed to more than 1 million casualties, resulted in massive refugee flows and internal population displacement, and paralyzed the country's economy.

Years of discrimination by the Sinhala majority against the Tamil minority boiled over in Sri Lanka during the Black July riots of 1983. Shortly thereafter, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) emerged as the most capable Tamil insurgent group, prepared to wage a campaign of violence and terror against the Sri Lankan state and non-Tamil civilians. Throughout its tenure, the LTTE was led by Velupillai Prabhakaran, a ruthless leader who continuously purged threats, both real and imagined, to his authoritarian rule. Over time, the LTTE distinguished itself as perhaps the most capable insurgent force in modern history. By the third phase of the conflict, the group boasted a navy, an air force, and an elite suicide commando unit used to assassinate several heads of state and numerous COIN force commanders. A transnational diaspora network provided funding and weaponry to sustain the Tigers for most of the group's existence, and a change from guerrilla to conventional fighting in the fifth and decisive phase of the insurgency doomed the LTTE. In the end, however, a combination of factorsincluding insurgent defections, a revamped Sri Lankan military, and displacement from the 2004 tsunami-allowed the COIN force to
The Cases 49 triumph while employing brutal tactics in snuffing out the remnants of a once-powerful insurgency.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Four decades of neopatrimonial rule by a corrupt and unpopular government led to an uprising in the rural parts of Nicaragua that quickly spread from the countryside to the cities and towns surrounding the capital, Managua. The murder of Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, an extremely popular newspaper editor, served to add fuel to an already smoldering fire as widespread dissatisfaction with the Somoza regime quickly galvanized into an insurgency.
Four important factors converged to allow the insurgents to dislodge a qualitatively and quantitatively superior COIN force. First, the three main insurgent groups reconciled their respective differences and combined their efforts to fight the government. Second, indiscriminate violence by the counterinsurgents turned the population toward the Sandinistas and swelled their ranks with recruits. Third, the Carter administration decided that it could no longer back Nicaraguan president Anastasio Somoza following egregious human rights violations committed by his forces. Finally, Venezuela, Cuba, and Panama afforded the insurgency the weapons and safe haven necessary to defeat a stronger opponent. The combination of effective political organization by the Sandinistas, repressive policies by the government, loss of support for Somoza in the United States, and a steady supply of weapons from various Latin American nations to the insurgents led to an insurgent victory in a short but bloody conflict.
The Afghan insurgency against the Soviet Union has been referred to as a "textbook study of how a major power can fail to win a war against guerrillas." 9 Despite their overwhelming political and military supe-riority, the Soviets encountered unexpected opposition to their invasion in 1979 and were unprepared to face the challenge of sustaining a weak, unpopular communist government against highly motivated Islamic fighters, or mujahadeen. While Moscow and its proxy regime in Kabul were able to develop more effective COIN policies in the mid-1980s, they were at a disadvantage against the mujahadeen, who not only benefited from extensive external support (including the provision of highly effective Stinger missiles from the United States) and religious fervor but were also in a position to "win by simply not losing."
The mujahadeen failed to unify as an insurgent force or offer an alternative form of governance, yet they were able to delegitimize the Kabul regime and defeat the Soviets after more than a decade of guerrilla war.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents) Fed up with the policies and cross-border incursions of Kampuchea's Khmer Rouge government, Vietnam invaded Kampuchea in December 1978. Initially welcomed for freeing the people of Cambodia from the depredations of Pol Pot, the Vietnamese quickly wore out their welcome. With the support of Thailand (and others further abroad), the Khmer Rouge reconstituted itself as a significant insurgency, and several other insurgent movements formed and contested the occupation. The 1984-1985 dry season saw the Vietnamese and their Cambodian proxies aggressively sweep the border regions free of insurgents and then build a "bamboo curtain" (with cleared ground, minefields, and defensive road networks) with their K5 plan. This ambitious operation was effective over the short term, but the bamboo curtain did not keep the insurgents out, and the use of forced labor in its construction further alienated the population. After several years of expensive stalemate, Vietnamese forces abandoned Cambodia to their indigenous proxies in 1989. The puppet government managed to hang on through the signing of the Paris Peace Agreement in 1991 and into the UN peacekeeping mission period. It was then soundly defeated at the polls.
Although the government unambiguously lost this insurgency, it is scored as a mixed outcome for two reasons. First, the principal insurgent group, the Khmer Rouge, also "lost" in that it was not particu-
The Cases 51 larly favored in the settlement or an important part of the postconflict governing coalition (other, more modestly sized and more moderate insurgent groups were). Second, although it withdrew and its puppet government was ultimately displaced, the government of Vietnam realized many of its more modest long-term political goals for Cambodia.
Case Outcome: COIN Win (Mixed, Favoring COIN)
The Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) offered a significant challenge to a kleptocratic and dictatorial Salvadoran government and a corrupt, barracks-bound Salvadoran military whose only significant victories were against the civilian population. With time bought by massive amounts of U.S. aid during the 1980s, the government of El Salvador democratized and increased its legitimacy, while the military increased its competence and improved its respect for human rights. By the end of the conflict, real evidence of reform corresponded with government and military statements and helped generate and sustain credibility and legitimacy. The conflict reached a stalemate in the late 1980s and was ultimately resolved through a settlement favorable to the government as external support to the insurgents dwindled and participation in the political process became an increasingly tenable approach to redressing grievances.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Mohamed Siad Barre's dictatorial regime was ousted by a decade-long insurgency that featured several insurgent groups fighting against the government. COIN forces repeatedly resorted to brutal tactics, which only served to galvanize the opposition and turn local populations against the military. Barre continuously underestimated the threat posed by the various insurgent factions while also failing to take heed of growing antigovernment sentiment among average Somalis. After years of wanton violence against civilians and any persons thought to be associated with certain tribes, Barre's government lost any support it once had, and the population actively supported the various insurgent groups in their quest to overthrow the dictator.
As the insurgency progressed, the two main insurgent groups operating in the north, the Somali National Movement (SNM) and the Somali Salvation Democratic Front (SSDF) began to capture territory throughout the country. Moreover, the SNM received material support from neighboring Ethiopia. Growing discord between Barre's regime and the military, coupled with a lack of a coherent COIN approach, contributed to his downfall. No longer able to bribe and coerce the myriad clans and tribes he had tactfully manipulated for so long, and facing a more organized and aggressive insurgency, Barre's forces eventually succumbed to defeat as he fled the country in the wake of his government's collapse. Somalia's clan-and tribal-based society was an ideal setting for guerrilla warfare, and the country has not had a functioning government since 1991.
Case Outcome: COIN Win Abimael Guzmán's Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, proved to be a surprisingly resilient threat to democratic Peru. Arising in the midst of a significant economic crisis that corrupt and squabbling government officials did little to resolve, Sendero was first treated as a law-enforcement problem. The threat grew largely unabated until 1982, when states of emergency were declared in many of the country's departments, allowing the military to enter the conflict. Massive repression and indiscriminate violence did little to help the government's cause. The late 1980s saw shifts in government strategies, with reduced repression and new attempts to encourage development. These initiatives were marred, however, by corruption and lack of unity of effort. Though Sendero never had the support of most of the population (the group was too violent and too radical), government and military incompetence led to widespread belief that the insurgents would win. All this changed with the 1990 election of Alberto Fujimori to the presidency and his administration's commitment to local defense forces and an intelligence-focused strategy that ultimately led to the capture of Guzmán and the disintegration of Sendero. Under Fujimori, for the
The Cases 53 first time in the conflict, the government, police, and military made effective use of what would now be called strategic communication, with a greater emphasis on government credibility and consistency between actions and messages.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Various opposition groups came together to fight against the Sandinista government shortly after its victory over the Somoza regime in late 1979. This insurgency is heralded as a classic example of the Reagan Doctrine in action. Backed by the Central Intelligence Agency, Contra insurgents gained momentum early in the conflict by catching the Sandinistas by surprise. After regrouping and improving intelligence collection during the second phase of the insurgency, the Sandinistas regained the upper hand. Ultimately, however, the Contras emerged victorious as a result of better training and organization, as well as considerable pressure exerted on the Sandinista government by the United States. Militarily, the support provided by the United States in the form of training, weapons, and money allowed the Contras to avoid defeat just long enough for the political elements of the insurgency to work in their favor. Politically, the U.S.-backed candidate, Violeta Chamorro, benefited significantly from the nearly $3 million spent by the National Endowment for Democracy on "technical assistance."
A separatist insurgency, the Movement of Democratic Forces of the Casamance (MFDC), troubled the government of Senegal for two full decades. Early on, the group "capitalized upon the grievances of the local populations, and received support from them." 10 However, in the early 1990s, the insurgency began receiving external support from neighboring countries the Gambia and Guinea-Bissau, which led it to escalate its tactics and turn on the local population. As the government of Senegal sought to improve relations with its neighbors in an effort to stem the flow of support for the insurgency, it also attempted to cut off any remaining internal support for the MFDC through what Wagane Faye has called a "politics of 'charm.'" "In response, the MFDC [became] engaged in the illegal exploitation of [Senegal's] natural resources."

The Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) began its insurgency as the outlawed party of an ethnic minority whose very existence was denied by the Turkish Constitution. The PKK struggled initially to develop support among a Kurdish population familiar with Turkish repression and not keen on further quixotic resistance. Over time, the PKK established itself as the premiere Kurdish cultural, political, and resistance organization and won significant regional popular support for its secessionist violence. This growth in support was a product not only of PKK successes but also of the repressive and heavy-handed response by Turkish authorities.
The PKK was defeated in 1999 after several years of "big stick" COIN by the Turks. Turkish forces had taken drastic measures to separate the insurgents from the population in the mountain villages in the area of conflict, aggressively pursued the insurgents into the mountains, sought to cut off cross-border support to them, and, most tellingly, made a political deal with extranational hosts to capture the authoritarian leader of the PKK, Abdullah Öcalan.
The civil war in Sudan pitted the developed Arab Muslim government in the north against the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA), representing Christians and animists in the rural, oil-rich south. The northern-based government sought to extend Islamic law throughout the country and benefit from the south's oil wealth, while the southern rebels fought to obtain autonomy. An ineffective COIN strategy motivated by religious convictions and a "military-first" approach hampered the Sudanese government's attempts to crush the insurgency. Despite factionalism within the SPLA and changes in its external sources of support, the insurgents were able to continue to launch attacks on government forces and Sudan's oil pipelines and infrastructure in the south. After two decades of fighting and widespread famine, the government bowed to significant international pressure and agreed to a negotiated settlement with the SPLA that included a power-sharing agreement with the south and the promise of a referendum on secession.
The Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) launched an insurgency against the Ugandan government in 1986, undertaking brutal attacks on civilians in the western region of the country. While a nominally Muslim group, the ADF did not have a clear religious agenda. Its vaguely stated goals were to overthrow the government and rid Uganda of Rwandan Tutsis. ADF attacks against civilians and military outposts increased in 1998, aided by external support from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and Sudan. Initially, the Ugandan government was unable to maintain security in the region, but it eventually contained the insurgency by attacking the ADF's rear bases in the DRC and by developing special COIN units trained in mountain warfare.
The insurgency on the island of Bougainville in Papua New Guinea was sparked by protests by local landowners against the policies of outside mining companies. The protests became increasingly violent after the government sent in troops to defend the mines, leading to the evolution of a wider secessionist movement. Attempts by the Papua New Guinea army to crush the rebellion by employing local militia forces and instituting a military and economic blockade of the island failed. After six years of low-intensity conflict, the president of Papua New Guinea contracted with a private military firm to aid his COIN efforts. This decision led to the collapse of the government and a decline in public support for the military effort. The government then pursued political negotiations, leading to agreement on a cease-fire in 1998 that promised broad powers of self-governance for Bougainville.
What began as a civil war soon descended into a frenzy of violence, with as many as seven armed insurgent groups vying for power simultaneously. Under the command of Samuel Doe, the Liberian army and its ethnic Krahn counterparts attacked other tribes seen as threatening Doe's power, specifically those in Nimba County. In response, Charles Taylor organized a rebel force across the border in Côte d'Ivoire, where the insurgents organized, trained, and prepared for battle.
Soldiers from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), the ECOWAS Monitoring Group (ECOMOG), supplanted a deteriorating government as the primary COIN force. Atrocities were committed by all sides, including the COIN forces, as each side sought to gain control over valuable natural resources, such as diamonds, gold, iron ore, and timber. Accusations of brutality, collusion, and corruption, especially among the Nigerian contingent, plagued the COIN force throughout the conflict and certainly contributed to its dearth of credibility. With the civilian population suffering from war fatigue and the combatants themselves battle-weary, the fighting began
The Cases 57 to ebb. After 13 failed attempts to reach a peace agreement, the conflict was finally terminated when Taylor's National Patriotic Front of Liberia received the tacit approval of Nigeria to sit for elections. Receiving an overwhelming 75 percent of the vote, Taylor and his National Patriotic Party defeated the 12 other candidates contesting for power in an election marred by widespread voter intimidation.
The civil war in Rwanda began in 1990 when the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF) invaded the country from its base in Uganda, seeking to establish democracy and the right of return for Tutsi refugees. After the RPF was turned back by Rwandan and French forces, it conducted an effective guerrilla campaign that ultimately led to the negotiation of a power-sharing agreement with the Hutu-led government. The political agreement with the RPF raised fears among the Hutu population over a reassertion of Tutsi power, however. In 1994, tensions came to a head when the plane carrying the Rwandan president was shot down and a genocidal campaign was declared by the radical Hutus who gained control of the provisional government. Over the next few months, the government became preoccupied with eliminating Tutsis and moderate Hutus. French forces withheld direct military support, which allowed the RPF to regroup and quickly defeat the Rwandan army, gaining control of the capital with little opposition.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Situated at the ethnic crossroads of several former empires, Moldova was host to violence that pitted pro-Romanian ethnic Moldovans against pro-Russian Dniesters in the early 1990s. 12 Suspicious that ethnic Moldovans in the government were planning to unite Moldova with Romania following independence, various elements in the Transdniester region, along the Moldova-Ukraine border, agitated for attacks against the Moldovan police. COIN forces were woefully underequipped and lacked a full-spectrum force. Furthermore, they were incapable of conducting high-intensity tactical assaults, despite having air supremacy and artillery superiority. The insurgents, on the other hand, acquired arms and heavy weapons from the Russian 14th Army, which was stationed in the region and provided seemingly unending tangible support to its ethnic kin. The support of a professional military proved to be the decisive factor in this lopsided insurgency.
The Moldovan government tried relentlessly and to no avail to resolve the conflict through diplomacy, with the Moldovan leader Mircea Snegur unwilling to unleash the full fury of his COIN force against his enemies. The insurgents then defeated the COIN forces in a short but bloody battle with the assistance of the Russian 14th Army and various mercenaries. The Transdniester region retains de facto independence and is still under supervision by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.
The COIN force in this conflict comprised a series of actors and lasted for more than a decade. The insurgents terrorized the population through looting, rape, mutilation, and murder. Control of the diamond fields was a central focus of the conflict and served as the primary motivation for the insurgents. Money gained from the sale of diamonds was used to pay fighters and acquire sophisticated weaponry.
During one stage in the conflict, the government of Valentine Strasser and the National Provisional Ruling Council hired the South African mercenary firm Executive Outcomes to conduct COIN operations. Ultimately, British-led COIN forces adopted good COIN practices, quelled the fighting, and restored order to the country. Indeed, the lack of continuity between COIN forces-the Sierra Leonean army, Executive Outcomes, ECOMOG, and the UN Mission in Sierra Leone (UNAMSIL)-certainly contributed to the prolonged nature
The Cases 59 of the insurgency. However, by reorganizing UNAMSIL into a more modern force with new leadership and better coordination at all levels, the COIN force was eventually able to adopt positive COIN practices in the later stages of the conflict. In addition to acquiring helicopter gunships, deploying a full signals battalion, and using detailed maps and satellite imagery, the COIN force was able to maintain regular contact for the first time between troop-contributing countries, the UN Security Council, and the secretariat through the UN's Department of Peacekeeping Operations. Furthermore, the COIN force kept its promise to protect the citizens during elections, providing the security necessary for Sierra Leoneans to vote at the polls with little fear of being attacked. Approximately 47,000 excombatants turned in their weapons, making the use of force by the counterinsurgents largely unnecessary during the final phase of the insurgency and lending a sense of credibility to the nearly disgraced UNAMSIL mission.
Some have called UNAMSIL the "model mission." To be sure, the COIN force was not without its shortcomings. However, at its height, UNAMSIL had roughly 17,000 troops and a large civilian staff operating at a cost of $700 million per year. Although it was not recognized as such at the time, adherence to strategic communication principles was a major factor in the mission's success. Indeed, the COIN force was able to maintain credibility with the local population, achieve unity of effort, and keep consistency in its message. This was accomplished by coordinating a large-scale disarmament program, successfully organizing elections, and, above all, providing a secure environment for the population.

The insurgency by the Armed Islamic Group (GIA) was prompted by the Algerian government's decision to cancel an election that was expected to put an Islamic party in power. The GIA initiated an urban terror campaign that became increasingly violent and targeted toward civilians. While the military government in Algiers took brutal repressive actions against the insurgency, the GIA's attacks were viewed as even more violent and threatening. After a series of civilian massacres, by 1998, the GIA had lost much of its public support. The government then pursued a more effective COIN strategy, implementing an amnesty program, targeting the GIA hardliners, and offering political concessions, which helped to defeat an already weakened and fragmented GIA.
The insurgency in Croatia was fought between the Croatian army (HV) and various elements of the Yugoslav People's Army (JNA) and other Serb insurgent forces, which attempted to form their own independent enclave within Croatia known as the Republic of Serbian Krajina.
This three-year conflict saw innumerable failed cease-fires and egregious human rights violations committed by both sides. After two and a half years of on-again, off-again fighting, the government prevailed as a result of two overarching factors: First, the Croatian military completely revamped itself from a second-rate fighting force into a formidable army with the assistance of the United States. Second, and equally important, the insurgents were abandoned by Belgrade as Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic diverted his support elsewhere in the Balkans in an attempt to capitalize on insurgent success in neighboring Bosnia.
Following its transformation into a respected military, the HV was able to reduce tangible support to the insurgents and was strong enough to force the Serbs to fight as guerrillas. As a result, the government in Zagreb soon garnered the perception of a competent and
The Cases 61 capable state. While the Croats fought valiantly throughout the conflict, it was not until the final phase that they were able to put all the pieces together, launching two devastating COIN operations (Flash  and Storm in May and August 1995, respectively).
Despite employing many poor COIN practices, including severe repression, the Croats exhibited enough positive practices on balance to prevail and secure the country's independence with its capital in Zagreb.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents)   After the fall of the Soviet-supported Najibullah regime in 1992, Afghanistan lacked a legitimate central government. Kabul was governed by a coalition of former mujahadeen who competed for power among themselves, leading the country to devolve into a state of warlordism. The Taliban rose to prominence in 1994 by establishing a devout and disciplined militia that promised to restore order and security to the country. Taliban leaders received support from Pakistan and the war-weary Afghan population and were able to defeat what remained of the divided mujahadeen government, seize control of Kabul, and establish their own unified yet brutal government.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents)   Less than a year after gaining independence from the Soviet Union, a mix of democrats, Tajik nationalists, and Islamists joined together to form the United Tajik Opposition (UTO) to challenge the communist-based government in Dushanbe. The UTO briefly gained control of the capital before being forced out by former government leaders, aided by Russian and Uzbek forces, employing brutal methods and inflicting significant civilian casualties. Upon its retreat, the UTO began launching attacks from bases in Afghanistan and became more closely associated with the Islamic movement.
The new government of Tajikistan subsequently did little to meet the needs of its populace and relied increasingly on Russian military support. While Tajik leader Emomali Rahmonov bowed to pressure to make some changes to his government and military leadership, they were not sufficient for the rebels, who continued to launch attacks. Only after the Taliban gained control of Afghanistan did Russia and Uzbekistan force the Tajik government to make greater concessions. This outside pressure led to the signing of the Peace and National Reconciliation Accord that met most of the UTO's political demands.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents)
Long a hotbed of unrest, the disputed Abkhaz region was one of many areas that erupted in violence following the dissolution of the Soviet Union. The Georgia/Abkhazia border region became host to an insurgency after the kidnapping of Georgian government officials in 1992. Control of the capital, Sukhumi, switched hands several times, and the two-year conflict featured numerous failed cease-fires. Abkhazian insurgents defeated Georgian COIN forces in a conflict characterized by atrocities on both sides, which fits the general pattern of insurgency warfare in the post-Soviet Transcaucasus. Volunteers from the Confederation of Peoples of the North Caucasus and Russian soldiers supplemented the insurgent force. The COIN force's inability to seal the country's borders allowed insurgent fighters, weapons, and materiel to prolong the conflict and provided the Abkhaz with the resources necessary to emerge victorious.
In addition to fighting Abkhaz insurgents, Georgian COIN forces were simultaneously engaged in a civil war against Georgian rebels and a war in South Ossetia. Ultimately, Russian soldiers tipped the balance in favor of the insurgents. Eager to end the fighting, Georgia begrudgingly accepted membership in the Commonwealth of Independent States as a precondition to Moscow's influence in bringing intra-Georgian fighting to a halt. Abkhazia gained de facto independence following the end of the insurgency and expelled the majority of the Georgian population living within its borders.
The Cases 63
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents)   In another case of post-Soviet separatism, Azerbaijani authorities had governed Nagorno-Karabakh 14 directly with tacit approval from the Kremlin beginning in the late 1980s. When its Armenian majority declared the territory an independent state completely free from Azerbaijani rule, the two sides mobilized for war.
A more disciplined, better organized Karabakh Armenian insurgency defeated Azerbaijani COIN forces with the assistance of Russia, which provided weapons and troops to both sides in the conflict at various points. Political discord in Baku contributed significantly to the counterinsurgents' inability to muster an organized fighting force capable of defeating the insurgency. This case is a clear example of how ineffectual political leadership can adversely affect battlefield performance. Moreover, the Armenians possessed superior fighting skills from their experience in the former Soviet army. By the time the fighting came to an end, Armenian insurgents controlled not only Nagorno-Karabakh proper but also approximately 15 percent of Azerbaijani territory. Russia helped negotiate a cease-fire in May 1994, with a major stipulation being the recognition of Nagorno-Karabakh as a third party in the war. The situation in Nagorno-Karabakh remains unresolved today and is commonly referred to as a "frozen conflict" because of the inability to find a lasting resolution that is acceptable to all sides.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents) Following Bosnia's independence after the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serb insurgents battled both Bosnian Muslims and Bosnian Croats for control of territory. COIN forces were underequipped and frequently fought with each other, while the insurgents were more organized, highly motivated, and better equipped. "Arkan's Tigers" were an extremely brutal but highly effective paramilitary unit oper-

Bosnia was also the scene of the Srebrenica massacre, a campaign of ethnic cleansing orchestrated by Bosnian Serb insurgents that led to the deaths of more than 8,000 Bosnian Muslims and the exodus of an additional 25,000-30,000 refugees.
The Srebrenica massacre and another large-scale slaughter of civilians in Markale prompted the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) to intervene to end the fighting in the waning stages of the conflict, but Bosnian Serb insurgents secured a significant portion of territory and established the autonomous Republika Srpska, with close ties to Belgrade. The insurgency officially ended with the signing of the General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina in Paris on December 14, 1995.   Burundi, 1993-2003   Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents)
Burundi has long been plagued by ethnic conflict between the Tutsi minority, which maintained control of the government, and the majority Hutu population. In 1993, a series of ethnic massacres occurred after the country's first democratically elected Hutu president was assassinated. Subsequent instability led the Tutsi-dominated army to reassert control and reinstall a Tutsi-led government under Pierre Buyoya. The Buyoya regime implemented harsh COIN tactics, including widespread forcible resettlements, which served to reduce popular support for the government. Only after a decade of fighting, tens of thousands of deaths, and hundreds of thousands of displacements was a peace agreement finally reached with the Forces for the Defense of Democracy (FDD, one of the two major Hutu insurgent groups), in which the FDD agreed to abandon its armed struggle in exchange for guaranteed representation in the government.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents)   After failing to put down a rebellion by proxy in the breakaway Republic of Chechnya, Russian forces entered Grozny in December 1994.
As the COIN force, the Russian army was plagued by a lack of training, severely disjointed command and control, and an unclear mission. Chechen insurgents, however, were highly motivated, familiar with the terrain, and able to marshal the resources necessary to exploit the Russians in asymmetric engagements.
The insurgents proved to be as adaptable and flexible as the COIN force was cumbersome. Realizing that hit-and-run tactics would require a high degree of mobility, the Chechens used light and portable grenade launchers, machine guns, and antitank weapons. The Chechens employed a technique known as "hugging," in which they stayed close to the Russian infantry in urban areas (usually less than 50 meters) to reduce casualties from COIN artillery and air attacks. Furthermore, the insurgents had an extensive support network among the population, which provided them with real-time intelligence, food, weapons, and fuel. The conflict devolved into carnage with widespread atrocities committed by both sides before a Russian withdrawal in 1996.
The Taliban took power from an unstable mujahadeen government in Kabul in 1996 and consolidated control over much of the country over the course of the next two years (with the help of Pakistani and foreign jihadist fighters). It failed, however, to establish an effective administrative apparatus that could provide services to the population or gain popular support for the regime. Welcomed at first for imposing order after years of chaos and bloodshed, the Taliban alienated many Afghans and isolated itself from the international community with its brutal imposition of Islamic law. Ultimately, the Taliban's decision to host Osama bin Laden and allow him to establish al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan led the Taliban to be driven from power by a U.S.-led coalition in November 2001.
The eastern region of Zaire was destabilized by the civil war in neighboring Rwanda and the influx of Hutus across the border. The displaced Hutus threatened the native Tutsi population in Zaire and established a base for rebel attacks against the new Rwandan government. In response to this threat, local Tutsis and the Rwandan army launched a preemptive attack on the Hutu militia and the Zairian army that supported it. A national rebel group under the leadership of Laurent Kabila was then formed to lead the fight against Zairian President Mobutu Sese Seko's regime. Kabila faced little resistance from Mobutu's poorly equipped army. Aided by the Rwandan, Ugandan, and Angolan armies, Kabila was able to take control of the capital within a matter of months.
Case Outcome: COIN Loss Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents battled Federal Republic of Yugoslavia COIN forces to a stalemate for most of the duration of this conflict. The KLA received financial assistance from the Kosovar Albanian diaspora and also benefited from the implosion of the government in neighboring Albania, which resulted in significant amounts of weaponry flooding across the border into the hands of the KLA.
The Racak massacre carried out by COIN forces prompted NATO to intervene on the side of the insurgents in an attempt to prevent ethnic cleansing and defeat the Milosevic regime. NATO forces conducted a three-month air campaign while KLA insurgents fought Serbian troops on the ground, resulting in Milosevic's capitulation and the imposition of a UN-backed peacekeeping force. While various commentators speculate on the motives for Milosevic's concession of the war, the primary reason is unequivocal: NATO air power was the deciding factor in bringing the conflict to a close. Following its unilateral declaration of independence in February 2008 as the Republic of Kosovo, the country is recognized as an independent nation by 63 UN member states, including the United States.

Case Outcome: COIN Loss (Mixed, Favoring Insurgents)
The second Congolese war began in 1998 with the invasion of Rwandan and Ugandan forces seeking to overthrow DRC President Laurent Kabila, their former ally. Kabila countered the threat to his government by engaging Angolan, Zimbabwean, and Namibian forces and local militia groups in his defense. The war then devolved into a conflict of pillage and partition as the various regional forces battled for control of the country's resources. Efforts toward political compromise and international negotiation began in 2001 after the president was assassinated and replaced by his son, Joseph. Joseph Kabila eventually concluded a cease-fire agreement with the Ugandan, Rwandan, and other foreign forces and a power-sharing deal with the major rebel groups, which greatly reduced the level of fighting by 2003.
These narratives provide some context for the quantitative analysis, presented in the next chapter. The accompanying volume provides more detail on the 41 new cases (see Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Detailed Counterinsurgency Case Studies for the same material on the 30 cases previously studied), including
• a short summary of the case • a summary of each phase of the case, including key factors for that phase • a discussion of the conventional explanations for the outcomes of the case, as offered in existing secondary analysis • a list of distinct features of the case.

The goal of this research was to answer a range of questions about or related to the historical effectiveness of a variety of COIN concepts and associated practices. These are fundamentally comparative questions and are based on the assumption that the historical cases in which these different practices have been observed are comparable. Moreover, to make the results of such analyses of more than just historical interest, the historical cases must be comparable to likely future cases as well. This chapter argues that some of the 71 cases discussed in Chapter Two, while individually interesting, are not good comparisons with other historical cases and with likely future cases and thus should be excluded from comparative analysis. After identifying these suboptimal cases for comparative analysis and indicating which cases constitute the 59 core cases used for our core analysis, the chapter then turns to the identification of several subsets within the data-cases that are members of smaller populations of cases with shared features. These are the cases that followed each of the two main COIN paths (the cases involving "iron fist" COIN approaches and those pursuing motive-focused approaches) and cases involving an external actor committing forces on the COIN side. Those cases involving an external actor committing forces to support the COIN effort constitute a comparative group of particular interest to the U.S. Department of Defense, because the role of external actor in support of a COIN effort in another country is the most likely COIN-related role for U.S. forces in both the short-and long-term future.
One of the oft-repeated themes in the literature on COIN is that "every insurgency is unique" and, thus, every COIN campaign must be unique. 1 However, in Victory Has a Thousand Fathers, we found that the distinctiveness of insurgencies did not matter across the 30 cases analyzed in that original study, in that a relatively modest list of factors was able to perfectly discriminate the cases into wins and losses without making any recourse to distinctive features or narratives of exceptionality. This led to the conclusion there that "every insurgency may be unique, but not at this level of analysis," noting that distinct features of cases may make it harder or easier to do the things that must be done in order to prevail but that these things remained constant across the cases studied.

1 Each of the following documents contains the quotation "every insurgency is unique": Joe Felter, "Taking Guns to a Knife Fight: An Empirical Study of Effective Counterinsurgency," paper presented at the annual meeting of the American Political Science Association, Philadelphia, Pa., August 31, 2006 
With the broader data set considered here relative to the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers research, we faced the possibility that cases would have such distinctive characteristics or narratives as to not be comparable with other cases. In fact, preliminary explorations of the case data revealed several instances in which the COIN force had followed many of the COIN practices endorsed in Victory Has a Thousand Fathers yet still managed to lose to the insurgents. The case narratives confirmed the validity of this observation but also revealed something else, something distinctive yet common to all of these peculiar cases: They were all "fought against the tide of history"-that is, against the trends of very strong global social and political forces. Specifically, they represented either the end of the colonial era or the end of apartheid. (Each case fought against the tide of history is so noted in the case summaries in Chapter Two.) What appeared at first to be something unique in each of several cases in fact turned out to be a whole category of exceptional cases. Rather than caveating every good COIN practice identified as "effective, except when fighting against the tide of history" throughout this report, we elected to exclude such cases from all core analyses.
We concluded that cases fought against the tide of history are apples to oranges with the typical COIN cases, the ones we wish to learn lessons from. To eliminate the unwelcome distinctiveness of otherwise "good" COIN practices failing to stem the tide of history, we added a factor to the factor list, "Case fought against the tide of history." (See Appendix E for a full list of all factors and factor numbers.) Every case that was fought against the tide of history (either the end of colonialism or the end of apartheid) in its decisive phase was flagged for removal from the set of core cases. This made the most sense analytically and allowed for a more robust set of findings. The "tide of history" cases are listed in Table 
3
The observant reader will notice that Kenya is included on the list and that Kenya was reported in the previous chapter as a COIN win. This might lead one to ask, "If you can win when fighting against the tide of history, then how strong is that tide, really?" Be reassured that, while the British did manage to suppress the Mau Mau Rebellion in Kenya, they also granted Kenya its independence just a few years later. The tide of history remains, appropriately, inexorable.
The even more astute reader may note that Malaya (1948-1955)  is not listed as a tide of history case, though it clearly began as an anticolonial insurgency. In fact, we did score the first phase of Malaya as fought against the tide of history, but the later phases (and, critically, the decisive phase) were not scored as such because the British had taken steps to transition power and authority to an indigenous government. Although they continued to help fight the insurgency in support of that new government, by the end of the conflict, the British no longer fought to retain colonial control. With the class of cases fought against the tide of history flagged for removal from core analyses, we identified a single additional possibly distinctive case. In fact, it might well be argued that this last case of concern is also a member of a distinctive class that should be excluded from the analyses, though this argument might be weakened by the fact that there is but a single case in that class. The class in question denotes cases whose outcomes were so mixed, so close to the razor's edge of clarity on whether the outcome favored the insurgents or the government, that including it adds little information about what is or is not effective COIN practice. The case we ultimately decided belongs to this class (and, ultimately, excluded from the analysis) is La Violencia in Colombia (1948-1958). A detailed discussion of the grounds on which La Violencia was excluded can be found in Appendix A. This final exclusion left us with 59 cases, hereafter referred to as the 59 core cases, which formed the analytic foundation for the core analyses that follow. The 59 core cases are depicted in Figure 
3
Within the 59 core cases, we further identified several subpopulations of particular comparative interest. In Chapter One, we identified two paths taken by the COIN forces in these historical cases. The first was the "iron fist" path, cases in which with the main efforts of the COIN forces were kinetic actions against an active insurgency. The second was the motive-focused path, in which the focus was on reducing the motives for supporting or participating in the insurgency-notably, sometimes with a substantial balance between motive focus and kinetic action against the insurgents. Seeing these two paths, and mindful of contemporary debate on COIN in which the merits of much more kinetic concepts are discussed, we wanted to identify cases representing each of these paths to see whether there were any differences in the correlates of success. Table 
3
The other group of cases that we separated out as constituting one or more subpopulations were those with external supporters on the COIN side. We scored a number of factors related to external support for each phase of each case (see Appendix E). Because so many COIN forces received external support in the form of funding or materiel at some point during the case as to render the presence or absence of such support a meaningless distinction, we chose to focus on the commitment of military force by major powers. Further exploration of the cases revealed two distinct levels of external force commitment:
(1) those that were restricted to advisers, special operations forces (SOF), and air power and (2) those that involved a substantial commitment of conventional ground forces, up to and including being the primary COIN force. These are not mutually exclusive categories,  nor are they meant to be; advisers or trainers, special operators, and air power commitments usually accompanied external commitments of significant conventional ground forces. A case was considered to involve external force contributions limited to advisers, SOF, and/or air power if such forces were present in any phase in the conflict and if in no phase did the external contribution include significant ground forces. A case was considered to involve external ground troops if in any phase an external actor provided significant ground combat forces. Table 
3
Turning to the subpopulations provides an even finer level of granularity. Just considering the win/loss ratio for cases in each subpopulation is revealing. Among the 59 core cases, the insurgents prevailed in 31 (53 percent). This is understandably lower than the full data set proportion, as the largest excluded class was cases fought against the tide of history, predominantly a losing proposition for the counterinsurgents.
Among the 44 iron fist cases, the insurgents prevailed in fully 27 of them (just over 61 percent). In the 15 motive-focused cases, on the other hand, only four were COIN losses (27 percent). This clearly shows, without any further analysis, that while both paths can lead to victory, in actual practice the motive-focused path leads to victory more often. The iron fist path leads to victory well less than two-fifths of the time, while the motive-focused path leads there solidly more than two-thirds of the time.
Considering the 28 cases that involved forces from a major external power intervening on behalf of the government, 14 (50 percent) were COIN losses. For those contemplating intervening to support a government, this is good news; the rate of failure for externally supported governments is slightly lower than the base rate in the 59 core cases (53 percent), demonstrating that, by itself, being an external actor does not automatically doom one's COIN campaign to failure. Looking at the rate in the two subclasses of external supporters, COIN forces that received only advisers, SOF, and/or air power lost six of 80 Paths to Victory: Lessons from Modern Insurgencies 13 cases (46 percent), while those that received significant external ground forces lost eight of 15 cases (53 percent). Given the relatively small number of cases in these subpopulations, these are not significant differences. Again, good news for the would-be external supporter: The outcomes of cases involving external COIN supporters are determined by factors other than the presence of an external supporter! With the class exemptions now identified for removal and the subpopulations of interest defined, the report now proceeds to the core analyses, seeking answers to all project questions first for the core data, the 59 core cases. The subpopulations receive more detailed treatment in Chapter Six.
Insurgency is a complex subset of warfare. Current U.S. doctrine defines insurgency as "the organized use of subversion or violence by a group or movement that seeks to overthrow or force change of a governing authority." 1 Essentially, insurgency is an organized, protracted politico-military struggle designed to weaken the control and legitimacy of an established government, occupying power, or other political authority while increasing insurgent control.
The mirror image of insurgency is counterinsurgency, a combination of offensive, defensive, and stability operations. The doctrinal definition of counterinsurgency is "comprehensive civilian and military efforts taken to defeat an insurgency and to address any core grievances."

Our review of the COIN literature covered everything from the classics to contemporary contributions from academics, practitioners, and military officers. Based on this broad review, we extrapolated 24 distinct concepts, partial concepts, or collections of practical advice for COIN. 
3
The 24 COIN concepts are listed in Table 
4
3
As we reviewed and synthesized the concepts, we identified a set of core tenets for each (reported later in this chapter). Based on these tenets, we then identified sets of discrete, measurable factors to represent each concept and identified them as either present or absent in each case. Details of the process that we used to select and refine the factors, along with details of the process by which the factors were determined to be present or absent for each case, can be found in Appendix A, in the section "Factor Generation, Evaluation, and Scoring." Our previous research, as reported in Victory Has a Thousand Fathers, followed the same process and evaluated many of the same concepts for the 30 insurgencies begun and completed between 1978 and 2008 (all 30 of which are included in the 59 core cases on which the current analysis is based). Details of differences between the concepts tested in that earlier research and the concepts tested here, as well as the few differences in results, can be found in Appendix D.
Preliminary analyses involved comparing the relationships between different factors and the case outcomes. This began with the assessment of simple 2×2 tables for each factor against each outcome.  Table 
4
4
Each concept is represented by between one and ten discrete factors. The factors are listed after the tenets for each concept later in this chapter. Because each concept is represented by more than one factor, we faced a challenging question: How many of the factors associated with a given concept for COIN must have been present in a case before the COIN force is considered to have implemented that concept? Rather than attempting to answer this question in an abstract or theory-based way, we let the data speak and sought the best empirical cut point for each concept.
For each COIN concept, we created a new factor that was the sum of all the factors tied to that concept and present in a given phase or case. We then chose a threshold value for that sum that maximized the number of COIN wins associated with the implementation of the concepts while minimizing the number of COIN losses. Here is a concrete example: Legitimacy of the use of force as a COIN concept is represented in the data by six discrete factors (listed later in this chapter in the section "Legitimacy"). For each case, we summed these six factors, creating a new variable, "sum of legitimacy of the use force factors."
The results are shown in Table

In this section, we introduce and test each of the COIN concepts listed in Table

Testing Concepts for Counterinsurgency 87
The "hearts and minds" 
4
• Development leads to indigenous support.
• Those who have something worth fighting for will fight for it.
• Development leads to increased indigenous capacity.
• Development is painful; short-term handouts ease the pain of development.
While the phrase hearts and minds itself may have become a cliché, the ideas behind this concept still retain relevance. The central proposition is that development and modernity will give the population a positive stake in order and good governance and thus deprive insurgents of their support. The catch, of course, is that development and modernity can cause painful dislocations and disruptions in the old institutions of a traditional society. 
5
6
This COIN concept prescribes increasing political rights, improving standards of living, and reducing corruption in the government while pursuing a path to development. The development concept follows popular support-based theory, positing that development leads to support, and support leads to positive COIN outcomes. 
7
The development concept is represented in our analysis by four factors. The threshold for a COIN force to receive credit for implementing this concept is having at least two of the following four factors present:
• Short-term investments, improvements in infrastructure or development, or property reform occurred in the area of conflict that was controlled or claimed by the COIN force. • In the area of conflict, the COIN force was not perceived as worse than the insurgents. • Planned reconstruction/development improvements were substantially above the historical baseline. • Reconstruction/development met at least two of these criteria: based on popular demand, initiated mainly at the village level, used local labor/created local jobs, aimed at self-empowerment of the people, and was sustainable.
As Table

Primarily thought of as a Vietnam War-era concept, pacification is a broad and fairly vague umbrella term for a handful of population-centric COIN concepts that focus on the local level. 8 These concepts emphasize the simultaneous pursuit of development and security, beginning on a small scale then then expanding across geographic locales. Classic pacification relates to the "community policing" perspective that was developed domestically in the United States in the 1970s. 9
The core tenets of pacification are as follows:
Again, while often considered a concept of yesteryear, pacification has stood the test of time, bridging the gap between classic and contemporary. This can be directly attributed to its focus on the population as a key to effective COIN. The support of the population is again implicitly important, but here that support is won locally. A premium is placed on providing and maintaining security at the local community or village level and then expanding the area that is "pacified." Though focused on the population, this concept implicitly balances efforts to reduce the population's motives and opportunities to support the insurgents, and of course the emphasis on local security includes an element of kinetic action against active insurgents.
Pacification is represented by six factors in our analysis:
• A perception of security was created or maintained among populations in areas that the COIN force claimed to control. • Short-term investments, improvements in infrastructure or development, or property reform occurred in the area of conflict that was controlled or claimed by the COIN force. • The COIN force established and then expanded secure areas.
• Planned reconstruction/development improvements were substantially above the historical baseline. • COIN force undertook all three of clear, hold, and build.
• Reconstruction/development met at least two of these criteria: based on popular demand, initiated mainly at the village level, used local labor/created local jobs, aimed at self-empowerment of the people, and was sustainable.
The empirical cut point for the factor stack requires that at least two of these factors be present for the COIN force to qualify as having employed pacification.
Pacification receives strong support from these data. Every COIN force that realized at least two of these six factors won. (See  
Sociologist Max Weber wrote extensively on the societal importance of legitimacy and authority. 
13
• Insurgency is fundamentally a contest of legitimacy. 
14
-has a monopoly on the use of violence
15
16
17
• The government's role can be expanded to include the need to protect legitimacy by avoiding collateral damage. 
18
Perceptions of legitimacy are complicated and involve contextual nuances. Legitimacy should always be evaluated as a perception of the stakeholders, not against some arbitrary external standard.
Because so many different aspects of and behaviors by the government and the COIN force can affect perceptions of legitimacy in a way that could relate to COIN outcomes, we divide legitimacy into "government legitimacy" and "legitimacy of force" for our analysis.
Government legitimacy was represented by these two factors:
• Government leaders were selected in a manner considered just and fair by the majority of the population in the area of conflict. • The majority of citizens viewed the government as legitimate in the area of conflict.
Having either factor was an empirical threshold. Twenty-three cases had at least one of the government legitimacy factors, and 17 of them were COIN wins; 36 cases lacked either of the legitimacy of government factors, and the vast majority (25, or 69 percent) were COIN losses. This degree of correlation is evidence in support of the importance of government legitimacy. (See Table 4.6.)    Legitimate Use of Force
Six factors represent the legitimacy of the COIN force's use of force:
• The COIN force avoided excessive collateral damage, disproportionate use of force, or other illegitimate applications of force. • COIN force collateral damage was not perceived by the population in the area of conflict as worse than the insurgents'. • In the area of conflict, the COIN force was not perceived as worse than the insurgents. • The perception of security was created or maintained among populations in areas that the COIN force claimed to control. • COIN force did not employ the indiscriminate force.
• The COIN force did not employ practices considered beyond the pale by contemporary U.S. ethical standards.
The empirical break point for legitimate use of force was four of the six factors, a relatively high threshold. Of the 14 cases with at least four legitimate use of force factors, 13 were COIN wins. This is strong evidence in support of the importance of government legitimacy. (See  Table 4.7.)   
If an insurgency draws support from those frustrated with the performance of the government, improving government performance is a logical way to reduce that support. Similarly, if the way security forces deal with insurgents further alienates the population, such efforts can be counterproductive. Reform, of both the government and the security forces, is a motive-focused concept that can increase the legitimacy of the state and undermine support for insurgents as a better alternative. The core tenets are as follows:
• Government reform portrays the government as responsive and responsible, and changes leading to greater professionalism and good governance increase legitimacy.  Reform was represented in the analysis by the following five factors:
• Government corruption reduced/good governance increased since the onset of the conflict. • There were significant government reforms since the onset of conflict. • There were significant ethical/professional/human rights-related military reforms since the onset of conflict. • There were significant government or military reforms in this phase.
• Reforms were recognized/appreciated by the population in the area of conflict.
The best empirical cutpoint for these five factors proved to be at least four of the five. The government won 11 of the 12 cases that had four or five of these five factors in the decisive phase. This provides strong evidence in support of reform as an effective COIN concept. (See Table 
4
If insurgencies are initially motivated by a set of grievances, and continued grievances sustain support for insurgencies, then redress of those grievances should lead to reconciliation and peace. Like reform, redress is related to legitimacy and, as such, is a motive-focused concept. The core tenet is as follows:
• The redress of grievances addresses the root causes of the conflict and increases the legitimacy of the host-nation government. 
21
• Grievances leading to the initial insurgency substantially resolved.
• Insurgents' grievances substantially addressed since the onset of the conflict. • COIN force or government actions did not contribute to substantial new grievances claimed by the insurgents.
These three factors did not yield an empirical cut point, because there was very limited correlation between these factors and outcome. Table 
4
21
22
Democracy is advocated as a way to increase the legitimacy of a government and as a way to resolve grievances short of violence. The core tenets of this concept are as follows: 23
• Democratic voice and expression resolve grievances.
• Democracy equals legitimacy.
At its undertheorized worst, democracy is held to be a panacea. 
24
Democracy is represented by four factors, the first two of which are mutually exclusive (so no more than three of the four factors could be present in any one case):
• The government is a functional democracy. • The government is a partial or transitional democracy.
• Free and fair elections were held.
• The government respects human rights and allows a free press.
The empirical cut point is having at least one of these four factors. As Table 
4
As a COIN concept, unity of effort draws on the classic military imperative, positing that successful COIN forces coordinate the efforts of all security forces, and the government more broadly, toward a unified purpose. Achieving unity of effort is often difficult in COIN, especially when balancing between sometimes-competing actions related to diminishing motive and eliminating the insurgent threat. The core tenet is as follows:
• When COIN forces are able to maintain unity of effort, it drives the core common goals and stated purpose/objectives of the mission. Unity of effort was represented by a single factor:
• Unity of effort/unity of command was maintained.
When unity of effort was maintained, the COIN force won in 24 out of 29 cases; when it was not, the COIN force lost in 26 out of 30 cases. (See Table 4.11.) This constitutes support for unity of effort. 
Pacification also has been used occasionally throughout history as a euphemism for relocation and resettlement-actions that take the prescription to separate the population from the insurgents quite literally.

During the Vietnam War era and writing in opposition to those who advocated popular support-based concepts for COIN, RAND's Nathan Leites and Charles Wolf, Jr., focused instead on insurgents' needs for certain inputs. 
34
• Treat the insurgency as a system.
• COIN forces must increase the cost of insurgent inputs.
• COIN forces must interrupt the process by which inputs are converted into activities. • COIN forces must destroy insurgent outputs.
• COIN forces should seek to blunt the impact of insurgent outputs.
Leites and Wolf suggested that insurgencies are best viewed as systems and that COIN efforts should be evaluated in terms of how well they either raised the cost of inputs to the system or interfered with outputs. 
36
In effect, development made more resources available to citizens, which insurgents could then acquire from the population through persuasion, coercion, or a combination of the two. Thus, paradoxically, programs designed to reduce popular support for insurgents could actually reduce the insurgent cost for inputs such as food. 
37
The core elements of a cost-benefit concept are captured in six factors in this analysis:
• COIN force efforts resulted in increased costs for insurgent processes.
• COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent recruiting.
• COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent materiel acquisition.
• COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent intelligence.
• COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent financing.
• COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent command and control.
104 Paths to Victory: Lessons from Modern Insurgencies
Having at least two of these six factors is the empirical cut point used as the threshold for the factor stack to represent the cost-benefit concept. There is a very strong correlation between the application of the cost-benefit concept and outcome, with 25 of 26 cases with at least two cost-benefit factors being COIN wins, and only three COIN wins coming without at least two of these factors. (See Table 4.14.) This constitutes strong evidence in favor of cost-benefit. 
The importance of border security follows the logic of the cost-benefit concept: If the insurgent "system" is able to freely receive inputs from cross-border sources, efforts to restrict in-country insurgent inputs will be far less consequential. "Indeed, with few exceptions (perhaps most notably Cuba), successful insurgencies have been able to obtain aid and comfort from outside sources." 38 This is a concept targeting insurgent support, but through kinetic/physical means. Tenets include the following: 39
• Insurgencies benefit from cross-border support and havens.
• Securing the border reduces the flow of fighters and materiel and/ or provides useful intelligence. • Secure borders increase international legitimacy.
The importance of border security is clearly evident in contemporary Afghanistan, where the Taliban has been able to move fighters, money, and materiel back and forth between that country and neighboring Pakistan. Although remotely piloted drones patrol the skies above the Federally Administered Tribal Areas on the Pakistani side of the border, the rugged terrain and centuries-old smuggling routes make sealing the border virtually impossible.
As a COIN concept, border control is always connected to other concepts, such as cost-benefit (deprive the insurgents of cross-border inputs), tangible support reduction, and legitimacy.
Border control is represented in the analysis by a single factor:
• The flow of cross-border insurgent support significantly decreased or remained dramatically reduced or largely absent.
Table

Seizing the initiative is a timeless military imperative predicated on striking fast, striking first, and striking hard. We discerned a single core tenet:
• Seizing and maintaining the initiative puts the COIN force in position to beat the insurgents back and gain the upper hand in a given phase. 
40
• Fighting in phase initiated primarily by COIN forces.
In the majority of cases won by the government (22 of 28), the COIN force held the initiative in the decisive phase. However, in cases won by the insurgents, the COIN force also held the initiative almost one-third of the time (ten of 31; see Table 4.16). When we interrogated the case narratives looking for an explanation, one offered itself: the difference between seizing the initiative by blindly striking first and seizing the initiative by coupling flexible and dynamic capabilities with actionable intelligence. Looking more closely at the theoretical literature, several scholars assert that successfully seizing and maintaining the initiative depends in large part on actionable intelligence.

"Crush them" is a concept singularly focused on the kinetic elimination of both active insurgents and the support they need. gency can be annihilated through the vigorous application of force and repression. 
42
43
• Escalating repression can crush an insurgency.
This concept sits uneasily alongside legitimacy and popular support-based concepts, because repression and unrestrained force are unlikely to be well regarded by the population at large. Indeed, an established insurgency met with escalating repression would likely gain further domestic and international support and legitimacy. What separates a nascent insurgency from a mature one and the resulting implications for this theory are not well articulated in the existing literature. The use of escalating repression is not limited strictly to dictatorships, but democracies typically lack the political will to employ this tactic for a prolonged period. After all, democracies, in theory at least, must respond to their domestic constituencies, while dictatorships have far more leeway in crafting COIN strategies. This concept sounds like it belongs in the "iron fist" playbook, and, in fact, most COIN forces employing "crush them" generally belong in that category. The two are not equivalent, however. An iron fist COIN effort focuses almost exclusively on the insurgents, and almost exclusively through kinetic means. That does not necessarily mean that the force applied to the insurgents is not discriminate and proportionate, or that supporting or source populations are also targeted. "Crush them," however, focuses both on the application of force to insurgents and on repression of supporting populations.
42 James Clancy and Chuck Crosset, "Measuring Effectiveness in Irregular Warfare," Parameters, Summer 2007. The authors note that "combat operations have defeated insurgencies by overwhelming and annihilating the insurgency and its supporters through bombings, massive raids, heavy shelling, and even torture and executions" (p. 91). "The quick and overwhelming smothering of an infant insurgency is a very effective tactic" (p. 92).
Escalating repression as a COIN concept is captured in the analysis by two factors:
• The COIN force employed escalating repression.
• The COIN force employed collective punishment.
Our data provide strong evidence against repression as a concept for COIN, as there is a strong negative correlation between the presence of both "crush them" factors and case outcome. (See Table 4.18.) Using repression does not guarantee defeat (11 of the 34 COIN forces using escalating repression and collective punishment still managed to win), but it is unambiguously a poor COIN concept. 
This COIN concept is little more than a piece of practical advice, and the benefits accruing to amnesty or reward programs are a motivefocused way to diminish the active insurgents that could support the elements of many other concepts. An amnesty program is usually one of the first steps toward establishing an effective disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) process. The logic and tenets are simple: 45
• Amnesty is a potentially attractive option for insurgents, reducing the need for a "fight to the finish." • Even expensive rewards can be more cost-effective than largescale military operations.
Three factors represent amnesty in this analysis:
• An amnesty or reward program was in place.
• The amnesty program reduced the number of insurgents.
• Phase included significant DDR efforts beyond amnesty.
The empirical cut point required at least two factors. (See Table

Strategic communication is a relatively recent term of art for coordinated whole-of-government persuasion and influence efforts, synchronizing the communicative content of both words and deeds.
When applied to the COIN context, it suggests a motive-focused and legitimacy-based concept for which we have distilled the following tenets:
• Maintain credibility.
• Minimize the "say-do" gap, the distance between COIN force claims and actions. • Prioritize consistency of message.
• Continuity of message over time improves credibility.
• Kinetic and nonkinetic messaging is noncontradictory.
• Core messages flow from policy goals.
• There is unity of effort.
• Core themes contribute to COIN operational goals.
• There is expectation management.
Capturing the essence of strategic communication as a concept for COIN is challenging. None of the COIN literature predating the turn of the current century explicitly mentions strategic communication, simply because the term was not yet in use. Lacking a period synonym, much of relevance to strategic communication can be found in discussions of PSYOP, information operations (IO), propaganda, political warfare, or simply as subtext among the principles and theories of COIN.
Though no one explicitly articulates a theory of strategic communication for COIN, there are sufficiently clear statements and recommendations in the literature to extrapolate a strategic communication COIN concept. 
46
Strategic communication was represented in the analysis by five factors:
• COIN force and government actions were consistent with messages (delivering on promises). • The COIN force maintained credibility with populations in the area of conflict (includes expectation management). 
46
• COIN force avoided creating unattainable expectations.
• Themes and messages were coordinated across all involved government agencies. 
47
The empirical cut point for the sum of strategic communication factors present in a given case was three or more, so we considered strategic communication to have been employed in any case in which at least three of these five strategic communication factors were present.
Strategic communication as a concept for COIN receives strong support in this analysis. In all 12 cases in which the COIN force realized at least three of the strategic communication factors, it prevailed. (See Table 
4
• Government corruption was reduced or good governance increased since the onset of the conflict. • Insurgent-claimed grievances were substantially addressed since the onset of the conflict • The COIN force sought to engage and establish positive relations with the population in the area of conflict. • The COIN force provided or ensured the provision of basic services in areas that it controlled or claimed to control. • There were short-term investments, improvements in infrastructure or development, or property reform in the area controlled or claimed by the COIN force. • The COIN force received substantial intelligence from the population in the area of conflict. • The majority of the population in the area of conflict supported or favored the COIN force. • The COIN force avoided culturally offensive behaviors and messages.
As a blend of classic and contemporary COIN thinking, the concept implicit in FM 3-24 shares several of these factors with other COIN concepts. The empirical cut point for the summation of these nine factors was four, so the factor stack representing FM 3-24 is "at least four COIN FM factors present." FM 3-24 receives strong empirical support, with all 19 cases having at least four COIN FM factors present in the decisive phase being won by the government. (See Table 
4

51
• Clear the area by destroying, capturing, or forcing the withdrawal of the insurgents. • Hold the area with security forces to effectively reestablish a government presence at the local level. • Build support for the government by protecting the populace and improving economic, social, cultural, and medical services. 
52
• COIN force undertook "clear" of "clear, hold, and build" in area of conflict. • COIN force undertook "hold" of "clear, hold, and build" in area of conflict.
• COIN force undertook "build" of "clear, hold, and build" in area of conflict.
For most supported concepts, the empirical cutpoint is clear. Not so for clear, hold, and build. As Table

The beat-cop concept is concerned with the employment of the COIN force. If the COIN force is routinely present in communities in the area of conflict and conducts regular dismount patrols-becoming individually familiar with and known to the local population (in the manner of the traditional urban beat cop)-then numerous advantages are envisioned to accrue to the COIN force. Such community policing or regular dismount patrolling in the mode of a beat cop
• creates greater understanding of the local situation • deters criminal activity
• deters insurgent support and activity • creates trust between the COIN force and the population. 
53
54
The beat-cop corollary to the pacification concept is represented in our analysis by nine factors:
• The perception of security was created or maintained among populations in areas that the COIN force claimed to control. • The COIN force employed local militias or irregular forces or engaged in or enabled community policing in areas that it controlled or claimed to control, and these militias did not work at cross-purposes with COIN or government forces. • The COIN force received substantial intelligence from the population in the area of conflict. • In the area of conflict, the COIN force was not perceived as worse than the insurgents. • The COIN force sought to engage and establish positive relations with the population in the area of conflict.
Testing Concepts for Counterinsurgency 119
• The COIN force employed "counter-gangs," "scouts," or "ferret forces" against insurgents. • Significant numbers of largely effective police, paramilitary, militia, or other nonconventional military in COIN forces used. • The government employed significant numbers of locally recruited military, paramilitary, militia, or police forces. • COIN forces primarily deployed in a space-domination/passivepresence role.
The empirical cut point for the beat-cop concept is at least four of these nine factors. Fifteen of the 16 cases with at least four of these nine factors were COIN wins. (See Table 4.23.) Based on this evidence, the beat-cop concept receives strong support. A word About Militias
Several concepts (including beat cop) call for the use of local militias to extend the COIN force's armed presence or allow locals to have a stake in their own security. 
55
56
A word of caution: None of the COIN forces that armed and recruited militias wanted them to work at cross-purposes, but roughly two-thirds (28 of 42) did, and with generally poor results (18 of the 28 cases in which a militia worked at cross-purposes with the government were COIN losses). This supports a recommendation for extreme caution in the use of militias in support of COIN.
Without articulating exactly why, several scholars and observers insist on a certain minimum force ratio, either between counterinsurgents and insurgents or between COIN forces and the population. See, for example, James Quinlivan's foundational research in this area, which reports historical ratios of security forces to population for a number of stability operations; 57 FM 3-24, which advocates a troop density of approximately 20-25 counterinsurgents per 1,000 residents; 58 and Douglas Ollivant and Eric Chewning, who advocate a 10-to-1 or 20-to-1 ratio of counterinsurgent to insurgent to prevent the develop-ment of insurgent safe areas. 
59
• The presence of forces deters adversary action and reassures the population.
• COIN requires a certain amount of infantry presence spread throughout the contested area. 60
These are testable tenets and so are sufficient for this analysis. This concept for COIN is represented by six factors in our analysis:
• Perception of security created or maintained among populations in areas the COIN force claimed to control. • The COIN force employed local militias or irregular forces or engaged in/enabled community policing in areas it controlled or claimed to control. • The COIN force sought to engage and establish positive relations with the population in area of conflict. • No parts of the area of conflict were no-go or otherwise denied to the COIN force. • The COIN force included significant numbers of largely effective police, paramilitary, militia, or other nonconventional personnel. • COIN forces primarily deployed in a space-domination/passivepresence role.
The summation of boots on the ground factors versus case outcome shows that at least three of the six factors is the empirical cut 59 Douglas A. Ollivant and Eric D. Chewning, "Producing Victory: Rethinking Conventional Forces in COIN Operations," Military Review, July-August 2006, p. 52. 
60
A piece of practical advice from contemporary operations advises the COIN force to seek to "put a local face on it." 61 This advice implies that local communities in insurgent-contested areas need security and development and that well-prepared indigenous forces serve most effectively in meeting those needs. 
62
61 David H. Petraeus, "Learning Counterinsurgency: Observations from Soldiering in Iraq," Military Review, January-February 2006, pp. 
3-4. 62
68
Like all pacification-related concepts, this is a motive-focused concept for COIN. This COIN advice is predicated on the assumption that the primary COIN force is from out of town-either an extranational force (as the United States will always be as a COIN actor) or a national force that is sufficiently culturally different to be considered "foreign" by the locals. 
69
• The COIN force employed local militias or irregular forces or engaged in or enabled community policing in areas that it controlled or claimed to control, and these militias did not work at cross-purposes with COIN or government forces. • The COIN force did not employ culturally inappropriate outsiders for a significant fraction of operations. • Indigenous forces conducted the majority of COIN operations.
• The COIN force included significant numbers of largely effective police, paramilitary, militia, or other nonconventional military personnel who were locally recruited. • Development was not predominantly provided by (or perceived as being provided by) an external actor.
For all 59 core cases, there is a modest empirical cutpoint at four or more of these five factors. (See Table 4.25.)    No 27 18
69 An example of the latter point is Russian COIN forces fighting in Chechnya.
Testing Concepts for Counterinsurgency 125
However, this concept is really only meant to apply to cases with external actors. When examining the factor stack for "put a local face on it" for subpopulations involving external actors (for which it should theoretically be most applicable), virtually no correlation was observed. We examined this factor stack against the outcomes of the 28 cases involving a direct external supporter, as well as the divided external subpopulations: the 13 cases with limited direct external support and the 15 cases with significant external ground troops. Virtually no correlation was observed. See Table 
4
Offered as necessary but certainly not sufficient is the proposition that cultural awareness is critical to COIN success. The tenets are straightforward and have clear face validity:
• Cultural insensitivity can undermine otherwise successful COIN practices.
• Good cultural awareness is an enabler.
• Without an understanding of the culture, much intelligence cannot be understood and will likely be improperly applied. 
70
Furthermore, just as with the United States in Japan following WWII, unfamiliarity with the language and culture means that an occupier or COIN force must rely more on the locals and any preexisting political, bureaucratic, and social structures. 
71
• The COIN force did not employ culturally inappropriate outsiders for a significant fraction of operations. • The COIN force avoided culturally offensive behaviors and messages. • COIN or government actions did not contribute to substantial new grievances claimed by the insurgents. • Government did not sponsor or protect unpopular economic and social arrangements or cultural institutions. • Government did not repress and/or exclude significant societal groups from state power or resources. • Force protection actions by external COIN forces (if present) did not alienate the population.
Across the 59 core cases, none of these six factors has a particularly strong individual correlation with case outcome. When assembled as a factor stack, the overall correlation is not sufficient to suggest a clear cutpoint. While having all six factors does correlate perfectly with COIN success (all seven cases with all six factors present are COIN wins), there is nothing in the concept as posed that suggests that complete adherence to all factors should be necessary, begging the question why seven of the 13 cases in which five of the six factors were realized were COIN losses). See Table 
4

The concept of commitment and motivation was introduced into the study as a working hypothesis after early discussions of case narratives for the cases involving external actors produced a relatively straightforward maxim for intervening forces: "You can't want it more than they do." While this hypothesis was initially conceived in relation to external actors, our research suggested that it could be applied more broadly and to cases of all types: To defeat an insurgency, the government and COIN force must be committed to doing so. The core tenets of this concept are as follows:
• If a government is more interested in political infighting, selfenrichment, or protecting unfair divisions than in combating an insurgency, it will not be effective at COIN. Defeating the insurgency must be the top priority of both the government and the security forces. • When a COIN force is committed and motivated, it is more likely to be effective, adapt to changing circumstances, and prove resourceful in the pursuit of its objectives without becoming overly dependent on support from another actor or entity. 
72
• Insurgent force not individually superior to the COIN force by being either more professional or better motivated. • COIN force or allies did not rely on looting for sustainment.
• COIN force and government did not have different goals/level of commitment or both had relatively low levels of commitment. • Government did not sponsor or protect unpopular economic and social arrangements or cultural institutions. • Government did not involve corrupt and arbitrary personalistic rule. • Government type was not kleptocracy.
• Elites did not have perverse incentives to continue conflict.
• The country was not economically dependent on an external actor.
The empirical cutpoint for this factor stack proved to be four or more. All 28 COIN wins had four or more of the commitment and motivation factors. (See Table 4.29.) This held across all cases, not just those in which an external actor sought to bolster and encourage a  
What we call the "tangible support reduction concept" is a contemporary spin on cost-benefit and popular support-based concepts. We hypothesized and collected evidence on this concept for the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers study, where it received strong support. Building on that research, tangible support reduction became foundational in the proposed typology of COIN theory discussed in Chapter One. This concept posits that it does not matter whether it is by reducing motives or by reducing physical opportunities/capabilities, the way to defeat an insurgency is to eliminate its tangible support. This perspective follows the cost-benefit concept in suggesting that it is the support the insurgents receive, from wherever they get it, that is the real center of gravity. 
73
Insurgents' many support needs can be met in myriad ways. Ten factors were identified to represent this concept from a COIN perspective in our analysis:
• The flow of cross-border insurgent support significantly decreased or remained dramatically reduced or largely absent. • Important external support to insurgents was significantly reduced. • Important internal support to insurgents was significantly reduced. • Insurgents' ability to replenish resources was significantly diminished. • Insurgents were unable to maintain or grow their force size. • COIN force efforts resulted in increased costs for insurgent processes. • COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent recruiting.
• COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent materiel acquisition.
• COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent intelligence.
• COIN forces effectively disrupted insurgent financing.
The empirical cut point for this set of factors proved to be three or more. The COIN side won all cases in which three or more tangible support reduction factors appeared. All 28 COIN wins had at least three tangible support reduction factors, and only two losses had more than two. (See Table 4.30.) This is extremely strong evidence in support of a tangible support reduction concept for COIN. 
Many of the concepts described and tested here are based on a population-centric theory of COIN. They maintain that the population is the center of gravity and that wooing the population, through legitimacy, security, investment, and services, or some combination of these or other things, will lead the population to renounce the insurgents, inform on them, vote against them, and deny them materiel support.
If insurgents are meeting their support needs from the population in the area of conflict, then tangible support and popular support Testing Concepts for Counterinsurgency 133 would be largely the same thing, and persuading that population to stop meeting the needs of the insurgents would be an effective tangible support reduction strategy. Are they the same, however?
In 42 of the 59 core cases, popular support and tangible support covaried. That is, when the insurgents had the support of the population, they were able to maintain their tangible support, and vice versa. The 17 cases in which these conditions did not correspond are quite instructional: In three cases, the COIN force had the support of the population but did not accrue at least three tangible insurgent support reduction factors. In all three of these cases, the insurgents prevailed. In 14 cases, the COIN force reduced at least three tangible support factors but did not gain the support of the population, yet the COIN force won 12 of those 14. One of the two COIN losses was the Lebanese Civil War. It can be argued that no matter how successful the Israelis were in reducing the insurgents' tangible support, the predominantly Shi'a Muslim population of southern Lebanon would never support soldiers from the Jewish state.
This suggests an important caveat to the conventional wisdom that the population is the center of gravity. It appears that, in fact, tangible support is "the" center of gravity.

sary.

COIN doctrine also asserts the criticality of actionable intelligence to COIN success. 
80
• Actionable intelligence drives successful COIN operations. This concept is captured in the analysis by two factors:
• Intelligence was adequate to support kill/capture or engagements on the COIN force's terms. • Intelligence was adequate to allow COIN forces to disrupt insurgent processes or operations.
The empirical cut point is at least one of the two. Twenty-two of the 28 cases won by COIN forces included at least one of these two intelligence factors, while both factors were absent in 30 of the 31 losing cases. 81 (See Table 4.31.) This is strong evidence in support of the criticality of intelligence.

Overwhelming firepower and sophisticated technology have never been guarantors of victory in COIN operations. At no time has this been truer than in today's operating environment, in which insurgents use the Internet to great effect and use rudimentary materials to construct increasingly deadly improvised explosive devices (IEDs) to counter COIN forces. Nagl's Learning to Eat Soup with a Knife emphasizes the importance of the COIN force's ability to adapt quickly and effectively to changes in warfare.

tor of the outcome); minimal support if there was a modest correlation between the concept's factor stack and the outcome; and strong evidence against if the concept was implemented in a greater proportion of losses than wins. As Table 
4
The next chapter presents the results from our analyses and findings beyond the tests of these 24 distinct concepts for COIN.
Chapter Four described and presented our tests of 24 concepts for COIN. This chapter describes and presents the results from other analyses. We begin by discussing the patterns of relationships between multiple factors and the outcomes of the cases and present three analyses. First, with so many of the concepts identified in the previous chapter receiving strong support, we try to preliminarily identify which patterns of factors occur most often in COIN wins. Our findings show that the balance of good versus bad COIN practices discriminates the wins from the losses in all 59 core cases, and we present a scorecard based on this finding. Second, we return to the concepts from the previous chapter and try to tease out which of supported concepts are most essential to success. Using a method called qualitative comparative analysis, we ask which of the 18 supported concepts for COIN from the last chapter are the most causally central. This analysis finds that every winning COIN force always implemented an approach that included four of these concepts and the COIN force never lost in cases in which at least one of three concepts were implemented. This allows us to prioritize several of the concepts as critical to success. Third, we make several additional observations about hypothesized patterns in the data, including some observations about the relative importance of the quality versus quantity of COIN forces and about the broader patterns of outcomes in the intermediate phases of the 59 core cases. The findings reveal that quality should be prioritized over quantity and that poor beginnings do not necessarily lead to poor outcomes.
The chapter then turns to analyses of different outcomes, turning away from an examination of factors and concepts correlated with who won or lost the case and instead focusing on other properties of the case: first, the duration of the case and, second, the durability of the outcome-that is, the length of the postconflict peace interval.
In addition to the factors (listed in Chapter Four) that we selected to represent each concept and evaluated for each phase of each case, we identified many other factors to evaluate for each phase of each case to test additional hypotheses and to use as control variables. All 289 factors recorded for each case are listed in Appendix E. Further discussion on the selection and refinement of these factors can be found in Appendix A, in the section "Factor Generation, Evaluation, and Scoring."
Preliminary exploratory analyses of the relationship of each factor with case outcomes, coupled with the analyses examining the factor stacks used to test the various concepts for COIN (presented in the previous chapter), revealed a trend: Most concepts and factors that common sense dictated would have a positive relationship to COIN victories did; most factors that common sense suggested would lead to poor COIN outcomes by and large did so. Looking carefully at the patterns of factors present and absent in each case revealed something very interesting: Every case won by the COIN force featured many factors that are part of demonstrably positive COIN practices or approaches and predominantly did not include detractive COIN factors; in instances in which the COIN force lost, this was never the case.
To confirm this preliminary observation, we gathered individual factors and factor stacks that had strong a priori grounding as good or bad COIN practices or that had strong bivariate relationships with case outcomes, either strong positive relationships or strong negative relationships. We then took these factors or factor stacks and compiled them into 15 good COIN practices and 11 bad COIN practices. In doing so, we repeated a process we had first followed in the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers research.
1
The good COIN practices or factors are as follows:
• The COIN force realized at least two strategic communication factors (factor list revised). • The COIN force reduced at least three tangible support factors.
• The government realized at least one government legitimacy factor (factor list revised). • Government corruption was reduced/good governance increased since the onset of the conflict. • The COIN force realized at least one intelligence factor.
• The COIN force was of sufficient strength to force insurgents to fight as guerrillas (COIN force overmatch). • Unity of effort/unity of command was maintained.
• The COIN force avoided excessive collateral damage, disproportionate use of force, or other illegitimate applications of force. • The COIN force sought to engage and establish positive relations with the population in area of conflict. • There were short-term investments, improvements in infrastructure or development, or property reform in area of conflict that was controlled or claimed by the COIN force. • The majority of the population in the area of conflict supported/ favored the COIN force. • The COIN force established and then expanded secure areas.
• Government/COIN reconstruction or development sought or achieved improvements that were substantially above the historical baseline. • The COIN force provided or ensured the provision of basic services in areas it controlled or claimed to control. • Perception of security was created or maintained among populations in the area that the COIN force claimed to control.
The bad COIN practices or factors are as follows:
• The COIN force used both collective punishment and escalating repression. • There was corrupt and arbitrary personalistic government rule.
• Host-nation elites had perverse incentives to continue conflict.
• An external professional military engaged in fighting on behalf of the insurgents. • The host nation was economically dependent on external supporters.
• The fighting was primarily initiated by the insurgents.
• The COIN force failed to adapt to changes in adversary strategy, operations, or tactics. • The COIN force engaged in more coercion/intimidation than the insurgents. • The insurgent force was individually superior to the COIN force by being either more professional or better motivated. • The COIN force or allies relied on looting for sustainment.
• The COIN force and government had different goals/levels of commitment.
Taking the balance of the sum of good factors minus the sum of bad factors for each case provided a striking result: For all 59 core cases, all of the cases in which the COIN force won have a positive balance of good versus bad practices, while for all cases in which the COIN force lost, the balance is negative. (See Table 
5
In the 59 core cases, every case in which the COIN force had more of the listed good factors/practices than bad factors/practices won. This list of 15 good and 11 bad factors is perfectly able to discriminate the 59 core cases into wins and losses, without any further information and without exception.  
This "without exception" is particularly important, given the regular admonition that "every insurgency is unique," and, thus, every COIN campaign must be unique. 
2
3
Where we allow that every insurgency is unique is in the details of the specific case, including the strategy and actions of the insurgents. These details are highly context-specific. They do not appear to cause variation in the factors that must be implemented to defeat an insurgency, but they do appear to affect how hard it is to do those things. If one reviews the lists of good and bad practices and factors, they are all phrased in such a way as to reflect accomplishment, not attempts. (When we brief these findings, we explain that, on this scorecard, there is no "A for effort.") How difficult it is to do each of these things, how much effort is required, will be (uniquely?) determined specifically by the context of a conflict.
Consider this extended example drawn from the Angola (UNITA) case. In first phase of the conflict (1975-1991), both the COIN force and the insurgents were backed by outside troops, as Cuban soldiers fought alongside their comrades from the MPLA and South African commandos worked alongside UNITA insurgents. MPLA COIN forces had just finished fighting in a 13-year war of independence to oust the Portuguese from the country, so its fighters resorted to all means available in the first phase of the subsequent civil war, with little attention to strategy or human consequences. Indeed, in Phase I, the COIN forces employed seven of the 11 "bad" practices listed on the COIN scorecard.
Toward the end of Phase I and the beginning of Phase II, external troops were (mostly) removed from the battlefield, although South Africa continued to provide low-level support to the insurgents. Recognizing the need for a change in strategy, the COIN force spent most of Phase II (1992-1997) gradually attenuating the insurgency through rounds of cease-fires, amnesties, elections, and reforms. The DDR processes that accompanied the Bicesse and Lusaka agreements deprived the insurgents of their top military leaders. Concurrently, the government used profits obtained through the sale of diamonds and oil to provide much-needed services to the population in an attempt to woo civilians and combatants alike. As a result of these efforts, by the end of Phase II, the COIN force could boast an overall scorecard score of 7, a significant change from the -4 total of the first phase.
In Phase III (1998-2002), the Angolan government and COIN force continued their strategy of allowing UNITA fighters and the insurgency's mercurial leader, Jonas Savimbi, to keep making mistakes while gradually improving the quality and quantity of the state security forces. UNITA neglected popular support and politics, making it much easier for the government to make progress in this area when it chose to do so. It made particular headway when it organized a political party of insurgent defectors, known as UNITA-Renovada.
The government's strategy resulted in the implementation of numerous "good" COIN practices from the scorecard, bringing the overall score for the final phase to 10. During this phase, the COIN force's strategy led it to explicitly focus on a number of the scorecard practices, including establishing and expanding secure areas, reducing tangible support to the insurgents, realizing factors related to government legitimacy, and creating and maintaining the perception of security among populations in the areas under government control.
The improvements in the Angolan COIN force's scorecard scores were not inevitable and were not the result of a scorekeeping excerise or the application of a checklist. They resulted from the evolution of a sound strategy, effectively executed. It just so happens that the effective Angolan COIN strategy realized a positive balance of scorecard factors, as did every other winning COIN strategy since WWII. The COIN scorecard is not (nor is it intended to be) a substitute for strategy or for a nuanced understanding of the distinctive features of a given context and insurgency. It is a historically derived way to make a diagnostic assessment of whether or not a strategy and its implementation have produced a positive balance of factors that have led to success elsewhere.
Perhaps of almost as much interest as the factors included in the scorecard are the factors that are not included in the scorecard. There is at least as much art as there is science in exactly which factors made the scorecard. Where many factors had a strong correlation with out-come but were also strongly correlated with each other, only one was included: the one that either best represented that cluster of factors, or perhaps the one that was the most intuitive to measure. The fact remains, however, that a simple scorecard of 15 good factors and 11 bad factors is able to perfectly discriminate the 59 core comparative cases of insurgency from 1944 to 2010 into wins and losses without needing to make reference to any of the following factors:
• The COIN force had and used uncontested air dominance.
• The primary COIN force was an external actor at any point during the conflict. • Terrain played a major role in the conflict.
• It was an Islamic insurgency.
• It was a communist insurgency • Grievances leading to the initial insurgency were substantially resolved • COIN force or insurgent actions precipitated (or constituted) ethnic or religious violence.
It is hypothesized in the broader discussions of COIN that each of these factors has a significant impact on insurgency outcomes. In fact, in the individual case narratives, several of these factors play prominent roles. However, none of them is so definitive that we could not discriminate the wins from the losses without it. None is essential to COIN success (as some of these factors, such as air power, have been posited to be), and none is a certain condemnation to COIN failure.
The full scorecard, with the individual factors that must be assessed to complete the scorecard (spelling out the five strategic communication factors to determine whether at least two are present, for example), appears in Appendix F. Again, while not meant as a checklist or recipe book for an insurgency (it is atheoretical and does not contain or imply a specific strategy), the scorecard should be a useful diagnostic tool to assess whether a given COIN strategy within a given context is on the right track and to help identify some issues that may not be sufficiently addressed by a given strategy, or shortcomings in implementation.
The evidentiary support offered to 17 of the 24 COIN concepts presented in Chapter Four is already a useful finding, but it does little to narrow down priorities. Which of the host of good COIN concepts is most critical, or most important? To answer this question, we employed sociologist Charles Ragin's qualitative comparative analysis (QCA).

The QCA conducted as part of the Victory Has a Thousand Fathers analysis was inconclusive; in the original 30 cases, the eight COIN winners all had so many of the supported concepts that it was impossible to prioritize (hence the title of that study and the core finding, which remains valid, that "good COIN practices run in packs"). The current study does better, in part because there are more cases (59 core cases, of which 28 were wins), and in part because more of those cases are more marginal wins-that is, the COIN force managed to prevail with fewer good practices in place. These marginal wins help winnow out which of the concepts and practices are critical and which are just positively correlated with success. For further discussion of the value of these marginal cases, see Appendix B.
QCA revealed a single simple set of prime implicants, requiring just two concept factor stacks:
• tangible support reduction • commitment and motivation.
Every case in which both factors were present was a COIN win, and every case in which one or both was absent was a COIN loss. In other words, these two factors constitute a scorecard score of 2; any case with a score of 2 is a win, and any case with a score of 1 or 0 is a loss.
Further iterations of QCA revealed six factor stacks that routinely contributed to other possible prime implicant sets. In the 59 core cases, every winning case implemented these four concepts, and no losing case had all four of them (so, together they are prime implicants, perfectly discriminating the cases by outcome):
• commitment and motivation • tangible support reduction • flexibility and adaptability
• at least two of the following: unity of effort, initiative, and intelligence.
A discussion and (fairly technical) presentation of this analysis is presented in Appendix B. Briefly, this finding leads us to prioritize commitment and motivation, tangible support reduction, and flexibility and adaptability as critical or essential COIN concepts. All successful COIN campaigns in the 59 core cases between 1944 and 2010 implemented all three of these concepts, and no losing COIN force in that span succeeded in doing all three. The QCA, the scorecard, and the narrative analyses suggest that a COIN force that wishes to succeed should implement other good practices, too, but future COIN forces should prioritize commitment, tangible support, and adaptability.
Before turning to outcomes of interest other than which side won the conflict, there are a few additional observational odds and ends to report. Choosing where to draw the line with such additional observations is difficult; these data ended up being so rich, analytically (71 cases, broken into a total of 204 phases, and each scored on 289 factors, for a total of over 58,000 individual cells of data, in addition to the case narratives), that there are always additional observations to be drawn from them. Here, we have restricted ourselves to additional observations in three categories: observations that are relevant to questions about external actors on the insurgent side, those relevant to the COIN force mix (including quality versus quantity), and a few observations about results from the intermediate phases of cases rather than just the decisive phases. Each is discussed in turn.
The preliminary observations at the end of Chapter Three noted that COIN forces consisting of or supported by external actors do not lose insurgencies any more frequently than those without such support. This observation was confirmed by the COIN scorecard, discussed earlier Broader Findings 151 in this chapter, which showed that the COIN force's status as an external actor was one of the factors not needed to discriminate cases into wins and losses. What about cases in which the insurgents have external supporters? As one would surmise, such support is bad news from the perspective of the government. In the case of Kosovo, this bad news was delivered to the Serbs in the form of NATO sorties flown in support of the insurgents, the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA). While one can never say for certain, it is highly unlikely that the KLA would have been able to defeat the Serbs without such significant external support. Jeffrey Record reinforces this point more broadly, noting that "external assistance is no guarantee of insurgent success, but there are few if any examples of unassisted insurgent victories against determined and resourceful governments." 
6
Immediately after WWII, governments were more likely than insurgents to receive external support. This trend was reversed once the Cold War began in earnest, and then it switched again during the 1980s, and governments were once again more likely than insurgents to receive external support, especially as the Cold War came to an end.
7
A frequent topic in the literature on COIN concerns the appropriate force mix for COIN forces, variously questioning the right balance between law-enforcement and military forces, between conventional forces and SOF, indigenous and foreign forces, and so on. Most of our data are not well suited to these types of questions, as the concept and scorecard factors are either about how something is done (for example, factor 39, "COIN force sought to engage and establish positive relations with the population in the area of conflict") or whether or not something is accomplished (for example, factor 43, "No parts of the area of conflict were no-go or otherwise denied to the COIN force") rather than about what part of the COIN force accomplished it, or even what COIN force elements were available. Some of the factors we collected, however, do speak to this issue.
For example, factor 155 scored whether or not the COIN force included significant numbers of police, paramilitary, militia, or other nonconventional personnel. This factor was present in 44 of the 59 core cases, with no correlation with outcome. The individual case narratives suggested that this was often because such forces were inadequately armed or trained. In the 23 cases in which such forces were present and that we evaluated as being effective (factor 155a), the COIN force won 69 percent of the time. Factor 162 asked whether COIN forces employed "counter-gangs," "scouts," or "ferret forces" against the insurgents. The presence of such forces was rare but impressively effective: In all seven of the cases in which they were present in the decisive phase, the COIN force won. In the case of South Africa, insurgent defectors known as askaris (Swahili for "fighters") were recruited and used in pseudo-operations against their erstwhile comrades, a model that had Broader Findings 153 worked well with the Selous Scouts in neighboring Rhodesia. 
8
Another issue that comes up in the COIN literature concerns the quality versus quantity of COIN forces, especially in discussions about building the capacity of a partner nation that is facing an insurgency. This question is quite relevant in that, across all 71 cases, no COIN force that was unable to overmatch the insurgents and force them to fight as guerrillas by the decisive phase of the conflict won. Being able to force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas clearly requires both a certain quantity and a certain quality of COIN forces, and no distinction is made between the two in the factors we collected.
Detailed examination of the narratives reveals two paths to transitioning from not being able to force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas to being able to do so. The first is diminishing the insurgents' ability to field and sustain conventional forces, usually by convincing or coercing external supporters to constrain their support. The second is facing the insurgents with sufficient numbers of better-quality troops, either external actor troops or indigenous troops with armament, training, and/or motivation or morale that had improved from the baseline. Interrogating the narratives regarding quality versus quantity revealed that, in every case in which it mattered, COIN force quality appears to have been more important than quantity. 9 The oft-quoted aphorism 8 Kevin A. O'Brien, "Counter-Intelligence for Counter-Revolutionary Warfare: The South African Police Security 
Branch, 1979
-1990

• Oman: British forces got involved, dramatically increasing the quality of the COIN force. • Oman (Dhofar Rebellion): The British got involved, improving quality, but indigenous forces increased in both size and quality.
that "quantity has a quality all its own" is true to the extent that too small a force will not be able to accomplish the mission. Quantity and quality must be balanced to some extent, but quantity is not a substitute for quality; the terminal phase of the Vietnam conflict is a clear testament to that.
To accurately capture important changes during the course of the insurgencies studied here, we broke each case into between two and five phases. Details of this process are described in Appendix A in the section "Phased Data." While breaking the cases into phases was useful and beneficial to the overall analysis, analyzing individual phases is problematic and minimally useful for a number of reasons. Paramount among them: We are interested in case outcomes, not phase outcomes.
Understanding how to win a phase pales in comparison to understanding how to win a case, especially-as occurred repeatedly-if the COIN force managed to win a phase on the way to losing a case.
Where relevant to specific concepts, results from the analysis of the intermediate phases are presented with the concepts in Chapter Four. Our analysis of the phased data revealed a further important finding: Patterns of phase outcomes en route to wins or losses reveal success or failure in early phases, but these wins and losses do not preclude losing or winning the case. In other words, poor begin- tutelage. • Sierra Leone: COIN force quality increased when the British and UNAMSIL became the primary COIN forces. • Croatia: COIN force quality increased under the tutelage of U.S. advisers.
Broader Findings 155 nings do not necessary lead to poor ends, and good starts do not always carry through to the end of the conflict.
With each of 71 cases having between two and five phases, there are a total of 204 phases in our data set. Each case has a single decisive phase-that is, 71 of the 204 phases were decisive phases. The remaining 133 phases are initial or intermediate phases and illustrate the dynamic relationship between the outcomes of intermediate phases and the ultimate case outcomes. (See Table 
5
5
Of the 71 cases, 22 (nine COIN wins and 13 COIN losses) had phase outcomes that all matched the ultimate case outcome. In the other 49 cases, the side that ultimately lost the case had the upper hand in at least one phase. This is continued strong support for one of the key findings from Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: "Poor beginnings don't necessarily lead to poor ends."

Related to the phase outcomes and the fact that historically poor beginnings have not necessitated poor ends are questions regarding the sequencing of positive developments. The COIN scorecard identifies a set of factors that are present by the end of successful counterinsurgencies, and the tests of concepts in Chapter Four show which concepts are correlated with success, but, given that good COIN practices run in packs, which concepts or factors, if any, must be implemented prior to the implementation of other concepts? In short, is there a requisite sequence of good COIN practices? Although our data were not structured to address this question (we scored factors as present or absent during a phase and do not report the factors' precise timing or sequence of addition), we can still speak to this issue in terms of whether important concepts were implemented in early phases, middle phases, or later phases in successful cases.
First, the 28 COIN wins do reveal that good practices accumulate over time. Given that all 28 wins had a scorecard score of at least 2 by the decisive phase, almost all 28 had scorecard scores that increased monotonically (that is, only went up) from the early phases through the conclusion. This was not the case for losing cases. Many of these cases saw a scorecard peak in an intermediate phase, which fell off dramatically toward the end of the case (Vietnam being the strongest example).
Further, we were able to identify several factors or concepts whose appearance was strongly correlated with wins, usually occurring in early phases of those winning cases:
• commitment and motivation (always present prior to the decisive phase in 26 of 28 wins) • COIN force of sufficient strength to force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas (always present prior to the decisive phase in 22 of 28 wins) • flexibility and adaptability (always present prior to the decisive phase in 18 of 28 wins) • insurgents not superior to the COIN force by being either more professional or better motivated (present in 27 wins prior to the decisive phase in 17 cases).
The case narratives confirm that these factors are foundational for other positive factors: You cannot get down to the serious business of COIN until you can overmatch the insurgents conventionally, and to make any headway in COIN, the government and COIN force must be committed to defeating the insurgency. Note that several COIN forces that ultimately prevailed were not initially able to force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas. Fully nine cases were COIN wins in which the COIN force did not initially overmatch the insurgents: Oman (Imamate Uprising), Oman (Dhofar Rebellion), Jordan, Philippines (MNLF), Angola (UNITA), Sri Lanka, El Salvador, Sierra Leone, and Croatia. These countries achieved overmatch by one of two routes: diminishing the insurgents' ability to field conventional forces, usually by convincing or coercing external supporters to reduce support, or by facing the insurgents with higher-quality troops, usually an external actor's troops but sometimes indigenous troops with better armament, training, and morale than at the outset, as was the case with the Sri Lankan armed forces fighting against the LTTE.
From this sequential baseline, we observed several factors that were usually present in wins by the end of the case but were usually added to the COIN effort before the decisive phase. These intermediate sequential factors are
• intelligence (present in 21 wins, appearing before the decisive phase in ten of them) • popular support (present in 16 wins, appearing before the decisive phase in 11 of them) • government legitimacy (present in 17 wins, appearing before the decisive phase in 14 of them).
Again, the case narratives confirm that these factors are logical predecessors to many of the positive factors that subsequently figure into winning cases.
Finally, we identified several factors or concepts that, while common in wins, rarely occurred until the decisive phase of the case:
• implementing the beat-cop concept (occurred in 15 cases, but not consistently until the decisive phase of 11)
• having the initiative (occurred in 21 cases, but not until the decisive phase for 15 of them) • strategic communication (occurred in 11 cases, but not consistently until the decisive phase for nine of them) • perception of security created or maintained (occurred in 14 cases, but not until the decisive phase for ten of them).
These findings clearly suggest that some concepts or factors logically precede and are perhaps prerequisite for other concepts or factors (such as the ability to overmatch the insurgents and demonstrating a commitment to their defeat). The narratives further suggest that some concepts or factors are more difficult to achieve, and an entire campaign's worth of effort may not bear fruit until near the resolution of the conflict (such as strategic communication and being able to create a perception of security). This situation proved true in Sierra Leone, among other cases.
shorten such conflicts? One of the new factors added to this study was the duration of each phase of each case in months, which supports observations about the durations of insurgencies and analyses with a temporal component, such as survival analysis (methodological details are presented in Appendix A).
Durations of insurgencies vary widely. In the 71 cases examined here, the shortest insurgency was roughly nine months long (Bangladesh, 1971), while the longest took just over 35 years (Guatemala, 1960-1996). The average (mean) duration of the 71 cases was 128 months (10.6 years), while the median duration (influenced less by the few extremely long cases) was 118 months (9.8 years). 11 COIN wins took (on average) slightly longer than losses.

Although wins took longer on average, it is clear from Figure

Survival analysis (methodological details in Appendix A) is so named for its use in epidemiology, studying the impact of various treatments or baseline health conditions on survival times for grievously ill patients (how long the patient survived, hence, survival analysis). The technique can be generalized to any inquiry in which the dependent variable of interest is time to event. In our analysis, the event is not the death of a patient but the end of an insurgency. Survival analysis allows the comparison of the survival times (or, in our analysis, insurgency durations) of groups of patients (cases) with and without certain factors or sets of factors. Importantly, it allows for such comparisons even when the factors of interest change over time-for example, allowing us to consider how the adoption of a particular COIN practice several years into an insurgency can reduce the duration of the remainder of the case. These comparisons are presented as "hazard ratios" and describe the relative risk of experiencing the event (the end of an insurgency) while the factor is present against cases (or periods of cases) in which it is not. A hazard ratio equal to 1 indicates no difference in duration in the presence or absence of the factor. A hazard ratio above 1 indicates higher hazard of the event (in this case, a great probability of the insurgency ending sooner, which is a positive thing). If the hazard ratio is less than 1, that indicates a reduced hazard, or something likely to prolong the insurgency.
To identify factors and implemented concepts that have consistently affected the duration of insurgencies, we reviewed all factors and factor stacks, identifying those that could plausibly affect duration. We then conducted survival analyses of the impact of each of these factors individually over the 28 wins from the 59 core cases. (Details of the factor selection and the choice of subsample can be found in Appendix C, along with detailed results from the survival analyses.) None of these inclusions is particularly surprising, but our findings do suggest noteworthy cautions.
As noted earlier, the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers study also produced a scorecard with similar virtues. When we briefed the results from that study, a question that often came up was, "So, you've shown me the things I need to do in order to beat an insurgency, but how long do I have to do them?" The original study, lacking temporal data, had no answer beyond "as long as it takes," which was not particularly satisfying. One of the goals of this expanded effort was to find a better answer to that question.
So, how long does a COIN force have to maintain a positive scorecard score before the conflict ends? For the cases in which the COIN force won, the median conflict duration (as noted earlier) was 132 months (11 years). By the end of the conflicts, all COIN wins had a scorecard score of at least 2. The median time from the beginning of the first phase in a conflict in which the COIN force achieved a scorecard score of 2 or more until the end of that conflict was 69 months (5.75 years).

In a briefing of preliminary study results, which included Figure 
5
1. There was significant development or revamping of the COIN force, along with a significant change in strategy (happened in nine cases). 2. The COIN force had an experience-based progression from slightly less effective COIN practices to more effective COIN practices (four cases, most of which started with relatively high red scores [e.g., -1 or 0] and progressed to only relatively modest positive scores [2, 3, or 4]). 3. An external actor held off the insurgents (or just helped indigenous forces do so) while supporting improvements in indigenous COIN forces (four cases). 4. An external actor entered and took over the primary counterinsurgent role, doing so effectively (two cases). 5. Insurgent errors, coupled with the withdrawal of external support to the insurgents, allowed the COIN force to "back into" a better COIN scorecard score without really changing what it was doing (one case).
Taken together, these paths to transition suggest that COIN forces that struggle and have poor scorecard scores should seek to develop and improve their forces and should not be afraid to consider significant strategic changes if what they are doing is not working, even if they require the help of an external supporter. Although the fourth and fifth paths have happened historically and might happen again, they are not a deficient COIN force's best bet.
Another observation from the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers study was that some countries were repeatedly plagued by insurgencies. Questions were left open about these "serial" insurgencies. Ideally, a government facing an insurgency would seek ways to not only defeat that insurgency but to reduce the prospects for a similar insurgency in the future. The resilience or durability of an insurgency's outcome can be thought of in terms of the peace interval-the amount of time between the end of the first conflict and the start of the next (if there is a next). We approached this problem in two ways: first, with survival analysis and, second, with bivariate comparisons against holistically assessed win quality or win durability.
Of the 71 cases, 35 saw their peace interval ended by another internal conflict before the end of 2011. The average (mean) length of Broader Findings 165 these peace intervals was 7.33 years. The other 36 cases were still experiencing peace at the end of 2011. 
17
Survival analysis revealed only three factors that had a statistically significant relationship with the length of peace intervals. Each had a hazard ratio indicating that peace intervals are between four and five times more likely to endure in the factor's presence than when it was absent. The three factors are as follows:
• There were significant government reforms during the conflict.
• There were significant ethical/professional/human rights-related military reforms during conflict. • The conflict caused significant host-nation economic disruption.
The relationship between reform and durable peace is unsurprising, but it is slightly counterintuitive that economic disruption would be correlated with extending the peace interval. We believe that economic disruption can be viewed as being broadly representative of the intensity and extent of the conflict, as well as the cost of the conflict as experienced by the population in the country and as a proxy of sorts for general war-weariness. The implicit argument is that where a conflict has had a significant cost in lives and economic disruption, people will be more hesitant to rise up (or support such an uprising) again any time soon, thus increasing the peace interval. end of the spectrum, such as development, legitimacy, reform, democracy, and strategic communication. It should come as no surprise that efforts that succeeded in reducing the motivation for participating in or supporting an insurgency diminished the prospects for similar support for a subsequent insurgency. Detailed breakdowns of each concept's factor stack and its relationship to win durability are presented in Appendix C.
This chapter presents results from some of the analyses in Chapters Four and Five for the iron fist versus motive-focused subpopulations and for the subpopulation of cases in which a major external actor provided COIN forces.
Chapter Three described several subpopulations, including the division of the 59 core cases into 44 iron fist cases, in which COIN forces focused predominantly on kinetic action against active insurgents, and 15 motive-focused cases, in which the COIN forces' primary focus was on reducing motives for participation and support. Where the efforts were substantially balanced between the two, we considered the case to be motive-focused, so the motive-focused category (15 cases) contains both motive-focused and balanced cases.
Data presented at the end of Chapter Three showed that iron fist COIN forces lose more often than motive-focused forces (27 of 44 iron fist cases were COIN losses, while only four of 15 motive-focused forces lost), though forces adhering to either paradigm can win. This leaves open the possibility that different factors or implemented concepts led to iron fist and motive-focused wins: Are there multiple, genuinely different paths to victory?
The short answer is no. The same factors that are correlated with iron first wins and motive-focused wins are common to COIN wins in general; these factors just appear less frequently in iron fist wins, probably because COIN forces that follow an iron fist COIN theory are less likely to seek to implement many of the successful concepts.
In support of the subpopulation analyses, we re-ran all the concept-factor stack cross-tabulations for the 44 iron fist cases and the 15 motive-focused cases. While the exact percentages deviated slightly from those derived from the full data and presented in Chapter Four, almost all led to the same levels of support and matched across all three populations: the 59 core cases, the 44-case iron fist subset, and the 15-case motive-focused subset. Refer back to Table 
4
What varied was the frequency with which these concepts were implemented. Six of the 17 strongly supported concepts were very rare in iron fist cases but were strongly correlated with success when they were: development (appeared in only five iron fist cases, all of which were wins), pacification (in nine iron fist cases, all of which were wins), legitimacy (government legitimacy appeared in 12 iron fist cases, eight of which were wins; legitimate use of force was present in only four iron fist cases, three of which were wins), strategic communication (only four iron fist cases, all of which were wins), beat cop (in only five iron fist cases, all of which were wins), and reform (in only three iron fist cases, all of which were wins).
Note that "crush them," found to be a poor concept across the 59 core cases, remains a poor concept in iron fist cases. Most iron fist cases employed this concept (34 of 44), but most iron fist cases were losses.
For one concept, however, the iron fist findings differed from the motive-focused results: initiative. As shown in Table 
6
Recall that in the discussion of the initiative concept in Chapter Four (see Tables 4.16 and 4.17), that in the 59 core cases, cases in which both concepts are present-regardless of whether they are iron fist or motive-focused cases-are COIN wins.
Taken together, Tables 6.1 and 6.2 reveal one further interesting (if not that surprising) finding: COIN forces in iron fist cases are much more likely to seize the initiative without the necessary foundation of intelligence than are motive-focused COIN forces, and they are thus much more likely to suffer the consequences of such indiscriminate applications of force.
This section presents a few additional observations about these two subpopulations, beginning with the iron fist cases. As noted, only 17 of 44 (38 percent) iron fist cases were COIN wins. Thirty-three of the 44 involved violent practices and atrocities well beyond the pale of contemporary U.S. ethical standards, including 13 of the 17 iron fist COIN wins. Very few (three) of the iron fist COIN forces avoided excessive collateral damage or other illegitimate applications of force; those that did, however, won. Iron fist COIN forces do not require popular support; 11 of the 17 wins under this paradigm achieved that outcome without the support of the majority of the population in the area of conflict. In Chapter Four, under the discussion of tangible support reduction, we showed that all winning COIN forces in the 59 core cases managed to reduce at least three of ten insurgent tangible support factors, and that in only two COIN losses were COIN forces able to reduce tangible support. Both of the cases in which tangible support was reduced but the COIN force still lost were iron fist cases: Afghanistan (anti-Soviet) and the Lebanese Civil War. Just as with the Israelis in Lebanon, no matter how effective Soviet COIN forces were in reducing the insurgents' tangible support, Afghanistan's predominantly Muslim population was never likely to have high levels of popular support for the "godless communists." Further, the Soviets' scorched-earth policy in parts of the country did nothing to endear them to the locals.
Turning to the motive-focused cases, we see that popular support is positively correlated with motive-focused success. All 11 of the motive-focused COIN winners improved their level of popular support across the span of the conflict (see factors 87 and 88 in Appendix E). All the motive-focused COIN winners did many things right: The lowest COIN scorecard score for a motive-focused winner is 6.
The bottom line is clear: While iron fist COIN forces can beat insurgencies, the most effective concepts and the most ethically permissible concepts align with a motive-focused or balanced COIN paradigm. That motive-focused or balanced concepts were more successful than iron fist cases should not be surprising, though. After all, insurgency is, in some sense, armed politics. Iron fist concepts address the armed part of the duality but do little to speak to the politics side of the equation.
Repeating QCA for the 44 iron fist cases revealed nothing new or interesting; the same sets of prime implicants derived from the 59 core cases worked. (Such is the nature of prime implicants. If they fully discriminate outcomes in the full population, they will also do so for any subsample or subpopulation.) QCA for the 15 motive-focused cases did produce some slightly different subpopulation-specific additional prime implicants, however.
QCA for the 15 motive-focused cases required only a single prime implicant: a reduction in tangible support. Removing tangible support from consideration still allowed the easy discrimination of the 11 COIN wins and four COIN losses with any two of the following factors (so, any two together make a sufficient prime implicant): pacification, legitimacy of the use of force, unity of effort, initiative, border control, and intelligence.
Since the overall results of this study suggest that the motivefocused paradigm is the best choice when fighting insurgencies, QCA on this subpopulation merely confirms the priority placed on tangible support reduction by the QCA of all 59 core cases.
As reported in Chapter Three, the 28 cases that involved forces from a major external power intervening on behalf of the government were evenly split between COIN wins and losses. From the perspective of a country that is likely to participate in a COIN campaign only as an external actor, this is good news. COIN campaigns supported by external actors are not that much more likely to be losses, even though cases that require external support are, logically, the most difficult cases. 1
We revisited all the concepts tested in Chapter Four for the 28 cases involving external forces from a major power intervening on the side of a COIN force. As was the case with the iron fist and motive-focused subpopulations, the concepts all received the same level of support in the external actor cases as they did in the full 59 core cases. Again, from the perspective of a potential external actor, this is good news; the same things that allow a government to defeat an insurgency by itself also allow a government to defeat an insurgency with help.
Several of the concepts have been advocated as specifically applicable to cases involving an external actor and thus merit further discussion. As shown in Table 
4
Only when an insurgency is perceived as a serious threat relative to the capabilities of the government are external powers likely to offer direct military support and is such support likely to be accepted. ther strictly required for COIN success nor a guarantee of such success when external forces are supporting the government. Table 
4
Commitment and motivation is the final concept meriting specific mention in the context of external actors. Originally designed as a test of the relationship between the external actor and host-nation government ("you can't want it more than they do"), this concept proved to be applicable across all 59 core cases. It received strong support in Chapter Four and was highlighted as a priority in the QCA in Chapter Five. This importance is even more apparent when governments are supported by external forces. As Table 
6
We have a few other interesting observations regarding external actor cases. First, no COIN force prevailed while the insurgents had an external professional military fighting on their behalf unless the COIN force also had an external professional military fighting on its behalf. This suggests that, in some cases, advisers and SOF may not be enough. Second, where significant external forces were engaged, coordination between those forces and other COIN forces is critical. Factor 160 is "Effective coordination between diverse COIN forces (e.g., police, paramilitary, various military forces, different country forces)." This factor was present in all seven cases in which significant external forces were present and the government won, but it was absent in seven of the eight cases in which the government lost. (See Table 6.4.)  Third, the willingness of indigenous COIN forces to take casualties is correlated with success, being present in 13 of 14 winning cases involving an external actors' forces. (See Table 
6
As noted earlier in this chapter, all prime implicants for the larger population of the 59 core cases apply to the 28 external actor cases, as that is the nature of prime implicants. The pattern of possible prime implicants for the 28 external actor cases is similar to those for the 59 core cases. Among the 28 external actor cases, every case was characterized by five concepts (instead of four for the larger population):
• flexibility and adaptability • commitment and motivation • tangible support reduction • border control • at least two of the following: unity of effort, initiative, or intelligence.
The only difference from the core implicants in the full data is the addition of border control. Border control comes in because 26 of the 28 external actor cases had some kind of cross-border support flowing to insurgents at some point during the case, and all 14 winners had substantially reduced that flow by the end of the conflict.
Other than the addition of border control, it is noteworthy that there are no other additional concepts competing as prime implicants for this subpopulation. This confirms the finding noted in the section "The COIN Concepts and External Actors," which is that defeating an insurgency with the help of external forces relies on the same concepts as doing so without external forces.
This study employed data collected for 204 phases of 71 insurgencies begun and completed between WWII and 2010. Each case was supported by a detailed case narrative and also by quantitative data on nearly 300 individual factors. These analyses benefited considerably from including both quantitative and qualitative data and from being able to move back and forth between the two. The qualitative narratives frequently suggested new factors or hypotheses, which were then tested comparatively across cases using the quantitative data. Patterns that did not make sense in the quantitative analyses were explored in the detailed narratives, with the nuance from the narratives being turned back into the quantitative analyses in the form of still more new hypotheses or new factors. Analyses tested specific COIN concepts, prioritized these concepts, considered factors associated with longer or shorter insurgencies, and examined factors related to the duration of postconflict peace intervals. We conclude with a reprise of the key takeaways from our findings, elaborated and expanded by way of conclusions and recommendations.
Because this research was vast in scope, the results are rich, detailed, and sometimes complicated. While different readers may find different aspects of our findings to be the most interesting or illuminating, this section presents findings identified as key in formulating and supporting successful COIN operations.
The historical cases primarily followed one of two COIN paths: the "iron fist" path, with a focus preponderantly (and often almost exclusively) on eliminating the insurgent threat, or the motive-focused path, with primary or at least balanced attention to addressing the motives for beginning and sustaining the insurgency. While both paths can lead to success, historically, COIN forces following the iron fist path won only 32 percent of the time, while those on the motive-focused or mixed path won 73 percent of the time. Not only have iron fist COIN efforts failed more often than they have succeed, but they have almost always involved atrocities or other COIN force behaviors that are "beyond the pale" by contemporary U.S. ethical standards, ranging from forced resettlement and coerced labor in Indonesia, Kampuchea, and other cases to the "disappearances" or civilian massacres in Algeria, Afghanistan in the 1990s, Tajikistan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwanda, and others.
While this finding appears particularly relevant to ongoing debates between advocates of population-centric or enemy-centric COIN, this report argues that different categories provide better context for these results and a more nuanced understanding of COIN going forward. The reason iron fist COIN forces struggle is that they focus exclusively on the insurgents at the expense of the support for those insurgents, and they focus exclusively on kinetic action to eliminate those insurgents at the expense of efforts to diminish the motives for the insurgency (and for supporting the insurgents). Successful COIN forces find a balance between types of targets (insurgent support or the insurgents themselves) and types of actions (efforts to kinetically eliminate insurgents/ support versus efforts to diminish the motives for insurgency/support). COIN forces on the motive-focused path succeeded not just because their main emphases included motive-diminishing actions, but also because they fought the insurgents and targeted both insurgents and support. The (relatively small) number of iron fist path winners prevailed with a primary emphasis on smashing the insurgents but also found ways to diminish insurgent support as a secondary consideration.
Following the pair of dichotomies offered in Chapter One (targets and actions against those targets), we found that COIN forces that defeat insurgencies target both the insurgents' tangible support and the insurgents themselves, and they usually do so by focusing on the motives for the insurgency (and the support) and by using force. Future COIN forces would benefit from seeking balance on both of these dimensions. When considering COIN concepts, a future COIN force would do well to implement concepts that are supported here but also to make sure that the concepts employed and overall strategy adopted address both support and active insurgents-and do so through both diminishing motives and kinetic diminution.

Effective COIN Practices Run in Packs, and Some Practices Are Always in the Pack: Tangible Support Reduction, Commitment and Motivation, and Flexibility and Adaptability One of the key findings of the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers research was that "effective COIN practices tend to run in packs," that COIN forces that defeated insurgencies implemented numerous effective practices rather than just a few. 
2
• tangible support reduction • commitment and motivation • flexibility and adaptability.
Implementation of all three of these concepts appears to be a prerequisite for COIN success, based on the core historical data of this study.
Tangible support refers to the ability of the insurgents to maintain needed levels of recruits, weapons and materiel, funding, intelligence, and sanctuary. In every COIN win, COIN forces managed to substantially reduce tangible support to the insurgents; only two COIN forces managed to substantially reduce insurgent tangible support and still lost.
Tangible support is not the same as popular support. Although tangible support can come from a supporting population, it can also come from an external supporter (a state sponsor, a diaspora, or a nonstate sponsor). This report echoes the finding from Victory Has a Thousand Fathers that "tangible support trumps popular support." 
3
Commitment and motivation assessed the extent to which the government and COIN forces demonstrated that they were actually committed to defeating the insurgency, rather than maximizing their own personal wealth and power, bilking external supporters by extending the conflict, or avoiding (or fleeing) combat. In all COIN wins, the While the scorecard is not a strategy for or a theory of COIN and could not, by itself, be used to plan a COIN campaign, it is a useful diagnostic tool. If an ongoing COIN campaign has a positive scorecard score, that is a clear indication that it is headed in the right direction. If such a campaign has a negative score, it indicates that something is wrong: There is a need to either amplify certain supporting efforts and make more progress in certain areas or revisit existing COIN strategy to make sure effective practices are pursued.
Of perennial interest to scholars of insurgency are the force requirements for effective COIN. The granularity of data sought for these cases does not allow for conclusions regarding ratios of COIN forces to insurgents or specific COIN force composition ratios between regular forces, police, SOF, or paramilitary forces. These analyses do support some higher-level observations that should be of interest nonetheless.
First, in no case did the COIN force win unless it could force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas or win the preponderance of conventional engagements by the decisive phase. Governments seeking to transition their COIN forces to being able to overmatch the insurgents usually sought to increase both the quality and the quantity of their COIN forces. While quantity may have a quality all its own, in every historical case in which the question was relevant, COIN force quality appears to have been more important than quantity.
Second, most COIN forces used significant numbers of police, paramilitary, or militia personnel, with virtually no correlation with outcome. This is because, too often, these forces were inadequately armed or trained or otherwise ineffective. However, in the 23 cases in which police or paramilitary forces were not ineffective, COIN forces won 69 percent of the time. This is another historical endorsement of the importance of COIN force quality and is a further endorsement of the inclusion of such forces, if they can be adequately prepared.
The results in Chapter Six show that external or externally supported COIN forces win almost as often as wholly indigenous COIN forces. This suggests that, by itself, using external forces is not a bad COIN practice. Further, results for cases involving COIN support by external actors match results from the core data; the same concepts that were correlated with COIN success in the broader data were also correlated with success in the external actor cases.
The external actor analysis raised two cautions, however. First, as noted previously, commitment and motivation of the government and COIN forces are critical to COIN success. This holds in external actor cases as well. No external or externally supported COIN force was able to prevail if the host-nation government was insufficiently committed. The caution, then, is for would-be external supporters: You can't want it more than they do! Second, every case involving external professional forces supporting the insurgents was a COIN loss unless it was balanced by external professional forces supporting the government. This caution applies to those who advocate "light-footprint" support to COIN forces, support restricted to advisers, SOF, and air power. History suggests that if the insurgents have external conventional forces on their side, the COIN force needs such support, too.
The duration of insurgencies varies widely; the median length of the 71 cases was 118 months (slightly less than ten years). Beating an insurgency takes longer than succumbing to one, on average: The median length of a COIN win was 132 months (11 years), while the median COIN loss was only 95 months (slightly less than eight years).
Chapter Five identified factors and concepts whose presence was correlated with shortening COIN wins and with prolonging the peace interval after a COIN win. The following concepts, in addition to being endorsed earlier as associated with COIN success, all signif-icantly decrease the remaining duration of a conflict when they are present:
These additional separate factors are also significantly associated with decreased duration:
• COIN force was of sufficient strength to force insurgents to fight as guerrillas. • COIN or government actions did not contribute to substantial new grievances. • There were significant government reforms since onset of the conflict.
The analysis of postconflict peace intervals was much more limited, but it identified three factors significantly related to the stability of a COIN win and extending the length of the postconflict peace interval:
• There were significant government reforms during the conflict.
• There were significant ethical/professional/human rights-related military reforms during the conflict. • The conflict caused significant host-nation economic disruption.
Note that reform (of both of the government and the military's human rights behavior) is not only a supported COIN concept (see Table 
4
Because the COIN scorecard discriminates historical wins and losses so effectively, it begs a further question: Once a COIN force man-ages to achieve a positive balance of good COIN practices versus poor COIN practices, how long do they have to sustain those practices? The answer is, on average, about six years.
All COIN wins in the data have a COIN scorecard score of at least 2 by their conclusion, but few achieve such a score in the first phase. The median remaining duration of an insurgency after the COIN force achieved a positive scorecard score was 69 months, so, on average, those that establish effective COIN practices prevail in 69 months. Note, however, that there is considerable variation around that average, but it suggests a planning point.
One of the key findings from Victory Has a Thousand Fathers was that "poor beginnings do not necessarily lead to poor ends." In other words, COIN forces that get off on the wrong foot have time to adapt over the course of an insurgency. 
6
Taken together, these key findings suggest the following recommendations.
188 Paths to Victory: Lessons from Modern Insurgencies
No COIN force won while unable to force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas or defeat them in the preponderance of conventional engagements (which occurred only when the insurgents should have fought as guerrillas but made critical strategic errors). If insurgents are able to give main-force battle, then the conflict is more like conventional warfare than COIN and governed by the principles of that type of conflict. Priority must be given to reducing the insurgents (or the insurgents' external supporters) to the point that COIN forces have clear conventional overmatch.
The importance of reducing insurgents' tangible support is the centermost finding of this research. Successful COIN forces reduce not only the active insurgents but also the support that fuels the insurgency.
Tangible support often comes from a supportive population, but it can also come from a diaspora or an external state (or nonstate) actor. Effective COIN requires the identification of sources of support and successful efforts to diminish it.
The median duration of an insurgency after a COIN force achieves a positive scorecard balance is slightly less than six years. This duration is also quite variable and does not include the length of time required to achieve a positive scorecard balance in the first place. Recognize that COIN takes time, and be prepared for a long haul.
Effective COIN balances action against both the insurgents and the insurgents' sources of support. Effective COIN also balances kinetic action and action aimed at diminishing the motives for supporting or continuing the insurgency. Exclusive emphasis on kinetic action has been much less likely to lead to success in the past.
Because of the balance required between motive-focused and kinetic action and the balance required between reducing insurgents and reducing insurgent support, COIN forces must be prepared to pursue multiple lines of effort simultaneously. Good COIN practices run in packs, and COIN forces must be able to realize a pack of good COIN practices at the same time.
Because of the demands of effective COIN, better forces will fare better. COIN requires more than just armed warm bodies. While there is certainly a need to balance quantity and quality, too many troops of low quality can do more harm than good, as witnessed in the host of cases in which militias on the side of the COIN force ended up working at cross-purposes.
Commitment and motivation is one of the factors characterizing all winning COIN forces and governments, and the findings specific to external actors show that committed external COIN forces do not make up for uncommitted host-nation governments. If supporting a partner plagued with corruption, internal divisions, poor governance, or other related challenges, improvement will likely be necessary before the insurgency can be decisively defeated. Encourage and support such improvement.
As an external actor, you can't want it more than they do. Uncommitted governments lose, and, historically, such governments have been more than happy to let someone else do their fighting for them for as long as possible. Make commitments of support contingent on demonstrations of commitment on the part of the host nation. The host nation may need to make progress in this area, and this need should not be held against it, but leverage to incentivize progress may also be needed.
Effective COIN balances action against the insurgents and action against the insurgents' tangible support, and that tangible support does not always stem from the population. Change the discussion to be cognizant of these facts and move away from polarizing and ultimately unproductive contention.
FM 3-24, Counterinsurgency, was being rewritten at the time of this writing. While the manual can certainly be improved, this analysis suggests that the criticism that has been leveled against FM 3-24 is largely undeserved. We recommend refining and improving FM 3-24, but the core principles should not be abandoned.
The data collected for these 71 cases (289 factors over 204 phases) will support analyses that go well beyond those reported here. And should a future inquiry require data that are not (yet) in the database, additional factors could be added relatively easily.
One of the perennial COIN-related questions concerns force requirements: How many troops does effective COIN require? This question is usually asked in terms of force ratios: How many troops per capita or how many troops per insurgent are necessary? This research did not collect data about relative force sizes at sufficient granularity to answer these questions. The results in Chapter Five do suggest that the quality of COIN forces is more important than quantity, while recognizing that there is clearly a quantity requirement for success, too. Although it does not capture detailed troop counts or force ratios, the existing data set does contain variables that would be potentially useful in such analyses, such as information about COIN approaches and strategies, insurgent motivations and capabilities, and factors related to terrain.
This appendix describes the overall methodological approach employed in this research, the historical COIN cases informing the analyses and how they were selected, and the specific methods used in the analyses. Our goal was to test the validity and range of applicability of the 24 COIN concepts described in Chapter Three against substantial historical evidence. How have COIN forces that have adhered to the tenets of the various concepts fared historically? How can these lessons inform preparations for contemporary and future COIN contingencies?
Early in our planning for the original research in this series (documented in Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Sources of Success in Counterinsurgency), we remembered a previous encounter with sociologist Charles Ragin's work on case-based comparative historical analysis using QCA, a tool designed to assess configurations of case similarities and differences using simple logical rules. 
1
Through the use of "truth tables," QCA provides a holistic approach to qualitative historical comparison by viewing cases in terms of combinations of binary (present or absent) factors. 
2
QCA relies on the application of Boolean algebra to a truth table, in which selected factors are scored as present or absent (1 or 0) for all selected cases. 
3
Prime implicants are the minimally sufficient patterns of factors that fully describe the pattern of outcomes of a set of cases. In our analysis, the prime implicants are concepts (or patterns of factors representing concepts) that describe the patterns of success or failure (the outcomes) in our cases and thus received strong support.
Though the prime implicants are determined mathematically, once they are identified, the analysis can turn back to the qualitative nuances of the individual cases. Cases with surprising patterns, or patterns that usually result in success but did not, can be singled out for more detailed case-study analysis. This can lead to further inductive theory development. Imagine a situation in which the presence of three factors leads to a COIN force win in all cases except one. Thorough and careful examination of the details of that exceptional case could reveal many different things, any of which would be informative. It could be that one or more of the three critical factors are not really present in the exceptional case but they were evaluated as present based on a superficial reading of the history. Or it could be that the three critical factors are very much present, but a detailed exploration of the case reveals a narrative showing that the impact of the three factors was thwarted by the presence of a fourth factor, which proves to be absent in the other cases containing the original three factors of concern. In this event, the addition of a fourth factor perfects the set of prime implicants. (Now, the presence of three factors plus the absence of the new fourth perfectly predicts COIN force victory.) Discerning what exactly is exceptional about the exceptional case leads to a better understanding of that case and the other cases as well.
This method is particularly well suited to our research effort because it allows mathematical principles to be applied to fundamentally qualitative data without in any way compromising the qualitative nuance necessary to identify and resolve exceptions. Boolean reduction allows us to identify and evidence factors and interactions between factors that have historically led to successful COIN outcomes. Thus, we can test the concepts associated with these factors.
In many cases, the intention to apply QCA drove how we structured our data and the collection of those data. For a more in-depth explanation of how QCA was actually applied to the data, see the sec-tion "Additional Details on the Use of Ragin's Qualitative Comparative Analysis," later in this appendix.
QCA is potentially applicable across any set of cases. As is true with any inferential analyses, findings are generalizable only across cases that can be argued to be comparable with the sampled cases. Since our sponsor's interest was in preparing U.S. forces for success in contemporary and future operations, we sought historical cases that were likely to be as representative as possible of the contemporary state of the art in insurgency and COIN. In an effort to be contemporary yet comprehensive, we elected to study all insurgencies worldwide begun and completed between WWII and 2010. We chose completed cases because we were interested in factors that contributed to the outcomes, which are impossible to assess if the outcome is not yet determined. Once we had compiled a list of the world's resolved insurgencies in the post-WWII era, we sought to narrow down our data set using an agreed-upon collection of distinguishing characteristics.
Identifying and enumerating historical insurgencies worldwide is a nontrivial undertaking. There have been many insurgencies in the course of human history and many other similar conflicts from which they must be distinguished.

• They involved fighting between states and nonstates seeking to take control of a government or region or that used violence to attempt to change government policies. • The conflict killed at least 1,000 people over its course, with a yearly average of at least 100. • At least 100 people were killed on each side (including civilians attacked by rebels).
Starting with this list, Libicki first excluded cases that could be classified as coups, countercoups, or insurrections. (There were 51 such cases; subtracted from 127, this leaves 76.) He then added 11 insurgencies that began (or crossed the threshold of 1,000 deaths) after the 1999 cutoff of the foundational list (so, 87 cases). Finally, careful consideration led two conflicts that had previously been excluded to be returned to the list. This left 89 insurgencies covering the period from 1934 to 2010.
To extend Libicki's list, we added four cases from a list prepared by the Center for Army Analysis and the Dupuy Institute that were missing but appeared to meet Libicki's criteria, for a total of 93 cases. 
7
This set of cases has several attractive features from an analytical perspective. First, it is exhaustive over the period under examination, so it constitutes the universe of insurgencies begun and resolved between WWII and 2010. This is not a sample of insurgencies over this period-this is the whole population. No statistics are necessary to make inferences about the extent to which these data represent a larger population; the data are perfectly representative of the past 65 years of completed COIN operations. Second, they represent many different regions, with cases in South America, Central Asia, Africa, and the Far East. If regional differences in the conduct or context of COIN were to significantly affect the performance of various COIN concepts, these data would reflect them. Third, there is significant variation among COIN forces-from world superpowers (United States, Soviet Union) to near-peer nations (Turkey, United Kingdom) and non-peer nations (Rwanda, Tajikistan)-and insurgent forces, which span the spectrum from highly advanced (Lebanese Hizballah, LTTE) to less advanced (Revolutionary United Front, MNLF) and everywhere in between.
As discussed in Chapter Three, Colombia (La Violencia) was excluded from the 59 core comparative cases because its outcome was deemed essentially indeterminate. The Colombia case was highly distinctive in its general narrative but most distinctive in its outcome. The COIN force did not "lose" in the traditional sense. By the end of the conflict, COIN forces and the associated political party had become so disenchanted with the current president, who was excessively corrupt and under whom the economy had suffered, that they were willing to negotiate a power-sharing agreement that would remove him from office. The government party retained substantial political rights under the power-sharing agreement, including a turn-taking process that would have the presidency alternate between parties, beginning with the leftists (the side of the insurgents). And there is the rub: Had the first turn been taken by the rightists (the party that controlled the government for most of the conflict), we likely would have scored this case as "mixed, favoring COIN" instead of "mixed, favoring insurgents." However, following the procedures laid out in Figure 
2
For each case, we completed a case narrative and collected data on roughly 289 specific factors.

Crisp-set QCA requires binary data for reduction to prime implicants using Boolean algebra. Given the difficulty of trying to quantify many of the concepts that we sought to test (e.g., security, democracy, legitimacy) in any discrete, scaled, or even ordinal way, binary (present/ absent, or 1/0) scoring was eminently suitable.
The identification and refinement of these binary factors was an inductive and iterative process. We began with the 79 factors scored for the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers data set, which were based on an extensive review of the literature on strategic communication and COIN. We added several hundred additional factors as refinements and expansions, based on questions we asked ourselves about 8 While 289 is the number of factors used in our analyses and listed in Appendix E, we actually collected (or attempted to collect) data on several additional factors. Some of these factors are included in the data and set off from their main factor with a subordinate number (for example, factor 155a), and some factors are not included because they proved impossible to reliably ascertain in many of the cases (factor 139, for example).
200 Paths to Victory: Lessons from Modern Insurgencies the cases and data, questions raised during briefings and discussions related to Victory Has a Thousand Fathers, or emergent questions in the ongoing and evolving literature on COIN.
Once we identified the practices advocated by the various COIN concepts and laid them out as measurable factors, we engaged in vigorous debate over whether the factors truly represented what we intended for them to capture. We revisited the factor list repeatedly as data collection and analysis progressed. This process of refinement spanned much of the project and relied on examples and experiences from the individual case studies whenever possible. Factors were adjusted (or eliminated) due to the difficulty assessing them with the available historical data, because of the nuance necessary for specific cases or to better capture the tenets of the concepts as they played out in real cases. Whenever a factor or its criteria changed, all previously scored data on that factor were reviewed for consistency across all phases.
For example, several of our preliminary factors were dropped as being too difficult to measure against the historical record. These included "messages consistent (or at least progressive) over time" in the realm of strategic communication, and "COIN force employed ID cards/checkpoints for population control." Other factors were changed subtly to make them either easier to assess or more representative of the tenets. For example, "Leaders selected in a manner considered just and fair by the majority of the population" became "Government leaders selected in a manner considered just and fair by the majority of the population in the area of conflict." "COIN forces attempted to secure border(s)" became "Flow of cross-border insurgent support significantly decreased or remained dramatically reduced or largely absent."
In addition to factors derived from specific COIN concepts and inductively revised based on experience with the actual data, we included factors induced from the cases. As we conducted the case studies, the preliminary narratives revealed other factors that appeared to make important contributions to determining case outcomes. After some discussion, we added these inductive factors to our factor list if they could not be explained away through reference to other factors.
All factors were scored as present or absent (1 or 0) for each case based on the best assessment of the analyst responsible for that case (unless the factor was specified as categorical, in which case the analyst used his or her best judgment to assign the phase to the proper category). To ensure consistency in criteria for evaluating the presence or absence of each factor, the research team met regularly to discuss factor assignments. Each project team member was responsible for a subset of the cases. Each analyst worked on at least ten cases concurrently, so all had ample examples on which to draw to illustrate a point, highlight a challenge to discrimination, or test candidate criteria language. We discussed factors and criteria to ensure shared understanding, and we collectively examined the details of difficult or borderline cases for certain factors. This exchange of concrete examples and counterexamples resulted in either new consensus and understanding of existing criteria or revision to the factor's wording or criteria. A full list of factors scored for each phase of each case appears in Appendix E.
The step that was most critical to the results of the analysis was the assessment of the outcome of each case. Unsurprisingly, since we do not live in a dichotomous world, some of the case outcomes were somewhat ambiguous. Libicki, in the 89 cases from which we started our case selection, had provisional outcomes for each case as assessed by his research team, and many of them were "mixed." While we retained "mixed" outcome as a factor in the data, we knew we wanted a discrete binary outcome for our core analyses. In other words, "mixed" was not good enough. For each case with a mixed outcome, the case analyst made a determination of "mixed, favoring the COIN force" or "mixed, favoring the insurgents." In no case was the outcome so truly ambiguous that the result could not be clearly identified as favoring one party or the other. However, as described in Chapter Three, the outcome for Colombia (La Violencia), though identified as "mixed, favoring insurgents," was determined to be so thoroughly mixed as to render it effectively indeterminate with regard to its utility as a comparative case. It is the only case excluded from the core 59 cases based on its outcome.
To adjudicate unclear case outcomes, we followed the logic illustrated in Figure A.1. First, for each case, we asked whether the government against which the insurgency arose had stayed in power through the end of the conflict and whether it retained sovereignty over the region of conflict. If insurgents either deposed (or otherwise led to the fall of) the government or won de facto control of a separatist region, then the COIN force did not win. If the government remained in power and the country intact, then we further considered whether the government had been forced (or chose) to make major concessions to the insurgents, such as power sharing in government or loss of territory or other sovereign control, or whether it was otherwise forced to yield to insurgent demands. If the government stayed in power, the country remained intact, and no major concessions were granted to the insurgents, then the COIN force unambiguously won. If, however, major concessions were made, then the outcome was mixed. In all cases, what constituted a "major" concession and who (the COIN force or the insurgents) had the better of a mixed outcome was decided at As noted, virtually all factors were scored as present or absent, 1 or 0, for each case. Some of the factors are described as negations; for example, one factor is "COIN force not viewed as an occupying force in the area of conflict." If this factor is scored present (1) for a case, that means that the COIN force was not viewed as an occupying force in the area of conflict. This follows standard practice for dummy or indicator variables and also adheres to English-language conventions regarding double negatives. Some of the analyses focused on the presence of certain factors, while others focused on the absence of those factors. (Specifically, our analysis of good COIN practices focused on the presence of those good practices, while our analysis of detrimental COIN practices usually identified a poor practice as the absence of an otherwise positive factor.) While leaving the underlying data intact, we avoid double negatives throughout the discussion and presentation of the findings to the extent possible. We do this by invoking the relationship between a probability p and (1 -p). Consider factors in which p is either 1 or 0 (as is the case for all our factor scores): (1 -p) will always be the other of 1 or 0. So, if a case is scored 0 for "COIN force not viewed as an occupying force in the area of conflict," that means that it is not not viewed as an occupier, which means that it is viewed as an occupier. We avoid awkward double negatives by describing the obverse factor rather than the negation of the factor; in this example, we would simply say, "COIN force viewed as an occupying force in the area of conflict," if that were the relationship of interest.
Data for the case studies (both narrative and factor evaluation) came from secondary sources. The analyst assigned to each case thoroughly reviewed the available English-language history and secondary analysis of the conflict for that case. Documentation proved voluminous for some cases (particularly those in Central and South America, but also cases in which Russian or Soviet forces were involved); it was much more sparse for other cases (particularly those in Africa). In all cases, available information was sufficient to meet our data needs.
We initially set out to score factors for the decisive phase of each case. Many of these cases lasted ten or more years and saw many different strategies employed by the government and the insurgents, as well as significant wholesale changes in exogenous factors that could be relevant to the outcome. By focusing on the factors present or absent at or immediately prior to the decisive point in the case, we hoped to capture the conditions that led to the observed outcome. Throughout this discussion, case data refers to the data for the decisive phase of the case.
We intentionally sought data for the decisive phase rather than the terminal phase because the two did not match in all cases. In three of the 71 cases, the decisive phase preceded the terminal phase: Baluchistan, Western Sahara, and Nagorno-Karabakh (see details in the accompanying case-study volume, Paths to Victory: Detailed Insurgency Case Studies, and that for the previous effort, Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Detailed Counterinsurgency Case Studies).
9
Russians put irresistible pressure on both sides for an immediate settlement, "freezing" the conflict with the insurgents still in de facto control of much of the territory they sought. Because of this peculiar close to the terminal phase, the second phase became the decisive phase; the factors changed in the third phase and did not have any effect on the outcome.
Due to the kinds of complexity that the Nagorno-Karabakh example illustrates, we ultimately separated each COIN case into one to five phases. While our core analyses still focus on the decisive phase, collecting data for all phases helped us avoid several pitfalls.
First, it seemed like a critical omission to summarize a case in a single row, with factors scored as present or absent that had not been present or absent for the majority of the conflict but were at the point of resolution. Second, those of us with backgrounds in comparative historical narrative research understood the possible importance of sequence in historical outcomes, a possibility we were ignoring by reducing our cases to a single row. The phased record for the whole case accurately reflects the condition of all factors throughout the conflict, not just in the decisive phase.
Identifying phase durations and break points proved to be at least as much art as science. Phases are not uniform in duration. A new phase was declared when the case analyst recognized a significant shift in the COIN approach, in the approach of the insurgents, or in the exogenous conditions of the case that caused changes in the assessment of several factors. Phases were not intended to capture microchanges or tight cycles of adaptation and counteradaptation between the insurgents and the COIN force; rather, these were macro-level and sea-change phases. Case analysts had discretion regarding the number of phases and the number of factors that needed to change to constitute a phase change. As with the individual factors, phase breaks were discussed during team meetings to ensure comparability across cases. Secondary analysis of the cases often helped, as other analysts would include periods or phases in their narratives. Similarly, elections resulting in a change in government, or the entrance or exit of an important external participant in the conflict, were often clear indicators of phase change.
Using these data, we conducted four different types of analysis. The first was a narrative for each case, presented in the companion volume of 41 new case studies, Paths to Victory: Detailed Insurgency Case Studies, and the previously published volume, Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Detailed Counterinsurgency Case Studies, for the 30 cases studied earlier. 
10
To give context to the raw phased factor data, we developed a brief narrative for each case. Each narrative includes a short summary of the case, a brief summary of each phase, a discussion of the conventional explanations of the case offered in the existing secondary analysis, and a list of distinct factors that were either uncommon but present in that case or wholly unique to that case.
Beyond this, we offer no separate analysis of the individual cases. In fact, one of the most striking findings of this research is that we do not need to discuss any of the distinct features or narrative peculiarities of the individual cases to wholly explain the outcomes. Unlike other research efforts, here, we are not relying on narrative historical methods to reach our conclusions. 
11
Our quantitative analysis began by identifying simple bivariate relationships between the various factors and the outcome of the case (or phase).

As is always the case with bivariate displays, no effort is made to control for the presence or absence of other factors. Thus, while Table

The relationships observed are perfectly representative of the relationships in this population of cases.
We also sought to examine the bivariate relationships between the 24 COIN concepts presented in Chapter Four and the phase and case outcomes. Because each concept is represented by more than one factor (see Chapter Four for the detailed breakdown of the factors for each concept), we faced a challenging question: How many of the factors associated with a given COIN concept must have been present in a case before the COIN force is considered to have implemented that concept? Rather than attempting to answer this question in an abstract or arbitrary way, we let the data speak and sought the best empirical cut point for each concept.
For each COIN concept, we created a new factor or variable that was the sum of all the factors tied to that concept and present in a given phase or case. We then chose a threshold value for that sum that maximized the number of COIN wins associated with the concept and minimized the number of COIN losses. Here is a concrete example: Legitimacy of the use of force as a COIN concept is represented in the data by six discrete factors (listed in Chapter Four in the section "Legitimacy"). For each case, we summed these six factors, creating a new variable, "sum of legitimacy of the use force factors." The results are shown in Table A.2. Here, the empirical cut point was identified to be at four or more. Having at least four legitimacy of the use of force factors captures 14 of the COIN wins and excludes all but one of the COIN losses. Thus, we created a single factor to represent legitimacy of the use of force in the analysis: "at least four legitimacy of the use of force factors," which was evaluated as present or absent in each phase of each case, just like all the other factors in the analysis.
We created a "factor stack" for each of the 24 concepts that we tested. These single factor stacks were used to represent each of the concepts in both the bivariate and qualitative comparative analyses. We also used the intermediate stage, the sum of factors, to combine and compare "good" practices and factors with "bad" factors (see Table 
5
Our decision to let the data speak and identify thresholds for satisfaction criteria for the adherence to certain concepts based on empirically observed cut points (see the discussion in Chapter Four) is open to criticism. One might argue that we should have set a theoretically based standard, either across all concepts (e.g., a threshold of 50 percent or even of 100 percent of an concept's factors must be present to qualify) or based on individual concepts (e.g., How many of these fac-tors or practices do the proponents of an concept suggest are necessary in order to prevail?).
Our decision to use empirically observed cut points is not a conservative one; it shows each concept in its best possible light by maximizing the ability of the factors to predict COIN success versus failure. We do not present the sums of factors for each concept, though they were part of our preliminary analysis. In our defense, for all concepts receiving strong support in our analysis (as listed in Table 
4
A
Imagine if we had used a higher threshold. For the sake of argument, suppose we had insisted on the presence of more than two-thirds of a concept's factors before considering it to be implemented. For a sixfactor stack like the one for legitimacy of the use of force, this would require five or six of the factors to be present. If we used that threshold, then we would conclude that legitimacy of the use of force was present in only ten of the 59 core cases. However, we would also conclude that it perfectly predicted a win every time it was employed. Similar patterns would be observed for all the supported concepts: Fewer cases would get credit for implementing each concept, but each concept would be shown to be even more successful as a predictor of outcome.
As indicated at the beginning of this appendix, we structured our data to facilitate the application of Ragin's QCA approach. The construction of crisp-set truth tables requires that all data be binary, hence our efforts to reduce all factors and concepts to present or absent (1 or 0). For the actual analysis, we used Ragin's fsQCA (fuzzy-set QCA) software.

We used the crisp-set option in fsQCA to analyze our data.

Based on our preliminary bivariate analyses of the case data, we entered composite factors representing the 18 COIN concepts that received strong support at the bivariate level into fsQCA.

Survival analysis is a statistical technique originally developed to answer questions in engineering about time to failure in mechanical systems (usually called "reliability analysis" in engineering) and in epidemiological studies to determine the impact of different treatments for (usually terminal) diseases or afflictions. The technique was broadened in its application in sociology (in which it is called, simply, "event history analysis"), and it is mathematically applicable to any situation in which Y, the dependent variable, is time to event, whether "event" is the failure of a ball-bearing, the death of a patient, or the end of an insurgency.
We use survival analysis to answer two questions in Chapter Five. First, what factors extend or reduce the duration of insurgencies? Second, once an insurgency has been resolved, what factors extend or reduce the subsequent period of peace (the "peace interval")?
This discussion tries to remain at the general audience level and will not digress into formulae or advanced mathematical discussion. The reader who is interested in greater detail is referred to one of the many textbooks available on survival analysis or event history analysis.

The curves representing the survival functions follow a "stepped" pattern because of the relatively modest number of discrete cases represented. Each step "down" represents the exact duration of one or more insurgencies (if more than one, a bigger step down, it means that multiple insurgencies had the same duration).
Overall, Figure A.2 shows several interesting patterns. First, on average, COIN wins had longer durations than COIN losses. This can be seen by the fact that the won cases' curve is always above the lost ended at the same time, we mean, for example, that they all ended after 72 months, not that they all ended on December 3, 1971. All times are duration times and are relative to the start times of the individual cases. cases' curve. (It would also be interesting if they crossed; that would mean that one type of case tended to last longer up to a certain point. We might see these curves cross like that if, for example, time really did favor the insurgents.) Second, Figure A.2 shows us that, for wins and losses, the distribution of durations is not uniform. If the distribution were uniform, the curves would be straighter and more closely aligned with the diagonal on the figure. Instead, both curves are below the diagonal, and both curves have relatively longer (vertical) steps toward the lower right of the figure, indicating that some cases lasted a great deal longer than others, disproportionately longer. Of course, Figure

Comparing survival functions for different groups is at the heart of survival analysis, but looking at graphs of the survival functions is not always the most informative way to make these comparisons. Often more useful is the hazard ratio. The hazard function is slightly more complex than, though derivative of, the survival function. The hazard function is the event rate (as determined by the survival function) at a give time t, conditional on survival to that time t. (So, basically, the hazard is the calculated risk of experiencing the event after any point in time, assuming you've "survived" at least that long.) The hazard ratio is an overall comparison of the hazard functions of two groups, usually a group defined by the presence of one or more factors or variable as compared to the rest of the data. The hazard ratio is reported as a ratio, so if the hazard ratio is equal to 1, it means that the two conditions have equal hazard of experiencing the event (of the insurgency ending); if the hazard ratio for a group is positive, it means that it is at greater risk of the event (the insurgency is likely to end sooner, so duration is likely to be shorter); and if the hazard ratio is negative, it means that the group is at less risk of the event (so duration is likely to be longer). For survival analysis of duration, we sought factors with positive hazard ratios, as they are correlated with decreased durations. When examining peace intervals, however, we sought factors with negative hazard ratios-that is, those that decrease the likelihood of experiencing the event (in this instance, the end of peace), relative to cases without the factor-because longer peace intervals are preferable.
Data for survival analysis can be structured in a variety of ways. An analyst can calculate a hazard function for cases in single rows of data, where a single event time is noted and all other factors in the model are assumed to be constant from time = 0 to time of event, or the model can be calculated with multiple rows representing a single case, where only one of those rows ends with the event and the other rows represent blocks of time (or, in our study, phases) in which the event of interest did not occur but various other factors might have changed (perhaps the administration of some kind of treatment, or the presence or absence of one or more COIN concepts). Because our phased data allow us to identify blocks of time in which certain factors were present or absent, we used survival analysis techniques that were appropriate for individual cases with multiple sets of conditions prior to event. Note that while we report the total duration of each phase in months, we do not report the within-phase start time for each factor that changed its state (went from present to absent or absent to present) during a phase. For all survival analyses, we assumed that factors changed state right at the start of a phase and held only one value (present or absent) for the entire duration of the phase. This slightly decreased the precision of our results and weakened the relationships of beneficial factors to duration, 19 so it is a conservative assumption.
One of the analytical challenges that survival analysis often faces is referred to as "right-censoring," the inclusion of cases that do not experience the event during the period recorded by the data. This could be a patient who survives past the end of the study, a machine that continues to operate through the entire observation period, or an insurgency that is not resolved. In our analyses of duration, there is no issue with right-censored data. To be included in our data set, a case must 
19
have concluded, so when the event of interest is "end of insurgency," that event always occurs in the data. However, the data on peace intervals are frequently right-censored. A peace interval is the time between the end of an insurgency and the start of the next one; many of our cases were not followed by subsequent insurgencies, so they have long peace-intervals that are right-censored; we do not know when (or if) those peace intervals will end. Right-censored data are a common and understood challenge in survival analysis, and the software we used to conduct this analysis is appropriate for the right-censored data.
All survival analyses conducted as part of this research were produced using STATA® and report estimates from Cox proportional hazard models calculated using the robust variance estimator (to correct for the fact that some countries hosted multiple insurgency cases and are thus not fully independent of each other). 20 1. at least two of four development factors 2. at least two of six pacification factors 3. at least one of two government legitimacy factors 4. at least four of six legitimate use of force factors 5. at least four of five reform factors 6. the single unity of effort factor 7. at least two of six cost-benefit factors 8. the single border control factor 9. the single initiative factor 10. at least three of five strategic communication factors 11. at least four of nine FM 3-24 factors 12. at least two of clear, hold, and build 13. at least four of nine "beat-cop" factors 14. at least three of six "boots on the ground" factors 15. at least four of eight commitment and motivation factors 16. at least three of ten tangible support factors reduced 17. at least one of two intelligence factors 18. the single flexibility and adaptability factor.
Iterative QCA found a variety of prime implicants of varying complexity and revealed two useful sets of information: first, a single, simple two-factor prime implicant and, second, nine concepts that consistently contributed to relatively simple prime implicants.
In all iterations of QCA, we identified only one prime implicant that required only two factors to perfectly discriminate the 59 core cases into wins and losses: tangible support reduction and commitment and motivation. These two factors are both present in all COIN win cases, and at least one of them is absent in all losses. No other set of prime implicants is as simple, with all others requiring more implicants or more concepts as part of those implicants to discriminate among the cases.
truth tables based on only 11 factors at a time. Since we could not test all 18 concepts at once, we rotated the factor stacks in and out of the analysis, finally removing a factor once it had had a chance to join a set of prime implicants with all of the factors being tested.
Repeated iterations of QCA also revealed that nine of the 18 factor stacks consistently contributed to prime implicants. These nine factor stacks fit into one of two categories: those that were present in every winning case (suggesting in the logic of causation that they might be necessary) and those that appeared only in winning cases (suggesting in the logic of causation that they might be sufficient).

• commitment and motivation • tangible support reduction • flexibility and adaptability • at least two of the following: unity of effort, initiative, or intelligence.
No losing case included any of these three concepts:
• pacification • FM 3-24
• strategic communication.

One of the observations from the original Victory Has a Thousand Fathers study was that some countries were repeatedly plagued by insurgencies. Questions arose about these "serial" insurgencies. Ideally, a government facing an insurgency would seek ways not only to defeat that insurgency but also to reduce the prospects for a similar insurgency in the future. The resilience or durability of the outcome of an insurgency can be thought of in terms of the peace interval, the amount of time between the end of the first conflict and the start of the next (if there is a next). We approached this problem in two ways: first, with survival analysis and, second, with bivariate comparisons against holistically assessed win quality/win durability.
Of the 71 cases, 35 had their peace interval ended by another internal conflict before the end of 2011; the other 36 were still in their peace interval at the end of 2011 and are thus "right-censored," as discussed in Appendix A. For the 35 cases that were not right-censored, the average (mean) length of the peace interval was 7.33 years, and the median was five years. For those that were right-censored, the average (mean) time until right-censoring was 20.9 years.
Figure C.3 shows the survival functions for the peace intervals for all 71 cases, divided into COIN wins and losses. Neither curve reaches 0 on the vertical axis (proportion of cases) due to right-censoring; roughly half the cases in the data did not reach the event (end of the peace interval) prior to the end of 2011. Together, the two curves show that cases in which the government won, on average, have lower probabilities of experiencing the event (in this case, end of the peace interval, or a new conflict) at every time point. Put another way, the analysis of duration showed that (on average) beating an insurgency takes longer than losing to it, and this shows that once an insurgency is beaten, the ensuing peace will last longer (on average) than when the insurgents win.
Similar to the survival analysis of case durations, we began by isolating factors and factor stacks that might plausibly affect the durability of postconflict peace intervals. This proved to include roughly 60 factors or factor stacks. We conducted exploratory analyses of the relationships between these 60 factors or stacks with peace intervals for all 71 cases. We were not too surprised to find no interesting or statistically significant relationships across all 71 cases. As we had anticipated (but still wanted to confirm), the processes that lead to longer or shorter peace intervals differ depending on whether the conflict ends in favor of the government or the insurgents. So, we restricted subsequent analyses to the core cases in which the government prevailed (n = 28).
We ran Cox regressions for each of the 60 factors individually against peace intervals for the 28 core cases that were COIN wins. Disappointingly, only three factors proved to have hazard ratios that statistically significantly (p < 0.05) differed from 1. These factors (and their  
C
The other approach we employed to identify factors leading to more durable wins involved returning to simple bivariate analysis of various factors or factor stacks against a simple outcome. Rather than using the length of the peace interval as the dependent variable (as we had for the survival analysis) or using who won or lost (as we had for most of the other analyses), we wanted a binary outcome indicator assessing the quality or durability of the COIN win. With that in mind, for each of the 28 cases won by the government, each case analyst was asked to score the following factor as present or absent: "COIN force won in a stable, lasting way." We confirmed these holistic assessments by mechanically assessing durability based on peace duration: A win was considered durable if the peace interval lasted at least ten years, or if the peace lasted until the end of 2011 if the case ended within the past five years. The mechanical assessment matched the holistic assessment in all but two of the 28 cases. We removed Sri Lanka from the analysis based on the case analyst's advice that it is too soon to tell whether or not the 
Victory Has a Thousand Fathers offered seven key insights. This section revisits each and presents supporting commentary. Here is a summary list of the seven key findings:
1. Effective COIN practices tend to run in packs.
2. The balance of effective versus detrimental COIN practices explains the outcome of all 30 cases without recourse to narratives of exceptionality. 3. Strategic communication-related factors are among the positive practices in which successful COIN forces engage. 4. Poor beginnings do not necessary lead to poor ends. 5. Factors drawn from FM 3-24 (the COIN field manual) are among the positive practices in which successful COIN forces engage. 6. Repression wins phases but usually not cases. 7. Insurgent support (the insurgents' ability to replenish and gain personnel, materiel, finance, intelligence, and sanctuary) appears to be a critical center of gravity.
We discuss each of these findings in turn.
The core result of the earlier analysis, and the inspiration for the Victory Has a Thousand Fathers title, was the observation that those who have defeated insurgencies historically have done not just a few things right but have done a host of things right, and that those who seek to repeat those historical success would do well to plan to do the same. This result stands up quite well to the expanded data. Most analyses include 28 COIN wins instead of the modest eight COIN wins from the earlier study. In those 20 new wins, most of the COIN forces did many things right and few things wrong.
The good news analytically is that not all of them did more things right than those in the original data set. A few of the COIN forces in the new data set did fewer of the things broadly correlated with COIN success and still won, allowing greater analytic traction when trying to discern which of those things is most important or truly critical. The QCA presented in Chapter Four relies on increased numbers and a few more marginal wins to identify priority factors. Effective COIN practices still run in packs, but the core of the pack is flexibility and adaptability, commitment and motivation, tangible support reduction, unity of effort, initiative, and intelligence.
The original Victory scorecard does not discriminate the full set of 71 cases into wins and losses, but it does a pretty good job: Only two of the 33 cases receiving negative scores (the "loss" threshold) on the original scorecard were COIN wins, and only three of the 22 cases receiving scorecard scores of five or more (the "win" threshold) were COIN losses, so it misclassified only five of 55 cases (with the other 16 cases falling in the gap between the scorecard's win and loss thresholds). When the 11 cases fought against the tide of history are removed, the original scorecard misclassifies only three of the cases, and one of those is Colombia (La Violencia), which this analysis concludes does not belong in the core 59 cases because of its nearly indeterminate and somewhat capricious outcome.
However, a slightly revised scorecard does perfectly discriminate all 59 core cases into wins and losses based solely on their scores, without exception. It would discriminate all 71 cases, but there are exceptions: Cases fought against the tide of history and La Violencia. The section "Updates to the Scorecard," later in this appendix, details the changes made to the original scorecard based on the expanded data set.
The full data show that the further one goes back in history, the more likely COIN forces are to focus exclusively on eliminating the insurgent threat (iron fist). Such approaches are unlikely to include strategic communication, but some of them are successful anyway. However, where it has been applied, strategic communication remains strongly correlated with COIN success. All cases in which three or more of the strategic communication factors appear are COIN wins. The finding from the original study needs to be rephrased to capture this additional nuance. Not all successful COIN forces use strategic communication, but all COIN forces that used strategic communication as part of their overall strategy were successful.
The expanded data set reinforces this finding. Many of the new cases include COIN forces that struggled in early phases but ultimately prevailed. Of the 29 cases won by the government (in the set of all 71 cases), only seven had the upper hand throughout the conflict (that is, they were scored as winning or having the better of a mixed outcome in all phases). Further, one of the findings from the current study is the criticality of COIN forces being of sufficient strength to be able to force the insurgents to fight as guerrillas. While this factor was present in all 29 COIN wins, the factor was absent in many earlier phases, confirming that there is an opportunity to improve on a poor start.
Like strategic communication, FM 3-24 remains one of the COIN concepts strongly supported by these analyses. Also like strategic communication, FM 3-24 is not present in all wins, but all cases in which it is present (19 cases) were COIN force wins.
The original study was particularly harsh on iron fist approaches, finding repression and collective punishment to be extremely poor COIN practices-practices particularly common in cases in which a repressive government took the upper hand in an interim phase only to ultimately lose the case. The expanded data, going further back in history, was more kind to iron fist COIN. In 44 cases involving the iron fist strategy, fully 17 (38 percent) led to COIN wins. Repression and atrocities were usually part of these campaigns. While repression remains negatively correlated with success, the correlation is much smaller than that observed in the original study. While repression and the iron fist can win cases, they remain unambiguously poor choices relative to the host of alternative concepts available.
One of the most interesting findings from Victory Has a Thousand Fathers was that success in disrupting insurgent tangible support, by itself, perfectly discriminated the 30 original cases into wins and losses, and that tangible support was a better predictor of COIN success than popular support. While tangible support reduction no longer perfectly discriminates all of the cases, it remains a requirement for COIN success. Across all 71 cases, all COIN winners managed to reduce at least three of the ten tangible support factors, without exception. Tangible support remains one of the critical prime implicant factors identified using QCA.
Victory Has a Thousand Fathers tested 20 "approaches" to COIN (refered to as COIN concepts in this study), 18 of which are common to the current study. This report tests 18 of the original 20, adds six, and modifies the factor stacks for ten of them. This section details the changes and omissions.
Eighteen of the 20 concepts tested in the original study are also tested here, but we omitted an entire subcategory of concepts, "insurgent approaches." The original study included two insurgent concepts, "insurgent support strategies" and "continuation and contesta-tion." These were omitted from the present analyses for several reasons. The insurgent strategic concepts have always felt like apples among the oranges of COIN concepts; they are not alike. The focus of the broader research effort has always been on effective COIN practices and not on effective insurgent practices. The efforts and qualities of the insurgents have only ever been of interest to the extent that they affect or constrain the effectiveness of COIN practices. One of the more important, if more subtle, findings of the original study was that the strategies adopted by the insurgents do not cancel out or obviate any of the effective COIN concepts. Insurgent practices can make the job of the COIN force harder or easier, but they do not change the things the COIN force needs to do. 
2
Ten of the 18 COIN concepts carried forward from the original study were modified in how they were measured here. These changes were the results of efforts to better represent the concepts, through improved understanding of the concepts themselves, improved factors with which to represent the concepts, or both. All changes are detailed here.
We added two new factors to the development factor stack to incorporate specific qualities of the development efforts undertaken. These were as follows:
• Planned reconstruction/development improvements were substantially above the historical baseline. • Reconstruction/development met at least two of these criteria: based on popular demand, initiated mainly at the village level, used local labor/created local jobs, aimed at self-empowerment of people, and was sustainable.
We added three new factors to the pacification stack from new factors added to the data set. We added the same two development-related factors as were added to the development stack (given that pacification is a hybrid that includes development), and we also added a third factor connecting classic pacification with the more modern expression of clear, hold, and build. The three added factors are as follows:
• Planned reconstruction/development improvements were substantially above the historical baseline. • The COIN force undertook all three of clear, hold, and build.
• Reconstruction/development met at least two of these criteria: based on popular demand, initiated mainly at the village level, used local labor/created local jobs, aimed at self-empowerment of people, and was sustainable.
In the current study, we reduced legitimacy of government back to its essential core, just two factors:
• Government leaders were selected in a manner considered just and fair by the majority of the population in the area of conflict. • The majority of citizens viewed the government as legitimate in the area of conflict.
To update legitimacy of the use of force from the original analysis, we removed one factor and added two others. To reflect the fact that external COIN forces are not necessarily viewed as an illegitimate use of force (and because we treated cases with external forces as a wholly separate subpopulation), we removed the following factor:
• The COIN force was not viewed as an occupying force in the area of conflict
To broaden the range of possibly illegitimate applications of force, we added the following:
• The COIN force did not employ indiscriminate force.
• No COIN practices were beyond the pale by contemporary U.S. ethical standards.
We broadened the amnesty factor stack to include other aspects of post-or late-conflict DDR:
• The phase in question included significant DDR efforts beyond amnesty.
In the present study, we refined strategic communication, removing two factors:
• The COIN force engaged in an earnest IO/PSYOP/strategic communication/messaging effort. • The COIN force maintained unity of effort/unity of command.
Regarding the first, earnest IO/PSYOP/strategic communication effort, we removed it for two reasons. First, it ran slightly afoul of our general principles for factors; that is, it reflected effort (earnest effort) rather than accomplishment. Virtually all other factors concern what the COIN force was able to accomplish, not what it attempted. Second, ongoing thought on strategic communication suggests that it is the integration of actions and words that is critical, with the messaging component playing perhaps the smaller part. 
3
While unity of effort remains important to many proponents of strategic communication, several discussions of the original study revealed that many readers saw it as an odd fit, given the prominence of unity of effort as an independent traditional military virtue (with virtues well beyond improving strategic communication). For that reason, we have removed it from the strategic communication stack and analyzed it as its own concept, unity of effort (see Chapter Four).
Based on the new factors and data in the current effort, we added four factors and combined two already in the stack into a single factor. Previously, "beat cop" had included the presence of militias but did not distinguish those militias working at cross-purposes as a single factor. This was replaced by the following:
• The COIN force employed local militias or irregular forces or engaged in/enabled community policing in areas that it controlled or claimed to control and militias/local irregular forces did not work at cross-purposes with the COIN force or government.
Further, we added these four new factors as representative of the concept:
• COIN forces employed "counter-gangs," "scouts," or "ferret forces."
• The COIN force included significant numbers of largely effective police, paramilitary, militia, or other nonconventional personnel. • The government employed significant numbers of locally recruited military/paramilitary/militia/police forces. • COIN forces primarily deployed in a space-domination/passivepresence role.
To expand and refine the "boots on the ground" concept, we added two factors:
• The COIN force included significant numbers of largely effective police, paramilitary, militia, or other nonconventional personnel. • COIN forces primarily deployed in a space-domination/passivepresence role.
To attempt to refine this factor stack, we once again combined the militias present and the militias not working at cross-purposes factors into the following:
• The COIN force employed local militias or irregular forces or engaged in/enabled community policing in areas that it controlled or claimed to control and these militias did not work at cross-purposes with COIN force or government.
We also added two factors that further reflect the degree of local versus external involvement:
• The COIN force included significant numbers of largely effective police, paramilitary, militia, or other nonconventional personnel who were locally recruited. • Development was not predominantly provided by (or perceived as being provided by) an external actor.
To expand the cultural awareness factor stack, we added three more factors that reflect different possible ways to run afoul of this principle:
• The government did not sponsor or protect unpopular economic and social arrangements or cultural institutions. • The government did not repress and/or exclude significant societal groups from state power or resources. • Force protection actions by external COIN forces (if present) did not alienate the population.
Further note that the empirical cut points for some factor stacks changed from those identified in the original study based on patterns observed in the full data, even while the specific factors in the factor stack remained unchanged.
The original COIN scorecard developed for Victory Has a Thousand Fathers contained 15 good factors and 12 bad factors, the difference of which perfectly discriminated the 30 original cases into wins and losses. The original scorecard factors are presented in Table 
D
Unfortunately, as discussed earlier in this appendix, the original scorecard was unable to perfectly discriminate all of the cases in the current study into wins and losses, so we sought to revise it so that it would. As described in Chapter Five, we followed a process similar to the one used to develop the original scorecard. We began by examining the bivariate relationships between each scorecard factor and the case outcomes for each of the 59 core cases. This allowed us to quickly identify individual factors that were no longer particularly strong discriminators, factors that we would seek to remove from the scorecard and replace as needed. Table

associated with COIN success and flagged them for consideration as "good practice" candidates. We then identified factors that the literature led us to expect to be negatively associated with COIN success and flagged those as possible additions to the list of bad practices. We added those with the strongest relationships to the list, using our expert discretion to eliminate factors that were largely redundant with factors already in the list. We also revised all COIN concept-related factor stacks to correspond with the factor stacks used in the current study (changed as described earlier in this appendix). This affected two of the scorecard factors, "COIN force realized at least two strategic communication factors" and "government realized at least one government legitimacy factor." Table

Only resolved cases were included because cases in which the outcome had yet to be determined would not have been useful for identifying the correlates of COIN success.

Before dismissing this result as trivial or obvious, note that there are several cases in the data in which an external actor contributed well-motivated and professional COIN forces in support of a government fighting an insurgency, but the government and indigenous COIN forces failed to demonstrate their resolve. All of these cases were ultimately COIN losses.

The mean duration is 128.4 months, pulled higher than the median by the few extremely long cases. The standard deviation for that mean is 99.3 months, due to the extreme variation in case durations, ranging from three months to 420 months (35 years).
The mean duration of a COIN win was 152.2 months, with a standard deviation of 109.9 months; the mean duration of a COIN loss was 112 months, with a standard deviation of 89 months.

The variation in the amount of time spent with a positive scorecard score prior to the end of the conflict can be quantified: The median was 69 months, and the mean was 101 months, with a standard deviation of 95 months.

We are not alone in this urging. Colin Gray asserts, "COIN is neither a concept nor can it be a strategy. Instead, it is simply an acronymic descriptor of a basket of diverse activities

Some scholars have argued that proponents of the population-centric theory of COIN have come to dominate any discussion of counterinsurgency by utilizing "select historical interpretations" to bolster their argument. See Jeffrey H. Michaels and Matthew Ford, "Bandwagonistas: Rhetorical Re-Description, Strategic Choice, and the Politics ofCounterinsurgency," Small Wars and Insurgencies, Vol. 22, No. 2, May 2011.   
Another critique of population-centric COIN is the "untenable premise" that populations are static, when, in fact, people tend to move around, especially in times of conflict.

This broad empirical basis allows us to avoid three logical traps that much of the contemporary debate fails to escape: (1) the trap of ongoing operations (what we are seeing now is what we will always see); (2) the trap of individual cases (what happened in one particular case tells us about what could or should happen in all cases); and (3) the trap of bad analogy (every U.S. COIN effort is like Vietnam).

The phrase hearts and minds can be traced to Sir Gerald Templer, who used it to describe aspects of the British COIN campaign inMalaya (1948Malaya ( -1955)). While called "hearts and minds" at its inception, there is very little in this approach that pertains to efforts to influence or woo the population in the way the phrase is often used in the contemporary era. Perhaps a better short moniker would be "give the population a stronger stake."
This idea is articulated thoroughly in Samuel Huntington, Political Order in Changing Societies, New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1968.

Where the distinctive features and characteristics of individual insurgencies most certainly do matter is in actual efforts to implement concepts and practices on the ground. Our findings do not suggest a "one-size-fits-all" approach to COIN at the execution level; rather, these findings suggest that there is a finite set of good practices that a COIN force should always aspire to realize, but how a COIN force actually does those things in any given operation will vary depending on the context.

This technique really shines in the "medium-n" methodological space. For small-n case studies (single digits), a researcher can make an effective comparison while holding all the relevant comparative detail in his or her head. For large-n studies, the full power of statistics and statistical inference becomes available. In the medium-n space (any number of cases greater than what one can compare holistically "in the head" and fewer the threshold for statistical inference), a technique-such as this one-that structures the data so as to point out anomalies and differences in patterns between the cases for further scrutiny is ideal.

Clarke, Beth Grill, and Terrance Savitsky, "Between Large-N and Small-N Analyses: Historical Comparison of Thirty Insurgency Case Studies," Historical Methods, forthcoming.

The mean duration of all cases was
128.4 months, pulled higher than the median by the few extremely long cases. The standard deviation for that mean is 99.3 months due to the extreme variation in case durations, which ranged from three months to 420 months (35 years).
All seven were statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level.
Another way to phrase this to correctly interpret median duration is as follows: 50 percent of insurgencies were defeated within just under six years of the government/COIN force first achieving a scorecard score of 2 or better.
This variation can be quantified: While the median was 69 months, the mean was 101 months, with a standard deviation of 95 months.
In survival analysis terms, these cases are "right-censored"-that is, they had not experienced the event by the time data collection ended. For a discussion of right-censoring in survival analysis, see the section "Survival Analysis" in Appendix A.
Note that 18 rows in Table4.33 are listed as receiving strong support; this is because a single approach, legitimacy, has been subdivided into two rows: one for government legitimacy and one for legitimacy of the use of force.

"Binary" indicates that a factor can take on only one of two values. In our case, that is present or absent, always represented by 1 and 0, respectively. A truth table, then, is a collection of rows of 1s and 0s that represent every pattern of presence and absence of the factors of interest that appear in the data.
  3  Boolean algebra was developed in 1954 by George Boole. See George Boole, An Investigation of the Laws of Thought, Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Books, 2003. Boolean algebra differs from standard high school algebra in two ways. First, values are logical instead of numerical values. These are true or false, present or absent, and are represented as 1 or 0. Second, logical values dictate slightly different mathematical operations obeying slightly different mathematical laws. Many readers will be familiar with Boolean search operators, such as and, or, and not, as they can be used in some search engines. The application of Boolean algebra here has two implications: It requires us to structure our data with logical values (true or false, or, in our case, present or absent), and it allows complex patterns of data to be reduced to the minimum set of factors necessary to determine a pattern, called prime implicants.
Insurgency is a centuries-old form of conflict that pits the weak against the strong. Indeed, writing between 400 and 300 B.C., with an emphasis on intelligence, hit-and-run tactics, and adaptability, Chinese strategist Sun Tzu essentially laid out the basis for guerrilla warfare in his timeless classic The Art of War. Ancient Rome also provided fertile ground for insurgency in such places as Gaul and Judaea.

Bivariate analysis denotes consideration of the relationship between two variables.

A Type I error is rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true-that is, asserting a finding when, in fact, what you have found is strictly the result of chance. This is a frequent problem in data mining. See Egon S. Pearson and Jerzy Neyman, "On the Problem of Two Samples," in Jerzy Neyman and Egon S. Pearson, Joint Statistical Papers, Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press,[1930]  1967.

Wei, "The Robust Inference for the Cox Proportional Hazards Model," Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 84, No. 408, December 1989.
Of course, it is impossible to make any conclusive causal argument based only on correlative data, and we do not make a formal causal argument. Further, the factors that appear only in COIN wins cannot be established as sufficient in isolation, as each case that includes one or more of those factors also includes all of the factors that appear in every COIN win. From a correlational perspective, however, these are strong and compelling levels of association.

The resettlement concept is represented by a two factors in our analysis:
• The COIN force resettled or removed civilian populations for population control. • Relocated populations were sufficiently compensated, and their quality of life improved.
When both resettlement factors were present, success followed. (See Table 4.12.) However, the presence of both factors was rare, occurring in only three of 59 cases. Much more common was resettlement for population control without much attention to the care of the resettled. When the first factor occurred without the second (as shown in Table

• Provide security.
• Establish government capabilities.
• Provide basic services.
• Address grievances.
• Reduce corruption.
All of the above help separate the insurgents from the population, and this popular support improves intelligence collection and contributes to legitimacy. FM 3-24 contains a population-centric concept for COIN with an emphasis on security, development, positive relations, and legitimacy. It is a hybrid built by combining traditional COIN concepts with new insights. According to FM 3-24, legitimacy is the main objective of COIN forces and, as such, all operations should be undertaken with consideration for the effect they have on the legitimacy of the COIN force and the host-nation government. 
49
• A perception of security was created or maintained among the population in areas that the COIN force claimed to control.
All 28 COIN forces that prevailed avoided failure to adapt in the decisive phase, as did 11 of the losing COIN forces. (See Table 4.32.)  This constitutes strong evidence in support of the importance of flexibility and adaptability. The case-level analysis showed that when a COIN force failed to adapt, it never prevailed. This holds at the phase level as well. In no phase in which the COIN force failed to adapt did it end the phase with the upper hand. However, it remains possible for the inflexible to recover. In fully 17 cases, the COIN force failed to adapt (and did not have the upper hand) in an early or intermediate phase but ultimately prevailed in the case.
Table

The three additional factors were
• The COIN force was of sufficient strength to force insurgents to fight as guerrillas. • COIN or government actions did not contribute to substantial new grievances. • Significant government reforms since onset of conflict.
These results highlight several factors and concepts that have already been strongly endorsed by other portions of the analysis as strong correlates for COIN success. Not only do these practices, when in place, improve the prospects for defeating the insurgency, but they are also correlated with hastening that defeat.
To complete our inquiries regarding duration, we also sought factors whose presence was correlated with prolonging insurgencies. The analysis revealed four that were statistically significant:
• Terrain allowed insurgents to avoid/overcome COIN force firepower or vehicle advantages. • The government maintained weak policing capacity and infrastructural power. • Government sponsorship or protection of unpopular economic and social arrangements or cultural institutions. • Government repression and/or exclusion of significant societal groups from state power or resources.
The survival analyses offered only a few strongly correlated factors, in part because of a lack of statistical power driven by uncertainty: Many of the peace intervals have not yet ended. To generate additional results about the durability of wins, we sought to return to simple bivariate analysis of various factors or factor stacks against a simple outcome. To do this, we needed a simple bivariate outcome. So, for each case won by the COIN force, the case analysts were asked to score the resulting victory as durable or fragile (details in Appendix C). We then compared the bivariate relationships between the 24 concepts tested in Chapter Three and our holistic win durability assessment. Table

A regular theme in discussions of insurgency is that "every insurgency is unique." The distinctive narratives for the 71 cases studied here led the authors to concur, except that those distinctive or unique characteristics do not matter at this level of analysis. All of the findings of this study hold across the core cases without exception for unique narratives or cases. 
5
Subtracting the total number of bad practices in the decisive phase of each case from the total number of good factors produces a scorecard score. If the score is negative (more bad practices than good), then the case was a COIN loss; if the score is positive (more good practices than bad), the case was a COIN win. No exceptions.
Here are some questions that might be of future interest in this area, building on this foundation of data.
Big Footprint or Small Footprint?
These results show similar levels of success for external actors contributing massive ground forces (big footprint) and those contributing only advisers, SOF, or air power (small footprint), with most of the variation determined by the overall presence or absence of good COIN practices. Isolating external actor cases for additional scrutiny could provide further information on which to base decisions about levels of force in supporting future COIN efforts.
All the analyses described here focus on the COIN force and the government, finding factors that are correlated with COIN success and trying isolate critical practices for defeating insurgents. Although we evaluated many factors relative to the insurgents, the insurgents play little role in these analyses, save as part of the conflict's context. While the policy issues of primary concern when this research was conducted addressed defeating insurgencies, what about cases in which we would prefer that the insurgents prevail? What are the best practices for overthrowing and defeating governments, and what efforts to support insurgents are most highly correlated with success?
While this report focuses on factors and practices that lead to effective COIN outcomes and, once that outcome is secure, on factors that might decrease the remaining duration of the conflict or improve the quality of the subsequent peace, questions remain about the "end games" of these conflicts. How, short of their total elimination and neutralization, are insurgent movements made to cease operations? What conditions are necessary for, or increase the likelihood of, negoitiated settlements? What factors make cease-fires durable? What DDR approaches are effective?
The QCA approach we employed is designed to reduce patterns of observed factors to the minimum set sufficient to explain the outcomes (that is what prime implicants are). In the Victory Has a Thousand Fathers 30-case data set, we (and QCA) were unable to make any discrimination between more than a dozen equally plausible sets of prime implicants because of the co-occurrence of so many positive factors in the eight COIN wins and their rarity in COIN losses. To give a simple example: If A and B both occur in every win and never in a loss, which is more important, A or B? Discrimination was impossible. Among the 59 core cases in these data, however, there are more marginal cases on both sides; that is, there are COIN wins with fewer positive practices and COIN losses that involved more (but clearly not enough) positives. A COIN force that won while engaging in a smaller number of positive practices helps isolate which practices are critical; similarly, a COIN force that lost while doing some of the things that we have identified as positive practices helps identify which concepts are, by themselves, insufficient. Overall, this allowed us to identify a smaller number of prime implicants (presented in Chapter Five) and make claims about the relative importance, strength, or value of the different concepts.
In our QCA, we entered the factor stacks for the 18 COIN concepts for which we found strong support at the bivariate level into fsQCA: 1 1 The bivariate analysis found strong support for 18 concepts (actually, 17, but legitimacy was divided into "government legitimacy" and "legitimacy of the use of force" when tested, and both components received support). As indicated in Appendix A, fsQCA would resolve

Appendix A described survival analysis as the analytical approach we used to answer questions about the duration of insurgencies and postconflict peace intervals. This appendix details the application of survival analysis to our case data and provides the full results. The median duration over all 71 cases was 118 months. On average, COIN wins took longer, with the median for 29 COIN wins being 132 months and the median for all losses being 95 months. Figure

Turning to the subpopulations, the 44 iron fist cases had a median duration of 94 months, while the 15 motive-focused cases had a median duration of 126 months. This stark difference is driven entirely by the fact that substantially more iron fist cases than were motivefocused cases were COIN losses, and losses take less time on average. The median duration of the few iron fist wins was 138.5 months, while iron fist losses took only 60 months on average. The median duration for motive-focused cases was 126 for both wins and losses.
The median duration for the 28 cases involving active external actors was 126 months. When external actors contributed only advis- ers, SOF, or air power (n = 13), wins had a median duration of 138 months and losses 108 months. When significant external ground troops supported the COIN effort (n = 15), wins had a median duration of 132 months, and losses averaged 117 months.
To ascertain what factors have helped reduce the duration of insurgencies and to identify factors that have extended insurgencies (and thus should, if possible, be avoided), we conducted survival analysis on our data (as described in Appendix A). We quickly realized, however, that considering all 71 cases would not be useful. Not only did we restrict the analysis to the 59 core cases as the best learning examples, but we further confined the analysis to the 28 wins for two reasons: First, factors that influence the duration of insurgencies may vary depending on which side wins; second, factors that help insurgents win faster are not really of interest here.
To choose factors to consider, we reviewed all factors in the data (289) and all factor stacks representing COIN concepts (

We then calculated a Cox regression for each of these roughly 110 factors or factor stacks individually for the 28 core case wins. Although Cox regression will allow multiple covariates (that is, multiple independent variables at a time), we had no strong hypotheses about multiple factors and their multivariate relationships with duration, and we also wanted to be mindful of the relatively modest statistical power and degrees of freedom in the 28 cases, so we chose to test each individually.

As has been noted several times in this report, the data used in this analysis include all of the data from the original study, Victory Has a Thousand Fathers: Sources of Success in Counterinsurgency.

There is considerable concordance between the findings of the original study and this one. First, both this study and the original represent high-quality, rigorous research. Second, the 30 cases considered in the original study are also in the database for this study. In light of the fact that most of the analyses in this report are based on 59 core cases, the original 30 cases account for slightly more than half the database. Still, many of the cases are new, and the total number of cases is larger, and any quantitative analyst will tell you that more data is an improvement. Refinements come from the increased number of cases, the increased number of factors assessed for each case, and from having more "marginal" cases (cases closer to being won or lost). Including cases in which COIN forces employed just enough effective COIN concepts to prevail or not quite enough to prevail provided

1 When factors were scored using (0, 1, -1, 7) it was because doing otherwise would have necessitated separate factors for the COIN force and the insurgents. That said, many factors have been divided into two (0, 1) factors as a way to encode the same amount of information.
