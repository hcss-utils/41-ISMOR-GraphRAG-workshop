These internal fissures meant it was difficult to sustain operations beyond the fiefdom of Kabul.
Although Dost Mohammad managed to mount an expedition against the Sikhs, winning a battle near Jamrud in 1836, he was simply unable to recover Peshawar.
He looked to open up diplomatic relations with the British to outflank the Sikhs, and in 1837 the British seemed to be moving closer to the Afghan position when they compelled the Persians to abandon a siege of Herat.
However, it soon became evident that the British, who had succeeded in annexing most of the Indian subcontinent, were a formidable adversary.
The Afghans were aware that the British possessed a large and modern army with a great deal of mobile artillery, and they had augmented their forces with Hindu sepoys and sowars.
Dost Mohammad had believed that a careful diplomatic approach to the British would avoid ever having to confront them in war, but his diplomacy with Russia and Persia merely fuelled British suspicions that Dost Mohammad was looking to join Britain's enemies.
As a result, Afghanistan was to find itself defeated and occupied.
