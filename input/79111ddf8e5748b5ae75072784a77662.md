Farewell to Arms Control?" ' 5 Similar sentiments abound among strong propo-
This report argues that there are distinctive American and Soviet "national styles" in nuclear strategy, that they are comprehensible on the basis of historical and sociological understanding, and that they may interact in actual conflict with possibly fatal consequences for the United States.
The centerpiece of this report is the analysis of five classes of options for U.S. nuclear posture and doctrine. These are (1) mutual assured vulnerability; (2) mutual assured vulnerability with (targeting) flexibility; (3) counterforce and counter-(political) control preeminence with recovery denial; (4) damage limitation for deterrence and coercion; and (5) damage limitation with defense dominant. The pros and cons of each class of options are analyzed in detail. The report recommmends that the United States adopt a strategic nuclear policy that is genuinely balanced between offensive and defensive capabilities. In short, option (4)--damage limitation for deterrence and coercion--is recommended.
The strongest single recommendation of this report is that U.S. strategic nuclear planning should be as attentive to the protection of the U.S. homeland as it is to the destruction of Soviet assets. This report finds that U.S. incomprehension of its own, and of Soviet, strategic culture and national style has misled U.S. policymakers into the making of poor policy. This report documents in detail how the United States developed a strategic force posture, endorsed strategic doctrinal concepts, and pursued strategic arms control agreements vis a vis a substantially fictional Soviet Union. It is demonstrated here how the Soviet Union, for reasons of its own, did not (and does not) share the U.S. approach to deterrence; has no vision of "strategic stability" that is even remotely congruent with that dominant in the United States; is dismissive of our traditional, doctrinally authoritative theory of escalation control and crisis management, and views arms control negotiations as an opportunity to secure unilateral advantage. These claims are all debated and supported, in detail, in the report.
Contrary to general assumption, the permanent advent of nuclear weapons has not effected a revolution in statecraft. Commentators on statecraft from Periclean Athens, Renaissance Italy, or "Concert Europe," would have no difficulty comprehending statecraft today. The historical discontinuity of recent times has not been technological in nature, but political, and dates from 1917 rather than from 1945. Since that time the U.S.S.R. has rejected the legitimacy of the imperia of the other major states. This is a revolutionary change.
The report offers a detailed contrasting analysis of Soviet and American national styles in nuclear strategy.
Although the major part of this report focuses on the roots and the detail of nuclear policy thinking in the two super-powers, one political fact dominates the enterprise--the U.S.S.R., by self-definition, is a true revolutionary actor in world politics (no matter how conservative it often may appear in its diplomatic activity). Pending fundamental political change "at home," the U.S.S.R. should be viewed as a permanent adversary. For the foreseeable future, the need to compete with the U.S.S.R. is permanent. But, the cumulative improvement on the Soviet end of "the correlation of forces" has changed the basis on which foreign policy engagement can be designed--greatly to the U.S. disadvantage. The central problem for the U.S. is not so much to understand Soviet power, as to contain it. Although Soviet leaders are acknowledged to be cautious and pragmatic (and not "gangsters in a hurry" a la Third Reich), Russian history and culture is found to weigh heavily in their world view. The Soviets--notwithstanding propagandistic denunciation of the possibility of the achievement of strategic superiority--have an intensely traditional professionalmilitary view of (nuclear) war. The Soviets have waged war, on their own territory (a critical distinction vis a vis the U.S.) against a first-class adversary within living memory--and they very nearly lost. This recent experience, added to the continental land-power tradition, produces a genuine "seriousness" about the actual conduct of war which is notably lacking in an insular power such as the United States. The Soviet attitude towards military power stems from Russian tradition combined with a creed which has universal pretensions and which is the very rationale for the legitimacy of Soviet rule in the U.S.S.R. Above all else, the Soviet Union should be thought of as an "insecure empire" that defines its security in terms of the insecurity of others. The "conservative" Western view of Soviet strategic doctrine--stressing its war-waging/war-surivival aspects--is now, belatedly, the conventional wisdom.
American nuclear-weapon policy thinking is analyzed, and contrasted with Soviet thinking (and actions), systematically in chapters which address the major categories of Western nuclear-doctrinal thinking (deterrence, strategic stability, escalation control and crisis management, arms competition and arms control, and strategic superiority). Because of its traditional geographical insularity, and the military history that flowed therefrom, the United States is not well equipped culturally to cope with the probable damage of a nuclear war. American policy-making and influencing elites tend to be dominated by skill groups (lawyers/elected politicians) whose real expertise--the manipulation of U.S. domestic democratic procedures--does not equip them well to deal appropriately with the successful survivors of Stalin's Great Purge. Americans, traditionally, have tended to believe that:
-"good" causes triumph.
the United States can succeed in anythitig it pursues energetically.
-Americans cannot fail (as God's chosen people).
the United States can out-produce any enemy in the materiel needed for victory.
The world of the 1980s is more complex than this. This report * explores the reasons behind the progressive diminution in American self-confidence vis a vis nuclear strategy of the 1960s and 1970s. The follow- ing American beliefs were important:
that nuclear war cannot be "won.' that other cultures soon will come to share American ideas.
that strategic defenses are likely not merely to be ineffective, but also dangerous.
that Soviet leaders can be "educated" into more constructive paths of thought and policy.
that the American defense establishment is as much the enemy as are the Soviets.
that, for structural societal reasons, the United Sates is, and would remain, superior in defense ideas and in defense technology.
It is found that much of the content of our "received wisdom" on deterrence, stability, escalation, arms control, and so forth, reflects little more than the character (strengths and weaknesses) of our own culture. To take but one critical example, Western officials and theorists envisage "a process of escalation" (itself a highly Western culture-bound concept) essentially as a process of (political) "bargaining." On the evidence of culture and style, the Soviets would approach nuclear war as war pure and simple--not as a bargaining process.
In these areas of central importance to Western policy thinking the U.S. has been driven by a vision of systematic stability which has not been shared by the Soviet adversary. Stated directly, U.S. strategic doctrine and policy have been wrong with reference to their provisions for deterrent adequacy, stability, escalation control and control of strategic arms competition. Among other deficiencies, the bedrock of NATO strategy (as in MC-14/3 of 1967) and of American strategic-warfare thinking--if not potential practice--continues to assume a favorable U.S.-Soviet strategic nuclear balance of a kind that has not existed since the early 1970s.
Most fundamentally of all, for the better part of twenty years (the 1960s and 1970s), the United States neglected to consider the U.S.S.R. adequately on its own terms. Deterrence, basically, is a psychological phenomenon, and deterrent effect must be active in Soviet minds and obviously, on Soviet criteria. This report stresses the imperative need for U.S. nuclear-weapon policy to be relevant to the Soviet world view. Strategic-policy truth is not abstract; it is culture specific--what do Soviet leaders fear most? It is judged here that Soviet leaders fear most for the survival of the essential assets of the Soviet state--not for the survival of Soviet citizens. This report concludes that although the United States must be true to Its own unique culture in its defense preparation, many policy errors can and should be avoided if the cultural/stylistic engines of American and Soviet strategic nuclear preparation are understood on their own terms.
It is almost a cliche to claim that this is a period of transition.
Every period is one of transition: today always hovers uncomfortably between yesterday (history) and tomorrow (the future--in which hopes and dreams may be assumed to be made manifest). However, with respect to nuclear weapons policy at least, today happens to have an unusually strong claim to be a period of transition. The early 1980s may see a historical turning point in U.S. nuclear weapon policy, or, it is possible that this period will constitute a turning point where history (in the form of U.S. policy determination) does not turn. (By way of analogy, Russian history from the accession of Czar Alexander II, in 1855, until the eve of World War I saw several potential turning points--where turns were not made.), With respect both to the political setting for, and the military factors contributing directly to, U.S. nuclear strategy and posture, it is reasonably well understood, by opinion on the left, the center, and the right, that the strategic ideas, the doctrines, and the postures that were deemed adequate for the 1970s, may not serve at all well for the 1980s and beyond.
The contemporary ferment in U.S. nuclear-weapon, and nuclear-weapon related, policy may be illustrated by a few "signs of the times." Harold   Brown, the former Secretary of Defense, offered the opinion that:
Though we made some significant advances in the 1970s , espe- cially in MIRVed warheads, our investment in strategic programs in that decade was less than one-third of what the Soviets spent on their strategic programs. If we had let that trend continue, we would have faced, by the mid-1980s, at best a perceptio2 of inferiority, at worst a real possibility of nuclear coercion.
This statement implied that the danger was real, but that appropriate corrective action has been taken (a subject to which this report will return).
It is useful to augment Dr. Brown's August 20, 1980 statement (above) with his words of January 1980. Then he said that "[ciritical turning points in the histories of nations are difficult to recognize at the time. Usually they become clear only in retrospect. Nonetheless, the United States may well be at such a turning point today. We face a decision that we have been deferring for too long; we can defer it no longer. We must decide now whether we intend to remain the strongest nation in the world. The alternative is to let ourselves slip into inferiority... This was a remarkable admission from an administration which already had held office for three years at the time the statement was issued.
Scarcely less startling than Harold Brown's acknowledgement of the seriousness of U.S. military competitive problems, have been statements from the heartland of the U.S. arms control community to the very plain effect that all is not well with their cause. For example, Leslie Gelb, one of the principal official architects of SALT II (and, reportedly, the major author of the Protocol to the SALT II Treaty), has written that [a]rms control has essentially failed. Three decades of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to limit arms ompetition have done little
Moving from the general to the fairly specific, changing times were well-heralded by the national security affairs correspondent of The New York Times, when he told his readers that "After Almost a Decade, the ABM Dispute Resumes."1

This critical review is undertaken not in order to seek to indict particular individuals or administrations for error, but rather in order to assist the U.S. defense community to learn from past mistakes. Many of the apparent catastrophe for both sides.1

[t]here is no contradiction between this focus on how a war would be fought and what its results would be, and our purpose of insuring continued peace through mutual deterrence. Indeed, this focus helps us achieve deterrence and peace, by ensuring that an ability t _retaliate is fully credible. (Emphasis in the original.)
Official disclaimers notwithstanding, those sentences constitute a U.S. doctrinal revolution. For many years in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Western commentators nurtured the forlorn hope that the Soviet defense community would come to converge in its strategic thinking upon
the orthodox Western theory of strategic stability. Instead, with one very notable exception, the United States has now converged its official strategic thinking upon that of the Soviet Union. Both superpowers now profess to believe that deterrent effect is a function of anticipated war-waging prowess.
The notable exception mentioned above is the continuing disregard for the physical protection of homeland assets (beyond continuation of government and essential communications) which characterizes U.S. policy.

It is far too soon to assess whether or not POs 53, 58, and 59, will have any very noteworthy impact on plans and programs. However, their production and public discussion (in the case of PD 59 on nuclear
weapons employment policy) provides a very useful point of reference
for this report--summarizing, as they certainly did, a great deal of the strategic thinking of recent years.
Necessarily, the analysis and conclusions in this report are strictly personal to the author. However, there is a large, and growing, area of consensus among defense and arms-control professionals over the nature of U.S. nuclear policy problems, and even over the character of desirable solutions. It has always been a rule at Hudson Institute that a necessary qualification for entering into debate is an ability to state the position of the other side to the satisfaction of that side (and, preferably, to state the other side's position better than they can). Unfortunately, a hardy perennial feature of U.S. debate over nuclear weapons policy (strategies and weapons) has been the erection, by all the contending parties, of straw targets--which have been duly
demolished. In practice, a good fraction of the time and energy of competent strategists, of all doctrinal persuasions, has been spent
attacking positions which no one has sought to defend. This report .* is, in the first instance, a theoretical exploration, leading, in the second instance, to policy exploration and recommendation. Readers will find no villainous MADvocates (advocates of a doctrine of mutual 20 assured destruction in a reasonably pure form ) in these pages, nor will they find functionally treasonable SALTaholics 2 1 --such creatures may exist, but they are not of policy significance today.
Notwithstanding the reference already made to there being a very substantial amount of common ground among strategic analysts today, it is sensible to categorize the elements driving this report, respectively, 12 *  1 into facts and opinions (termed propositions--to be discussed, tested, insofar as possible, accepted as fact, plausibly candidate fact, or to be discarded as probably false). What follows is a terse summary of the facts and propositions which underlie all of the discussion in this report.
Fact: The Soviet Union has been outspending the United States on strategic forces in the ratio of 3:1 (averaged over a decade).

Fact: Arms control agreements between the super-powers have proved to be negotiable solely on the basis of registering "a photograph of the existing balance."

Proposition: Both the United States and the Soviet Union have distinctive "strategic cultures"--which reflect their separate * 26 political cultures. These cultures give evidence both of the unique histories of the countries in question, and of the ways in which American and Soviet citizens perceive their unique histories.

In addition to the contemporary issues which divide them, conflict between the super-powers has been greatly exacerbated by the mutual miscomprehension of two very different strategic (and political) cultures. Mutual cultural empathy would not have precluded what has been mistermed "the Cold War,' 2 8 any more than it would have precluded the arms competition that flowed inevitably from political conflict, but it might have obviated gross, and many dangerous, misassessments of intent.
Proposition: Some critically important American nuclear policy decisions rested upon either a plain misreading of Soviet strategic culture, or perhaps more likely--a naive unawareness of the distinctions between the Soviet and American "ways" in defense preparation.

nuclear-weapons policy over the past fifteen years. Part II of this report examines U.S. theories of deterrence, stability, crisis management, escalation control, arms competition, arms control, and superiority, with a view to assessing how well they have fared in competitive practice with the Soviet Union.
Central to every major element in this report is the idea that both the United States and the Soviet Union have a distinctive national style, a strategic culture, which impacts significantly upon their separate ways in strategic deliberation and defense preparations. This idea, of cultural distinctiveness, has come to be familiar of recent years.

and that the United States might be better placed to convey convincing deterrent messages were it able, more accurately, to divine those threats which Soviet leaders tend to view with particular abhorrence.
Every competently conducted study of U.S. civil defense problems has shown that a major shelter plus evacuation program made a dramatic difference to U.S. societal survival and recovery.
From the time of Robert McNamara, annual Defense Department reports have told Americans that they are "hostages" to Soviet and U.S. good behavior. However, these reports have not been read by very many Americans. This author is willing to wager a considerable sum on the proposition that most Americans would reject the stabilityvia mutual-vulnerability thesis, were it put to them plainly.
32. An impressive datum is to the effect that at the time of "the great ABM debate," in 1969-70, most Americans believed that the U.S. already had an ABM defense in place.  -~ --
Unfortunately, the decision for or against the initiation of nuclear war may not always be exclusively in the hands of an American President.

For the reasons cited imediately above, the United States, clearly, must have a nuclear strategy--the question is which one. This is not to imply the necessity for any rigid, rigorously exclusive, choice of strategy--flexibility, options, are strongly desirable, just as a heavy focus upon operational strategy, on occasion in this report, should not cause readers to forget that the principal purpose of nuclear-armed forces is deterrence (pre-and intra-war), it is not the efficient conduct of military operations. (As noted above, the United States defense commiunity remains somewhat uncertain as to the prudent relationship between deterrence and defense.)

Whatever sense one may make of his policy advice, McGeorge Bundy's strictures against "nuclear gamesmen" do contain a distressingly substantial grain of truth. A great deal of what passes for the strategic analysis of nuclear-weapon issues is really nothing of the kind. In truth, the American defense community tends to be both apolitical and astrategic in orientation. All too often the hypothetical central (U.S.-U.S.S.R.
homeland-to-homeland) wars of the "nuclear gamesmen" begin with such words as "let us assume a large-scale Soviet attack upon the U.S. silo-housed ICBM force." Such a war has no political context, indeed--innocent of context--it has no political meaning. 
9
One of the most intriguing questions that can be posed by a strategist looking backwards, or by an international historian attuned to contemporary policy debate, is the following: "what difference have nuclear weapons, and their means of delivery, made to world politics?" To rephrase, of all the differences that may be detected between the world politics, say, of 1980, and the world politics of 1939, 1900, or 1850, how may--and to what degree--can one attribute change to nuclear-weapons technology and to the means of long-range delivery of that technology?
This question is of more than mere academic interest. One is inquiring into the historical domain of the evidential base behind policy advice. 
10
1
For example, only of very recent years has the United States' defense community considered its principal overseas adversary in the light of the distinctive history, and hence culture, which must pervade Soviet policy determination. 13  There is an acute problem of historical evidence: there is but a single stream of world political activity since 1945.
In essence one is asking, "hoo could the world politics of 1945 to the present have been different had nuclear weapons not been invented?" No case, or argument can be proved--to repeat, there is only one stream of historical evidence.
It seems useful to begin at the level of the structure of world politics.
The familiar pre-nuclear concept of a Great Power--a power essential to the functioning of the international order of the day--has retained some fraction of its meaning.1 
4
15
Probably the single most important element in the Great Power catechism was that every Great Power had a right to exist, was essential to *the system of international security of the day, and had legitimate interests.
Each Great Power would, and was expected to, seek unilateral advantage where it could--but the integrity of the balance of power system, considered as a whole, was expected, ultimately, to take precedence over individual parochial interests, while the hidden hand of a near-automatically operating .-balancing system would soon restrain any power which neglected its obligations to the integrity of the system as a whole.1 
6
After all, the Great Power which we humiliate today, may be the Great Power whose "balancing" assistance we need tomorrow.
It may be objected that the above thumbnail description of the Great Power balance of power system has been overly attentive to some nineteenth century practices, while ignoring a great deal of contrary evidence, and presents what may be characterized as a historical anomaly as the norm.
A European (effectively synonymous with global, for most of the period) balance of power system was fairly explicitly recognized to exist, and was valued for its contribution to order and security (though not always peace), from the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, marking the end of the Thirty Years War, until 1939-1 7 That system, notwithstanding periodic hiccups, did operate, at its best, according to a code of behavior intended to preserve not peace, but rather order and general security. It was destroyed by a malign combination of rampant nationalisms, rigid contervailing alliance structures, the rise of a Germany too powerful to be contained, and a new technology of war and a new feasibility of economic mobilization for war, which ensured that quick victory would evade the clutches of both sides.
Behaving sensibly, which was not always the case by any means, the Great Powers of the nineteenth century (Great Britain, France, Prussia/Germany [ after 18661, Austria-Hungary , and Russia) recognized a community of concern for international security, embraced no ambitions for a universal imperium, and--as may be surmized--shared a common code of statecraft just as they shared a common language of diplomacy (French). This author is acutely aware of the exceptions that should be noted to the generalizations just offered. The Imperial Russia of the Romanovs was viewed, particularly in liberal Britain, as something of an international outcast for reasons of the "barbarism" of her domestic autocratic structure;18 Germany foreign policy after the fall of Bismarck in 1890 was as inept as it was often indeterminate...and so forth. Nonetheless, at the time of the Boer War (1899-1902) Great Britain was willing to consider seriously a limited colonial settlement with Germany, which might have blossomed into a deeper political relationship, 19while--in 1907--Great Britain and Russia did achieve a reconciliation of their respective, and formerly antagonistic inteest wih rferece o Suth 20 interests with reference to South Asia.
In short, this European balance of power system, though vulnerable to incompetent statecraft (witness the Crimean War), was sufficiently flexible that very few alliance or entente combinations were prohibited.
What is of particular interest to this study is the fact that the international system as it emerged out of the ashes (in Europe and Asia)
and prosperous industries (in the United States) in 1945 was essentially set on its course, in its structure, and perhaps even substantially in its civilities and incivilities, before the nuclear age had any noteworthy physical military reality. The old order of the European balance of power system lingered on in the machinations of European diplomats in the 1920s and 1930s, but the world already had changed.
Nuclear weapons were developed in the 1940s by what came to be termed the superpowers, but the superpowers were considered superpowers before the world had assimilated the fact of the explosive release of nuclear energy for military purposes. Quite unaware of the existence of the Manhattan Project, William T.R. Fox wrote his book entitled The Super Powers during the course of World War 11. 21 Even had the atom never been split, the United States and the Soviet Union would have emerged from the Second World War as they did, preeminent (if heavily damaged, in the Soviet case) and eventually condemned to an enduring antagonism-even though the Soviet union threatened no very specific and long-standing American interest in any very direct fashion. Soviet-American hostility was a geopolitical inevitability. The United States was compelled to assume the duty of the principal defender of the Eurasian "Rimland" against the outward pressure of the Heartland power, the U.S.S.R. 
22
The near-total, though non-lethal, hostility between East and West that Is Implied by the concept of cold war has to be traced to causes 29 that is the co .
far more substantial than the cycle of mutual misperception that one can trace in the 1940s. This study is uninterested in the question of "who started the Cold War," not merely because that hoary issue has absorbed considerable historical research talent for too long already, but also--and, particularly--because the mere posing of that question shows a profound misunderstanding both of the character of the Soviet Union and of the enduring nature of world politics.
Although the European balance of power system limped on through the 1920s and 1930s, (as France sought with increasing desperation to contain a resurgent German Third Reich via alliance connections with Czechoslovakia and Poland), the largely excluded semi-European factor of the new Russia/Soviet Union posed a part-traditional, part-novel threat to the integrity of the international politics of the day. By political definition, the new Soviet Republic, in what was Imperial Russia, has been "at war" with the political and imperial system of capitalism from the day of its birth.
There is a rigidity in the structure of world politics flowing from this fact which has no close analogue in modern history (though some scholars of Bonapartist imperialism may disagree).
As American nuclear strategists discovered, very belatedly, in the 1970s, the character of the U.S.S.R. was not solely a matter of scholarly interest. Indeed, as some strategic theorists were to acknowledge, again very belatedly, a signal weakeness in American strategic nuclear doctrine, as developed in the 1950s and 1960s, was that it was virtually totally
innocent of any recognition of Soviet, qua Soviet reality.
: . . -/..'.' . ....... The period 1914-45 saw not only the emergence of three states whose political (and hence strategic) cultures were fundamentally challenging to the previously established rules of the Europe-oriented balance of power system (the Soviet Union, the German Third Reich, and the United States), it also saw the destruction of the theory of limited war. As
Clausewitz explained, with some overstatement, limited war was a rational product of a states' system wherein only limited political objectives 24.
were sought.
The idea of nationality inevitably was erosive of the practice of waging war for limited territorial objectives. For example, the loss of Alsace-Lorraine in 1870-71 functioned as a canker in the French body politic for a generation--nurturing an enduring demand for revanche. In the Fifteenth, Sixteenth, and even Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries, such an idea would have been ridiculous. However, what the idea and even the fact of mass national identification implied for the freedom of action of statesmen, the military technology of the late Nineteenth and early Twentieth Centuries made inevitable.

that occurs in war--for a time, at least), industrial strength, and political and military intellectual ineptitude, the military regulator of the European balance of power system could not function effectively in 1914.27 A protracted military struggle, engaging all of the assets of the participants, was an eventuality which none, save for a handful of unheeded theorists, had anticipated. The brutality implicit in the scenarios of the "nuclear gamesmen" of the nuclear age has already been practiced in the total wars of this century.
Brutality in war, alas, tends to be a simple function of military utility. The nuclear age, one may seek to argue, has seen new heights of planned barbarism--perhaps made all the more repulsive for the pseudoscientific strategic jargon with which prospective mass murder is explained

It is, perhaps, easy to be blase about events which have long been contemplated yet which have failed to occur. Nuclear war is no more "acceptable" or less horrible, for the fact that American society has lived in its shadow for thirty years. The clich6 of "the nuclear age" seems to have dulled what otherwise might be perceptive commentary.
What has the nuclear age meant for world politics?
Prior to the nuclear age, Great Powers competed for influence, engaged in arms competitions (reflecting their competing political aspirations), signed up allies and generaly avowed their faith in a somewhat locallyoriented definition of the good life. Also, from time to time, though with increasingly catastrophic results, the Great Powers had to resort to war one with another. (Germany, defeated in World War I, suffered only a very limited occupation and the imposition of an indemnity--albeit a crushing one--whereas defeat in World War II resulted in total military occupation and a division of the national territory [which may or may not prove to be permanent] .)
The principal fact of postwar (1945) international politics, the countervailing alliance, or satellite, structures organized by the United
States and the Soviet Union, would have occurred if nuclear weapons had not been invented. The super-power qualities of the United States and the Soviet Union have been enhanced by their unevenly evolving military nuclear capabilities, but their preeminent stature in the league table of international authority was preordained by reason of economic strength 34 L (in the American case), and the way in which economic assets ruthlessly were applied to military problems (in the Soviet case).
It is tempting to suggest that neither World War I nor World War II would have occurred had the crisis-principals of 1914 and 1939 been armed with nuclear weapons, and--ab extensio--that one of the post-1945 crises would have exploded into a general East-West war had nuclear weapons not been invented; but, this author remains unconvinced. Nuclear weapons should, indeed, promote an unusual measure of caution in statecraft, but it is difficult to see how a military invention could, for long, have damped the fires that were burning in the Balkans of 1914, or, again for long, have impressed a cautionary wisdom upon a desperate Vienna, a frivolous Berlin, and a vacillating, divinely inspired St. Petersburg.

The structure of countervailing alliances in Eurasia has not been the product of changes in military technology. NATO came to depend very heavily upon a contingent American nuclear guarantee after "the Lisbon goals" of 1952 for conventional rearmament lost their authority--which was very rapidiy indeed--and nuclear policy issues repeatedly have engaged the attention of intra-NATO diplomacy. However, the basic structure of the alliance, and particularly the leading role of the United States, has been the result of the overall strength of the United States, and the relative weakness of a politically much-fractionated Western Europe.
East-West relations since 1945, as this author has explained in detail elsewhere, 
39
Since 1945, notwithstanding the nuclear fact, world politics has been conducted very much on the basis of "business as usual. " The rigidities in the major alliance pattern have flowed not from the evolution of miitary, let alone military-nuclear, technology, but rather from the basic characters of the two principal alliance organizers, and the historically extraordinary, though not unprecedented, degree of their international preponderance in terms of the factors that make for "national power."
Consider, in summary form, the major changes that distinguish late Twentieth-Century, from, say, late Nineteenth-Century, world politics.
(I) The international political system, is truly global for the first time in history.
(2) Although Europe remains the principal "prize" in East-West competition, one superpower is totally non-European in its geography, while the other has most of its territory outside of Europe.
(3) The only colonial empire remaining in the world is the Great Russian/Soviet one.
(4) The "coming" Great Powers, each of which will have a military mobilization potential of, or close to, the first rank, are all non-European: they are Japan, the Chinese People's Republic, and Brazil.
(
The global character of the international political system is both matched and fueled by a global economic system and, effectively, a global system of very rapid communications .... and so on.
Where do nuclear weapons fit in the global political structure today?
It is unclear whether or not the possession of an overt nuclear-weapon capability, conveys, ipso facto, the contemporary equivalent of Great Power status (bearing in mind the fact that there are very few precedents for the superpower phenomenon--particularly in modern European history
[ perhaps Spain for most of the Sixteenth Century, and the France of Louis XIV, for a while, and of Napoleon Bonaparte--though even in these cases the precedents are very imperfect] ). As Soviet writers are fond of saying, "it is no accident" (probably--for an un-Soviet qualification) that the Permanent Members of the United Nations' Security Council are all nuclear weapon states. To have any very serious pretensions to play an international "ordering" function, a state today must possess nuclear weapons. The
.
. . 
* reason is as obvious as the logic is inescapable. Major challenges to international order are likely to stem from, and be encouraged by, other Great Power "guardians"--and those states are nuclear-armed. A state cannot pretend to cut a significant and independent figure in the guarding of international order if it has no like answer of its own to nuclear threats. However, it does not follow that every nuclear-weapon state aspires to contribute in a noticeable way to international order on the global stage. Today, and it is to be expected increasingly in the future, the international order to be guarded by national nuclear-weapon capabilities will largely be local and parochial. For example, Israel and South Africa, two states probably in possession of nuclear weapons today, have little interest in accomplishing anything more than keeping regional enemies at bay.
Notwithstanding the French theory of proportional nuclear deterrence, 42 the fact of the enduring Western alliance structure illustrates the truth that the traditional definition of a Great Power is no longer valid.
That definition held that a Great Power was a Power capable, alone, of standing up to any one of the other Great Powers. The emergence of two super-states has meant the demise of that definition. A nuclear-weapon capability per se, regardless of quantity and quality, does not serve as an effective equalizer in "the correlation of forces"--save, just possibly, with respect to a very narrow range of admittedly truly vital interests. 
43
A (1970-80), one should hesitate before offering any confident-sounding, broad-brush characterizations either of the rules of nuclear statecraft or, perhaps of greater relevance, of the rules of statecraft conducted in the shadow of nuclear weapons. There is no evidence as to how the Soviet Union will in fact choose to conduct its foreign relations in an era of marginal or perhaps clear nuclear superiority, in a context where other elements in the correlation of forces may be so unsatisfactory as to incline Soviet leaders towards caution or perhaps even cooperation.
Through the late 1940s, the 1950s, and the 1960s, Soviet adventures, actual and potential, in nuclear statecraft were checked by the fact of American nuclear superiority, while Soviet advantages in non-nuclear projection forces in Europe were offset convincingly by the escalation dominance implicit in the healthy (for the West) imbalance in so-called strategic forces.

45
In other words, the problem probably is not so much the question of the willingness of a particular group of Soviet leaders to take risks, but rather of the way in which it calculates risks.

The Soviet Union is not committed to a guardianship role vis-a-vis the curent international order--on the contrary she is committed, for excellent Russian and Soviet reasons, to guarding the process of transition from the present order to a future wherein socialism (i.e., the U.S.S.R.) will be triumphant. The "external role" of the Soviet armed forces, as stated quite unambiguously by Soviet authorities, is to protect and forward the transition to socialism. Whether one ascribes this viewpoint to Great Russian imperialism, to Marxist-Leninist ideology, or to a malign combination 48 of the two, is quite unimportant in the context of this study.
Soviet nuclear weapons, unlike American nuclear weapons, are not developed and deployed for the purpose of defending an international order that is deemed legitimate. Looking to the

Soviet intervention policy in Angola, Ethiopia, South Yemen and Afghanistan should warn us that the rules of the road for nuclear-backed statecraft are deemed by Soviet leaders to change with the correlation of forces.
In the words of a Soviet observer:
The nuclear and missile potential of the Soviet Union and of the entire socialist community cancels out imperialism's opportunity to use its war machine to obtain any political advantages, thus explaining the apparent paradox that imperialism's military arsenal grows by the year, while the power factor of its foreign policy is increasingly depreciated. In fact, the imperialist powers have not succeeded in employing the threat or use of arms to achieve any of their aims, whether in Vietnam, in Cuba, or Angola or in scores of other "flashpoints" over the last few decades. Moreover, the power conflicts of modern times end more and more often in the aggressor's defeat with respect t 2 the overall balance of power between reaction and progress.
Unlike the states-system that was reconfirmed at the Congress of Vienna in 1814-15, the international system today contains an actor which has, since its birth in revolution and civil war, been committed to the destruction of the Western idea, and practice, of international order.
Nuclear weapons, as accommodated in "the [Soviet] revolution in military 1, 53   affairs' do not pose a challenge to the historical necessity of the transformation of world politics. On the contrary, Soviet nuclear weapons serve as an effective counterdeterrent, "holding the ring square" for the conduct of "just" wars in the Third World;

Western officials, in their conduct of statecraft, should never forget that in the Soviet Union they have an adversary who holds essentially to a "battlefield" philosophy concerning nuclear planning. 
55
The weighting of the correlation of forces in the favor of the West through most of the nuclear era has helped, thus far, to render moot the foreign policy implications of Soviet strategic doctrine. The transition from rough strategic parity, to marginal and then to clear superiority as the 1980s proceed, could well mean that Soviet strategic doctrine will I ave considerable influence on Soviet foreign policy behavior. In years past, when the United States believed that Soviet leaders shrank from the brink of catastrophe--those leaders may have shrunk not from the idea of a generalized catastrophe, but rather from the uncomplicated conviction that the Soviet Union would lose a nuclear war. Should Soviet leaders come to believe not only that victory is possible, which is an ideological requirement (as well as being sensible for sustaining morale), but also that victory is likely, then Soviet foreign policy, quite responsibly (in Soviet perspective), could asume a course fundamentally challenging of those rules of the road for nuclear peace which American governments believe to have been long-established.
Perhaps the single most distressing fact of contemporary world politics for a country traditionally as optimistic in its outlook as the United
States, is the idea of permanance of competition with the Soviet Union.
It is unpopular to remind people that the Soviet Union is obliged because of its very raison d'*tre, to define the United States objectively as an enemy. However slow the present transition to a fully socialist (and Soviet dominated) world, the Soviet commitment to conflict and struggle with the West is quite inalienable. The U.S.S.R. is a state based upon a highly dubious interpretation of an extremely fragile theory of inevitable historical change. The U.S.S.R., in its own terms, only makes sense as way-station en route to socialism worldwide. This does not mean that 44  the Soviet Union is committed to the waging of eventual (military) war with the West--Marxism-Leninism, as interpreted, offers several alternative paths to socialism. But, it does mean that the Soviet Union, of necessity, is fully committed to the prospect of war with the West.
Western governments persist in believing that policies of cooperation are as important, if not more important, than are policies of conflict.

2. This contemporary fact does not excuse policy-makers from taking 4. Harold Brown appeared to state that deterrence and defense are one and the same (in his Speech at the Naval War College, Newport, R.I., August 20, 1980, p.6), but that position was so contrary to his, and President Carter's entire record of nuclear policy beliefs, that one hesitates to proclaim a revolution in U.S. strategic doctrine.
The Reagan Administration, while generally disapproving of Carter's defense programs, has given no evidence, to date, of disapproval of the nuclear strategy that it inherited.
5. If one is willing to grant the concept of a "well fought" nuclear war.
It has long been charged by radical critics of nuclear strategy that debates over nuclear strategy tend to embrace only people who have establishment values (e.g., a question such as "should the United
States have a nuclear strategy?"--is deemed, by the nuclear strategy cognoscenti to be inadmissible, or irrelevant).   Englishmen and Americans (etc.) had important qualities qua Frenchmen, Englishmen and Americans (etc.)far more important than their social roles.
Notwithstanding its multi-national, and certainly multi-ethnic, foundations, the United States, paradoxically, has had--and has--a very clear sense of national identity, a sense that there exists a distinct "us" and that all others are "them" (more or less carefully differentiated), while at the same time American strategic thinkers, have been curiously insensitive to possible national differences in modes of strategic thought and behavior.
American strategists have always known, deep down, that Soviet, French, British et al. approaches to security issues differed from their own in good part because Soviet, French and British policy-makers were heirs to distinctive perspectives that were, at root, comprehensible through an appropriate combination of historical, geographical, anthropological, psychological and sociological study. However, the recognition of national differences has only very rarely moved the U.S. Government to take explicit account of the impact of those differences upon policy 2 goals and methods in its conduct of affairs.
In the later 1970s, American defense commentators discovered what they really had known all along--that the Soviet Union did not appear to share many of the more important beliefs and practices beneficial to the American idea of international order. This should have come as no surprise, but it did. Although the Western strategic literature of the past quarter-century is replete with warnings against the practice of mirror-imaging and projecting American desires and perspectives unself- The concept of strategic culture is a direct descendant from the * concept of political culture--which has been debated, developed, variously employed and even more variously defined by political scientists since the early 1950s.

--frames, intellectually, its defense tasks in ways generally unfamiliar to the United States.
--behaves in defense related matters in a fashion inexplicable in standard American terms.
These differences in observable thought and practice have so enduring a character that, even when idiosyncratic decision possibilities are factored out, it is plausible to hypothesize that the Soviet Union has approached, and continues to approach, defense issues in a fairly distinctive Soviet manner--comprehensible only in those terms. In order to understand why the Soviet Union thinks and behaves as she does, it should be useful to seek to trace that thought and behavior to the fundamentally influencing factors, While fully accepting the possible dangers of crude reductionism (if one or more allegedly "determining factors" are identified), 
6
It is a contemporary fact that the discovery of cultural distinctiveness in strategic thought and practice has been attended, probably inevitably, by an unduly simple appreciation of this dimension to strategic affairs. As preliminary caveats, it should be noted that:
--some strategic-cultural traits are common to many supposedly and even truly distinct cultures.
--a strategic culture may accommodate several quite distinctive strategic sub-cultures (which may have more in common with some foreign strategic cultures than they have with their dominant national culture).
--many, and probably most, alleged strategic cultural traits are fully rational, in strict realpolitik terms, given the perceived historical experience of the nations in question.
The strategic cultural thought processes and (derived) behavior of interest to this study do not, noticeably, rest upon individual psycho-cultural phenomena (e.g., the childrearing practice of Great Russian mothers and the like).
--from time to time a state may act in ways that represent, in toto, a break from the traditional, dominant, strategic culture.
The strategic cultural theme of this study has its roots in a concern flagged informatively by Jack Snyder. He has written as follows:
It is useful to look at the Soviet approach to strategic thinking as a unique 'strategic culture.' Individuals are socialized into a distinctively Soviet mode of strategic thinking. As a result of this socialization process, a set of general beliefs, attitudes and behavioral patterns with regard to nuclear strategy has achieved a state of semipermanence that places them on the level of 'culture' rather than mere 'policy.' Of course, attitudes may change as a result of changes in technology and the international environment. However, new problems are not assessed objectively. Rather, they are seen th ough the perceptual lens provided by the strategic culture.
As often as not, alas, the intriguing and potentially enlightening idea of strategic culture becomes a distorting idea when defense commentators research too assiduously, and too uncritically, for the cjItural roots of contemporary defense practice. Hence, although one can compare and contrast Soviet with American cultures, the comparison and contrast would often be a lot less stark were the full range of American (and Soviet) attitudes to be assessed--as opposed only to the policy-dominant ones. As with sound geopolitical, so with strategic-cultural, analysis, one is discerning tendencies not rigid (pre-) determinants. Nevertheless, contemporary American, Soviet, et al. strategic commentators have to be very much the products of their particular, unique, milieux.
It is hypothesized here that there is a discernible American strategic culture: that culture, referring to modes of thought and action with respect to force, derives from perception of the national historical experience, aspiration for self-characterization (e.g., as an American, what am I?, how should I feel, think, and behave?), and from all of the many distinctively American experiences (of geography, political philosophy and practice [i.e., civic culture], and way of life) that determine an American citizen. The idea of an American national style is derivative from the idea of American strategic culture, suggesting that there is a distinctively American way in strategic matters.
Notwithstanding the necessary indeterminacy of some of the evidence, this Chapter presents a complex hypothesis. First, it is suggested that there is an American (and, ab extensio, other) strategic culture--which flows from geopolitical, historical, economic and other unique influences.
Second, that American strategic culture provides the milieu within which strategic ideas and defense policy decisions are debated and decided. Third, it is suggested here that an understanding of American strategic culture (and, by extension, style) can help explain why American policymakers have made the decisions they have. Moreover, if the past and present can thus be explained, it may be possible to employ the concept of strategic culture (and style) to predict decisions in the future.
It has to be admitted that it is, as yet, unclear just how helpful studies of strategic culture may prove to be. However, it does not seem unduly optimistic to assert at least the following potential benefits:
--an improved understanding of our own, and other, cultures on their own terms.
--an improved ability to discern enduring policy motivations and to predict.
--an improved ability to communicate what we wish to communicate (whatever that may be). 8
an improved ability to comprehend the meaning of events in the assessment of others.
A rather obvious danger in this theme lies in the realm of cultural relativism. Soviet drives for further influence abroad need be no less menacing because we think we understand much better what lies behind them.
Our central problem is not so much to understand Soviet power as it is to contain it (which is not to demean the virtue of understanding). Moreover, It is not argued here--implicitly or explicitly--that American policy 60 L7..
necessarily should be changed solely because its frame of conceptual reference fits poorly with that identified for the U.S.S.R.
Virtually by definition, strategic culture and national style have very deep roots within a particular stream of historical experience--as locally interpreted. While it is not assumed here that culture and style are inmnutable, such would be absurd, it is assumed that rational patterns of thought and action--the "preferred" way of coping with problems and opportunities--are likely to alter only very gradually, short of a new historical experience which few can deny warrants a historically discontinuous response. It is not argued that there is a Russian/Soviet strategic culture and national style that is fixed for all time. Clearly, the Soviet Union of 1981 is different from the Soviet Union of 1937-38.
But, pending some major system shocks, the weight of the past, and the way the past is interpreted as a (largely implicit) guide to the present, far outweighs in enduring importance the marginal changes in culture discernible year by year.
It. is my contention that major streams of policy decisions in the United States and the Soviet Union cannot simply be explained in terms of the characteristics of particular people, their unique assessment of * policy options, and the bureaucratic-political milieux in which they find themselves (though, very often, they could, and did, help shape the mix of contending bureaucratic-political forces).
In addition, it is necessary to consider the strategic culture of the various policy-makers.
While aberrant, culturally innovative, or just plain eccentric decisionmaking is always possible, there is a tendency for policy-makers of a is not enough just to note the details of "the American way" and "the Soviet way"; more important is the question of how those ways would likely * fare if they were ever tested in direct conflict. To date, at least, the very few studies of comparative strategic culture and style that have appeared have not ventured into the realm of the implications for United
States policy. The inherent merit of American strategic thinking is not the issue--this is not a contest in intellectual aesthetics--the real issue is how appropriate American ideas (and ideas-made-into-policy) are in a conflict process with a particular adversary. It is worth noting that this study takes a broad view of "national peculiarities." By "peculiarities," I refer not so much to (ethnocentrically perceived) eccentricities or colorfully bizarre "foreign" habits, but rather to different mind-sets and behavior patterns that flow, as responses, from a very distinctive historical-geographic (and hence cultural) context. The potential problem of multiple-causation may easily be over-stressed. Assessed in isolation, quite a wide range of theories may be invoked to explain American and Soviet defense behavior. To sift these theories for their plausibility, and then their explanatory power, one needs to engage in cross-cultural analysis. For example, if one has a structural theory of U.S. defense policy behavior which identifies some mix of a Military-Industrial Complex and bureaucratic politics as the collective determinant (or villain) of defense policy output, how does one account for the fact that a Soviet Military-Industrial Complex, and Soviet bureaucratic politics, produces a very different policy output.
The answer, presumably, has to be that the industrial-bureaucratic-political forces in the two superpowers are differently configured. But, even if this is true--as seems likely--one then has to ask why those forces are configured differently. In short, even the 'structural-determinist' cannot evade the issue of possible cultural impact upon the analysis.
It is important to restate, at this juncture, the fact that this study rests upon a basically agnostic stance vis a vis national differences in approaches to national and international security. While one has no difficulty identifying apparent American, Soviet, British, et al. In asserting, as a hypothesis, that Great Russians think differently about national security issues than do Americans, one need not imply anything about the "curious" psychology of individual Great Russians or Americans. Instead, one may simply imply that the geopolitical inheritance of the two peoples is very different and that that inheritance has quite 64
(locally) natural consequences for contemporary assessment of security problems.
It is important that the cultural/stylistic theme not be muddied in appraisal by views on the merits, or otherwise, of national character
analysis. This author will confine himself to asserting that * --each state has a unique, distinctive, history.
-each state learns ((,r mislearns) from its assessment of that unique, distinctive, histo~ry.
-and that each state, having a unique, distinctive, history, is very likely to learn and mislearn dicta significantly different from those of other states.
It is not too difficult to find in the history of each state experiences quite closely analogous (at least superficially) to those of many others. For example, as Ken Booth has done, one can show that the American * -military experience is sufficiently rich and varied as to cast doubt upon ,,12 all simple assertions concerning "the American way in war .
Booth's successful foray into the realm of myth-destruction, though quite impressive as a scholarly exercise, is reminiscent of the old conundrum of the r~tecessity for deciding whether a tumbler of water is half-empty or halffull. Many, if not most, allegedly American cultural traits in warfare, and approaches to warfare, can be found elsewhere. Booth is correct.
However, in his worthy determination to slay the dragon of myths concerning the convenient metaphor of American Strategic Man, Ken Booth neglects to address the still-valid question, "what, if any, are the implications for defense and international security of the unique American geopolitical Man, this author believes, with John Shy, that ...whenever Americans before the end of the nineteenth century thought about questions of war or military force, their perception of those questions was strongly affected by certain peculiar attitudes and beliefs that, through the conditioning effect of long historical experience, had become almost reflexive.
A dichotomous idea of national security, an unthinking optimism about the national American aptitude for warfare, and an ambivalent attitude ward those Americans who specialized in the use of force... It would be an elementary exercise to demonstrate why Americans should be different--how their attitudes and behavior should betray unique tenden- --endorsed theories of strategic stability which rationalized the loss of strategic superiority.

to American political-military desiderata--no matter how eloquently, or persistently, expressed.
As Edward Luttwak has argued, until quite recent years the United States really had scant need of strategy 
1 9
It is the American style to devote far more attention to the management of large defense programs than to operational issues. Indeed, there is a startling historical contrast between the selection process, and subsequent course of study of German and American staff officers prior 20 to World War 1I.
As a somewhat gross generalization, while American officers were taught how to be good at the management of men and the provision of material, German officers were taught, near-exclusively, how to handle military assets in combat. The management bias in American higher military education has survived to the present day--with predictable
results. The United States, in the Twentieth Century, has been a resource-rich country. Questions pertaining to the actual employment of
force, and particularly of limited force, have been deemed secondary to the marshalling of muscle. In terms of her mobilized, and mobilizable, assets, Germany in World Wars I and II was grossly inferior to her enemies.
Eventually, this inferiority produced the predictable outcome-defeat.
However, the German army in those two wars--although ultimately defeated for reasons of deficiencies of substance--outperformed its adversaries to a noteworthy degree. The political fact of victory, achieved through brute force or sheer quantity of military/civilian assets, tended to subsume issues of strategy.
Until the mid-1960s, issues of strategy, so-called, required that scant American attention need be paid to political objectives. War planning, traditionally, was informed by an elementary, and eminently defensible, desire to win. American military experience, from the Seven Years War through to 1945, yielded some dominant national beliefs.
First, it was believed that good causes tend to triumph--and Americans only wage war in good causes. The United States, as the modern pioneer ;4 in democracy, religious liberty and so forth (the "city upon a hill," 
2 1
Second, it was believed that Americans could achieve anything that they set their hands to in earnest. America/the United States--until 1966-67 at least--was, by very popular consensus (by and large acknowledged--though not untinged by jealousy--abroad) one of history's success stories: Horatio Alger at the national level. The American national experience provides ample evidence for an optimistic ideology. Americans survived and triumphed in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries against the might of intermittently hostile, and numerically vastly superior, Indian tribes, against the might of France and Great Britain--and, perhaps most impressive of all--against a very challenging physical geography.
By 1814, as John Shy has argued, the infant United States had registered a historically very unusual achievement: 
2 3
Third, in Sir Denis Brogan's phrase, there was an "illusion of [American] omnipotence" which was, of course, fed and justified by reference to the national success story. 
2 5
In addition, most Americans, as more or less recent immigrants, were not at all eager to see their new country, and themselves, involved intimately in the conflicts of a world that they (thought they) had left behind.
Central and Eastern Europeans, Jews, Germans, Italians, Swedes, Irish, et al. did not, by and large--as new Americans--feel that indissoluble nexus to the 'old country' felt, say, by British emigrants to Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Aside from the very important fact that no single immigrant group, relative to the total size of the American electorate, (or even by virtue of geographical concentration), could--prior to 1945--affect American foreign policy in decisive ways, it would seem *
to have been the case that, in a fashion that is historically unusual, immigrants to the United States were eager to cast off their European memories and possible residual loyalites.
To summarize, prior to 1945 it was unusual to find Americans endorsing the idea that the United States should be, or had to be, a permanent guardian of international order. In the popular American conception, the United States was a haven for the disadvantaged (though very restrictive immigration legislation effectively had negated the practical force of that thesis); was an example to the rest of mankind (the "city upon a hill");2 8 and would, and could, intervene decisively on the side of good when the disorder in the Old World so required. The reality of material abundance, married to a historic engineering-pragmatic national style, 
2 9
A United States rich in machines, men, and logistic support of all kinds, is not a United States obviously in need of clever strategems, or needful of a careful balancing of likely political benefit against probable cost in material and human assets. German tactical skills in the two world wars of this century were the product of military necessity--the side inferior in material and human assets needs to seek compensation in the quality of its tactics and strategy.
Although there have always been individual exceptions, it is--nonetheless--valid to argue that strategic thinking has been, and remains, -alien to the mainstream of American thought on defense questions. 
30
Whatever the President's intentions may have been, American military power was not applied in World War I in a manner calculated to achieve American political objectives. However, American military behavior in the First World War is, of course, easily defensible. General Douglas MacArthur was correct when he asserted that "there is no substitute for victory."
If one wishes to dominate the process of designing the post-war political order, one has first to win that right on the battlefield. From time to time countries are unable to translate military victory into political success (witness France vis a vis the war in Algeria), but it is a general truth that in the absence of clear military success only extraordinary incompetence on the part of the enemy permits you to have a decisive voice in the design of the post-war order. The political meaning of military defeat is very well illustrated by recent events in Southeast Asia.
World War II is a more complex case than was World War I, in that the goal of defeating Nazi Germany, unlike the Allied goal of beating the Kaiser's Germany, clearly was politically valid in and of itself.
It is a relatively elementary matter to defend the American military Roosevelt's policy of near-unconditional cooperation with the Soviet Union in retrospect plainly was unwise and even naive. But it was understandable, given the "national peculiarities" of American political culture, and was easy to defend in the light of real-time American policy assessment.
It is easy to forget, from the vantage point of the early 19 8 0s, that the Western Allies of 1943-44 (when, for example, critical decisions were taken concerning zones of occupation in post-war Germany) felt profoundly guilty over the massive inequality of effort, as between the Soviet Union, and themselves, devoted to the actual engagement of the German armed forces.
When an ally is doing most of the fighting and dying, one is not in a strong position--or even likely to feel much motivated--to design strategies intended to deprive him of most of the potential fruits of a victory to which he has made a disproportionately large contribution.
Nonetheless, with the excuses admitted, the fact remains that competent war leaders are supposed to have vision and pursue long-term, as well as short-term, security measures. Once the Grand Coalition was fully assembled and had weathered the crises of 192 (i.e., after Midway, Alamein, and Stalingrad), strategic genius was not required to discern that Germany and Japan's defeat (barring the improbability of German production of atomic weapons) was inevitable, and that the most important issues of Anglo-American statecraft pertained to the character of the post-war world. However unimaginative and deficient in strategic vision was the general American conduct of its campaigning in World War II, at least it had the virtue of pursuing the unambiguous, attainable, popular, and necessary (though not sufficient) goal of victory.
The astrategic American tradition, the product of continental insularity and abundant defense mobilizaton potential, continued into the nuclear age--although it took different forms. The American national military experience, prior to 1945, was characterized by relatively short, relatively cheap, and unambiguously successful campaigning against enemies easily portrayed in demonological terms. In practice, if not in terms of public recognition, the United States waged two balance-of-power wars in 1917-18
and 1941-45--to prevent the domination of Eurasia by a single country/coalition. However, as Henry Kissinger came to lament, Americans do not think geopolitically,

These theories could have been developed in a way, and with policy implications, compatible with prudent strategic thinking.

Nothwithstanding the contemporary (mid-1950s) theorizing on the subject of deterrence, with its highly critical (of official policy) tone and content, SAC did have war plans which made strategic sense. An American President could back his foreign policy, if need be, with threats of central nuclear employment, and expect to be believed. American political By 1981, albeit very expensively, the Soviet Union had achieved a position of marginal strategic superiority--meaning that with good luck and judgment she would win at modest cost; with less good luck and less good judgment she should still win, though very possibly at catastrophic cost. 
4 4
The dominant strain in the American defense community (Democrat and Republican) for twenty years, while not (in general) demeaning the theoretical value of strategic superiority, came to believe that:
--Meaningful superiority could not be regained or, if regained, sustained. Moreover, such superiority was not necessary to meet the goals set by national security policy.
--
The evolution of technology was imposing an impasse, a strategic deadlock.
--Continued doctrinal commitment to strategic superiority would merely license the armed services to request larger forces from which little, if any, net political or military benefit could be anticipated.
Little benefit could be expected because the Soviet Union would react in such a fashion to any efforts to ensure superiority as to nullify those efforts. Damage-limitation came to be seen as the primary dynamic of the "arms race."
As a plausible generalization, the American defense community came to fear the arms race more than it did the Soviet Union. After a brief 84 flurry of interest in strategic operational issues, Robert McNamara declined to press for major revisions in targeting strategy.

notWhat American, and in some cases uniquely American, attitudes, have contributed to the cumulative relative decline in American deployed strategic power over the past twenty years?
First, there has been, and remains, a belief that nuclear war cannot be won. War), and a value system that accords great importance to the well-being of individuals. However, it is worth noting that there is some friction between this devotion to low American casualties and the facts, throughout most of American history, both of an abundance of American manpower, and of a relative indifference on the part of American military commanders to local material and civilian loss (not to mention enemy combat loss).
General Van Fleet, Commander of the Eighth Army in Korea, said in May
We must expend steel and fire, not men. I want so many 50 artillery holes that a man can step from one to the other. threatening, rather is it fearful of American intentions. It should follow that if only, or rather when, Soviet leaders can be brought to understand the rationality of, and mutual benefit that would flow from, general acceptance of American deterrence and arms control reasoning, much of the fuel would be removed from the engine of the arms race.
Fifth, it has been believed that the American military establishment, in all its manifold ramifications, poses as great, if not a greater, threat to traditional American values than do Soviet ambitions (which almost certainly have been misassessed on the hostile side by official assessors with vested interests).

However, the "window of vulnerability" evident in the 1980s, though traceable to the posturally debilitating long-term impact of highly questionable (and very distinctly un-Soviet) stability theory, is no less easily traceable to the several political-budgetary effects of Vietnam. The mere fact of the war reduced the financial resources available for strategic- Sixth, there has been a widespread belief in the superiority of American technology and strategic ideas. The Soviet Union was viewed as an unsophisticated fundamentally peasant country, capable of challenging in quantity but not in quality; in short, technological and intellectual hubris.

In their hubris, or arrogance, American defense intellectuals in the 1960s and early to mid-1970s had difficulty even conceiving of the possibility that there could be more than one strategic theoretical enlightenment. The American national experience (a dynamic data base) produced a nuclear strategy, and nuclear-strategy related policy, in the 1970s which had the following characteristics:
--A theory of strategic stability, and its implications, was endorsed which rested upon the belief that the super-powers shared a tolerably congruent perspective upon a desirable status quo.
--
A confidence was placed in reason and (American-style) rational decision-making to the extent that the physical protection of Americans came to reside solely in anticipated pre-, or intra-, war deterrent effect.
--It was simply not serious at the operational level. American policy-makers endorsed flexibility as a desideratum, but U.S. strategic forces continued to be postured for a very short spasm war.
Inchoate optimistic notions of progress in international cooperation were invested in an arms-control process the evident failure of which was rationalized by reference to ever more minimalist criteria.
One can trace these specific items to "the American way." Unfortunately for clarity of understanding, one could reverse the policy logic in these items, and trace them also to "the American way." This is why It has to be stressed here that the analysis in this chapter is time-specific.
This chapter targets a United States that is reconsidering the merits of the path pursued for the past fifteen years. Although national political culture and its derivative, strategic culture and national style in strategy, evolve over time, American oscillation between underand over-preparedness, between wishful thinking and Manichaeanism is endemic, for the foreseeable future, to "the American way." It is instructive to specu-* m late as to the reasons for this.
First, the United States is an insular political culture. There is an expectation of safety, as the norm, which flows from the geographical fact of insularity. For an insular power to be stirred to take expensive and dangerous actions, foreign threat has to be (believed to be--rightly or wrongly) immediate and massive. The drawing of a sharp distinction between peace and war is natural to Americans and Englishmen--traditionally, they have not lived in constant fear of loss of life or liberty.
Geographical isolation, however illusory, encourages one to discount apparently distant dangers. But, the cultural proclivity to assume that peace is normal, produces, when turned around by apparently unambiguous evidence of foreign threat, a possibly disproportionate military response.
Second, with very few exceptions, American policy-making in the national security area (foreign policy, defense policy, arms control policy) tends to be dominated by people with a poor sense of the value of history.
. In the inimitable words of one American policy maker:
..all tha history business! We've got to make policy *decisions.
To the average American maker of "high" policy, international events * occur as by constant revelation and have meaning, if any, solely with reference to his personal historical experience. It is commonplace to observe that American decision-making style tends, pre-eminently, to mean

States is likely to be compelled to engage. In the 1980s the United States is obliged, faute de mieux, to compete for international influence with the U.S.S.R., to be prepared to seek to dissuade the U.S.S.R. from taking (U.S.-) undesired actions, and if need be, to endeavor to thwart Soviet policy by means of applied military power. Given these elementary, unarguable, facts, it is important that the Soviet Union be as well comprehended 2 in the West as may prove possible. Soviet policy may not be likened to a loose gun carriage on a rolling deck (indeed, that simile more nearly approximates the enduring American policy condition), it is not eccentric, irrational (in local Soviet terms, at least), or even particularly mysterious in its driving motivations and its goals. However, it is different from American policy, it cannot usefully be approached in familiar American terms; and many of the Western policy errors of the past thirty-six years could have been avoided, or reduced in scope, had a proper respect been
paid both to Soviet cultural uniqueness, and, in addition, simply to the plain facts of local Soviet conditions.

It is relatively easy both to acknowledge, in a formal way, the trivially obvious fact that the Soviet Union is very different from the United States, and then to engage in policy analysis which focuses far more heavily upon the apparently familiar, than the unfamiliar, elements in the Soviet system.

This study acknowledges the dangers that lurk close to essentialist explanation--a disinclination to examine possibly discordant details (since one has to hand already "the essential truth"); a closed-mindedness towards competing theories; and--in general--an undue ease of explanation. Scholars tend to seek intellectual order in what, in practice, may well fairly be described as disorder. Not infrequently, book reviewers criticize authors for failing to impose order on their material. History may unfold as "one damn thing after another," but historians are charged (at least by reviewers who categorize themselves as political scientists)
with "making sense of events.

Russian colonial experience on the open steppes bred the same anticipation of military threat that the process of Soviet imperial expansion since 1945 has fostered.

Americans seek to minimize the risks and potential costs of armed conflict by sharply graduating applied violence (or never doing by halves what might be accomplished by quarters).
In Vietnam for example, the United States was always "behind the (necessary) power curve." Consistently, the Johnson Administration applied too little force too late (not to mention the many sins of military mal-execution that were committed--against the policy background of inchoate and unpersuasive political objectives).
The Soviet Union has favored a reverse strategy. Following the old dictum *that no general ever lost a battle because he was too strong, Soviet leaders have sought to minimize risks and costs by the threatening and applying of military force on such a scale as, hopefully, to guarantee prompt success.
Whether or not this historical pattern would be reflected in the Soviet conduct of central nuclear war is a question of more than tangential inter-est to this study.
The American proclivity for easing her way into combat with symbolic, quarter and half measures--for the excellent purpose of seeking to dampen the pace of conflict expansion and maximize the prospects for political control of military events--extends into the realm of central war planning.

the conduct of war American officials and scholars do not, and cannot, know with high confidence just how Soviet leaders would choose to wage a central nuclear war. Indeed, it may not even be prudent to assume that Soviet leaders 34 would perceive that they enjoyed the luxury of strategic choice. Unfortunately, there is no alternative other than to speculate on this subject.
To the limited degree to which there is Western expertise on the subject of Soviet strategic-nuclear operational intentions, the story is a grim one for American hopes for escalation control. The Soviet strategic missile forces are organized into armies, brigades, and regiments, geared to salvo firming--in short it is a battlefield deployment of strategic weapons, "nuclear guns," if you like, aimed at the enemy in order to fight a "counternuclear battle," knocking out the enemy nuclear guns and exploiting at the same time accepted military principles of surprise, deception, and maneuver .... It is worth noting in passing that the founders of the Soviet strategic missile force were not strategic theoreticians but experienced and distinguished artillery commanders .... In the sequence of strikes, the maximum number should be allocate 7 to the first launch, in order to maximize survivability... Such evidence as there is suggests that if the politicians fail to prevent war, the Soviet military establishment would do its duty and endeavor to conduct it in efficient pursuit of a clear, favorable military outcome. The consistency of evidence (from writings, from behavior in other military-diplomatic respects, from the technical details of Soviet military deployment, from exercises, and from Soviet/Russian strategic/political culture) is remarkable and probably should be viewed as persuasive--if only for reasons of prudence. In practice, Soviet political leaders may prove to be as interested in attempting to retain political control of military events through flexibility in military execution as were their precedessors in July 1914. The partial mobilization (non-) option, against Austria-Hungary only, which attracted the Russian Foreign Minister, Sazanov (a man heroically ignorant of military [and many diplomatic] realities), was always absurd because it would have been certain to trigger an Austro-Hungarian general mobilization which would have triggered German general 118 ..

mobilization...and so on to the Marne.
Although one cannot be certain, it is only prudent to assume that, in the event, Soviet political leaders will be unable--assuming, perhaps over-optimistically, that they would try--to cope with the apparently sound military arguments of the General Staff (and its political allies) for waging the war according to plan.

Those commentors impressed by the apparent novelty of the Soviet military modernization drive of the 1960s and 1970s should be reminded of the fact that the Soviet Army and Air Forces of 1935 were probably the most modern, as well as the largest, in the world.

The Soviet Union does not view its heavy economic-social burden of defense preparation in ways at all analogous to those familiar in American terms. While the separate Soviet armed services may, and do, squabble over relatively scarce industrial and human resources, there is never any question of debating the fundamental state drive for multi-level military preponderance over any and all potential enemies. This may mislead the unwary, since clearly the steady slowdown in the rate of growth of the Soviet economy must sharpen defense-non-defense allocation controversies.
However, the Soviet weltanschauung does not admit of any controversy over the need for constant military vigilance. Without denying the growing need of Soviet high-technology industry for the Great Russian (in particular) 124 * -youth that currently must spend two or three years performing generally economically unproductive military tasks, Soviet leaders discern no alternative--for the following reasons (or cultural conditions):
--A very large armed force is "the Russian/Soviet way." The tradition of public service in the mass army is as solidly entrenched in the Soviet Union as it is in France. 
54
The U.S.S.R. knows, by ideological definition, that it has deadly enemies in the outside world.
--
The military power of the Soviet state induces politically beneficial awe and respect on the part of citizens, untrustworthy Warsaw Pact allies, and those currently beyond direct Soviet control.
--Military and para-military organizations of all kinds, from units in schools and factories to elite Guards regiments, are a source of national pride, an instrument of social cohesiveness, and a tool for nation-building and national integration.

There is a steady rhythm to Soviet military preparation which lends itself all too easily to misassessment in the West. Whereas the United States stumbles, or lurches, from feast to famine in its allocation of resources to defense, the Soviet Union--for enduring reasons of style and structure--adheres to a tolerably even course, year after year. This well attested fact is subject to the phenomenon of redundant causation.
In other words, several quite distinct, and plausible, theories serve to explain the steady pace of Soviet defense preparation. The Western misassessment flows from the alien character of this Soviet rhythm of preparedness. In some Western eyes, it seems virtually self-evident that the unrelenting social and economic costs of Soviet defense preparation must have political meaning in terms of "a day of reckoning." The familiar phrase, "the Soviet military build-up," suggests an activity purposefully directed--and what purpose can a iilitary build-up have other than to * coerce enemies? Consideration of build-up leads easily enough to the Soviet window of opportunity/Western window of vulnerability thesis.
This author does not wish to risk propagating spurious reassurance, but he believes that the Soviet military "build-up" should be viewed, first, in Soviet perspective. but they have a grand strategy (or doctrine--for the Soviet term)

No matter what Pravda, Tass, or itinerant Soviet "scholars" may say, day by day, Soviet statecraft is dominated, at a high level, by an enduring comprehension of the essential rules of the game of world politics, and of the proper Soviet role as a player in that game.
In addition, a country with a centrally planned economy with respectA to the priorities within which major decisions are made at quinquennial intervals, is not a country easily capable of adjusting its kinds and levels of defense production on a flexible, year by year, basis. Every serious Western student of Soviet defense industry of recent years has
stressed the inertia in that system, and the difficulty there would be in attempting to shift resources as threat estimates varied.
Unlike the situation in the United States, Soviet defense industry (in alliance with its particular military users), year after year, maintains a fairly steady work flow on the products that it knows how to build.
While major innovation is possible, the system, disproportionately, rewards formally satisfactory performance and discourages risk-taking. Regular of existing products. In addition, there is good reason to believe that particular programs are continued long after there is excellent reason to doubt their prospective military utility. As with all styles in defense preparation, the Soviet one has the vices of its virtues.
Nonetheless, however one elects to explain it, there is no significant dispute concerning the character of Soviet style in defense-industrial activity. The United States defense community is able to predict, with quite high confidence, the level and kind of Soviet defense product output in the 19 8 0s, and even 1990s (barring some traumatic system shock), in a way that simply is not feasible for Soviet intelligence analysts contemplating the United States. The American cycle of defense-industrial feast and famine is not a regular one. By 1990 the United States may have deployed the MX ICBM, Trident I1, the B-1, and a low-altitude ABM system-or she may not.
Although the subject of this study is nuclear strategy and national style, it is imperative that political drives and temptations not be subsumed in, for example, technical consideration of nuclear war planning and approaches to arms control. Above all else, this chapter seeks to provide the reader with a clear sense of the character of the Soviet Union as a strategic actor--with particular reference to strategic-nuclear concerns. The previous section detailed certain prominent facts about Soviet thought and behavior, this section advances a somewhat sweeping hypothesis concerning the political engine that may summon forth Soviet nuclear posture and strategy to action. To be specific, it is contended here that the Soviet Union may usefully, indeed most usefully, be approached as an Empire, moved in her thought and behavior by distinctively imperial considerations. As will be made evident, this hypothesis is not advanced as a preclusive explanation and basis for prediction, simply as a very useful one. There have been many empires, all unique in important respects.
However, the purpose here is not to uncover general truths about empire, rather is it, much more modestly, to contribute to improved understanding of the Soviet Union. In this context, it is proposed that some frequent and enduring (if not necessarily universal) themes of empire are very useful indeed for comprehending Soviet reality.
the meaning of empire
In looking for the essence of empire one is compelled, faute de mieux, to have recourse to common sense. What are the characteristics of empire-properly understood? They should include: Imperial rule, fundamentally, implies a relationship of authority founded on the power to coerce.
Imperial rulers, even in the hey-day of their authority, and notwithstanding the possible reality of their actually believing in some form of a mission civilisatrice, are often wont to recognize that there is an abnormality (of legitimacy) in their relationship with many of their subjects such that coercion must underlie all ruler-ruled connections. This argument can easily be overstated.
The relations between rulers and ruled in most empires, at most times, have not been characterized by overt coercion. Nonetheless, essential to the authority of empire is the idea that putative national-separatism is very unlikely to succeed--because of the power of the coercive instruments of central imperial rule.
Very often, the idea of empire is confused with the idea of "colonial empire." A colonial empire, by definition, is an empire of colonies with colonists. More often than not, imperial reality has had no colonial referents worthy of note. For a prominent example, the British Empire in India never extended, in personnel, beyond administrators, the army and traders: there was never any question of bringing native British persons out to "colonize" the Indian Empire. It should be noted that colonization, as an adjunct to empire, may have several distinct motives.
In the Soviet case, one observes Great Russian colonization both as a response to population pressure, and as intended to dilute, and eventually overwhelm, local nationalisms that otherwise might become politicallytroublesome.
. .
Even though the nation-state is a comparatively modern invention-after 1500--the sentiments that make for nationhood are anything but modern.
Empires have always had to contend against the local particularisms of group, tribe, clan, city, and nation. It would appear to be a universal, and historically ancient, preference, for people to favor rule, and even * misrule, by "one (or some) of their own kind" to rule by foreigners.
Any nation that rules another nation in the absence of freely given consent (an unlikely condition) assumes a permanent insecurity burden. The price of (multinational) empire is high, and the essential dynamics of imperial expansion have been notably constant over the centuries. Presented here is but one thesis concerning the security perimeter of empires.
It is possible, and ;ndeed probable, that different theses have explanatory value concerning other empires.
The Russian/Soviet empire, like for example, the Roman, the British, and the Austro-Hungarian, has chosen to seek enhanced security through expansion. The motive, at root (though far from exclusively), has been defensive in character. The Romans invaded Britain not in quest of gold and glory, but rather to deny rebellious tribes in Gaul a sanctuary.
Similarly, Rome expanded to the Rhine and the Danube in a search for natural, defensible, frontiers, but found that the security of those river lines required a forward policy beyond them.

Great Britain waged three disastrous Afghan Wars (the third one immediately after World War 1) 6.
The Northwest frontier of India offers a near perfect example of how an empire, basically satisfied with its exant holdings, feels compelled to seek some measure of control beyond the existing fron-* tier in order to safeguard that which already is held.
Austria-Hungary, with its ethnic smorgasbord, offers potentially the most compelling, and alarming, analogy with the Soviet Union today.
Vienna and Budapest prior to 1914, confronting a domestic multinational time bomb, decided that their best strategy for coping with Slav separatism was to restrict the growth of Slav states on its borders. Instead, it is argued that there is a model, and really a historically dominant model, of imperial statecraft which is characterized by a largely defensive urge to expand--and that the Soviet Union (following Imperial Russia) behaves true to this particular tradition. Also, although it is contended here that the key to comprehending Soviet foreign policy should be sought in this dominant model of the imperial need to expand for essentially defensive security reasons, many other factors play their part in addition.
Naturally, the mix of motivating factors will differ from case to case and from time to time, nonetheless it is worth mentioning the following reasons for empire:
--Financial gain.
-- It would probably be an error to look for a general theory of empire and imperialism. One of the leading authorities on the idea of empire has offered the following cautionary words:
Politics and semantics make uneasy bedfellows, and anyway "Empire" has always appealed more to oratory than to analysis .... For what is imperialism anyway? It is the predictable expression of a will to power, which in rn is something that manifests itself in unpredictable ways.
One can find several compelling partial historical analogies to the situation and policies pursued by the Soviet Union as an imperial power.
However, the insecurity of empire--which is a general condition flowing from the inherent tension between local particularism and central imperial authority--is unusually acute in the Soviet case. In addition, the phenomenon of empire, with the necessary strength of that "will to power" cited by Professor Thornton, almost invariably excites suspicion and hostility abroad. The British Foreign Office in the 1830s (and well beyond) for example, could make little sense of the Russian drive into Central Asia and the trans-Caucasus region save in terms of a hypothesized Russian ambition eventually to exercise authority (imperium) over India and Persia.
Russia, it was believed (with good reason) in London, already had more territory than it could exploit, control, or people (colonize) effectively-what need had it to extend its dominion? Moreover, the Khanates of Central Asia posed no threat of significance to extant Russian "holdings"--so any defensive-security rationale was weak.
The Soviet Empire today is unusually insecure, in terms of historical imperial phenomena, because the authority of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) is fragile even in its core (Great Russia) domestic area. Whereas many groups of imperial statesmen, historically, have feared, appropriately enough, that trouble on the frontier could easily spread, and that their individual political fortunes required at least the appearance of policy success, it is a little unusual for the character of the state itself to be potentially at risk in every crisis on the marches: which bore no necessary relationship to the interests of their subjects (which is not to deny that the passion for order evidenced by all Muscovite Grand Princes, Czars and Soviet leaders benefited the populace as well as the courtiers who were its immediate beneficiaries). Raison d'etat, in practice, reached (and reaches) heights of patrimonial hubris undreamed of even by Louis XIV. Russians, and other peoples within the Russian or Soviet Empire, have acquiesced in imperial rule fundamentally because of their awe of the power of the state and because of their perennial fear of chaos. Russians fear disorder almost to a pathological degree, accept the need for firm government, and respect a leadership that demonstrates an inflexible will to power.
The legitimacy of the Czars rested on two essential pillars, a Mandate of Heaven endorsed by the Orthodox Church, and--as noted above--respect for the power of the state. The Czar was held to be God's representative.
To the Emperor of all the Russias belongs the supreme and unlimited power. Notably fear, but also conscience commanded by God Himself, is the basis of obedience to this power. (Article I of the Fundamental Laws of Imperial Russia)
With regard to the awe in which Russian subjects held the power of the state, and on the character of the connection between ruler and ruled, it is worth quoting these observations by Edward Crankshaw:
The Russian autocracy in its most positive manifestations has always been so spectacular in its absolutism that it has cWpelled the myth of omnipotence with almost hypnotic force.'
The obedience of the Russian people was.... negative, or passive, obedience. It was an abdication of responsibility. In only the most limited sense could the Russian autocrats command: except in moments of extreme national peril they could only repress .... The central government of Russia with its tightly . organized provincial apparatus extending over unimaginable distances was, insofar as it affected the governed, less the administrative nexus of a unified nation than the colonial service of an occupying power, having no organic connection with the subject people.... One person and one person alone, in the eyes of the subject people, stood above the detested government and was at the same time its victim; and he, whose supreme office did indeed reflect the people's need, was the very man who believed that he was the government: the Tsar.

The actual practice of Grand Princely, Czarist, and--save for most of the truly exceptional Stalinist era--Soviet power has tended more to the oligarchical than to the individual-absolutist. There is reason to believe that the mysticism of the Orthodox Church, and Great Russian nationalism (or chauvinism), go far deeper than do any of the doctrines taught officially since 1917.

In short, even the heart of the Soviet empire contains potentially politically combustible material. The British could divest themselves of empire, sometimes even in humiliating circumstances, without political revolution occurring at home. However fairly, or otherwise, Britain treated the inhabitants of its imperial holdings, there was always a contractual nexus binding British government and British people. Defeat abroad was not seen by British radicals as clear evidence that "they"--the authorities--

could hardly be more stark. --
An Eastern European glacis with enormous potential for the promotion of (domestic) instability, yet from which Moscow believes it cannot afford to be seen to retreat.
The Soviet Union is rigid on territorial issues (as vis a vis China)
because it believes that it dare not appear to show weakness--for fear of who might be tempted next to test Moscow's will. Similarly, the Soviet Union is rigid on the essentials of political control--though the local form may vary--in Eastern Europe for fear of the risk of domestic contagion.
It is not suggested here that the Soviet government lacks domestic support--Soviet subjects, like people everywhere, take a natural pride in the success of their country. Also, it is not suggested that the Soviet empire is a house of cards likely to collapse at the first push, or setback.
There is a ruthless will to power about Soviet leaders which warrants, and receives, respect. Whether or not they were convinced that they could win a nuclear war, it is safe to assume that Soviet leaders would take any military risk if they could discern no alternative path to save their patrimony (albeit at the risk of having to absorb a catastrophic level of damage).
Soviet foreign policy behavior may be explained near-totally with reference to the dynamics of insecure empire. This author, suspicious of mono-causal explanations, elects not to do so. However, he does believe that such a theory would not lead the student too far astray. "The dynamics of insecure empire" thesis holds that power centers independent of Moscow must be defined as a threat.
In particular, the empire in Eastern Europe can never really be secure so long as Western Europe is free to attract, propagandize (however inoffensive the motive), and provide a peninsular beachhead for American power and influence. The Soviet Union certainly does not want to fight a war in Europe, but it does need--to be much more secure--at least to neutralize currently non-Soviet controlled Europe as a generic threat to the extant empire. Beyond Europe, the U.S.S.R., to be secure in Eurasia, needs to deny the United States access (of all kinds) and to isolate her in the Western hemisphere. Such an accomplishment would change dramatically the terms of the long-range Soviet-American competition to the Soviet advantage.
The theory of the ever-expanding empire is very similar to the geopolitical explanations of Soviet behavior that I have advanced elsewhere.

The conclusions and implications of this section are disturbing be- Sixth, in essence, the legitimacy of the Soviet state reposes in the awe in which its power, its will to succeed, is held by its subjects.
A military or political defeat on the frontiers of the empire could shake the world view of many formerly acquiescent subjects who simply could not envisage the possibility of Soviet defeat. A healthy political system can survive the shock of foreign defeat--although it may choose to punish the current office-holders. Soviet state ideology is an ideology of longterm success, of inevitable victory in the Historic Mission of spreading 143 socialism worldwide. Defeats for Soviet arms and/or diplomacy strike both at the credibility of the omnipotence of the state, and at the robustness of the myth that the CPSU rules by right of being the correct interpreter of the authoritative doctrine. Finally, given the very obvious insecurity of its extant, multi-layer imperium, the U.S.S.R. discerns no option other than to seek to expand its control of the outside world.
Geopolitcs/realpolitik, ideology, Great Russian national hubris, and the 78 dynamics of empire, all impel the U.S.S.R. on an expansive foreign policy.
The image of the Soviet Union as an insecure empire bent upon achieving the impossible dream of total security will be unwelcome to many readers.
From the left this author no doubt will be accused of inventing a permanent Soviet military danger--flowing directly from the very structure of the Soviet imperial polity. From the right this author no doubt will be accused of inventing an essentially defensive rationale for the Soviet propensity to aggress. To return to a theme introduced en passant several times already in this chapter, this author is not convinced that there is a single "essential" drive behind Soviet foreign policy, in support of which Soviet strategic nuclear posture and strategy is designed (or mal-designed--allowing for error). However, the insecure empire proposition advanced above, for all its simplicity (or desirable parsimony--from the point of view of elegant theory design), seems to offer little prospect of misleading the reader, while it fits the historical facts persuasively.
In short, there may be a superior proposition waiting to be discovered, but this 144
one is judged by this author to be good enough for his limited purposes in this study. It is against the background of appreciation of Soviet imperial statecraft that American defense planners should design their conflict scenarios for the 1980s and 1990s.
If World War III should occur in this period, it will most likely not occur because adventurous Soviet leaders are willing to leap through a perceived "window of opportunity" in pursuit of gains, nor because mechanistic technical instabili'ties in the strategic balance produce a condition characterized by "the reciprocal fear of surprise attack"

The detailed strategic implications of differences in the national styles of the superpowers are presented below, in Chapters 4-8. By way of scene-setting for those detailed discussions, the following paragraphs comprise some terse pointers to the impact of Soviet national style on Soviet nuclear posture and strategy.
First, Soviet state ideology, married malignly to Soviet historical memories, identifies certain foreign powers as enemies, by definition.
Limited tactical acconmmodation, as in SALT, is always possible, but there can be no fundamental and lasting accommodation of interests. War with these enemies is an ever-present possibility. Second, as the student of some very painful historical lessons, and as the principal banner-carrier for the Historic Mission of spreading socialism worldwide, Soviet leaders know that there is no adequate substitute for victory in war. Third, in the Soviet view, wars of all kinds can be won (or lost). The prevention of war is the duty of politicians; the duty of soldiers is to prepare .
for the efficient conduct of war. Fortunately, deterrence and defense are believed to be fully compatible.
Fourth, it is the Soviet belief that war, of any kind, should be a survivable experience. Damage limitation is a non-negotiable concept.
For temporary tactical reasons a Soviet leadership may sign on for an arms control regime which appears to limit Soviet freedom of national 
Otherwise excellent scholarly studies not infrequently forget that the Soviet Union (for example) is real, while political science is an invention which as often as not--to be generous--comes between the author and his subject. This is the case with Seweryn 2. It is fairly commonplace to assert a need to understand Soviet attitudes and opinions on their own terms. Somewhat less commonplace is the scarcely less valid assertion that there is a need for American understanding of the attitudes and opinions that Soviet policy-makers believe Americans to hold (rightly or wrongly).
3. This is a very sweeping judgment. Consideration of space and focus preclude extensive defense. Indeed, in very general terms--as in the text--the judgment is well-nigh an obvious truth. 4. This is analogous to the scholar who notes in an introduction to a book that there are many ways of examining his subject matter and then, having paid brief formal obeisance to theoretical ecumenicalism, proceeds for the entire length of the book to employ only his own preferred theory--without explaining why his theory should be preferred.
Democracy, unfortunately, is a concept that is not patented: perversions abound --as in "People's Democracy" or "democratic centralism." Perspectives on the Arms Race (New York: Praeger, 1972), Cfapter 3. 
No sooner had we successfully come through several decades of enormous theoretical progress than the world which we began to comprehend manifested unmistakable signs of profound change, rendering our hard-won theoretical sophistication increasingly obsolete...In short, nothing seems to fit. 
Although a great measure of flexibility in military execution may have apparent political merit to (rightly) terrified statesmen, the military arguments for "going large" rather than "going small" are likely to be very pressing. Strategic forces that are deliberately witheld in time of war are liable to destruction, their C 3 1 will be a very high priority target set, and--in general--it may be next to impossible to execute a series of strikes in an efficient manner in accordance with anything that resembles a war plan if one suffers a lot of pre-launch damage.

Stalin's reign of terror was historically unusual because of its arbitrariness. In most totalitarian, or aspiring-totalitarian, countries, people can play reasonably safe by giving to Caesar that which Caesar demands (provided one is not unfortunate enough to be inherently guilty by some ethnic accident)--the qualification, "reasonably," is needed, because any system neglectful of "due process" lends itself to personal exploitation (by individuals eager secretly to denounce personal enemies and rivals). In Stalin's day, innocence provided no assurance whatsoever of personal safety. A serious intellectual (or policy) historical survey of the concept of deterrence, and its parasitic doctrines, would be of interest, but is not the purpose of this chapter. I have traced Western, largely American, thinking on deterrence in considerable detail elsewhere,

Deterrence is not a controversial concept--everyone is for it, just or targeting strategy, is a subject that rarely sullies university lecture halls wherein deterrence theory is presented and discussed (and those are none too numerous). Students introduced to the mysteries of deterrence theory all too rarely are told that the language of policy-makers may find only a pale reflection in the war-plan design actions of the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS) in Omaha.

The actions in question, with regard to nuclear forces, to date have been confined to exercises.
The language of deterrence policy is formulated and reformulated with predictable regularity as administrations come and go in Washington, and the choice of words can indeed be important. However, the reality of American SlOP planning, in the past, often has diverged noticeably from contemporary fashion in official declaratory deterrence policy.

The Soviet Union is unlikely to be impressed by a strategy which lacks the necessary means of implementation. Some "new" strategies might be effected by existing forces and command and control arrangements, but not all (and certainly not this one).
--
The "new strategy," if it really does call, inter alia, for the ability to take out Soviet (very) hard military and political targets requires, to be credible, American strategic forces with the appropriate survivability, warhead yields, and accuracy. The United States, today and for most of the 1980s, is not and will not be able to strike effectively at the complex of Soviet deep-underground political command bunkers, or at most Soviet missile silos and nuclear-weapon storage sites. This is an easily demonstr-
able fact, it is not a matter of opinion.
--
The "new strategy" is not really new at all. The United States has always targeted Soviet military forces and has long planned to attempt to strike at key political targets. 17 "Cities," per se, have not been targeted for very many years.
Indeed, even in the years when the official rhetoric in praise of mutual assured destruction was fairly undiluted by "war-fighting" considerations (say, during 1967-69), actual force allocation in SlOP planning was weighted overwhelmingly towards counter-military targeting. 
18
Aside from the facts that even in 1970 a President did have a range (though admittedly a small range) of pre-planned SIOP-level strike options, and that special-purpose strike options could always be designed rapidly,  [tlhe primary purpose of the Assured Destruction capabilities doctrine was to provide a metric for deciding how much force was enough: it provided a basis for denying service and Congressional claims for more money for strategic forces. It also served the purpose of dramatizing for the Congress and the public the awful consequences of large-scale nuclear war and its inappropriateness as an instrument of policy. (However, it was never proposed by McNamara or his staff that nuclear weapon .actually be used in this way.) (Emphasis in the original.)
The worth of these excuses admitted, the facts remain that McNamara: chose not to fight the Joint Chiefs of Staff on SlOP design--he did not press for changes which stressed flexibility and selectivity; he accepted the increasing invulnerability of Soviet strategic forces as a desirable fact of life--he did not press research and development programs intended to offset at least some of the survivability features of new Soviet programs; and finally, he blessed the evolving technological trend with the concept of mutual assured destruction--which was really the idea of an apolitical bookkeeper or engineer, not of a strategist. 
2
Unfortunately, he had a powerful bookkeeper's, managerial, mind--he did 28 not have the mind of a strategist.
On the evidence available, which includes his policies (declarations and programs) in the strategic-nuclear area, and the American conduct of the most crucial years of the Vietnam War, McNamara simply did not understand that a defense establishment has to be ready to fight wars; that if wars are not won they tend to be lost;
and that general expectations of military success are beneficial for deterrence. This, perhaps, is becoming unduly personalized. But, the fact remains that Robert McNamara: set a tone of defense management, rather than strategic leadership; 
29
Office virtually required the services to follow analytical suit and confuse systems analysis with strategy; 3 0 presided, apparently contentedly, over the evolution of the central nuclear balance from a condition of very healthy clear American superiority to near parity; and when tested as a strategist in a real war (i.e., in Vietnam), failed lamentably. McNamara was an outstandingly worthy, and competent, example of the American way in peacetime defense thinking.
Although American strategic forces were targeted, throughout the 1960s, overwhelmingly against Soviet military targets, the essence of official United States' deterrence thinking was that strategic stability (and peace--insofar as peace was believed to be forwarded by strategic stability) flowed from a situation where neither superpower could protect its essential domestic assets. By implication, this meant that neither superpower should be able to threaten the pre-launch or penetration-survivability of a major fraction of the strategic forces of the other.
Almost needless to say, this was (and remains) a theory of stalemate, or of paralysis in American statecraft. 
3 3
Unfortunately, the kind of diplomatic leverage that should have flowed as a consequence of strategic superiority was diluted by the early American attraction to the idea of mutual deterrence. American policy-makers, even in the Eisenhower years, did not think in operational terms about In terms of the "objective facts" of the strategic nuclear-weapon balance (the most important element in "the correlation of forces"), the United States should have enjoyed virtually a free hand in the 1950s.
The critics of "rollback" in the 1952 elections were wrong, as were the critics of John Foster Fulles' carefully hedged theory of "a capacity for massive retaliation" in January 1954.

First, it may be argued that it is rational for the United States state is so fearsome a prospect that the credibility of its execution probably need only be very modest indeed. One may argue that the credibility of American execution of such a threat lies in the "fog of crisis," or-should the conflict proceed that far--in the "fog of war" itself. As
Clausewitz affirmed, there is a degree of "friction" in war, and "[its [war's] grammar, indeed, may be its own, 
'
58
Moreover, the military dynamics of thermonuclear war may, in practice, kescape careful central political supervision. Deterrence may succeed as a consequence of the uncertainty of victory, as well as of the certainty of defeat.
Third, and finally, one may seek to argue that through a (reciprocated) flexibility and selectivity in nuclear execution, intrawar deterrence may function in a central war so as to interdict the slide to mutual holocaust. 
5 9
Indeed, on this logic, it would be reasonable to argue that it is the clear, and increasingly present, perceived danger of the ultimate threat of holocaust that would provide the major incentive for both sides to find, in real-time, some prominent solution for their common need to settle upon 60 a basis for prompt war termination.
-1 to the present day the United States, intermittently and with various degrees of high-level policy persistence, has sought to diversify the range of threats posed in its SlOP to the Soviet Union, but at the end of the threat corridor lies, and has always lain, the specter of society-wide destruction.
Even as recently as January 1980, when he was fully conversant with the details of the strategic nuclear targeting review (the "Sloss Report"), Harold Brown went on very public record as follows:
...we need, first of all, a survivable and enduring retaliatory capability to devastate the industry and cities of the Soviet Union.
Dr. Brown proceeded to stress the limited policy relevance of such a threat, but as the words quoted make clear, he did see a massive countervalue threat as being the "bottom line" of the range of American strategic threats. Indeed, Dr. Brown asserted that What has come to be known as assured destruction is the bedrock of nuclear ggterrence, and we will retain such a capacity in the future.
What has happened over the past decade is that the United States' defense community has come more than half-way, particularly at the rhetorical, declaratory level of policy, towards adopting the logic of a warfighting strategy, but--for good or ill--major elements of an alternative stream of logic persist. It is possible that strategists with the views on deterrence theory held, for example, by this author, may have discerned more warfighting logic in recent official prose than in fact was present in the minds of the official authors. Although official deterrent reasoning has made an honest woman of countermilitary, and even hard-target counterforce, targeting, and although it is officially fashionable today to talk of victory-, or success-, denial as comprising the heart of the American deterrent requirement, the element of deterrence through the threat of punishment endures.

Much of the recently revived academic theorizing about deterrence has failed, signally, to understand the variegated character of the problem.

nonsense which hid 'war' behind a phrase like 'violent bargaining.
Official American prose of recent years has recognized that for deterrence to succeed enemies must be convinced that ...they would be frustrated in their effort to achieve their objective or suffer so much damage that they would gain nothing by their action.-' (Emphasis added.)
The second alternative reflects a continuing confusion. American officials and many extra-official theorists, not without some ambivalence, continue to view the probable dynamics of nuclear war as a very painful exercise in "violent bargaining"--really as a psychological process wherein the side most willing, or apparently most willing, to bear pain should
win. This is a reasonable vision of conflict save only, alas, that it is noticeably at odds with what the available evidence suggests to be the dominant Soviet view of nuclear conflict. It is not obvious that the Soviet Union can be, or ever has been, deterred by the prospect, even the very credible prospect, of suffering pain. Where the anticipation of pain may be effective as a deterrent almost certainly has been, and is, when pain and military and political effectiveness were believed to be synonymous. Let it be noted, this is not to argue that Soviet leaders are indifferent to the prospect of societal punishment--many aspects of their civil defense program attest to a (substantialy instrumental) concern for the fate of their general public. as overemphasizing negative, at the expense of positive, sanctions;

Jervis addressing the subject of aethnocentrism and status quo biases," 75 albeit very briefly.
With reference to the needs of American policy-makers, for the improvement of the American theory of deterrence with a view to its incorporation in policy, five questions stand out as being in need of particularly urgent attention. First, what do Soviet leaders find deterring? Second, should deterrence "fail," what employment policy would it be in the American interest actually to execute? Third, when is deterrence policy relevant?
Fourth, how should nuclear-weapon employment policy enhance deterrence?
Fifth, what is the relationship between the American ability (or perceived ability) to limit damage at home and the credibility and efficacy of deterrence threats?
It should never be forgotten that the credibility and the efficacy of a threat may not, indeed need not, be synonymous. The Soviet Politburo may believe an American President who issues a threat, but it may judge that threat to be unsufficiently fearsome. Credibility is important but it is not all-important.
Before turning to the provision of detailed answers to the five questions posed above, several points of logical and factual reference need to be registered. First, I do not believe that the United States Government should be satisfied with its nuclear-weapon policy unless that policy is guided by, and reflects, a theory of victory. 
76
In terms of deterrence logic, the recent public emphasis placed by serious American officials upon countermilitary and counter-political control targeting is as flawed as were its declaratory predecessors. It, and they, betray the absence of strategic thinking and the absence of a campaign analysis of nuclear conflict. This is not to criticize the content of the new emphases in targeting, though those emphases may fairly be criticized, 
7 7
Second, and in partial explanation of the reasoning behind the first point, official strategic thinking in the United States would appear to have been, and to continue to be, remarkably casual over the vital question of which side will be the deterrer and which the deterree. I am The logic chain developed immediately above is fatal (theoretically)
to extant official American policy reasoning, but it does contain also a major possible flaw which is destructive vis a vis virtually all schools of Western intra-war deterrence theory. To be specific, Western theorists of all shades of doctrinal persuasion appear to have been captured by the metaphor of the escalation ladder. 
79
If a Soviet Politburo approaches a Soviet-American central war as a war and not as a violent bargaining game, then Western theories of controlled escalation and intra-war deterrence are most unlikely to be applicable. Third, and finally, it is worth recalling that deterrence was the first, and most important, of the three major pillars of contemporary Western strategic theory--the other two were limited war and arms control h o y 81 theory.
Limited war theory, insofar as it was reflected in American conduct in Vietnam, we know now to have been fatally flawed in conception (as well as in execution). 82 Arms control theory we know, courtesy--in particular--of ten years of rather intensive SALT experience, to have been very substantially misconceived.

American terms. We are all prisoners of our political-strategic culture.
In revising its nuclear deterrence theory, the United States has to be vigilant in self-criticism in assessing the answers provided to the most vital question, "what do Soviet leaders find deterring?" American officials and theorists need constantly to be mindful of the facts that strategic nuclear weapons comprise only one, albeit the single most important, element in "the correlation of forces" as appraised in Moscow, and that the full force of nuclear deterrent effect is likely to be needed, diplomatically, only once in thirty, forty, or fifty years. As my colleague, Herman Kahn, likes to argue, our problems of nuclear weapon policy design are analogous to the problems of planning to survive a major earthquake. We know that a major earthquake is very likely, or even certain, once in, say, forty or fifty years, but we do not know when. This means that we have to be prepared, constantly, for an event which is exceedingly unlikely on a day-to-day basis. 
8 5
This chapter, and indeed this study taken as a whole, does not assume that nuclear deterrence design, if properly conceived, will always work.
Indeed, it is only prudent to consider the possibility there may occur a political context for which there is no "proper conception" of nuclear deterrence. 
8 6
-on the one night in forty or fifty years when they were desperately needed.
In principle, there should be a scale of plausible threats which would deter even the most desperate and determined Soviet leaders from seeking military solutions to political problems. But, in practice, for reasons of cultural blindness, war-planning rigidity, the "fog of crisis," or plain incompetence, a situation could arise wherein a Soviet leadership group effectively would be beyond deterrent influence by an American Government.
Careful to calculate just how much political-control damage would 91 be inflicted by particular strikes.
--has well short of perfect information on the quantity and quality of Soviet internal communications, and on the vulnerabilities of those communications.
--by executing a truly major counter-control strike probably would leave the surviving Soviet government believing that it had little or nothing left to lose. In short, actual execution of an "ultimate threat" would free Soviet hands from any consideration of intra-war deterrent effect.
-o.
--might want to negotiate war-termination with a Soviet government--and that could be exceedingly difficult if the United States has just sent 1,000 or more nuclear warheads in seach of the Soviet political control structure.
It is difficult to deny the logic in the position which holds that should Soviet military power be defeated, or even just stalemated, the entire Soviet political control structure might come unravelled. To a large, though uncertain, degree, Soviet authority rests upon the respect felt by subject nationalities for Soviet power.
If Soviet military power is seen to be defeated, the awe in which Moscow is held must diminish.
Next, following directly from the above discussion of the deterrent threats most likely to induce fear in Soviet official minds, United States' nuclear-weapon employment policy should be directed in the first instance to the defeat of Soviet military power-projection and strategic nuclear forces. Second, United States' nuclear-weapon employment policy should be directed both to the destruction of the (over-) centralized apparat "* of the Soviet state, and--in the course of a central war which may be protracted (up to six months, perhaps)--to the destruction of the entire Soviet state-system at all levels. This is a case where the best is likely to be the enemy of the good enough. The United States cannnot threaten, plausibly, to hit every target essential to the functioning of the Soviet state. But, the United States can threaten, plausibly, to do very great damage to the command network that is the Soviet state. It should not be forgotten that just as American officials cannot be certain that fatal damage would be inflicted on the central Soviet control apparat, so Soviet officials cannot be certain that fatal damage would not be inflicted.
At the very least we can assert, with high confidence, that this is the kind of threat which Soviet officials would be most unlikely to take lightly. 9 2
Third, when is deterrence policy relevant? In eyeball-to-eyeball war-threshold terms, probably only once in thirty, forty, or fifty years.
But, as best may be judged, the Soviet Union does not see its strategic posture as an instrument for the direct coercion of the United States sensibly be designed solely to deter a Soviet assault against the American homeland. 9 
3
Largely for cultural reasons, the United States' defense community has tended to see overwhelming value in a strategic nuclear posture clearly compatible with a somewhat narrow and American-centric (and distinctly un-Soviet) interpretation of stability h--criteria for strategic-force adequacy have tended to relate to putative day-to-day needs, and to presumed crisis--time needs that reflect, unintelligently, the lessons learned in the nuclear age thus far. To date, the quality of American strategic nuclear deterrence policy probably has not been tested. The fact that there has been no general war in Europe, and no central nuclear war, does not necessarily attest to the massive stability of the strategic balance; 
9 5
policy has yet to be tested.
A close reading of Soviet history suggests that American policymakers should consider the strong probability that the Soviet Union is fairly easy to deter up to a certain point, beyond which she may be almost impossible to deter. In other words, there may well not be a broad region wherein deterrence policy, in varying intensity, can function.
Because of their antipathy to risk-taking, really to anything that might be characterized as adventurism, Soviet leaders probably do not need deterring in the terms most familiar in Western strategic discourse. victory?" The second question will be, "will the United States seek to deny us victory, given the strategic nuclear deterrence relationship?"
Finally, embracing questions four and five specified at the end of the previous section of this chapter, "how should nuclear-weapon employment policy enhance deterrence?"--and "what is the relationship between the U.S. ability to limit damage at home and the credibility and efficacy of deterrent threat?" There is much to recommend the view that deterrent effect flows from Soviet perceptions of United States' acquisition and declaratory policies, rather than from weapon employment policy. Assuming the United States and of NATO is to deny victory to Soviet arms (i.e., it is to defend Western society).
If the Soviet Union can win a war militarily, it will very likely be able to pick up the somewhat radioactive pieces at home. Moreover, Americans should be more interested in avoiding defeat than they would be in defeating the U.S.S.R.--let alone in posing extremely severe problems of postwar recovery for the enemy. 
96
given the very probable political disintegration that this would promote at home, could, and should, mean victory for the West.
Whether victory for the West is attainable, and--more to the point, given the deterrence focus of this chapter--whether the pre-(and perhaps intra) war beneficial deterrent effect of Soviet anticipation of such a conflict outcome is attainable, has to rest critically upon the ability of Western countries to limit damage to their homelands. Union offset American damage-limitation endeavors with relative ease? These are serious questions indeed. But, the strategic value, really necessity, of a major ability to limit damage is also serious--and should not be ignored simply because it would be very difficult, and probably very expensive to effect. The defense programmatic issues pertinent to damage limitation are treated in Chapters 8-9. Here, in this chapter, the author confines himself to strategic and political logic.
A defense community which fails to recognize the relevance of damage limitation for the quality of its deterrence policy is a defense community which is failing to think strategically. Because of the extended-deterrent duties placed upon United States' strategic forces, nuclear-weapon policy, fn the last resort, has to be about freedom of action (not, as in the Soviet case, by and large, about "holding the ring square"--checking the strategic nuclear posture of the adversary).
If he cannot hold damage to the American homeland down to the level of a survivable catastrophe, an American President could not, responsibly, initiate a process of escalation into the realm of central nuclear war. In other words, the United States, prudently, would have to acquiesce in defeat in the theater.
Unfortunately, this problem cannot be finessed cleverly by an attempt to slice it into many parts. More or less elaborate schemes for targeting flexibility and restraint do not address the point that, at every potential threshold, it would most likely be the United States who would have to contemplate the probable consequences of its next escalatory move.
In practice, I have grave doubts about the realism in Western escalation thinking, the idea that a nuclear war might (or should) comprise a series that that may be a change in targeting emphasis--which could have profound effects upon the details of force allocation.
The overwhelming problem in those years was that the U.S. was devoting more and more weapons in expectation of diminishing results--as Soviet strategic forces were hardened in silos or dispersed to sea in the Yankee-class SSBNs.
In military perspective, it is neater, more manageable, to have virtually a single pre-canned war planned which one executes promptly when so ordered. It is profoundly complicating to have to plan to withhold many of one's more competent force elements, to be prepared to effect major re-targeting design in response to superior political orders in the course of a war, and to prepare attacks that are constrained 
However, to be fair, the greater failure was that of the U.S. armed services who neglected to approach Vietnam as though it were a real war.  Nonetheless, the U.S. Government could profit from a major renewal of interest in how nuclear war might be terminated.

If there had never been a truly major earthquake, serious planning probably would not take place--regardless of the scientific prediction of expert seismologists.
Fred Ikle's important question, "Can Nuclear Deterrence Last Out the Century?" may thus be inadequately pessimistic in its implications.
87. Speech at the U.S. Naval War College, Newport, R.I., p.6. As the United States force posture has evolved over the past 15 years, the idea of stability has emerged as the central strategic objective, and the asserted conceptual consensus seems to be organized around the objective.
The following concerns underlie this chapter: that the particular theories of stability most widely held in the West may be gravely deficient;
and that the integrity of the concept of strategic stability itself may be questionable. Discussion of stability and its possible requirements is really a discussion of deterrence theory which in reality is a debate about the operational merits of different postures and doctrines. There can be no useful, objective, doctrine-neutral, exploration of the idea of stability. The discussion which follows makes no pretense of neutrality; instead it endeavors first to explain the roots, meaning, and deficiencies, of the still dominant theories of stability, and second to suggest a theory that has much greater internal and external integrity.
It is very important to recognize that for all its popularity, there is no useful consensus upon the meaning of the idea of stability. Most commentators, and certainly the U.S. Government (and NATO) writ large, acknowledge the value in the twin concepts of arms race stability and crisis stability. Arms race stability is understood to be a condition wherein neither party to an arms competition is motivated strongly to press military developments or deployments in quest of major advantage-because such advantage is judged to be unattainable (however desirable).
Crisis stability is understood to be a quality of strategic relations wherein, during periods of acute crisis, instruments of war (mechanical, electronic, organizational) should not be the immediate cause of war.
These concepts, at this level of generality, have been widely understood and approved (in the West) since at least 1960.2 However, consensus breaks down over the particular policy implications. From an operational perspective, how is arms race stability to be achieved and maintained?--how is crisis stability enforced?--in both cases vis a vis a distinctively Soviet adversary.
This quest is after a theory of stability that should work "well enough" given the full dimensions of Western strategic security problems in the context of the military consequences of the unique "cultural thoughtways" 3 of a particular major adversary. As a working hypothesis, I contend that the ideas of arms race and crisis stability, and the theory of deterrence to which they most usually make (often implicit) reference, have (mis) led Western policy makers into neglecting the operational dimensions of strategy--indeed, many politicians, officials, and analysts seem to believe that nuclear strategy cannot really have any operational dimensions.
An adequate theory of deterrence must encompass, really as its first priority, a determination of military (and relevant civilian) requirements in war itself. Extant, still-dominant deterrence theory--as the leitmotiv for Western strategic preparation--is fully consistent with a strategic force posture that is incredible as a threat because it would not be intelligently usable in practice. It is essential to recognize, as argued throughout this study, that the Western ideas on stability, and the relevant Soviet approach to the determination of the principles that should guide defense preparation and war planning, have deep cultural roots--they are not accidents of history.
For much of this chapter, as the context makes clear, "stable deterrence theory" refers to the proposition that stability, in arms competition and in time of crisis, is maximized when both sides are unambiguously vulnerable at home, and when each side is confident that a large number of its strategic offensive weapons are invulnerable prior to launch and during mission execution. 
4
By way of providing an initial point of doctrinal reference for this chapter, it is my view that the strategic balance would be stable were it to permit Western governments to enjoy not-implausible prospects of both defeating their enemy (on his own terms) and of ensuring Western planning, is already American policy with respect to the requirement 5 for the defeat of the enemy, and is not incompatible with the more familiar connotation of (arms race and crisis) stability. The bedrock of this definition is the proposition that forces which do not lend themselves
to politically intelligent employment in war are unlikely to suffice to "" deter--at least in those very rare moments when an adversary may be motivated to seek a military solution to his problems.

The U.S. defense community, with very few exceptions, decided that a stable military balance should mean a safer world; should mean a safer world at less cost in resources expended upon defense than would be the case with an unstable military balance; should be compatible with the support of U.S. foreign policy interests (though it is unclear that very careful analysis was performed on this subject); and should eventually find favor with the U.S.S.R. both for reason of its technological inevitability, and for reason of its near self-evident desirability. In a book which probably merits description as the fullest and most mature statement of 1960s-style stability (through mutual vulnerability) theory, Jerome
A mutual stability approach, in the broadest sense, rests on the premise that the United States is benefited if the Soviet Union maintains a strategic deterrent capability comparable in overall strength to our own; it is an acceptance of both t e mutual assured destruction relationship and numerical parity.
A little earlier Kahan had written that if, then, the U.S.S.R.'s strategic doctrine is largely understandable and somewhat comparable to ours, it is possible to in American perspective, would be a balance wherein each side's military forces looked roughly comparable, and wherein neither side would believe that it could register a significant military advantage by striking first because neither side would be able to protect its domestic assets against retaliation. This set of stability elements derived initially, in good part, from discouraging analyses of the future promise of damage-limiting strategies. Military-technological prediction--that future societal vulnerability will be a fact, not a matter for choice--was transformed into normative terms. Far from being a problem, mutual vulnerability was seen instead as an opportunity to establish more stable Soviet-American strategic relations. The Soviet Union might prefer to compete for "useful advantage" so long as that was believed to be attainable, but technology, surely, has a logic which the Soviets must and will respect. In a 1970 * publication, Roman Kolkowicz expressed the then popular, and perhaps even plausible, view that Soviet strategic doctrine and capabilities appear to have lagged behind those of the United States by about five years .... ,modern defense technology determines to a large exent the kind of strategic doctrines and policies that will be adopted by the superpowers. Thus, technology seems to have a leveling effect which subsumes PoliticalIt ideological and social differences in various political systems.
The convergence of strategic ideas hoped for in the late 1960s and early 1970s, in reality meaning a Soviet convergence with the American concept of a stable military balance, did not occur. By 1981 most American * commnentators on Soviet-American strategic policy issues accepted as a very probable fact the existence of a "conceptual gap" between Soviet * and American thinking on strategic issues which appeared to be enduring because each side's thought was rooted in what has come to be termed strategic. culture. 
12
Today, the U.S. defense community has to grapple with the implications of the hypothesis that Soviet military ideas and activities are deeply rooted in local soil, and hence are very likely to endure; that the Soviet General Staff is extremely well acquainted with Western ideas on stability--Soviet military thinking is not crude and "uneducated"; and that there are no important apparent strains between the policy preferences of the Soviet military and the Soviet political leadership. 
13
15
Soviet thought on the military dimensions of statecraft, what loosely can be called "strategic theory," is distinguished by its rarity.1 
6
17
Despite the accumulating evidence on Russian/Soviet strategic culture and the implications of that culture for military-program momentum, Western commentators continue to deny, implicitly, that stability is a condition describing a military-political relationship. The question of what kind of damage a Soviet leadership would most likely judge to be unacceptable has been posed, and even answered, of recent yearsl8--with conclusions that cast grave doubts on the merits of the society destruction bedrock of the theory which identifies stability .
with mutual vulnerability--but the covering of the urban-industrial target set still is accorded importance, and even pride of place, in official 19 American stable deterrence prose.
It may be the case that this society punishment oriented theory can provide a robust basis for a stable military balance, even in the context of an adversary relationship with an alien Soviet strategic culture.
It is possible that the Soviet military (and political) establishment is seeking the unattainable in its evident pursuit of a war-waging/warwinning capability, and that the United States would be ill-advised to compete very vigorously with military programs designed to improve warwaging performance. However, now that it is generally recognized that the Soviet military effort marches to the beat of a distinctly non-American of the very large counter-society strike. What beliefs, attitudes and perspectives are reflected in this simple theory?
It reflects a belief that nuclear war would mean the end of history.
The assumed certainty of unrestrained escalation and mutual destruction leads easily to the conclusion that there can be no intelligent way of preparing for, or waging, nuclear war. 
2 3
But, American foreign policy, in its potential need for military support, rests heavily on nuclear threats. However, no operational nuclear strategy is compatible with American societal values. An important reason why American strategic commentators have focused so heavily upon deterrence, as opposed to military operational questions, is because they have realized that American society is profoundly unwilling to contemplate, or debate coolly, the prospect of losing tens of millions of people.
For the better part of two decades, the United States has been highly dependent upon latent nuclear threat, but American society, and even the a nuclear war. Michael Howard was close to the mark when he wrote as follows:
But such credibility [f nuclear response] depends nt. simply on a perceived balance, or imbalance, of weapons systems, but on perceptions of the nature of the society whose leaders are threatening such retaliation. Peoples who are not prepared to make the effort necessary for operational defense are even less likely to support a decision to initiate a nuclear exchange from which they will themselves suffer almost inconceivable destruction, even if that de i 4sion is taken at the lowest possible level of nuclear escalation. Also, stable balance theory reflects a conviction that an enduring East-West political modus vivendi is possible--if only for the reason that nuclear arsenals mean that neither superpower dares intrude into regions well understood to be of vital interest to the other. The relationship between intense arms competition, and its associated first-strike alarms, and political tension remains ill understood, but a plateau of stable deterrence resting upon total societal vulnerability and sufficient weapon invulnerability should--so the argument goes--calm many of the anxieties that the arms competition can foster.
The more reasonable supporters of SALT I tended to avoid asserting that the Soviet political leadership and General Staff had been educated into accepting American-style stable deterrence thinking. Instead, they assumed that American strategic vigilance would deny the U.S.S.R. any militarily meaningful future advantage, and that Soviet leaders would rein in their programs in anticipation of the futility of a bid for superiority.
In addition, it was assumed widely that the five-year "Interim
Agreement" on strategic offensive arms would be superceded by a permanent treaty regime which would greatly assist stability through the survivability it would provide for offensive forces, and the predictability it would provide for for defense planning. 
25
In short, stable balance theory was believed to reflect inescapable technological truths;2 
6
Stable deterrence theory indicated, quantitatively, "how much is enough." 
27
Stable deterrence, with its logical implication of a finite need for weapons, appeals to the Western belief that peacetime defense preparation has an almost wholly negative social impact. An insular strategic culture such as that of the United States tends generally to view the allocation of scarce resources for defense functions as being inherently wasteful.
Such a culture supports substantial armed forces in peacetime with the attitude that they constitute, at best, regrettable necessities. Major defense program initiatives often are taken belatedly and clearly reluctantly, and they have to be justif ied in very specif ic ways in terms of identif iable, -or very plausible, threats.
Even on its own terms, it is legitimate to question the validity of mainstream stable deterrence theory. For example: as Henry Kissinger has argued forcefully, in policy practice it constitutes "a revolution in the strategic balance as we have known it" 2 
8
sequence of events that lead to war. However, leaving such reservations aside, the most troublesome aspect of maistream stable mutual deterrence theory is that it does not speak to Soviet reality. the grosser features of that ideology, and the practices which they legitimized, fitted so well a Russian national political character marked by cunning, brutality, and submissiveness. 
29
The commitment to permanent struggle, the need for eternal vigilance, the militarized character of society, the fundamental distrust of independent power centers (domestic and foreign)--all are enduring features of Russian/Soviet strategic culture. "The revolution in military affairs,"
as evidenced in Soviet military programs and as discussed in detail in the Penkovskiy "Special Collection," was dramatically different from the revolution in strategic thinking caused by nuclear weapons in the West.
The Western non-operational focus upon deterrence as opposed to defense is totally alien to Soviet strategic culture, and is indeed viewed as dangerous, irresponsible, and scientifically incorrect. Since 1956
the Soviet Union has rejected Lenin's "inevitability of war" thesis, but has continued to believe that war is possible, that the difference in the range of outcomes could encompass the distance between victory and defeat, and that more military power cannot fail to pay political divi-31 dends.
The notion of having enough military power is alien to Soviet -229
thought and appears to be contrary to the Soviet reading of their, and 32 other states', history.
Equivalence and parity are recognized by the Soviet Union as being the necessary basis for East-West security relations, but that necessary basis is not, and cannot be, accepted as sufficient.
Quite aside from any ideological imperative, Soviet geopolitics--like
Russian geopolitics in times past--is the story of near continuous struggle against actual or potential enemies who posed, or might pose, a threat to the (multi-) national existence.

There is a distinct possibility that a United States' government, in the future, could believe the Soviet Union to be deterred by the assumed short fuse from provocative (Soviet) military action to nuclear holocaust-a belief that projects stable deterrence reasoning into Soviet decisionmaking processes--while a Soviet government could believe that it had a very good prospect of winning a war, and that the United States' government should appreciate its weak political position and back down. In short, both sides might falsely project the perspective of their strategic culture onto the other--with very dangerous consequences.
A focus upon stability criteria oriented towards mutual vulnerability encourages a defense community to think astrategically. A military posture that is truly innocent on classically defined crisis or arms race instability grounds, is likely to be a military posture ill-suited to coercive diplomacy.
American strategy should translate military posture into plans for the efficient and effective application of force in support of political goals.
Stability is fully compatible with policy paralysis.
If one postulates stability at every level of potential conflict, the problem disappears. However, unless the United States can enforce multi-level stability, a stability at the strategic nuclear level should mean that the United States could not, responsibly, exert strategic nuclear pressure in compensation for an unfolding theater defeat. 
4
The concept of stability is used in a wide variety of senses. Among that wide variety, three in particular stand out as meriting individual analytic attention: arms race stability, crisis stability, and stability in perception.

J *
arms race stability
The idea of arms race stability holds that the basic engine of competition is the first stike fear encouraged by defense programs designed to threaten at least part of the opponent's ability to wreak massive societal damage in a second strike. 
4
rather by the fears that flowed from anticipation of such dangers.
The idea of "sympathetic parallelism" in armament programs was the logical colollary of the arms race "spiral" theory. It was argued that just as the superpowers could stimulate each other to build more and more capable weapons, so they should be able, through deliberate restraint, and perhaps explicit cooperative management, to remove much of the anxiety which drives essentially anticipatory--reactive armament programs. actual and potential rivals from the 1840s until 1914. This stability, however, was not achieved easily, cheaply, or without recurring alarm in British defense circles: "panics" and anticipated "gaps" were familiar, repeated, features of British naval debates.

as former Secretary of Defense Harold Brown has claimed by strong implication, 
46
Also, stability can obtain in a period when there is a rapid change as the right (i.e., ultimately "destablizing") defense technologies--given human frailty in strategic prediction.
In its loosest, though most easily defensible, sense, arms race stability could be held to pertain simply to the pace and degree of rival postural change, regardless of the character of that change. An unusually rapid succession of deployed weapon generations, on both sides, would appear to many people to constitute an unstable situation. However, such rapid change may reflect a particularly fecund period of parallel defense research activity, rather than unusual political hostility, and may be fully compatible with some important definitions of a stable situation. Nonetheless, it is reasonable to allow that rapid postural change would be very likely to breed fears abroad that militarily significant, if transitory, breakthroughs were a distinct possibility--breakthroughs which might facilitate or enable disarming first strikes to be planned with some confidence.
Probably the major problem attending the concept of arms race stability
was that it rested upon an easily challengeable theory of arms race dynamics. ' To impute this influence [of weaponslon the likelihood of the outbreak of war to "weaponry" is to focus too narrowly on technology. It is weapons, organizations, plans, geography, communications, warning systems, intelligence, and even beliefs and doctrines about the conduct of war that together have this influence. The point is that this complex of military factors is not neutral in the process by which war may come about.
Particularly valuable is the distinction Schelling draws between the static and dynamic dimensions of (crisis) stability. Thus there is a disagreement over "how much credibility is enough": two policy analysts therefore might agree on how likely the Russians thought it was that a limited war would 1 escalate and disagree over whether they could be deterred.
If taken to its logical extreme, the more pessimistic argument might lead to the conclusion that, at some point in the future, the Soviet Union might be so desperate as to be "beyond deterrence"--meaning, again logically, that considerations of crisis stability, however rigorous, would be irrelevant. The only question remaining would be "how well would the West fare in the war?" Different analysts may agree on the general characteristics of a crisis-stable military balance, and even on the character of Soviet strategic culture, yet they may disagree on whether particular United States military postures are sufficiently crisis stable. The reason for the disagreement lurks in the different range of political crises that each is willing to consider as relevant to the sizing and character of the U.S. defense effort. Some interpretations of the military implications of the concept of crisis stability bear the potentially dangerous hallmark of a managerial, as opposed to a strategic, perspective upon security issues. Crisis stability is fully compatible with an American strategic force posture which could take the initiative, compete for escalation dominance, and--if need be--fight the war through to a favorable military decision. However, crisis stability very often is considered narrowly in the context either of a rigid application of mutual assured destruction reasoning or, beyond that in sophistication, in the addendum of flexible targeting design. Typically, any capability that threatens Soviet strategic forces, pre-launch, or during mission execution, is held to be an affront to crisis stability. Crisis stability, properly understood, does not lend its conceptual authority to such judgments. For reason of extended deterrence duties, the United

In order to establish a mutual stability policy, it is necessary to classify strategic system as either stablizing or destabilizing and to avoid the latter.
Following classical mutual vulnerability theory, Kahan claimed that weapons threatening to the countervalue mission performance of strategic offensive forces are destabilizing, "since they can directly negate an opponent's deterrent capability, a 
5 4
Given the Soviet traditional military approach to nuclear war planning, strategies and tactics which in the West tend to be judged as destabilizing almost certainly have no such implications in Soviet thinking. Soviet political and military planners would be most unlikely to view programs intended to provide active and passive defense of the American homeland as signalling anything other than common sense. 
55
However, the mechanistic ying-yang envisaged in some simple-minded defenseoffense, action-reaction theories of the arms race is the stuff of the (American) seminar room, not of the real world of Soviet defense decisionmaking.
The small strategic theory community has paid very little attention to the place, let alone the details, of command, control, communications,
Like peace and security, everyone, from every school of thought, is for good C31.
Understandably, it would be difficult to generate a debate over the issue, "does the United States require high quality C 3 1?" Non-controversial subjects tend to escape attention.
The most severe problems with the concept of stability result from the fact that its technical definition has not included a critical dimension of strategic capability: namely, the physical and organizational arran gments for exercising deliberate command of strategic forces.

As Steinbruner proceeds to argue, when the concept of stability is expanded so as to accommodate C 3 1 desiderata, the preferred force structure (given classic stability themes) might alter markedly. For example:
The submarine-based strategic force which is clearly the most stable under the conventional definition 5 is just as clearly the worst in terms of command stability. 
5 7
It is almost certainly the case that a good fraction of the strategic debate of recent years has rested upon quite unrealistic assumptions concerning the quality and survivability of American (and NATO) C31 assets.
There was much weaving of interesting strategic targeting tapestries in the 1970s, but I suspect that most of the targeting schemes which envisaged the protracted and progressive unfolding of a deliberate design of destruction (for carefully calculated military and political effect), failed to take adequate note of likely, or possible, command instability phenomena (American and Soviet).
There is ample evidence suggesting that classic stability theory, which encourages the belief that nuclear war would be the end of history, promoted a relaxed climate concerning the many details of actually managing Perceptions of the military balance, correct or not, affect political behavior both of our own nation and of others as well.
Instability can result from swings in perceptions, which can be much greater than the changes in the factual situation. The best way to avoid that instability is to avoid, to the maximum extent possible (it is a difficult task), expressing the balance in tendentious terms or, even worse, shading it 2whether this be in order to excite alarm or to calm fears.
The need for essential equivalence reflects the fact that nuclear forces have a political impact influenced by static 246 :
-* measures (such as numbers of warheads, throw-weight, equivalent megatonnage) as well as by dynamic evaluations of relative military capability. It requires that our overall forces be at least on a par with those of the Soviet Union, and also that they be recognized to be essentially equivalent. we need forces of such a size and character that every nation perceives that the Unitgg States cannot be coerced or intimidated by Soviet forces.
Without denying that appearances, reflected in the cruder static . '  material influencing foreign perception of who is ahead, or which way the Soviet-American political-military competition is tending.
For understandable reasons, some American commentators appeared to believe that the debate over the foreign policy implications of (alleged) military imbalance was a debate over military "appearances" only. In the 1970s it was fairly popular to argue that, ultimately, a military imbalance would have political significance only if it had (plausibly) military significance. 
6
In their ICBM, air defense, BMD (in research and development), ASW, and civil defense programs, the Soviets have been providing persuasive evidence that their systemic view of the arms competition is dramatically different from the view adhered to by succeeding United States' administrations. They have sought, and are continuing to seek, "useful advantage" through whatever degree of preponderance the United States permits. 67
The "classical" theory of crisis stability may or may not be correct;
fortunately the 1970s did not provide a field test. However, the Soviet perspective on strategic matters suggests that the explanatory power of the theory may be poor. Richard Burt expressed this skepticism when he wrote that Central strategic war, according to Soviet literature, is not likely to stem from mechanistic instabilities within the super-power military relationship, but rather from real and enduring differenceg 8 between competing political systems and national interests.
In principle, certainly, it is sensible to argue that it would be undesirable for the superpowers to deploy forces which lend themselves to first-strike destruction. However, it is no less sensible to argue that "the reciprocal fear of surprise attack"

Many of the elements of a new theory of strategic stability already have been expressed in official prose and action over the past five years.
However, the theoretical revolution remains incomplete. What is missing, above all else, is both a recognition of the pervasiveness and longevity of competition, and a positive approach to the functions of strategic nuclear forces. On this last point, for example, Harold  As stated earlier, the identifiable Soviet approach to arms competition is the steady acquisition of a more and more formidable war-fighting/warsurvival capability. It is highly improbable that the Soviet Union can be dissuaded from pursuing this approach.

interest actually to implement it. Execution of such a threat would be the negation of strategy: in and of itself it would solve no military or political problems, while it would near-guarantee a Soviet retaliation that would preclude U.S. recovery from war.
The strategic nuclear targeting review of the late 1970s, as summarized in PD 59, has prepared the way for serious discussion of the concept of stability suggested in this chapter.

the United States enunciated a strategic doctrine (of stable mutual deterrence deriving from assured-destruction based ideas of crisis and arms race stability) that was devoid of strategic merit. 8 That is to say it neglected to relate military power to the accomplishment of political objectives.
Although Robert McNamara apparently did not intend his preferred doctrinal leitmotiv of assured destruction to pertain in detail to actual strategic-opera-tional plans, the facts remain that the stable deterrence ideas of the late 1960s did have a major impact upon the course, and kind, of weapon acquisition, 
9
There is an apparent paradox: How could a defense establishment whose sophistication in management was the envy of the Western (and perhaps 10 the Eastern, also) world, contrive to lose a major war and so mismanage its end of the strategic arms competition with the Soviet Union that it is plausible to talk about the opening of a Soviet "window of vulnerability" in the 1980s? Could it be that sound management and sound strategy need have no necessary close relationship one with the other? 
11
Clearly, how a war is to be conducted has to be congruent with the aims to be achieved. The United States, in Vietnam, violated Clausewitz' principle with predictable consequences. (Explicit defense analysis can promote efficiency in the acquisition, maintenance and employment of military means--always provided somebody is minding the strategy store [i.e., is determining policy ends and the connections between ends and means]).
McNamara is reported as having offered the revealing opinion that there is nolonger any such thing as strategy, only crisis management.
Moreover, scarcely less representative a standard-bearer for Western strategic culture than Robert McNamara, Alastair Buchan (the principal founder and first director of the Institute for Strategic Studies in London), writing in 1966, felt moved to characterize crisis management as "the new diplomacy.111

Offices have always known about crisis management and many governments have practiced controlled escalation--even if they did not so label their activities. However, the theory-conscious social-scientific cormunity in the United States wrote as if gold had been discovered.
As a historical aside, it is not self-evident that the appearance of an over-arching theory, pertaining to a long-practiced reality, necessarily improves the quality of policy. For example, notwithstanding its quite genuine gratitude to Alfred Thayer Mahan for his services as a publicist, it is a fact that the British Royal Navy had practiced the doctrine of "seapower," as expounded by Mahan, for more than two centuries prior to his detailed exposition.

The argument in this chapter is leading towards an indictment of poor, instant, theory, by ahistorical strategists looking backwards (virtually) to a single, or very small population of, events, and seeking therefrom the elements of a general theory, not to an indictment of theory creation writ large. This author believes that from a close study of direct historical evidence, from the folklore of statecraft, and from the viewpoint of political-military logic, it might be possible to derive useful theories of escalation control and crisis management. ideas pertaining to the conduct of central war) was bequeathed an undeveloped infant of a concept, not a mature theory. Moreover, the controlled escalation concept embraced by NATO-allied officials reflected all too accurately the ethnocentric weaknesses of the strategic theories outlined in the West as of 1964-66. The "Golden Age" of American strategic theoriz- ing, for all its deductive merits, was as culturally insular as apple pie.
Crisis management, like the control of escalation, had immediate appeal to a management-skill oriented United States defense community.
Here is "how to do it" advice--which is always popular. More often than not, when scholars brief officials on their academic "findings," those "findings" amount to the conclusion that "the subject is more complicated when you looked at it the right way, did not become still more complicated.")

a few noteworthy exceptions, a literature of almost monumental inutility.
For example, one unquestionably scholarly compendium offers its unfortunate readers an Appendix with no fewer than 311 "propositions." Without evidence of irony, proposition number 302 holds that " t he credi-bility of threats increases when there is consistency between verbal statements and action. ' , 
27
Notwithstanding the pomposity and naivete that permeates the crisis management literature, it should be remembered that this literature was catalyzed by a particular event and that it had a very serious, indeed an unquestionably praiseworthy, motive. First, in the early and mid-1960s, difficult though many people today find it to recall, there was a sense of crisis-management achievement: that in October 1962 the United
.
States' decision-making system at the highest level had been tested almost Sl'outrance and had not been found wanting. 
2 8
Among the most penetrating descriptions of the intent behind the crisis management theorizing of the early to mid-1960s were these words by Robert
There is, of ccurse, nothing novel in the aspiration, as such, to manage diplomatic crises. What is novel in contem-porary "crisis management" is the intensity of aspirations to exercise a far greater measure of control over those cri-tical junctures in state relations than men have exercised in the past and the confidence that this may indeed be done through exhaustive analysis, imaginative speculation, and careful planning for future actions. Whereas in the past crises all too often "broke" on men who, being unprepared and having no time, were made the prisoners of events, crisis management would reverse this ancient and today Jngerous form of servitude and make men the masters of events.
Almost needless to say, the optimism to which Osgood and Tucker referred stemmed from reflections upon the course and outcome of the very recent experience of Cuba, October 1962.
The (Western, really American) theory of escalation, to stretch terminology a little, holds that force can be applied purposefully in measured graduated quantities, of specified quality, to a point--or zone--where an enemy will decide that his expectation of (future) loss exceeds his expecta-274-tion of gain, and hence he will acquiesce in a process of war termination. 3 0
As a very bare framework of rational decision-making, escalation theory can accommodate a wide range of deterrence theories. Also, the theory, if left sufficiently sparce of detail, need not be vulnerable to charges of strategic-cultural relativism (or ethnocentricity), or of wishful thinking. To have a vision of escalation need not be to endorse that particular vision as prospective reality.

--war, particularly nuclear war, is a bargaining process, or competition in risk-taking.
--that bargaining process, or competition in risk-taking, has thresholds likely to be recognizable as such by both parties.
--escalation is a process of graduated punishment (and the threat thereof). Both sides will have many opportunities (at the thresholds) to consider carefully whether or not the stakes of the war are worth the damage yet to be inflicted and suffered.
--neither side will have grave difficulty understanding the strategic/political meaning of the military actions taken by the other. In principle, this theory, with its multiple synergisms, has much to recommend it--particularly if the prospective adversary shares Western values and would engage in rational decision-making in familiar Western terms. Unfortunately, there is no good reason to make these assumptions.
Some Western commentators have sought to argue that, "in the event," Soviet decision-makers would likely prove far less idiosyncratic, or bloodthirsty, than might be believed on the basis of study of Russian/Soviet national style and the evidence of Soviet literature and military exercises. 
3 5
I am not scornful of this proposition, but neither am I particularly respectful.
Unwelcome though the judgment is, it is difficult to find an evidential base to controvert Jack Snyder's argument that Countercultural strategic analysis is not well-developed in the Soviet Union and has been in retreat since the Cuban Missile Crisis. As a result, there has been no discernible effort to explore the advantages of flexible-option strategies. Based on what is visible to the outside observer, Soviet crisis decision-makers would appear intellectually unprepared for sgaltime improvisation of a doctrine of intrawar restraint.
In short, while the Soviet Unon may identify some potential thresholds in an East-West military conflict, it is not at all obvious--on the basis of the admittedly very imperfect evidence available--that they embrace any theory of intra-war deterrence or of escalation control that could function as a combat dampener in conjunction with Western policies. 
3 7
Western theorists of escalation, no matter how well they hedged their theoretical frameworks with caveats, provided Western decision-makers with a dangerous concept. Herman Kahn's hypothetical escalation ladder may be a metaphor, really a heuristic device to stimulate creative official thought, but in practice it may have encouraged some particularly dangerous illusions concerning the potential for the control of conflict. By way of summary:
-- seem to offer a "management offset" to a major decline in relative military muscle.
As with the concept of crisis management, discussed below, the idea of escalation control contains an inherent tension which may prove fatal for its efficacy in policy practice. In the enduring absence of substantial domestic damage-limitation capabilities, American enthusiasm for the control half of the escalation control concept promises to be fatally erosive of the desired deterrent effect. In the Disney World of some American theorists, fearful Soviet leaders either are deterred by the Great Chain of Escalation reasoning, or--in the worst case--are brought to their senses abruptly by sharp escalatory initiatives by the United Sates 39 : I.e., deterrence is restored. Yet no explanation is offered as to why the U.S. would be willing to escalate an unfolding conflict while the Soviet Union would be unwilling to continue that escalation process--there simply is no basis presented for anticipating such U.S.
boldness or Soviet caution. Indeed, there is some evidence (discussed below) to suggest that just the inverse would be the case. As argued extensively already in this study, no one can predict with high confidence which superpower will lead an escalation process: geopolitical logic suggests that it should be the United States, for reasons of local weakness in Eurasian theaters, but Soviet strategy may overwhelm that logic.
If the logic of geopolitics holds true, and the United States is in the driver's seat of escalation, seeking to reverse the course of some local conflict, then the American cultural attraction to escalation control in the context of a totally vulnerable American homeland, could d279
well vitiate the threat efficacy of the escalation concept. The more carefully the United States seeks to control a process of escalation, the less menacing her deterrent profile may seem in Soviet eyes.
For a rather crude, though not wholly misleading, caricature, crisis management attained the status of being a chic concept in the early to mid 19 6 0s--apparently it had cultural appeal to some of those Americans whom David Halberstam described, ironically, as The Best and the Brightest.
The concept of crisis management, and the theory (or theories) that was woven around it, spoke to some enduring American cultural themes. Second, crisis management appealed to the American proclivity to solve problems and to define conditions as problems. By definition, a crisis is, or may be, a problem-solving mechanism (as is war). Third, crisis management was attractive to Americans as a concept because it was both optimistic (crisis management) and skill-oriented. The concept, in its very structure, suggests that crises can be managed--and Americans have never lacked for confidence in their ability to manage effectively.
Fourth, crisis management seems to imply that the (inferred) pacific management of crises is the natural order of affairs. The prevalence of lawyers or--more realistically perhaps--of people with some legal training, in the United States' Government, has the skill-bias effect upon "policy planning" of encouraging the belief that "a deal" can always be struck between fundamentally reasonable advocates for their state-clients.
The concept of crisis management has immediate appeal to an American policymaking community heavily populated by lawyers, (temporarily) lapsed-lawyers, or lawyers--manqu's-who have been "socialized" by the net-unhealthy effect of a legal perspective imbued at an impressionable age, to believe that reasonable people will eventually come to terms to manage a crisis to the satisfaction of all interested parties. In other words, the very concept of crisis management encourages the view that every crisis can be managed successfully, if only 'the right package' of incentives (and disincentives) can be assembled and negotiated. There is what may be termed a "fallacy of negotiability.'
For example, Roger Fisher, Professor of Law at Harvard, has long advised American governments to "give them a yesable proposition 41--in other words, seek a way of packaging American desires such that the adversary will feel moved to say "yes." This is yet another example of a good idea that all too easily becomes a poor idea. There are occasions--as, for example, over "who rules South Vietnam?," or "shall the Americani hostages be released?"--where men of good will on both sides cannot attain a mutually satisfactory crisis outcome.
It is worth recalling the rather obvious historical points that not all crisis landscapes are well populated with men of good will (for example, Munich, September 1938); sometimes the issue at stake does not lend itself to a compromise decision; while not all crises permit one party to make an offsetting side payment in return for acquisition of the major prize in the conflict. In practice, Roger Fisher's advice to "give them a yesable proposition" serves as a temptation to appeasement (although Fisher does not, of course, intend it as such). Fisher advocated his "yesable proposition" option in relation to the American hostages in Tehran, but no one, including Professor Fisher, succeeded in designing a proposition that appealed to Shi'ite zealots.
If there are no "yesable" propositions on the horizon, and if the issue truly is a matter of vital national interest, one has little recourse other than to send in the Marines. The final resolution of the hostage crisis in January 1981 had little or nothing to do with the quality of American diplomacy.
As Osgood and Tucker have suggested (quoted above), the crisis management theorists of the early and mid-1960s were reacting to the perceived fact that, as they believed, the world was fortunate to have been spared 42 nuclear war in October 1962.
It seemed sensible to argue that although every crisis has distinctive features (of time, place, strength of commitment of adversaries, alliance complications/assistance, correlation of forces, and so on), at a fairly high level of generality one should be able to specify some guidelines for crisis management, or "conventions of crisis," Notwithstanding the major scholarly endeavor undertaken to dissect crisis phenomena, the end result--at least to date--has been disappointingly r.7
obvious. For example, one distinguished scholar, Ole R. Holsti, having engaged in scrupulous, painstaking research, informs us that the following are the most important items of crisis-management advice: 
4 6
Avoid taking steps which seal off "escape routes."
Reducing the adversary's incentives to escalate will probably require a combination of incentives and threats. (Comment: this is so obvious as to be banal and without value.)
In crisis diplomacy, as in other forms of communications, actions tend to speak louder than words. (Comment: this is good advice, but again, stupefyingly obvious.)
Make every effort to slow the pace of crisis events. (Comment: this was good advice for October 1962; was irrelevant for 1939; was believed 4Y the best military brains of the time to be bad advice in July 1914; and could be disastrous adv4ge for NATO vis a vis an unfolding military crisis in the 1980s.)
During a crisis responsible policymakers should be in control not only of broad strategic decisions, but also of the details of implementation."
(Comment: clearly, and sensibly, Professor Holsti does not want a battalion commander in the U.S. Fifth Corps starting World War III on his own initiative. However, the long-standing American tradition of trusting "the man on the spot" should not be discarded too lightly. Far from starting World War III, prompt and resourceful action taken by a battalion commander might just resolve a military problem that could otherwise have escalated had it been left to the judgment of the man with the global perspective in the White House.) Although there should be policy value in wisdom derived from the careful historical study of statecraft and from a high-level theory of crisis management, the facts remain that the American record of crisis 
management prior to enunciation of crisis management theory was not obviously inferior to the post-enunciation record. This, of course, is not necessarily to indict the theory. Any theory, of any degree of explanatory power, may be ignored or misapplied by fallible and fumbling policymakers-not to mention the distressing fact that adversary policymakers may either hold to a quite different set of rules of crisis management, or may read your theory and ambush it in detail.

If deterrent effect, to some important though indeterminate degree, is believed to flow from the fear that one is making threats "that leave something to chance," in Schelling's phraseology, 
5 2
It is probably no exaggeration to argue that just as it may be held that deterrence has "failed" if force has to be used, so crisis management often is judged to have failed when war, nonetheless, breaks out. In terms of Western culture, wherein peace is normal and war is abnormal, crises tend to be viewed either as Acts of God (or of a capricious nature), or as acts of a malevolent adversary.
It would be almost inconceivable to describe as successful a case of crisis management which resulted in war. American strategic theory and strategic policy makes no provision for the coercive use of crises.

Escalation theory, in the United States, has been something of an academic plaything: with great ingenuity richly differentiated logical * sequences of escalatory actions were invented. Unfortunately perhaps, it appears to be the case that the Soviet Union is not attracted to the idea of engaging in a very carefully graduated "diplomacy of violence"-she seems to believe that the "grammar" of war is largely sui generis
and that, ergo, there is an internal logic or integrity to military operations which, albeit within predetermined political parameters, should be permitted to run its course. In other words, military action has political meaning in the sense that war must be conducted only for appropriate political ends, but not in the sense that war comprises a series of violent political messages.
It is not "the Soviet way" to choose to place reliance upon the self-restraint exercised by others--if there is an alternative directcontrol option. Deterrence, pre-and intra-war, is believed by Soviet theoreticians to be the consequence of anticipation of war-waging success, of believing that "war is war," and that because wars are either won or lost (stalemate would translate into "lost" in the Soviet political context) it is preferable to try hard to win. Victory, in Soviet military-and, we must presume, authoritative political terms, is not a nostalgic idea clung to by old soldiers, and neither is it simply a morale-boosting concept;

For ideological and sensible analytically based military reasons, the Soviet Union remains convinced that victory is possible in wars of all 68 kinds.
Once a Soviet government takes the decision to fight, it should not be expected that the Soviet military establishment would be much constrained by considerations of escalation control. The Soviet Union would not employ force needlessly (in its estimation), but neither should Western countries anticipate a Soviet willingless to risk paying a major military price in return for a considerable lowering of the risks of escalation.

The concept of escalation control is very much the product of an insular, as opposed to a continental strategic culture. The insular situation of Great Britain and the United States, and a good part of their actual (as opposed to romanticized) histories, have lent credence to the view that a country could "take as much and as little of the war as he will."

the center of national power was not immediately at risk in war.
Britain and the United States, are unusually vulnerable to the siren appeal of a concept such as escalation control. This concept presumes the feasibility of deliberate manipulation of the military environment in favorable ways (which was long a condition for these two countries by virtue of their geographical location); appeals to the pragmatic, engineering-manipulative impulse that is dear to the American (and to a much lesser degree, the British)

The analysis in this chapter, though admittedly hampered by lack of evidence from the Soviet side--not to mention the obvious point that there is no "hands-on", real-world experience of the functioning of escalation processes in a nuclear war--reinforces the conclusions reached in the prior discussion of deterrence and stability. Looming over all of these subjects is the apparent fact of a Soviet "battlefield" view of the proper use of nuclear weapons in war.
As with mainstream American theories of deterrence (through the threat of punishment) and stability, so the American theories of escalation control and crisis management are riven through with American cultural desiderata. The issue is not whether those desiderata are, or are not, praiseworthy, rather is it whether or not those cultural desiderata lead, in practice, to military postures and policies which would be unlikely to be able to withstand the traffic of Soviet policies driven by Soviet culturally-derived impulses. The basic idea of escalation control, on the surface at least, appears to be compatible with both American and Soviet strategic cultures. The idea that more and more (or different)
force may be applied in discriminating ways for the achievement of political objectives is hardly culture-specific. Similarly, the idea of intrawar deterrence, even if alien in the Soviet context, once understood potentially has to be a major candidate for policy influence. In short, typically there is virtually no emotional input to Soviet decision-making on foreign policy.8

The very structure of the Soviet mode of leadership, since 1964 at least, lends it a degree of predictability which is quite absent from the American (Presidential) scene.
In addition to the dampening effect imposed by committee government upon policy initiative, the apparent Soviet belief that "war will run its course" also should serve to discourage boldness in prediction of putative chains of escalation logic. Furthermore, it should not be forgotten that although the Soviet Union has been elected by History (i.e.,
Lenin with a revolver) to lead and guard the transformation of capitalism/imperialism into socialism (thence, eventually, to communism), the Soviet Union is both the vanguard and the principal asset of proletarian internationalism. Soviet leaders are not supposed to place the citadel of socialism (i.e., the U.S.S.R.) at serious risk through adventurous diplomacy. The Soviet Union, courtesy of many living historical memories, knows that war is a very serious business--a theory (of escalation control) which poses a potentially major threat to military efficacy is unlikely to secure many converts in Moscow, even under the dire pressure of wartime events. Soviet leaders know, through historical and personal experience, that if a war can be won virtually any kind of damage sustained eventually can be made good. Recognition of this perspective, alien though it is, did not permeate the writings of American theorists on escalation in the 1960s.

and occasionally sophisticated ideas, just because some officials (et al.) will fail to understand them properly.
If only because their incentive to understand will be so high. I find this assertion to be grossly optimistic. Aside from the blinkering effect of cultural stereotype thinking, the plain physical facts of the "fog of battle" must impede timely receipt, let alone analysis, of information concerning military activity.

Even in the cases discussed in George, Hall, and Simons, The Limits of Coercive Diplomacy, the American intent was fundamentally, or strategically, defensive--"coercive diplomacy" was a possible muscular approach to compel an adversary to desist from inimical activity, and/or to disgorge gains already made. In Soviet terms, of course, active American resistance to regional imperialism (masquerading 54. Ibid., p.

The French contr6le, which translates as a somewhat distant general supervision, is close to the usual meaning ascribed to a "Finlandized" Western Europe.
Over the years, Soviet theater-operational strike assets have been deployed overwhelmingly on Soviet rather than Eastern-European soil.
This continuing fact suggests that the Soviet Union does not expect to be able to preserve its homeland as a sanctuary in a war in Europe. 82. The British have elevated "muddling through" to the level of a distinctive national approach to strategic policy-making. Because of its ongoing character since November 1969, because of its major linkage to East-West political relations and because of the political dynamics which have driven it forward, it is not unfair to observe that there has been a "mad momentum" to the SALT process.

I would argue that the United States defense community should "rethink"
and "reconceptualize" before, not after, SALT Ii ratification. The debate over SALT II has been raised here in order to introduce and illustrate the thesis that the United States' defense community has never benefited from an arms control theory worthy of the name--essentially because, to quote Johan Hoist, w e just do not have an adequate explanatory model for the Soviet-American arms race.

In short, what are needed are "tangible accomplishments.

The strategic force posture places only a very modest burden on the defense budgetl7--in comparison to manpower intensive general-purpose forces--and, it encompasses that high end of the technology competition spectrum wherein Soviet officials know that they are at a major, enduring, disadvantage.
Second, although it is difficult to argue with Leslie Gelb when he asserts that Arms control has essentially failed. Three decades of U.S.-Soviet negotiations to limit arms impetition have done little more than to codify the arms race.
The fact remains that since the United States has yet to decide just what it is about in arms control negotiations, it is perhaps too harsh to conclude that "[a]rms control has essentially failed." Failed to accomplish what? There can be no doubt that the United States' arms control community, in reviewing the 1970s, must judge its performance to have been unsatisfactory. 
19
Third, following directly from the line of argument developed above, a very important aspect of the current crisis of arms control is profound uncertainty over the proper operational objectives of arms control.
How high should the criteria be set for policy success or failure? "[F]or the most part, SALT agreements have tended to ratify, rather than restrain, the expansion of Soviet forces" 2 1 --but could they do anything else?
If the SALT process can only reflect political and military reality, is it fair, or enlightening, to critize its American part-authors for failing to accomplish the impossible? Fifth, if the charge can be sustained that, in some important respects, an ongoing, or imminent, arms control process contributes both to the astrategic skewing of Western defense programs away from the path of policy rationality and to the psychological disarmament of noteworthy political constituencies in the West--then it may be the case that the West cannot afford arms control. Richard Burt has argued that SALT, during the last decade, did not become a forum for American and Soviet doctrinal convergence. In fact, it tended to mask 2 he different directions in which the two sides were moving.
As phrased, this judgment is misleading. SALT masked nothing: though it may be true to argue that the existence of a SALT process encouraged American officials and commentators to believe, falsely, that the Soviet Union had "signed up" for some rough facsimile of standard Western theories of strategic stability. 2

Although it has become commonplace to argue that there is a crisis
of arms control, I am not convinced that the crisis, generally, is correctly characterized. There is a crisis in that many people have come to wonder whether, judged on the historical record, arms control really is, or even can be, as important as successive American administrations have asserted to be the case. As Richard Burt and others have --noted, SALT and the debate over its future, tends to direct attention to matters of only secondary significance. 
2 7
28
Strong advocates of negotiated arms control are very much on the defensive today--a condition well-illustrated by the fact that the Director of the Arms Control Association was moved to entitle an article "A Farewell to Arms Control?" 
30
On balance, SALT II should be judged to be a poor bargain for the United States. However, that belief is not particularly important in the context of this chapter. The many references here to SALT II are solely for the purpose of illustrating a more general argument--this study is not concerned to prosecute one side of the SALT II debate, yet again. The effective demise of SALT II in the late fall of 1979 was beneficial for Western security not so much because a particular Treaty regime was avoided, but rather because that demise enables the United States' defense community to place some valuable, perspective-granting distance between the arms control record of the 1970s and what might be attempted in the 19 8 0s.
In the words of Richard Burt:
In fact, even a temporary hiatus in the SALT process provides an opportunity for unfettered thinking about American nuclear options during the c3ing decade and beyond. The opportunity should be exploited.
Unfortunately, many people appear to have difficulty understanding that the crisis of arms control is really only a crisis of formally negotiated arms control. A poor, or only marginally useful, SALT II agreement is not a triumph for arms control. Arms control should be about reducing the risks of war, reducing the damage that might be suffered should war occur, and reducing the burden of peacetime defense preparation. Those goals should be forwarded through a well-designed defense policy. Moreover, if they can be forwarded through formal inter-state negotiations, it will only be because of the well-designed defense policy that American negotiators had as "the hand" with which they could play.

In company with Albert Wohlstetter,

In macroscopic terms, at least, this belief is not unreasonable.
--
The United States and the Soviet Union have identified each other as their principal adversary.
--Each country is almost desperately attentive to the course, and detail of the arms programs of the other.
--Each country attends carefully to its relative position on the multi-level military balance.
These three facts do not really qualify the Soviet-American military relationship as an arms race. Unfortunately, many of the pejorative connotations of "arms race" are all too lightly attached to Soviet-American military rivaly, notwithstanding the absence of supporting evidence. 
34
Insofar as history offers any general wisdom on the subject, it is to the unhelpful effect that some wars have been preceded by arms races and some have not. 
35
military rivalry--and since wars tend not to occur between states who had not considered each other as prospective enemies until the eleventh hour of peacetime--some historical juxtaposition of arms race and war is only to be expected. Notwithstanding the empirical knowledge claimed, and the theoretical ingenuity displayed, the possibility remains that arms races are more the invention of polemical writers and social scientists in search of cross-historical general theory, than they are genuinely identifiable event-sequences that do, or may, have dynamics different from peacetime defense preparation as usual.
Heretical though the thought appears to be, it is worth considering the proposition that arms race theory has made so little progress in large part because the concept of an arms race is mainly metaphor. The confusion of metaphor and reality may have encouraged Western arms control-.. lers to seek what Robin Ranger has termed "technical," as opposed to "political ' ,36 arms control. Because arms controllers could conceive of an arms race system, to an important degree distinct from the framework of political relations, they came to believe that system could be controlled in useful ways with only the most minimal reference to the political environment. Authoritative confirmation of this claim has been provided by Barry Blechman.
The American theory of arms control would isolate such negotiations [SALT] from politics.
In theoretical terms, arms limitation talks should be viewed as technical exercises, directed at constraining the risks which weapons themselves add to existing political conflicts. As those espousing arms control made no pretense of solving political conflicts through the negotiations they proposed, they saw no relationship (other than that artificially instilled by politicians) between progress or lack of progress in settling underlying sources of con ict and progress or lack of progress in armsnegotiations.
Blechman proceeds to notice that "[i]n practice, however, the United States has closely linked movement in arms control with broader political accommodations with the Soviet Union." Nonetheless, the practice of "linkage" admitted,

Where many theorists of arms racing, and many policy proponents masquerading ,39"" as arms race theorists, have erred, has been in focusing far too heavily upon the putative interactive traffic in the alleged arms race system.
Indeed, the very concept of a largely autonomous arms race system encourages a quest for the military dynamics of military interaction. Scholars of Soviet-American relations tend to be ignorant of the precise historical detail of the process of genesis of a weapon system in the United States, and profoundly (and, by and large, excusably) ignorant with reference to Soviet program details. This is a subject where broad-brush character-
ization, deduced from first principles, can lead one astray all too easily.
Consider the likely impact of the following first principles upon one's understanding of the dynamics of arms competition and the prospects for negotiated restaint:
--
The defense programs of each side are, and can be, greatly influenced by perceptions of the other side's programs--actual, anticipated, and possible.
--Both sides would like to reduce the burden of resource allocation for defense. The larger, and more dynamic, the defense programs of the two sides, the greater the policy influence of defense-minded hard-line officials.
--
Both sides would like to be able to negotiate a plateau in weaponry, or at least to be able to set some "cap on the arms race," so that strategic predictability is enhanced-permitting both governments to deny requests for programs that plainly would provide "excessive" capability.
The above very short list encapsulates much of the theoretical, first-principle baggage with which the United States government conducted 41 -' SALT and its end of the arms competition through much of the 1970s... Each of the four principles was true--for the United States. None of the four principles was true, or contained enough truth to be useful as a guide for policy, vis ' vis the Soviet Union. It is difficult to improve on the words of Sun Tzu:
Know the enemy and know yourself; in a hundred battles you will never be in peril.
When you are ignorant of the enemy but know yourself, your chances of winning or losing are equal.
If ignorant both of your enemy 4d of yourself, you are certain in every battle to be in peril.
This study suggests that, to date, American policy-makers have not made adequate efforts to know the enemy, and that even the level of American self-knowledge has left much to be desired. The arms race metaphor, aside from its unhelpful pejorative aspects, encourages scholars and officials to consider Soviet-American military relations apart from their * 328 Although this discussion is cast in terms highly critical of past United States nuclear-weapons and arms control policy, it should not be supposed that all, or even most, of the strong criticism of that policy (really policies) that has been voiced of recent years is any better grounded in strategic-cultural realities than is the policy assailed. Just as one should not leap, with fashion, from a simple-mined theory of detailed inter-state action-reaction to a scarcely less simple-minded theory of eigendynamik, so one should not leap too precipitously from the erstwhile belief that the Soviet Union was in the process of converging upon the American theory of strategic stability (through the maintenance of mutual assured destruction capabilities), 
4
to the conviction that the Soviet Union is on the high road heading, deliberately, for the goal of clear strategic superiority. 
4 4
The questions which underlie the analysis which follows of the Soviet-American arms race are the following: is there a sufficient basis of common interest for an arms control process to be able to achieve outcomes deemed at least minimally useful by the two sides? Even if a sufficient basis of common interest can be identified, what, and how strong, are the domestic political forces in the two superpowers likely to interdict the arms control process in a negative way? Finally, is it plausible to suggest that the future of arms control is likely to be as unimpressive--or short of "tangible accomplishments"--as its past, because of the very character of the Soviet Union? (In other words, to control 144the arms race do we need, first, to see a major change in the nature of the Soviet polity?) 
4 5
while at the micro level, Soviet defense programs are driven very substan-, tially by their own inertia and by a distinctively Soviet brand of bureau-46 cratic politics. Each country runs, or jogs, in the so-called arms race in a fashion to be expected given its very different political system.
Arms race model builders tend to err because they have not, by and large, recognized the critical importance of the "level of analysis" ,.
problem. As a result, apparently strong--and certainly superficially *plausible--cases can be made both for the proposition that the superpowers may be likened to two swordsmen, thrusting and parrying, and for the proposition that there is so high a degree of autonomy in the arms programs of each side that the concept of an arms race is really very misleading.
I discern both value and error in all majo; schools of arms race analysis, so, rather than indulge in a protracted, eventually negative, exercise -.
in critical review, instead I offer the outline of a new model for the understanding of the arms competition. Perhaps the most difficult idea to communicate, though it is commonplace to pay lip-service to it, is * that the two super-powers genuinely are different in their characteristic arms race behavior. Jonathan Steinberg, for example, has suggested that An arms race is, after all, an immense social, political, legal, and economic process. Its influences penetrate every corner of the societies involved, and its attendant manifestations are simply too complex to fit the standard categories of historical analysis. Even if the subject of study is only one of the participants in such a race, as is the case here [Imperial Germany], the number of elements in that nation's social, cultural, economic, and religious traditions which s 9 nificantly affect the course of the arms race is very large.
Arms race activity cannot be explained satisfactorily exclusively either in macro or in micro terms--both must be accommodated.
the ghost of Mackinder
The greatest geopolitical thinker of the Twentieth Century, Sir
Halford Mackinder, predicted a major clash between the Eurasian (land power), Heartland Power (the U.S.S.R.) and the leader of the maritime alliance (the U.S.A.). Peninsular Europe clearly is the major stake in Soviet-American rivalry, although that stake may be secured more efficiently through effective control of its energy supplies, at source, in the Persian Gulf, than through an attempt at outright direct conquest.
Although Mackinder, in 1904 (when he began to write on geopolitics), then held the familiar standard British view that Imperial Russia posed a potentially deadly threat to British India, his last geopolitical article, written in 1943,49 pointed very clearly to the major enduring problem of the postwar world. Historians are wont to observe that the diplomatic history of the (near) century from the early 1 8 70s to (perhaps) the late 1950s, was dominated by the fact of an overly-powerful Germany--in actuality or anticipation. 5 0 The new, post-1870, Prussian-dominated Germany could 51 not be accommodated within the European balance of power system. Since 1945, with "the German problem" remaining essentially unresolved, 
5 2
All things considered, the conclusion is unavoidable that: if the Soviet Union emerges from this war as conqueror of Germany, she must rank as the greatest land power on the globe. Moreover, she will be the power in the strategically strongest defensive position. The Heartland [redefined by Mackinder to encompass "the territory of the U.S.S.R."] is the greatest national fortress on earth. For the first time in history, it is janned by a garrison sufficient both in number and quality.
The Soviet Union, like Imperial Russia, has never viewed her frontiers as settled lines of reference. In the same way that the British acquired an Empire in India by controlling the hinterland behind the extant holdings, and then the hinterland to yesterday's hinterland, so the U.S.S.R. will not feel truly secure in Eurasia until all potential threats to the stability 54 of the extant Soviet "holdings" are controlled from Moscow.
Over the past hundred years Russian imperialism has contended, successively, with three principal adversaries: 
5 5
States. Each of these adversaries has sought to prevent Russian/Soviet domination of Eurasia. Russian/Soviet history is a story of endless struggle for survival (by way of sharp contrast to the history of insular polities)--sources of power which they do not control pose, in the Soviet view, a threat to their well-being.
Motives are difficult to isolate. There is some sense in the claim that Soviet leaders seek power for its own sake (it is preferable to control than to be controlled). But, there is probably more sense in the argument that Soviet (and Russian) rulers feel perpetually insecure-lacking, as they do, any very secure "mandate from heaven" to rule--and that this insecurity drives them to seek more and more control over their external environment.

When placed in a position of authority, the village "strongmen" have behaved with exactly the kind of ruthless, amoral rapacity that was to be expected. The crudeness of Soviet diplomacy, the lack of concern for "the decent opinion of mankind," the general absence of finesse (witness Soviet behavior in Kabul in December 1979), should have warned the American defense community that the arms programs of the Soviet Union were being directed by a political elite that could not be understood in Western
terms.

This unflattering portrait may be extended in great detail; however, on a lower scale, it is not totally dissimilar from the problems faced by British and French statesmen in the 1930s in their dealings with Nazi Germany. Mr. Chamberlain, who was a decent English gentleman to the tip of his umbrella, could not understand that a civilized country like Germany had been captured by a criminal riff-raff, essentially by gangsters.
Even the proposition was inconceivable to him. and foreign) is hostile. American policy-makers could do a great deal worse than to ponder the implication of these colorful thoughts of Frank Barnett:
...some American entrepreneurs, anxious to sell technology to Moscow, still profess to believe the Rus' ians are simply Slavic-speaking graduates of the Harvard Business School. They are not. They are an ideological Mafia in control of an empire with limitless designs on the rest of us, and with the guts, guile, and finesse to carry out their ambition. Our political heritage derives from the Magna Carta, Locke and Jefferson. The Soviet legacy is from Genghis Kahn, Ivan the Terrible and Lenin. The culure gap is wider, and perhaps more dangerous, than the missile gap.
permanent struggle
The Soviet-American arms race, in its Soviet dimension at least, is founded upon the very character of the Soviet state. Quite aside from the geopolitical factors which drive Soviet-American rivalry, the U.S.S.R. exists only because it is the physical embodiment of a cause.
By Soviet definition, the United States is a principal enemy. So as not to deny their Marxist-Leninist birthright, and the very legitimacy of the rule of the CPSU, Soviet leaders are obliged to engage--or appear plausibly to be engaged 62--in a permanent struggle against other social systems. This fact is very important to recognize because, not infrequently, commentators in the West seek to argue that the Cold War, and the arms competition that flowed from it, have been the product of mutual misperception. Also, it is argued that the arms rivalry might be damped down very considerably if only an appropriate measure of American/NATO selfrestraint were to be exercised. . tionary change of a character ultimately benign to the security condition of others, or until there is a military decision between East and West. 
6 4
Nonetheless, this argument rests upon fact--not assertion. The relevance of this argument to the study is the long-term, really inalienable, nature of the problem to which it points. The roots and sustaining fuel of the Soviet-American arms race do not lie so much in the separate, very complex "domestic processes" which can be explored in detail by scholars of the bureaucratic-politics or Military-Industrial Complex (MIC) persuasion, rather do they lie in the particular political character of Soviet state power and in the facts of geopolitics.
The Action-Reaction Hypothesis Arms-race analysis in the West continues to be afflicted by theorists seeking to identify patterns of arms-program interaction.
It is my contention that, although each superpower has sought to be responsive in a 77j broad and general way to trends in the evolution of the military capabilities of its principal rival, there has been very little detailed action and reaction. Because of the near-total absence of direct evidence on the motives behind individual Soviet weapon programs, this author and the scholars who he is criticizing, are driven, more often than not, to argue by technical inference.
While it would probably be an error to assert that Soviet defense programs are totally insensitive to perceived and anticipated threats, the historical facts of the period 1964-1981 (the Brezhnev leadershipperiod, to date) suggest that a claim for the very substantial autonomy of the Soviet defense effort (vis a vis change in the level of the American defense effort) is unlikely to be far off the mark. In that extensive period, the rate of increase in the level of the Soviet defense effort roughly coincided with the rate of increase in the growth of the Soviet economy. 
6 5
As our defense budgets have risen, the Soviets have increased their defense budget. As our defense budge g have gone down, their defense budgets have increased again.
In short, the past fifteen years offer a happy playground for statisticians eager to establish positive and negative correlations. In practic, ., 337 (in weaponry and C31), and very particular domestic-process considerations to accommodate. In short, American officials and extra-official commentators cannot sensibly support or oppose a particular weapon program, be it MX, LoADS or whatever, on the grounds "that the Soviet Union will respond as follows.. "69
Close study of such Soviet evidence as there is available suggests that the Soviet Union strives to achieve maximum prospective combat effectiveness (in the interest of proletarian internationalism, deterrence, and plain common sense), but that also it is devoted to the preservation of stability on the home military-industry front. Major changes in resource allocation for defense vis a vis non-defense programs, or even between defense programs, are very expensive in the Soviet system. An economy centrally planned on a series of five-year cycles is not the most agile of vehicles for the conduct of an arms competition characterized by an action-reaction process. The more that is learned of Soviet defense industry, and that remains all too little, the less convincing becomes the image of a Soviet defense establishment willing and able to conduct a process of deft thrust and parry in the strategic arms competition.
I am is prepared to believe that the Soviet defense system, writ large, is capable of "lurching" in step-level jumps, given sufficient notice.
In other words, should an American administration decide to raise the level of American defense expenditure by, say, fifty or one hundred percent, one should expect the Soviet defense machine to react. the Soviet Union necessarily could react--even in a gross fashion--as some action-reaction theorists tend to imply. It is not obvious that the Soviet Union could much increase the output of its high-technology industry for defense functions. A Soviet Union devoted to the improvement in its military condition at all levels easily lends itself to misassessment by Western theorists.
Where Western theorists are inclined, by strategic culture, to see purposeful design, one should perhaps see only prudence (defined in Soviet terms).
Benjamin Lambeth has offered the relevant thought that [ilt would probably not be overly facetious to suggest that for Soviet military planners, the favored measure of strgjegic sufficiency is the notion that "too much is not enough".
The Soviet Union has not imposed a condition of strategic inferiority
on the United States. Such a condition, if it exists, is the product of steady momentum, or perhaps just inertia, in Soviet weapon programs, and an enduring deficiency in American attendance upon its strategic-force survival problems. The current crisis in the survivability of the American ICBM force is not the result of a dramatic Soviet arms race challenge, nor need it be read as clear evidence signifying Soviet determination to achieve strategic superiority. Indeed, even to frame the problem in that way probably is to impose a very un-Soviet mode of thinking upon the Soviet defense establishment. Believing that war can occur, and that the quantity and quality of defense preparation (considered expansively) can make the difference between victory and defeat, but all the while hoping that a direct military clash 340 *. . A .
with the United States can be avoided, 
7 4
75
As an arms race participant, the Soviet Union appears not to be racing to achieve any particular relationship of power, unless an appreciation of the political and military benefits of a growing (though necessarily fragile) preponderance, may be so characterized. The Soviet Union, driven both by paranoid fears and by the general belief that coercive power is always useful, can never be satisfied that it has "enough" or "sufficient" military power. In a very dogged, steady, manner--the Soviet defense establishment makes, by and large, marginal improvements in its capabilities, year after year. 
7 7
above, lies in the inherent, structural limitations of Soviet high-technology industry. Soviet officials know very well that they could not win or even sustain a rough parity in a high-technology arms competition with the United States (or with Japan, or West Germany).
In other words, although American carelessness may have yielded them an advantage in the central nuclear balance, narrowly defined, in the 1980s, they cannot-and probably do not--expect that carelessness to continue for much longer.
The model of the arms competition implicit in the above discussion should have an impact upon Western debate over arms control policy. To summarize, the Soviet arms-race/arms-control adversary-partner has the following essential characteristics:
--A total, though long-term, commitment to the demise of Western governments. Detente, or even near-entente (as in the current phase of Sino-American relations), has to be solely a matter of tactical convenience. 78
Both a geopolitical (realpolitik) and an ideological antipathy to the "maritime alliance" which continues to deny it a total imperium over Eurasia.

apparent weakness can cost.

A commitment to offer the most effective defense feasible should war occur. Soviet defense programs are not guided, or inhibited, by any consideration of strategic stability that would be familiar to Western theorists.
--
A stable doctrine, a stable strategy, and a commitment to orderly, stable, defense programs. This is not to deny the probable fact of intra-service rivalry having a biasing effect upon the evolution of quite broad categories of Soviet defense capabilities (for example, consider the shifting
fortunes of Soviet Long Range Aviation), but it is to suggest that the Soviet defense effort, as a whole, is not an instrument capable of playing new tunes on little notice.
Interaction between Soviet and American defense capabilities tends, therefore: to be intermittent and necessarily somewhat broad in its effects at the higher levels of policy direction; to be all but absent at the level of particular major program development (the region classically assumed to be driven by a tight pattern of action-reaction); and to be quite intensive at the sharp end of (tactical) operating detail. Consideration of the evolution of weapon programs from the early 1900s to the present day suggests a surprising degree of autonomy in national rationales.

As noted several times already in this chapter, the principal objective of arms control is to reduce the risk of war occurring. It is time to introduce the thought that there is no very obvious connection between arms control processes, as generally understood, and the likelihood of war occurring.
If anything, the most prominent formal arms control processes of the 1970s, SALT and MBFR, probably contributed in a very modest way
to the enhancement of the likelihood of war occurring. This apparently perverse judgment refers to the known, indeed quite explicit, Soviet theory of the prospects for war.
The Soviet Union holds to the self-serving proposition that the stronger the forces of socialism, the stronger the forces for peace. The prospects for the occurrence of catastrophic East-West war are reduced, according to Soviet logic, if Soviet-led forces are sufficient (and then some) to deter the forces of imperialism from intervening in local conflicts of ....
V.-1 national liberation (or "social progress"). SALT and MBFR should ratify Soviet counterdeterrent power, at least, with reference to the major military capabilities of imperialism--leaving Soviet, Soviet-proxy, and friendly local-indigenous forces free to subvert and "liberate" in the region of genuine political movement (South Asia, Africa and Central America 8 5).
Notwithstanding the importance of the central nuclear relationship and the political-military standoff in Europe, it has to be noted that those areas of competition are not "where the action is" on a day-by-day basis. The Soviet Union can make no major gains in Europe unless it is prepared to wage a major, and nuclear, war. The potential benefits of non-military success in Europe are very high, but so also are the risks.
The East-West demarcation line in Europe has been frozen since the Spring of 1948 (with the pro-Soviet coup in Czechoslovakia).
In the Middle East, South Asia and Africa there are no demarcation lines. Prospective gains are modest, assessed individually, but so also are the risks.
Although I endorse the hallowed trinity of arms control objectives:
to reduce the risks of war occurring; to reduce damage should war occur;
and to reduce the burden of peacetime defense preparation--I do not believe that inter-state formal arms control processes, as pursued thus far, in the 1920s and 1930s, or in the 1970s, have contributed usefully to the forwarding of those objectives. At the least, a strong case can be made for reassessing the sense in such a 1970s institution as SALT. It may be that such a reassessment will lead to deeper insight into the value of SALT as we have known it, but Western knowledge of the arms control process, the character of the negotiating adversary, and the relationship with regard to MBFR, in SALT the U.S.S.R. desires simply to register the i facts of the competition and, insofar as possible, to heip dissuade the American defense community from competing in its region of major comparative advantage. Central nuclear war is a kind of war that the Soviet Union hopes it will never have to fight--but, its reading of the possible calculations of imperialists-in-desperation leads it to conclude that such a war is possible. Hence, there is no way in which the Soviet Union would agree to a SALT reduction regime which impacted noticeably in a negative
way upon its prospective war-waging prowess.
War is a truly serious business, SALT agreements and their political ramifications may be beneficial, but they are several orders of magnitude of less serious import than are defense capabilities.
Fourth, the SALT process as launched by Nixon and Kissinger was seen as an integral part of a much more general architecture of East-West detente.
The historical record of Soviet foreign policy in the 1970s demonstrated conclusively what could easily have been deduced from Soviet statements-specifically, that the detente process, with SALT as its somewhat unfortunate centerpiece, was viewed in Moscow as a reword for the great improvement in the correlation of forces, and that it licensed a more foward Soviet foreign policy. 9 0
Fifth, the SALT process, bearing as it did upon the dominant weapons
of the super-powers, could not possibly support the political traffic that it was required to accommodate. 
9 2
Sixth, as the debate over SALT II in 1979 began to point to problems for a SALT III, the American defense community began to appreciate that the very integrity of a negotiating process limited, for reasons of negotiating convenience, to so-called "central systems" posed prospectively the United States needs to find a "new approach," since clearly the old approach has not produced satisfactory results. 9 3
the United States needs "a better hand" with which to bargain:
"a new approach" will accomplish little, if anything, if the United States continues to lack visible, credible momentum in weapon programs.
--
the United States needs to attend to the quality of its negotiating tactics and strategy. There is ample evidence which would suggest that American SALT negotiators, if they have not given away the store, have at least failed to secure genuinely balanced agreements.
There is something to recommend all three of the above items of advice. Provided one does not focus, for example, upon such a naive 94.
idea as Christoph Bertram's "mission approach" to arms control, it is sensible to have an open mind on new approaches. It is true, virtually beyond argument, that in SALT, to date, the least useful measure has been employed (to count "launchers'--a term which continues to remain undefined). Similarly, there is a growing realization that it is probably a poor idea to isolate so-called "central systems" (understood to refer to "strategic" arms) for isolated negotiating treatment. 9 
5
may prefer not to negotiate with a strategically much stronger United States), or that an agreement 'with teeth'--even with teeth that bit genuinely to the mutual discomfort--would be negotiable, should the U.S.S.R.
elect to continue negotiations. The least contentious of the three items of advice is number three, that the United States should negotiate in a professional and tough-minded manner.
The First Law of Arms Control holds that you will receive through negotiations only that which you have demonstrated a willingness to achieve unilaterally (i.e., there are no "free lunches" in SALT or MBFR). The Second Law of Arms Control holds that you will not receive what you deserve unless you attend meticulously to every detail in the negotiations.
Unlike the United States, the Soviet Union adheres to the precept of -caveat emptor ("let the buyer beware"). Like the Russian peasants from ", which they stem, Soviet SALT negotiators seek to secure a bargain that is weighted in their favor.
It remains an open question whether or not the SALT process and diplomatic institutions of East-West arms control activity are a net liability or benefit to international security. On balance, it appears to be the case that SALT probably is a net liability because, even if it is competently conducted on the Western behalf, even at best it can Western thinking on the nature of a stable military relationship between East and West.
On the basis of observation of their programs and from a close reading of their military literature, one is quite safe in arguing that arms control has not been a major planning factor in the calculation of the Soviet General Staff. Unlike the situation in the Soviet defense community, the United States has negotiated over the period of a decade in SALT while it has been bereft of a stable strategic doctrine. 
97
official seeking wisdom with reference to a particular capability that is the subject of SALT attention. A career-professional General Staff, as in the Soviet Union, is tasked, inter alia, with providing "correct" military solutions to military problems. The United States, with its . lirgering suspicion of "Prussian-style" general staffs, continues to debate even the most basic question of nuclear strategy. 
98
The problem, to simplify, does not lie in "the dynamics of the arms race," rather does it lie in the character of the Soviet political system (which is perhaps the same thing). Although the superpowers share a common interest in the avoidance of war, it is reasonably obvious that Soviet officials see no incompatibility between their vigorous prosecution of strategic arms programs and that common interest. Plausibly, if unconventionally in Western perspective, Soviet officials appear to see no noteworthy danger of war in the dynamics of the arms competition itself.
I agree with them.
The moral of this somewhat depressing story is to the effect that the United States should not inhibit its defense planning activities with (largely spurious) so-called arms control considerations. To the best of our knowledge the Soviet Union does not, and cannot, react program-* for-program, to American arms race behavior. The only sound approach to SALT, or MBFR, is for the United States to pursue an arms policy that is robust in defense of American foreign policy interests. The more robust that policy the better "the hand" available to American arms control negotiators, and the less important will be agreement on arms control.
After all, SALT, for example, only reflects--it does not change--the rules of international politics. As already observed in this chapter, by 1979 the most noteworthy feature of "the great SALT II debate" was the degree to which it was really marginal to matters fundamental to national and international security.
The American body politic should appreciate that the nuclear arms race, so-called, is driven essentially by the political character of the Soviet state. While developments in the arms race can be registered through SALT agreements, anything more fundamental has to rest upon a theory for (or purporting to explain) a benign alteration in the character of the Soviet state. The United States cannot seek "security through SALT," because SALT merely expresses the real world. The true basis for any SALT accord lies in the perceptions of power relationships in SALT-less futures. Foolish proponents of SALT seek to frighten the American public with prognoses of arms-control-unconstrained Soviet strategic deployments--ignoring Soviet systemic fears of American arms competitive activity.
There is no close match between SALT diplomacy, as conducted thus far, and the three classic goals of arms control. Moreover, so different are the Soviet and American concepts of strategic stability that there is no strong case to be made, on the historical evidence, for formal East-West arms control institutions. The only sensible approach to the problem of strategic arms control is a United States' determination to develop a strategic force posture that should deny victory to Soviet arms, and which would extend a not-implausible prospect of success for the United States. Such a posture would mean that the United States would no longer be in the position of the demandeur, and that American officials could genuinely be relaxed over the fate of SALT negotiations.
It is entirely possible that "success" in SALT is beyond the grasp of the United States--no matter what the character of American defense policy. American politicians should not promise that "new approaches" to arms control will produce better arms control agreements. A United
States with a robust strategic-forces' program may be no more able to negotiate a security-enhancing arms-control agreement than was the United States of the 1970s. This should be no great cause for dismay--security flows from programs, not from agreements.
1. This claim, though deliberately phrased strongly, does not extend to the assertion that SALT has dominated U.S. strategic-force planning.
On this very contentious issue see  
Barry Blechman, "Do Negotiated Arms Limitations Have a Future?" Foreign Affairs, Vol.  
As the reason, or excuse, for requiring continuing domestic sacrifice and vigilance. In the interests of discipline at home, the U.S.S.R.
would have to invent foreign enemies if they were not already so conveniently identified by ideology and geopolitics. 64. Logically, there is a third alternative--that Soviet-American antagon- ism will wither and die much as did Christian-Moslem and later Reforma- of freedom of foreign policy decision.
The United States government never decided, explicitly, to move from a condition of strategic superiority to one of parity; rather, such a shift was permitted to occur through the mechanism of freezing the number of strategic missile launchers at the levels attained in 1967, and deliberately eschewing investment in weapons prospectively capable of enforcing damage limitation on a major scale: 
6
For reasons that have to do with a change, perhaps even a permanent change, in American political culture in the late 1960s--or which may pertain to a temporary, though major oscillation between sub-cultures--the concept of strategic superiority ceased even to be respectable among 373 J! policy commentators. Few people appear to be comfortable with the concept of superiority. Although the United States largely has recovered from the collective identity crisis substantially triggered and fed by the Vietnam War, the idea that strategic superiority is both feasible and necessary for Western security has yet to stage a truly convincing comeback.
The propositon central to this chapter is that strategic superiority refers to the ability to win arms competition, crises, and wars. The concept is clear, even if the detail of effective, high-confidence implementation may not be. In his prepared testimony on the SALT II Treaty for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in 1979, Henry Kissinger offered some much-quoted wisdom on the subject.
After an exhausting negotiation in July 1974, I gave an answer to a question at a press conference which I have come to regret: "What in the name of God is strategic superiority?" I asked "What is the significance of it .... at these levels of numbers? What do you do with it?" My statement reflected fatigue and exasperation, not analysis. If both sides maintain the balance, then indeed the race becomes futile and SALT has its place in strengthening stability. But if we get out of the race unilaterally, we will probably be faced eventually with a younger group of Soviet leaders who will figure out what can be done with strategic superiority. / It was one thing to believe, as most American defense officials did in the mid-1960s, that damage-limitation--which, if sufficiently expansive in scale, is synonymous with superiority--would not be feasible for inescapable technical reasons. However, it was quite another to make a virtue of that believed necessity to the point where, retrospectively, it is legitimate to wonder whether the loss of United States strategic superiority was not, to a noticeable degree, a self-fulfilling prophecy. This suspicion is strengthened when one reads the following historical assessment, written by one of the High Priests of parity, Jerome Kahan:
The stated policy of Presidents Kennedy and Johnson was to consider the effect of U.S. strategic weapons decisions on the Soviet Union's programs and the overall stability of the balance. This was explained by Assistant Defense Secretary John McNaughton as early as 1962 and later formalized by Secretary McNamara in his description of the action-reaction phenomenon. The decisions to eliminate vulnerable systems, limit the number of U.S. strategic vehicles to the levels of the mid-1960s, and emphasize assured destruction rather than damage limitation were influenced by a desire to avoid stimulating Soviet reactions or disrupting the stability of the balance, and fight against the deployment of a large U.S. AOM system was increasingly motivated by arms race concerns.
There can be no doubt that through most of the 1960s and 1970s, the United States' defense community, at policy-making levels at least, did not want to pose a major threat to the pre-launch, or penetration, survivability of Soviet strategic forces. 
9
10
As noted above, superiority carries with it a burden of largely substantively irrelevant negative baggage which inhibits intelligent discussion. The case for a meaningful measure of strategic superiority is functionally identical to the case for strategy, properly defined. 
As strategy should relate, in a purposeful way, military power to political i objectives, so superiority is the means for providing that freedom of action essential if policy-makers are not to be paralyzed into inaction, or driven to take paths of unpromising action in case of acute need.
All too often, strategic commentary in the United States remains mired in the bog of static indices of relative strategic power. This prevalent inclination to count defense inputs (launchers, warheads, equivalent megatonnage, and so forth) is understandable, bacause it places little intellectual strain on the commentator. However, defense professionals should not encourage such shallow "analysis" even though the temptation can be strong in the heat of a highly politicized debate over a defense issue. Although it is sensible to argue that the United States should not endorse, for example, prominently visible unfavorable asymmetries in permitted force levels in arms control agreements, it is not sensible Similarly, superiority could be defined in crude input terms that bear not at all upon operational issues. The problem here is that the American defense community has come to accept as fact a largely implicit distinction between political/perceptual and operational analysis. Many, and probably most, commentators who deplore conservative arguments for strategic superiority are persuaded that conservatives really are arguing only for optically relevant, as opposed to operationally meaningful, superiority. This author, for example, is friendly to the following argument advanced by Abram Chayes:
The efforts of strategic analysis to demonstrate that numerical superiority remains meaningfdl or that present force levels can be justified in terms of plausible missions--for example, damage limitation or war fighting capability--have become increasingly labored and unconvincing. Countries should have little difficulty in drawing the political conclusions. For much of the 1970s, and perhaps even today to some degree, the debate over the meaning of strategic inferiority/superiority has been 'owned" by people who held, as an a priori assumption, the belief that nuclear war could only be lost. Hence, there could be no operationally significant debate over superiority. This chapter, in keeping with the thrust of the study as a whole, endorses no such assumption.
It has to be said, though it should be obvious, that strategic superiority is a composite concept. It need not imply a crude numerical preponderance on any particular indices of relative military power. Strategic superiority continues to be undervalued because few people are willing to consider strategic nuclear weapons as to be usable. This author shares at least a good measure of that incredulity (and indeed plain horror), but he is obliged to take explicit account of the following considerations:
--Soviet military science, the foundation for Soviet military strategy, considers nuclear weapons to be not merely usable, but also to be potentially decisive in their effect. 
18
--Nuclear war could happen. Policies of pre-war deterrence cannot be guaranteed to succeed forever.
--Usability and credibility for deterrence are one and the same.
Although strategic superiority easily is defensible conceptually in terms of the familiar Western logic of arms-race, crisis, and the management of sequences of wartime escalation, it is defensible also with reference to a hypothetical case of total deterrence breakdown (pre-
, and intra-war). Ignoring doctrinal labels, "countervailing strategy", essential equivalence, a margin of safety, and the rest, Harold Brown in reality called for a strategically superior United States' defense *condition when he specified the requirement that if they [our potential adversaries] were to start a course of action which could lead to war, they would be frustrated in their effort to achieve their objective or suffer 1 5o much damage that they would gain nothing by their action.
In short, the United States and her allies would defeat the U.S.S.R., or, at the least impose a stalemate ("frustrated in their effort to achieve their objective"), and would hold at risk the essential assets of the Soviet state.
Brown's broad-brush conceptualization of the problem was sensible, but his analysis did not proceed to identify the kind of American force posture which might give credible effect to his "counter- 12. ...I define strategic superiority as the ability by the United States to pose a risk, or at least a perceived risk, to the Soviet Union that it might lose most of its strategib retaliatory force if it pushed a crisis beyond a certain point.
Notwithstanding his "born again" comprehension of the concept of strategic superiority, Kissinger does not, at least to date, recognize the essential connection between counterforce threats and homeland defense. 
2 1
Typically, as noted above, assessment of the Soviet-American strategic balance is conducted almost solely in terms of the gross static inputs to the "balance". Instead, commentators should be encouraged to consider the dynamic prospect for each side of achieving its war aims. In the case of the United States, this involves the novel requirement that war aims for a World War III be identified and promulgated. In the absence of war aims, there could be no strategy--because, very simply, one would not know what one was trying to accomplish. However, if one were totally pessimistic concerning the ability of the United States to limit damage to its homeland, then one might argue that although war aims might have some meaning for a central war that was conducted with a major degree of reciprocated targeting restraint, and a willingness (and physical ability) to negotiate an early termination to a war, the "end-game" could be of no operational significance because the scale o, certain catastrophe would assuredly overwhelm any consideration of political advantage.
Superiority has meaning for strategy only when it is translated into operational terms. If the Soviet Union is judged to be strategically superior to the United States, that judgment subsumes and transcends 381 q-" '
such strategic force inputs as quantities and quality of weapons and communication/assessment assets, and makes reference to a believed ability on the Soviet part to conduct conflict processes (including wars) with " a very good prospect of achieving success. I am not convinced that Harold
Brown was correct when he asserted that t1]he need for essential equivalence reflects the fact that nuclear forces have a political impact influenced by static measures (such as numbers of warheads, throw-weight, equivalent megatonnage) as well as by dynamic evaluations of relative military capability. It requires that our overall force be at least on a par with those of the Soviet Union, and also that they be recognized to be essentially equivalent. We need forces of such a size and character that every nation perceives that the United States cannot be coerced or intimidated by Soviet forces. Otherwise the Soviets could gain in the world, and we lose, not from war, bu1 2 from changes in perception about the balance of nuclear power.
Richard Betts has offered very sensible judgment on the "perceptual impact" dimension of the argument over essential equivalence. He claims that [t]he politics of strategic planning preclude astronomically expensive investments that are rationalized by public relations criteria that diverge from military logic. It is fine to have a strategic force that appears impressive to Third World or European leaders who lack a serious understanding of nuclear strategy, but only if it is consistent with what impresses the most important group of perceivers who are not untutored: the Sniet General Staff and Politburo. (Emphasis in the original).
When one discusses the political meaning of relative strategic nuclear power, one is not leaving behind consideration of probable operational effectiveness. Confusion has been created by all sides to the 1970s debate over the foreign-policy implications of parity, inferiority, superiority and essential equivalence. In particular, proponents of the thesis that perceptions of an unfavorable strategic nuclear imbalance can be Much of the audience for this debate may have believed, and perhaps may still believe, that the debate was about appearances only. "Dovish" spokesmen were correct in arguing that it is foolish to expend scarce resources for militarily meaningless weapons. "Hawkish" spokesmen should have made it very clear that their doctrinal opponents were assailing a position that was not defended.
The static measures of strategic capability--and particularly missile throw-weight--were, and remain, of great consequence because they are the raw material for capability output. In and of themselves, disparities, even large disparities, in launcher numbers and missile throw-weight, though undesirable on political perceptual grounds, should not promote expensive efforts at postural correction. Those disparities have been, and are, important because--when married to navigational improvements permitting CEPs that approach O.lnm--they translated into a unilateral, Soviet ability to conduct a preclusive hard-target counterforce strike. Dr. Kissinger, on one of his less defense-minded days in the mid-1970s, asserted that "throw-weight is a phony issue."
The world, and Dr. Kissinger,
was to learn that throw-weight, far from being a "phony issue," was instead the key to the growing, unmatched, Soviet hard-target counterforce competence.
Debates on strategic issues have an unhealthy tendency to focus upon substantively the least important issues. In 1979 American strategists, so-called, were obsessed with such questions as: "is SALT II truly equitable?;" and "is SALT II verifiable?"--instead of such strategic questions as "does the existence of a particular SALT II regime usefully reduce the risk of war (and if so, how)?"; and "what kind of a military balance, on all levels, projecting from 1979 to 1985 and beyond, are we likely to have vis a vis the Soviet Union?" Similarly, in 1980-81, debate was initiated on the merits of "strategic superiority" and on the issue of whether or not victory is possible in nuclear war. 
25
Parity and superiority cannot be debated intelligently unless they are understood to be codewords for particular kinds of capability. Strategic forces have meaning only in terms of their contribution to the support of foreign policy--one cannot sensibly debate the political or strategic merits of such summary concepts as parity or superiority in 26 an intellectual context innocent of foreign policy considerations.
Similarly, some strategic commentators seem determined to debate the feasibility, or infeasibility, of achieving victory in nuclear war, without 4;., acknowledging the true character of historical circumstances. When commentators, such as this author, seek to spell out just what they mean .4, by victory, and endeavor to explain that American and NATO freedom of choice may well be severely restricted, 
2 7
28
The case for strategic nuclear superiority has to embrace both a persuasive rationale and a persuasive theory of feasibility. It is virtually a definitional truth that a doctrinal leitmotiv of essential equivalence cannot be appropriate for a country, and alliance, which structures its strategy such that strategic nuclear compensation is required in order to offset local deficiencies in Eurasian theaters of potential combat. This doctrinal, intellectual truth does not mean, necessarily, that essential equivalence will not be "good enough."
It may be that the prospect of the catastrophe of nuclear war is so deterring a fear that gradations in anticipated general-war prowess may be irrelevant to foreign-policy decision-making. However, such a thought, if translated into policy terms, constitutes a grave (and unnecessary) risk, is not and defense are very intimately related,

--is trapped in the dynamics of Empire. Retreat anywhere is impossible for fear of the political consequences for the integrity of the whole; while the security of the extant imperial holdings requires an expanding degree of control over the external environment.
--has a strategic culture, born of historical experience, which anticipates and presumes hostility abroad. Such anticipation tends to generate the external referents which then function in a system of positive feedback.
--does not view her foreign policy demarches as aggressive.
Soviet foreign policy is about the business both of fulfilling the prudent security goals of a state surrounded by actual, or potential, enemies (the United States, NATO-Europe, China, Japan), and of forwarding the essential missionary purpose of Soviet power.
--while viewing nuclear weapons as a form of super-efficient artillery, has no difficulty understanding their unique properties and would employ them only in a condition of dire military necessity (in Soviet estimation).
Professor Howard proceeds to argue that ....it would take a great deal to shift me from my own view, that the leadership of the Soviet Union, and any successes they may have within the immediately foreseeable future, are cautious and rather fearful men, increasingly aware of their isolation in a world in which the growth of Marxian socialism does little to enhance their political power, deeply torn between gratification at the problems which beset the capitalist world economy and alarm at the difficulties which those problems are creating within their own empire; above all conscious of the inadequacy of the simplistic doctrines of Marx-Leninism on which they were nurtured to explain a world 3 ar more complex and diverse than Marx or Lenin ever conceived. People's Republic (and the growing quasi-security ties between Beijing and Washington); the potential for defense mobilization in Japan and Western Europe; the enduring fragility of Soviet control over Eastern Europe; the continuing inefficiency of the Soviet economy; the political instability/policy-paralysis consequences of a protracted succession crisis in Moscow; the complex "time bomb" of the nationalities problem within the U.S.S.R. itself...and so on. 
36
Soviet leaders have a dynamic view of the relationships of influence among competing power centers. While they may be genuine in asserting that strategic nuclear parity is all that the Soviet Union requires, 
38
. 4   This argument, though logically sound, could easily mislead if taken too far. One should not assert that "the Soviet Union wants parity."
Instead, one should argue that the Soviet Union, prudently, anticipates the possibility, perhaps even the probability, of war occurring, is attentive to the necessity of homeland damage-limitation, but is reconciled to the long term prospect of being unable to secure an enduring strategic nuclear advantage. It should not be forgotten that although it is plausible to argue that the Soviet Union probably is pessimistic concerning its ability to establish a lasting measure of strategic nuclear superiority, Soviet defense programs proceed on the basis of no known algorithm of sufficiency. 
3 9
States reestablishing a condition of strategic superiority, may be intensely skeptical over the feasibility of such an enterprise. The argument in this study is to the effect that superiority (the ability to wage arms competition, crises, and wars to outcomes that would merit characterization as politically successful) will be neither cheap nor easy to accomplish, .4 but that it is both possible and is well worth attempting. Indeed, it is so desirable, and necessary, that the burden of persuasive analysis really should fall most heavily on the shoulders of those who seek to argue that such a capability cannot be achieved, or, if achieved (briefly), sustained. Nonetheless, without preempting too much of the kind of program . identification specified in Chapter 9, it is incumbent upon the author to outline the practical basis for his argument that superiority is feasible.
An American strategy with a war-waging focus (for improved deterrent * effect) would accommodai the ft, ,mental principle that defense of the 390 American homeland is more important than is damaging the enemy. Above all else, the American political system has to appreciate that one need not, and should not, curl up and play dead in the face of society-wide There probably is some point of damage beyond which a society truly is definitively "out of business". However, it is worth recalling the fact that many societies have survived and eventually recovered from casualty lists well in excess of one-third of the prewar population level.
While we tend to flatter ourselves that the nuclear threat is unprecedented--such flattery is not entirely well deserved. The multi-generational threat of nuclear warfare (i.e., the long-term genetic damage) is indeed unprecedented, but the total character of the threat believed to be posed and the Mongols, and there is good reason to believe that it can survive j the worst that nuclear war planners can devise.
In the American context, nuclear war should not be thought of as an Act of God, to be endured as best may be possible. The amount of * damage likely to be suffered by North America is, significantly, dependent * upon the quantity and quality of the preparations effected. When an American defense analyst argues for "strategic superiority," behind that recommendation should lie a structure of offensive and defensive force postural proposals such that his concern to damage the enemy is balanced fully by his determination to enforce a severe limitation upon the amount and kind of damage that the United States should suffer at home.
American defense planners face an apparently intractable moral-philosophical-strategic problem--"what is (un)acceptable damage?" Pessimism over the ability of the U.S. defense community to limit damage to a noteworthy degree is so ingrained that it is close to heretical to suggest that a nuclear war could be waged, for sound political purposes, in expectation of suffering only acceptable casualties. War, nuclear or otherwise, against a first-class adversary is going to involve a horrific casualty rate.
The advocate of American superiority is neither blind to the potentially catastrophic scale of casualties that may be involved, nor to the whole range of casualty-attenuating policy measures that can and should be taken.
In common with the Soviet defense authorities, the American damage-limiter places but qualified faith in any one instrument for defense. By way of summary, looking to the very late 1980s and early
.*
1990s, damage limitation programs for the American homeland could comprise the following:
--strategic nuclear counterforce attrition of the threat--at source.
--two waves of exoatmospheric attrition of the ballistic-missile threat.
--two waves of endoatmospheric attrition--one high, one low level.
--air defense --civil defense protection of key target sets.
It is well understood today that the key to damage limitation is multi-layering: Faith is not placed in one magically proficient intercept system. Furthermore, realistically it is not assumed even that a BMD system with three or four intercept "layers" would be totally leak-proof.
However, the leakage through such a complex BMD system, in the context of U.S. (and Canadian) civil defense preparation, would be easily compatible with U.S./Canadian societal survival. For deterrence, and actual defense purposes, the key to effectiveness lies in the multi-layering. Even without discussing the possibility of "exotic" (directed energy) active defense technology, this author can envisage, realistically, that the defense could have up to four shots at an incoming warhead. This is a situation wherein, certainly, some warheads penetrate--but, given U.S.
urban-area evacuation, blast and fallout protection, it is not a situation wherein urban-industrial America is destroyed.  felt obliged to dedicate to American non-urban-industrial target sets (e.g., MX/MPS with 4600-9000 shelters--with or without LoADS BMD protection).
The details have to remain imprecise, given the major "unknowns" in the equation, but no great optimism is required for the claim that urbanindustrial America, essentially, can survive a World War III.
Everyone, so it seems has his favorite damage-limitation study.
Many defense commentators will assert that they can find no good grounds for anticipating less than 100 million prompt fatalities for the United States. At the opposite extreme, readers will find some Boeing studies which envisage American losses (prompt fatalities) only at a very low 40 level.
Everybody is honest, they just employ different assumptions.
When this author claims that "victory' is possible in a nuclear war, he envisages the kind of damage-limitation system layering specified above. There is nothing here that is beyond the theoretical scope of 19 8 0s United States' defense technology. Indeed, the prospects for damagelimitation are so promising, and the potential costs of failing to attempt to make such provision could be so terminal, that--to repeat-the burden of proof really should be judged to fall on those who argue against superiority.
There is no discernible enthusiasm for war in Moscow. The Soviet Union is a heavily militarized, but not militaristic, society. The current Soviet leadership, though the beneficiary of the most successful peacetime military buildup in Russian/Soviet history, do not appear to be at all eager to precipitate a "day of reckoning" with the West.
..
Whether or not we choose to emphasize such issues publicly, there can be no denying the possibility that in the course of a general nuclear war, the U.S.S.R. might disintegrate as a centralized political structure.
That possibility is enhanced by the fact that contemporary U.S. strategicnuclear targeting design is directed to seek to exploit the unique weaknesses in the political-bureaucratic architecture of the Soviet Empire.
Strategic superiority , as employed in this section of Chapter 8, means--quite literally--if pressed, the ability to win a war. This means the ability to defeat the military power of the Soviet state and to hold down to a tolerable level the quantity and quality of damage that the Soviet state might inflict upon North America. In short, as noted in detail above, the concept of superiority has fairly clear implications pertaining both to offensive and to defensive capabilities. That period should be judged not to have been a mythical Golden Age, but rather to have been a Golden Age in prospective operational terms.
.,."
The fact that American politicians did not so understand it at the time is neither here nor there.
Considering the explicit and implicit reliance of the United States upon nuclear threats in the crises of the 1950s and early 1960s, there is much to recommend Richard Betts' judgment that if this reliance was a bluff, the Soviets never chose to force the issue, and allowed the crises to be sett4ld on political terms at least minimally acceptable to Washington.
Earlier, again with reference to the crises of the 1950s and early 1960s, Betts offered the pertinent thought that ...although no one can prove that such threats [of U.S. nuclear employment] were effective, there is enough circumstantial evidence that Communist leaders took them seriously to invalidate 2 any confident dismissal of the political utility of superiority.
If it adopts a genuinely balanced offense-defense force posture, a U.S. administration in the 1980s can aspire to restore a strategic relationship which should have the functional merits identified earlier with strategic nuclear superiority. Such a condition requires both an unusual American willingness to think strategically about its defense postural needs, and a willingness to consider damage-limitation to be the dominant defense concept. The leitmotiv for the determinant of U.S. strategic-force requirements cannot, prudently, be the need to ensure that the U.S.S.R. would suffer a great deal of damage by way of U.S. retaliation: such an objective is almost trivially easy to guarantee, given the character of nuclear weapons. Instead, the U.S. leitmotiv should be the need to pose a credible threat of intolerable damage, in Soviet terms, all the while rendering it very unlikely that the Soviet Union would be able to effect intolerable damage upon the United States.
Many, and probably most, commentators recoil from the idea of superiority because they hold to notions of acceptable/unacceptable damage which are wholly inappropriate vis a vis nuclear war. In common with some generic critics of nuclear strategy, I am not indifferent to the "* moral, immoral, or plain amoral, aspects of the subject. What after all, could be "worth" tens of millions of lives? It is morally repugnant even to pose the question. Nonetheless, there is no nuclear posture and strategy likely to be available to the United States which would not, by way of a net assessment in prospective operational terms, cost American society 10-20 million fatalities--and that refers to a hypothetical war wherein the United States fares very well indeed. The problem is .q really one wherein choice is severely restricted. I believe that the range of real choice embraces survivable and non-survivable catastrophe.
Also, quite probably, many of the survivors of a World War III would judge the political issues supposedly at stake to have been as trivial, relative to the casualty list, as were the issues that underlay the 1914-18
war.
The fact remains that East and West are locked into a threat and counterthreat system from which the nuclear-weapon element cannot be removed. Indeed, for reasons of elementary geopolitics the NATO Alliance is more dependent upon nuclear threat for security than is the U.S.S.R.
It appears to be a fact that for good Russian/Soviet historical reasons, Moscow takes an amoral instrumental view of the value of its citizens.
Western strategists have to contend with the unfamiliar fact that the Soviet adversary does tend to take a nuclear cannon-fodder approach to its civilian dependents. This is not to say that Soviet leaders are

indifferent to the prospect of a catastrophic level of civilian casualties, but it is to say that such a level is deemed "acceptable" given the political issues anticipated to be at stake. As was outlined in Chapter 1,
the United States has no choice other than to play in the threat system, and that, today, means the nuclear threat system. International politics has not changed its nature from Ancient China and Ancient Greece to the present day. Affluent societies unwilling to act responsibly in defense of their own interests inevitably go down before the Barbarians. There is every good reason to reject the Greek tag that "the Barbarians, after all, were some sort of solution."
The uses of strategic superiority may be summarized as the possession of freedom of diplomatic action in peacetime; the ability to wage crises in expectation of acceptable political outcomes; and the capability, if need be, to wage and survive war at any level. On the last point, it is not a very telling argument to claim--accurately enough, in all probability--that the societal survival envisaged encompasses acceptance of perhaps twenty million casualties. I do not find the prospect of twenty million, one million, or indeed any number of casualties any more "acceptable" than does the next person. But, war may occur for reasons that currently are unpredictable, or are only dimly appreciated, and--historically--the United States could, and would, recover from such a catastrophe. The problem is that there is no wide range of choice. The United States could vastly reduce the geopolitical extent of its security perimeter, but that would not alter the character of the international threat system-- The case for strategic superiority virtually makes itself once one succeeds in discarding the astrategic dicta that were popular from the mid-1960s until the late 1970s. For example, the following propositions summarize the mind-set which continues to ennervate the U.S. defense community. These propositions are all either false or irrelevant:
--"...parity is the only criterion on which political agreement-both internal and external--can be built.' 
4 3
4 7
The Soviet leadership knows, couresy of first-hand experience in the fall and winter of 1941-42 that military operations can be a close-run 48 thing.
To reassert the case for strategic superiority probably is impossible for any U.S. administration. The reason, simply, is that under pressure of appropriately skeptical questioning, such an administration would have to anticipate being compelled to specify its expectations regarding American casualties--and those have to appear to be unacceptably high.

called "central" strategic nuclear systems are bound to favor the Soviet Union--no matter how equitable the agreement secured. 
5 2
Strategic superiority does not mean war without pain. It has been contended above, theoretically, that arms races, crises, and wars, can be won--even in the nuclear age. Moreover, painful though nuclear victory might be, there is no good reason to suppose that such a victory would either be virtually indistinguishable from defeat, or that such victory would not be worth attaining.
In practice, at some time in the 1980s, Western political-military options may narrow to a point where fine-drawn considerations of political merit are all-but irrelevant. The issue may be, should Soviet forward diplomacy be halted here (wherever "here" happens to be in 1984 or 1985)?
The U.S.S.R. certainly publicly would resist an American bid to regain strategic superiority just as vigorously as its propaganda instruments permit. Soviet "scholars" from the various Institutes of the Soviet to be acquired if budgetary circumstances permit (which they never seem to), instead it is a prerequisite for a robust chance for survival.
Inexact terminology can impede productive discussion. Virtually the entire U.S. defense community agrees that it is essential for the Soviet Union to be denied victory (in prospect--for a robust deterrence regime). However, it is important to recognize that the denial of Soviet victory is not, logically, necessarily identical either with Soviet defeat or with the denial of American defeat (in American terms). For example, the Soviet union might be denied achievement of its political goals through  reassuring to appreciate that the American military experience does, in fact, point to a usefully wide range of policy options. Nonetheless, a close observer of the American defense debate of the past ten years could not help but notice the doctrinal rigidity which appears to have characterized different schools of thought.

In principle, at least, Americans should be the least likely people to coalesce into doctrinally dogmatic, apparently exclusive groups. 
6
It is fashionable to argue that a thousand flowers should be encouraged to bloom and that one person's theory is as good as the next. This study prefers to hew closely to the ideal of American pragmatism and to argue that many of the candidate nuclear postural/doctrinal concepts for the United States in the 1980s and 1990s have already been tested (though short of battle, of course), have been found wanting, and should be identified clearly as inferior ideas. Policy options that have been demonstrated by history, with reasonable plausibility, not to "work," should be identified as such. There is no virtue in showing respect for ideas that are demonstrably incorrect. I believe that the discussion in this concluding chapter, resting as it does upon the myriad of detail and proposition which precedes it, should take due account of politically noteworthy postural/doctrinal options, but should not hesitate to identify insupportable options as such. This study is not written solely from the perspective of the scholar eager to demonstrate his grasp of all arguments regardless of merit.
Instead--while committed firmly to the mission of comprehending each school of thought on its own sub-cultural terms--this study is directed towards the identification of a United States strategic-force posture and doctrine which most nearly matches the foreign policy duties predictable for the 1980s and 1990s.
In descending order of concern, the strategic nuclear forces of the United States are charged with: the deterrence of massive counterurban/industrial strikes; the deterrence of massive counterforce/counterpoliticial strikes; and the ability to exercise coercive influence on behalf of forward-placed allies, or exposed American forces, by way of extended deterrence. In fine-grained detail, these tasks were outlined by Herman Kahn in the early 1960s in his books On Thermonuclear War 8 and On Escalation. 
9
While some alternative strategic force postures do come with "optional extras," depending upon how much insurance one feels moved to purchase, the fact remains that the required character of the strategic force posture, and the doctrine that it expresses, largely is (or should be) determined by the character of the American foreign policy that it is required to support and the political-military capabilities and nature of likely adversaries. For a leading contemporary example, the official in-house, 415 and--scarcely less significant--the Eurasian allies of the United States have proved in practice to be exceedingly nervous of defense postural/ doctrinal "improvements" which appear to make the international political system safer for local or theater wars. 
14
Although emphasizing conventional forces will tend to raise the "threshold" in local conflicts for the Western use of nuclear weapons, a conventional-emphasis stategy could actually provi e the Soviet Union with incentives to escalate in time of war.
Among the worst sins committed by policy-contending defense analysts is an inability to listen to the arguments of "the other side." This study offers a preferred policy option, but that option is offered on the basis of characterizations of alternatives that doctrinal opponents should acknowledge to be fair. All too frequently policy debaters choose not to hear the arguments of "the other side" (after all, why should the devil be accorded his day in court?). This author has a clearly preferred strategic posture and strategic doctrine in mind, which is advanced in this chapter, but he is open to the logic of alternative perspectives. Opponents of the preferred option may cavil over the logic of the argument, but they should not be able to allege that their arguments have not been presented fairly.

(5) damage limitation with defense dominant.
-. To return to a theme raised above, this vitally important section is respectful of the motives of individuals, but it is not particularly respectful concerning arguments that are easily refuted with regard to historically well-referenced evidence. This subject is so important that folly, and fools, should be exposed when necessary. Nuclear strategy, and deterrence more generally, tends to be taught in universities and war colleges in a doctrinally permissive mode. That is to say, students are exposed to rival theorists and are educated to believe that there really is no source of authority on the subject. For example, at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, students are asked to compare and contrast this author's opinions with those of Professor Robert Jervis.17
The idea that there may be a "correct" theory is inimical to contemporary liberal scholarship.
Braving the charge of hubris this chapter offers not merely a preferred posture and doctrine, but also a posture and doctrine that the author claims is objectively correct, given U.S. foreign policy, the nature of the enemy, and what is technically feasible. Among the more debilitating features of the American defense debate is the fact that truly fundamental doctrinal issues, seemingly, are never resolved. For example, seven years from its inception, the MX ICBM debate, today, continues to be plagued by arguments that betray themselves as being innocent of understanding of why the United States might require the services of a land-based ICBM force with its distinctive characteristics. In the very early 19 8 0s, many people seem to believe that the mere allegation/ demonstration of environmental damage certain to be caused by MX/MPS is a strong argument against the system. Strategists, properly so-called, have always recognized the certainty of environmental damage, that is not the Issue; the issue is how substantial are the strategic benefits of MX/MPS deployment likely to be to the United States.
Although this study prefers option (4), as detailed below, it should not be imagined that the other options will be slighted as a consequence of that prior choice. If anything, the other options will be taken more seriously than truly they merit, lest a charge of cardboard targeting be filed.
(1) Option One: mutual assured vulnerability
The United States could decide that nuclear war-fighting and intrawar deterrent ideas were an illusion and that security could best be forwarded by advertising, and acting programmatically upon, the basis of that decision. The matching U.S. strategic posture would be designed to hold at risk, under all circumstances of attack, a very large number of Soviet urban areas and other economic targets believed to be essential to recovery from war. That number might be 100 or even more. U.S. strategic forces could be designed and sized for extravagant redundancy, in that one might require that each leg of the strategic triad be capable, independently, of effecting the identified level of damage.
Although this posture and doctrine often is termed one of finite or minimum deterrence, and not infrequently, when advocated, is accompanied by the opinion that even a handful of nuclear weapons on a handful of cities would, in all likelhiood, suffice to deter and would certainly, if executed, be viewed as a societal catastrophe, 
18
Defense Department spokesmen in 1967 and 1968 often spoke and wrote in very prominent terms of the merits of mutual assured vulnerability, but critics (and admirers) of the idea of mutual assured vulnerability should not confuse rhetoric with operational policy. 
1 9
In the interests of civility and accurate communication, rival debaters from contrasting schools of thought should be discouraged from debating caricatures of their opponents' arguments and public relations' acronyms and pejorative slogans that are inaccurate. Nuclear strategy is a difficult enough subject when discussed fairly, without the added complications of deliberate or careless misrepresentation. Quite often, the first victim of the telling oversimplified caricature is the author himself.
For example: advocates of a finite deterrence approach to the quality and size of the strategic force posture are interested in mutual vulnerability, not in executing mutual destruction. and should be done in the event that deterrence fails. This author assumes that all theorists are morally equal, though they are not all equally prudent or competent in their logic and prescriptions.
This first postural option rests upon the following beliefs:
1. Nuclear war would be a catastrophe unparalleled in world history.
2. Nuclear war could not be controlled or limited
Probably the greatest risk of nuclear war will not stem from Soviet leaders who are insufficiently deterred, but rather from Western nuclear war-fighting theorists who may mislead policy-makers into believing that nuclear weapons can be employed, like other weapons, as a political instrument. 
use of such weapons would be judged to be much more likely.
All men fear nuclear war and, moreover, they fear it to roughly the same degree.
Cultural nuance is not important in the nuclear deterrence system. A very large nuclear war means the same thing to all 24 cultures.
In principle, there is some political-analytical merit in pointing to possible cultural distinctions between countries which may affect deterrent reasoning. But, in practice, the sheer scale of damage that widespread nuclear war would impose renders discussion of operational nuclear strategy largely moot.
Nuclear war, should it occur, would hold the participants (and many bystanding states) open to a limitless liability. Mutual assured vulnerability is not a posture and doctrine of choice-there is no choice.

1. Nuclear war may or may not prove to be a catastrophe unparalleled in world history, but it is highly unlikely to be the functional cataclysmic equivalent of the biblical flood. In the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries, the Mongols and bubonic plague were viewed in much the same eschatological terms in which many people today view nuclear war. Those "visitations from God" were terrible, but mankind remained in business. As Herman Kahn sought to establish more than twenty years ago, catastrophe . can come in different sizes and with very different consequences.

counterforce capability is destabilizing, Soviet weapon deployments do not betray any sensitivity to this concern. In the Soviet view, the prevention of war is totally a political function, it is the task of the armed forces to prepare efficiently for the actual conduct of war. 
39
Small nuclear strike options would be intended both to provide a deterrent shock and to carry the clear threat of "more to come, unless .... " By executing a limited nuclear option, one would have signaled determination through actions in that two major thresholds would be crossed (use of central nuclear forces, and employment most probably against the homeland of a superpower.) 
4 3
Proponents of mutual assured vulnerability with flexibility have not been unmindful of the perils of this option (in terms of their core beliefs about stability and "what deters.' 
4 4
Manned bombers and cruise missiles inherently are inappropriate for most (though not all) LNO missions, because Soviet air defenses would not have been suppressed in advance. Also, SLBMs would be inappropriate because there may not be submarines "on station" to execute such a mission; communication may not be adequate (or even possible); and an SSBN comes with a number of SLBM warheads and an SSBN betrays its position by launching even a single missile.
With respect to the flexible and small-scale employment of nuclear weapons, extreme accuracy--as can be provided, in this context, only by ICBMs--is desirable because the use of small warheads, creating the least possible collateral damage, is therefore feasible.
In the immediate context of this discussion, flexibility implies very small-scale employment. However, there is no inherent reason why flexibility need refer only to the very limited end of the employment spectrum. Flexibility is a strategy-neutral concept, long appreciated as a political and military desideratum. Soviet military science, too, endorses flexibility, though with specific referents that are far removed indeed from the context of the American debate of the mid-1970s. ment plan than effective intra-war deterrence. It would be profoundly imprudent to begin a small nuclear war unless one had to hand a capability for waging, surviving, and recovering from a large nuclear war.
(3) Option Three: counterforce and counter-control preeminence with recovery denial Option Three is U.S. defense policy today. Unfortunately the intellectual task, in part for terms-of-reference reasons, was severely flawed with respect to its overall policy integrity. 
53
Through intelligent targeting design the United States could deny the Soviet Union victory, even in Soviet terms.
Appreciation of the fact that relative (to the U.S.S.R.) U.S.
strategic-force capability, on all important measures of merit, either has slipped already into the inferior category, or soon will do so. As with the U.S. Army's characterization of its operational problem, the issue here is how to "fight outnumbered and win., 
'58
In terms of putative deterrent effect, the United States would be able, in extremis, as its ultima ratio, to promise credibly to the Soviet Union that its ability to recover from World 442 t

agreed that sub-SlOP level LNOs were uninteresting; that massive countereconomic (recovery) strike options were not obviously useful either for "up front" declaratory-policy-for-deterrence purposes, or for operational reasons; and that World War III, should it occur, could be either very short or relatively long (perhaps six months). Genuinely strategic thinkers, a category always in very short supply, have some severe reservations over the plausibility of long World War III campaign scenarios.
Over the past three years many defense analysts have come to be excited over the issue of the endurance of strategic forces and the National Command Authority, but--somehow--the idea that (relatively) long wars are possible moved from the status of idea to that of driving planning assumption without benefit of very close strategic analytical scrutiny.
On close inspection, one discovers that although six-month wars are possible, six-day or six-week wars are no less possible, and are indeed probably 2. The idea of the second-strike counterforce "equalizer" is attractive, and has some theoretical merit, 
6 5
It is healthy for deterrence that the Soviet leadership be told that it, and its means for enforcing domestic and imperial political control, are targeted reliably. However, countercontrol targeting has some severe problems. The United States Any American official, or extra-official defense analyst, should know that his country is and has always been acutely sensitive to American human loss. Save in the Civil War, high casualties have not been the American military experience--and they have not been politically acceptable.
Hence, the traditional American preference for profligate firepower to reduce (American) casualty rates. Behind Option Three is full recognition of Soviet rejection of the concept of a strategic stability reposing upon the basis of mutual assured societal vulnerability. But, Option Three, or PD 59, accepts prospectively in perpetuity the assured vulnerability of American society. The drafters of PD 59 did not so much reject American homeland damage limitation, rather did they ignore it as a possibility.   What is the logic of Option Four?
1. In the absence of the ability to hold down American casualties (and economic damage) to a level "acceptable" in the context of the most important political interests being at stake, American strategy is either a bluff or is heroically irresponsible. 
7 3
But, no matter how intelligent or clever U.S. strategic nuclear offensive targeting design may be, the credibility of execution of such design is very low so long as the United States makes no noteworthy provision for the protection of its homeland against (near) inevitable Soviet retaliation.
4. If the sole problem were the deterrence of a massive Soviet assault upon North America, then the case for homeland damage limitation would be far less persuasive. Unfortunately, virtually every one of the more plausible, or less implausible, scenarios that involve possible employment of central nuclear systems, has to be structured--for reason of the very probable geography of conflict--such that it is the United States that most needs to restore deterrence through the issuing of credible threats and, if need be, the implementation of nuclear strike plans.
The absence of protection for the American homeland, in these most likely circumstances, should literally prove to have a paralyzing impact upon the freedom of action of a desperate U.S. president.
No one can Predict with any high degree of assurance the course of a central nuclear war. Intra-war deterrence may function as hoped (if not expected). However, there is a very significant chance that the superpowers would prove to be incapable of controlling a central war; while there is also a strong prospect that the Soviet Union would not be interested in any idea of control likely to prove tolerably congruent with American wishes or interests. In short, for the extant official American theory of strategic deterrence to prove robust in its hours of real test (acute crisis and war itself), a quite extraordinary degree of good fortune would have to bless its endeavors. Above all else perhaps, the Soviet war plan, in practice, would have to violate virtually every known precept of Soviet strategic culture. 
7 4
7 5
However, a prudent defense posture and doctrine can hardly be constructed on the basis of such an expectation.
Ideologically, the Reagan national security bureaucracy is not at all opposed to the logic of points 1-5 above. But, in practice, the shift from offense dominance to offense-defense balance would strain any national security system. The American problem today, as always, is strategic-conceptual at root. Defense decison-makers wish to do the right things, but they do not know what those things are. The Secretary of Defense may, or may not, be persuaded that the low altitude defense system (LoADS) would work adequately, at the level of a "technical fix," but he may not be open to argument on the subject of basic American deterrent philosophy. The Reagan Administration entered office with a mandate to correct the adverse trend in relative military preparation, but not with a mandate to adopt one, or another, alternative national security strategy. For Option Four to be adopted officially, the U.S.
government would need to address, and be educated concerning, fundamental defense issues.
This study has argued the value of strategic considerations.
The case for strategy is as strong in relation to the expanding Reagan defense budgets of the 1980s as it was in relation to the declining defense budgets of the 1970s. The Reagan Administration is committed to rebuild U.S. military power, but it needs also to rethink the conceptual basis of that power. The Administration is willing to pour funds into new programs, but it may also have to be willing to engage long-standing domestic adversary constituencies in direct debate. should tell these American people the truth. There is no good substitute for a land-based ICBM force, and that force is going to have a net negative environmental impact somewhere, wherever and however it is Possible objections to Option Four include the following:
1. Casualties and economic damage in nuclear war cannot plausibly be held down to "acceptable" levels.
In the words of Bernard Brodie, "[w]hether the survivors be many or few, in the midst of a land scarred and ruined beyond all present comprehension, they should not be expected to show much concern for the further pursuit of political-military objectives. 
'' 76
2. Denying victory is all very well, but some not inconsiderable doubt remains over the real authority of the (alleged)
Soviet official belief that victory is possible in nuclear war. 
7 7

'79
Persuasive sounding arguments can be designed pro and con on a wide range of strategic postures and doctrines. No one's theory of intra-(nuclear) war deterrence or damage limitation has yet been road-tested, while the possible reasons why war is prevented or does not occur are so various, and impossible to assay, that one cannot sensibly point to the evidence of nuclear peace since 1945 as clear and unambiguous proof of the merit of any particular theory of 457 4-deterrence. Option Four is designed to cope with an unusually stressful set of circumstances--where deterrence is particularly difficult to effect or simply does not apply. American diplomacy, day-by-day, certainly does not need the support of Option Four, but this author believes that in the event of the true "war is in sight" crisis nothing less than Option Four would be adequate--while even this option may not suffice to deter or to hold wartime damage down to an acceptable level.
(5) Option Five: damage limitation with defense dominant
The reasoning behind Option Five is more prudential and ethical than it is strategic. As the late Donald Brennan wrote in 1969:
I do not believe that any of the critics of BMD have even the beginnings of a plausible program for achieving major disarmament of the offensive forces by, say, 1980. Many of them seem committed to support a strategic posture that appears to favor dead Russians over live Americans. I believe that this choice is just as bizarre as it appears; we should rather prefer live Americans to dead Russians, and we should not choose dl3iberately to live forever under a nuclear sword of Damocles.
Since the mid 1960s, the United States has endorsed a theory of strategic stability which holds that the active and passive defense of a superpower homeland is not merely infeasible, it is undesirable.
Nuclear peace was judged to rest, most reliably, upon the accurate perception by all policy-makers, and policy-relevant publics, that in the event of war catastrophe could and probably would be unlimited.
In keeping with this (American) belief, SALT I and the abortive SALT would not be totally leak-proof--and residual doubts would remain in the minds of politicians over just how efficient their untested defenses would prove to be in combat.
Nuclear war would remain a terrible prospect, but it would not remain a total society threatening prospect.
The quantity and quality of societal damage that could be imposed on the Soviet Union would be reduced (assuming a bilateral superpower move to a defense dominant posture)
to the point where the United States and her friends and allies would worry about the feasibility of the extended deterrent duties that traditionally had been charged to the strategic offensive forces. 82  The argument probably would proceed as follows: the credibility of American offensive action would be very high, because of the limited liability to which American society could be held in a defense dominant world, but the quality of nuclear deterrence would certainly be reduced by virtue of the same condition.
(In effect, this world is "safe" for war, nuclear and otherwise). Aside from the residual uncertainty about the real, operational effectiveness of heavily deployed active defenses, the Soviet Union should be compelled by American and NATO-European (and Chinese) conventional, and battlefield nuclear deployment to doubt its ability to prevail in the theater.
Five should grant that they have a serious problem in the area of extended deterrence, but argue that that problem needs to be set against the prospect of removing the danger of unlimited nuclear catastrophe from the human race.
I am sympathetic to the motives of those who favor Option Five, but am not persuaded that a defense dominant world is either technically feasible or strategically desirable. For example, it is just possible that the current research on directed energy weapons will produce a preclusive, truly leak-proof, defense against ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, and manned bombers, but such a prospect would serve to direct military research into the region of countermeasures (including directed energy weapons intended to shoot first at "their" directed energy weapons) and offensive weapons impervious to such defenses. Skeptical commentary on Option Five takes the following form:
1. It is not at all obvious that a defense dominant world, as opposed to a useful level of defense for damage limitation, is technically feasible. Even if it is feasible, the pertinent time horizon for full operational capability probably is on the order of fifty years (or more). Furthermore, although the Soviet Union is known to favor assured survival, it is not known to favor mutual assured survival.
There are some good reasons for the drastic reduction in strategic offensive arsenals, but those reasons are not easily compatible with Western ideas concerning a more stable international order.
2. Of course a breakdown could occur in the existing system of nuclear threat--that is not at issue. What is at issue is whether such a breakdown would, or would not, be far more likely to occur should the major powers effect the postulated transition to defense dominant strategic arsenals.
It may be accurate to paint a glowing picture of a world freed from dread of the nuclear sword of Damocles, but such a world--by definition--would offer vastly reduced painful consequences for folly, adventure and mismanagement.
Such a reduction could well have a very marked negative impact upon the incidence of major crises and wars. MC-14/3 of 1967, with its endorsement of the concept of flexible response, would be rendered obsolete.
It is highly improbable that the friends and allies of the United States would be willing to consider the possible merits of Option Five against the certain, potentially catastrophic implications of this option for their own national security. It would be argued by NATO-European officials and commentators that the United States foolishly was choosing to destroy the structure of mutual nuclear deterrence which helped to preserve peace. For fear of the possible ultimate donsequences for American society, the United States was designing an international military order wherein, de facto, her allies would be expendable.
However remote this reasoning would be from the reality of American motivation, it would have more than a little logical merit.
Option Five was advocated very strongly by Donald Brennan in the late 1960s, but it has no significant following today.

There may seem to be a theoretical artificiality about the discussion of five discrete postural-doctrinal options in this chapter. After all, the U.S. Government makes its strategic program decisions incrementally--there is never a right time for shifting gears to a different posture. Each administration is the legatee of the program decisions of its predecessors and inherits weapon programs, and strategy and targeting choices, that cannot feasibly be terminated or very substantially reoriented for reason of very large sunk costs. Notwithstanding these considerations, the case for strategy reappraisal is overwhelminq.
The American public has a right to expect that defense policy should be treated, inter alia, as an economic problem--that is to say as a problem in the efficient allocation of scarce resources.
It should not be politically acceptable to testify before Congress to the effect, simply, that more effort is required across-the-board.
Individual weapon programs should make strategic sense within the framework of a coherent theory of war--for improved deterrent effect and as insurance should war occur nonetheless. The lead-time on weapon development may well pose very serious problems for senior officials attempting to compose a coherent military posture, but at the least those officials should have a clear vision of whither they are intending.
If strategic debate, worthy of the name, is not a dominant feature of discourse concerning contentious weapon systems, the Department of Defense only has itself to blame.
The five postural-doctrinal options outlined in this chapter provide but one framework for strategic-theorical discussion. If some readers do not like them, they are at liberty to invent their own.
The important point, which should be non-controversial, is that money
should not be expended upon defense programs in the absence of plausible strategic rationales.

This argument should have been settled definitively by Kahn's On Thermonuclear War, more than twenty years ago. It is not helpful or sensible to argue, as does Glenn Buchan, that " t he burden of proof must be on any decision-maker who would consider a general nuclear war to convince himself ...that the risks of a nuclear war are manageable, and that the outcome could be predicted with sufficient certainty to make war a viable policy option." "The anti-MAD mythology," p. planning.
It simply has to be a viable policy option. Critics of counterforce, damage-limiting strategies often gives the appearance of believing that they are saying something tolerably original and significant when they cite the horrors of nuclear war. Nuclear strategists do not need to be reminded of the penalty society would, or could, pay should deterrence fail.  intelligence (C 1) facilities are hardened, dispersed and redundant--those of the United States, as yet, are not.

In an increasingly complex and dangerous world, Soviet leaders know that the one element that is very unlikely to fail them is the Russian/Soviet soldier.
Finally, in Soviet perspective it is no more than common sense to allow soldiers to determine military questions. The conduct of war is not a game, nor--for a centrally located, substantially land-locked power-can war be approached with a view to achieving some desirable measure some of it at bitter first hand, that war tends to be a matter of national survival or extinction. While soldiers, in peacetime, may make terrible mistakes in planning, on balance they are more likely to design militarily sensible plans--since they themselves will have to execute them--than are civilians.
Quite unintentionally, this study may help to promote a pervasive fallacy. Specifically, while theories and theorists can be important, not infrequently the world is driven not so much by ideas as by the multitude of details of implementation of ideas--and those details may have a connection with the master ideas so tenuous as virtually to be nonexistent. Western strategists are prone to quote Clausewitz On War to the effect that [ilts war's] grammar, indeed, may be its own, but not its logic.
and to stress the non-(militarily)autonomous (political) logic of war. This is sensible, but it could be fatal if it betrays an inadequate understanding of the "grammar" of war.
It is virtually certain that a U.S. Soviet officials tell us that the Soviet Union does not believe in limited central nuclear war--although nuclear war limited to a particular geographical theater of operations may be something else. This claim should be taken at face value.

In practice a Soviet Politburo might seek to impose targeting restraint upon its military machine, but such should not be expected is exercised will likely accord more with military than with (Western) political algorithms.
On the evidence available, it is prudent for the American government to assume that in the event of central nuclear war the Soviet Union will not seek only to deny victory to the United States; to terminate the war (on any terms) as rapidly as possible; or, generally, to engage in coercive nuclear diplomacy. Instead, the evidence suggests that the Soviet Union will seek political victory through military victory. They postural-doctrinal response.
The postural-doctrinal response specified here requires that the United States take seriously the now, and belatedly, fairly general belief that deterrence and defense are but one and the same. It is strange to observe that although center-conservative opinion is almost desperately eager to endorse U.S. strategic offense designs and capabilities that carry the promise of denying victory to the U.S.S.R.,

The problem appears to be as much intellectual as technical. American strategists, by and large, seem to be resistant to the idea that most likely it will be the United States, not the Soviet Union, which "goes first" (or very seriously considers "going first") with central nuclear systems, for reason of the enduring planned insufficiency of forwarddeployed theater forces. In other words, the principal U.S. strategic problem is not the deterring of a Soviet first strike, rather is it the design of a total nuclear war campaign capability such that a first strike could be executed backstopped by a robust theory of sequential escalation dominance. The authors of PD 59 should have thought through the protracted nuclear campaign problem, but--predictably--they did not.
Also, today it is popular to preface even very defense-minded analysis with the observation that the U.S. problem, first, foremost, and possibly exclusively, is deterrence. In other words, many people who are arguing, objectively, for so-called "war-fighting" capabilities, find it politically expedient to remind their audience that the name of the game is deterrence.
Such pre-emptive surrender on the part of nuclear strategists may be politically intelligent, but it is not strategically sound. Quite aside from the major qualification, noted above, to the effect that the deterrent problem may be one of self-, rather than other-, deterrence, it is as likely as not that should a nuclear war occur it will occur with a sequence of outbreak events to which deterrence is irrelevant.
The most likely political scenarios for World War III entail, first, a truly desperate Soviet Union, convinced that its Empire is collapsing, seeing no alternative to military action (nuclear vistas regardless).
Second, World War III could erupt out of an unplanned crisis that evolved according to the "grammar of war" and was not orchestrated by the strategic scenarists of either side. In short, by implication, the United States needs a defense posture that assures national survival both in cases where very high quality deterrence can make the difference to national policy decision-making, and in cases where deterrence simply does not apply. 
13
It is not enough that American icy-.akers acknowledge the strategic- What is required is that they consider carefully both the impact of strategic culture upon defense programs and ideas, and--above all else--the probable fate of the two strategic cultures if ever they should find themselves locked in combat. How well would we do? 
To be specific, Thomas Schelling and Herman Kahn. The influence of these two theorists may easily be exaggerated, but it would be difficult to deny that each of them contributed very noticeably to the parameters of nuclear policy debate. At the very least they both made large, obvious, and enduring contributions to the language of nuclear policy debate.

Notwithstanding the prodigious efforts of scholars to provide an explicit "data base" of historical crises, the (possibly unfortunate) fact remains that the historical and social-scientific education of the average senior American policymaker remains lamentably elementary. His understanding of the dynamism of crises tends to be limited to: any crisis decision-making in which he participated personally; the Cuban Missile .* Crisis of October 1962; the crisis slide of 1936-39; and the crisis slide of 1914. 4 4 Unfortunately, each of these historical cases for easy reference constitutes a quite distinctive "dominant scenario." Moreover, with respect to October 1962, and particularly 1914, it is far from obvious that scholars agree at any useful level concerning the lessons of successful (1962) and unsuccessful (1914) crisis management. Indeed, 1914 is an extreme case of crisis pathology45--one might well learn more from the successful crisis management practiced by the Great Powers in 1908-1909 over the Bosnian crisis.

Although they carry some risk of a wider war erupting, local crises are--on occasion--the deliberate and intended outcomes of the policies of the Soviet Union. Even if Western policymakers are unable to foment local crises in the prospect of political gain, they should not forget the fact that Soviet policymakers, although not wanting war, do see (some) local crises as advancing Soviet power. Disorder, instability, crisis and war are all, by definition, undesirable in Western perspective--but not, necessarily, in the Soviet view. that In wartime, military doctrine drops into the background somewhat, 287 .......................... . . .

Barry Blechman, former Assistant Director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), has offered the following judgments on the course of the SALT II debate in the late summer and fall of 1979: Although passage was far from certain, betting in Washington was that approval by the full Senate would be in hand by Thanksgiving. The subsequent travails of the treaty are traceable not to the surfacing of any new arguments about the agreement itself, nor to new information about the balance of strategic weapons, but to other types of events [Soviet combat brigades in Cuba; the Tehran hostage crisis; and, finally, the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan]. 5 Blechman's words, quoted here, raise again the basic question: "what are the right reasons for approving or disapproving a SALT agreement?" It is quite evident from the historical record that SALT, process and agreements, by the late 1970s, was markedly different from the dominant

Western commentators should never forget that Soviet military professionals believe that war, in all its aspects, lends itself to "scientific" study. Soviet texts on "military science" should be taken at face value as reflecting the genuine Soviet approach to the subject.

First, the Soviet adversary, while respectful of American defenseindustrial power and technological prowess (witness the ABM Treaty of 197787), is not at all respectful of American theories of strategic stability. Second, the Soviet Union cannot be persuaded to sign arms control agreements which would forfeit the right to wage war, should it occur, as efficiently as feasible in defense of the Soviet homeland. A condition of mutual vulnerability is not negotiable. Mutual vulnerability and mutual deterrence may be strategic facts of life, but the Soviet Union will never endorse those ideas as desiderata.
Third, notwithstanding the juvenile rhetoric of disarmament which is standard official Soviet fare, the Soviet Union is not at all interested in major measures of (again) mutual strategic nuclear disarmament. As 72. The strategic balance is notoriously difficult to measure. This author, as a defense analyst trained (through a British education) to think historically, is compelled to assess dynamically in terms of hypothetical campaigns. Today, and for the next several years, I do not believe that the United States could wage acute crises or wars with the U.S.S.R. and secure her foreign policy goals. This has to translate into strategic inferiority--"soft" though the reasoning admittedly has to be. There is no magic metric or yardstick which can inform the U.S. defense community as to whether or not its programs are sufficient. 73. It is far from obvious that the U.S.S.R. recognizes a concept of strategic superiority outside the enveloping framework of the correlation of forces. See Bialer, Stalin's Successors, pp.241-253.

This study has argued that:
--Nuclear weapons have made a difference, but not a fundamental difference, to statecraft.
The discernible national styles of the two super-powers are quite clearly apparent, even with reference .to theories, tactics, and strategies pertinent to nuclear-weapon policy.

There is a preferred posture, (perhaps) compatible with American values, which meets the unique needs for military support of
This study has functioned at two reasonably distinct levels. First, the level of policy-neutral analysis; and, second, the level of policy commentary and advocacy. A noteworthy fraction of the more important elements in the Western strategy debate tends to require that close attention be paid to the quality of Soviet-area evidence. Chapter 5 discussed the concept of stability in considerable detail, yet a case can be advanced and supported to the effect that while it has been American commentatortheoreticians who have talked about strategic stability, it has, actually, been Soviet defense officials who have practiced strategic stability over the past ten years. Crisis instability problems over the next few years pertain to the American strategic nuclear posture, not the Soviet.
