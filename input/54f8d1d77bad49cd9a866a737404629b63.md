It is important to not understate that the gray zone is a creation of the United States.
Its overwhelming military superiority ensures that revisionist states act so as to not invoke that action of use of military force.
Revisionist states, however, did not quit their war aims no matter this disadvantage.
Key adversaries to the United States continue to evolve in their strategic thought.
States like China, Russia and Iran are at war with the United States and utilizing all elements of national power.
This is not suggesting that shots are never fired in the gray zone, only that the gray zone is the first priority if not the first course of action to achieve a desired end-state.
The acceptance of war in this regard brings with it different approaches and aspects that are relevant to ensure the safety and sustainment of the gray zone, thereby reducing future possibilities of a large-scale conventional military war.
This framework can suit US interests, a welcomed insight given that US force of arms does the most to create this situation.
