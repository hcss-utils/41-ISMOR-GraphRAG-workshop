Like China, Russia was a great land empire, whose leaders saw power and prestige in terms of territorial extent and so aimed at maximizing all three.
Likewise, Russia's neighbors were much smaller both in territory and population.
But unlike China, historically Russia was not culturally central, but rather it was a backwater of Europe that could boast superiority only in military and territorial terms.
Russians tried to make a case for their own spiritual superiority, connecting the Russian spirit (russkaia dusha, русская душа) with a mystical quality associated with the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian culture.
Their technologically superior neighbors were struck not by Russia's soul, but by its general poverty juxtaposed to the lavish living of a small aristocracy.
Long historical connections with Europe meant that Russia rapidly felt the effects of the Industrial Revolution and began importing technology much earlier than did China.
These effects would become lethal after the unification of Germany in 1871, putting a technologically superior great industrial power on Russia's border.
