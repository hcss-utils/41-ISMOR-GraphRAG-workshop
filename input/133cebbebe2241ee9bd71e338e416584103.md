The NATO alliance in Europe appears headed in this direction.
In Asia, this type of alliance is a more distant possibility but is no less necessary for achieving U.S. goals.
In the Middle East, there is even less of a basis for creating broad-based alliances; the United States will thus need to rely on multiple, bilateral relationships to achieve its goals.
On a political level, the desire of the United States to promote regional stability and to avoid regional hegemony will dictate increasing attention to relations, including military relations, with potential great powers, particularly China, Russia, and India.
