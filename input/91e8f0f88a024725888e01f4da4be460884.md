• First, when the Cold War ended and the Soviet Union collapsed, the United States expected no peer competitors to rise and persistently discounted the scale, speed, and fungibility of China's spectacular economic growth. •
Second, the United States underestimated the resurgence of Russian military power and Moscow's will to restore great power status and influence while demonstrating it could manage macroeconomic policy through major shocks, including sanctions. •
Third, Washington ignored the incentives for Sino-Russian collaboration and the ease with which China and Russia could develop a deepening partnership based on a strong common aversion to American hegemony. •
Fourth, in contrast to the Cold War when the US gained an advantage through cost-imposing offset strategies against the Soviet Union, China has proved to be a more formidable competitor and, more so than Russia, is developing asymmetrical capabilities and concepts that US strategists fear are "beating the Americans at their own game"
