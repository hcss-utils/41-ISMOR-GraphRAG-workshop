These activities include terrorism, assassination, sabotage, arming of proxy forces, and the use of deniable state military forces.
Russia uses diplomacy to freeze conflicts and delay overt warfare to a time of Moscow's choosing.
When Putin determines the timing is right, Russia uses deception to mask the dynamic change in the level of force, and quickly consolidates the limited objectives before freezing the conflict and presenting a new status quo.
It is a characteristic of Russian hybrid warfare that no conflict examined has yielded a complete discernable "victory."
Each case has the potential to flare up again in the future and Russia may very well use this to make further gains against the target states or as leverage against the international community.
