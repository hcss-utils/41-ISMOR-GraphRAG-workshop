Attempting to date the beginning and the end of the Cold War is problematic.
If you gather historians and political scientists together to discuss the topic, the likelihood of developing a consensus on either date is remote.
Some experts have submitted the Cold War began as early as the initial "Big Three" meetings while World War II continued to rage or as late as the launching of Sputnik in 1957.
Some scholars argue the Russian actions in Poland, Hungary, Greece, Turkey, and the Berlin Blockade served as events pointing to the new conflict.
For others, the successful testing of an atomic bomb in 1949 was the wakeup call for the United States.
Just as it is difficult to determine the start, dating the ending of the Cold War is just as contentious.
The tearing down of the Berlin Wall in 1989 is a commonly accepted event signaling the end of the Cold War.
