The Industrial Revolution brought about innovations in scientific technology, introducing flying machines to the battlefield and moving wars into three dimensions.
In the early 20th century, pioneers of air power theory, such classical air theorists as Italy's Giulio Douhet, 3 Britain's Hugh Trenchard, 4 America's William ^Karl P. Mitchell, 5 and the Russian-born American Alexander de Seversky 6 predicted that, "In the future, air superiority would decide the outcome of war."
Farsighted as they were, these innovators faced great difficulty in obtaining public support for their views.
