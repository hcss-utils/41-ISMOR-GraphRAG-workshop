The building of a coalition for military action in Iraq was very difficult because many nations were not convinced the United States had provided irrefutable evidence of an Iraqi WMD program.
Moreover, they generally disagreed with the implications of our preemption strategy.
Unlike Afghanistan, Germany, France and Russia opposed military action against Iraq and remain opposed to on-going stability and support operations.
Perhaps the most significant impact on OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM was Turkey's refusal to allow ground forces to transit its territory.
This was a strategic set-back for United States forces and caused a major change in the campaign plan.
There are factors that determined why these nations failed to join the coalition.
Some disagreed with our strategy, others feared their country would become a target of terrorist and others simply refused to act if the action did not have the endorsement of the United Nations.
Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld stated " a state makes its decisions based upon national interests.
If certain of our friends tell us no, the U.S. will not be sad for it."
