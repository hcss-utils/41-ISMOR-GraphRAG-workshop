The military end of the Austrian-Prussian War in 1866 came when Field Marshal Helmut von Moltke, under the roof of a strategic offensive, conducted a military-strategic counter-concentration by the Prussian Army near KOENIGGRAETZ and subsequently launched a concentric attack, while on the move, against the Austrian Forces.
Though, in the war against France, he was able to launch a brilliant counter-concentration, the campaign could not be decided through any single battle Another example for counter-concentration is the Battle of TANNENBERG in August 1914.
The commander of the 8th Army, Colonel General von Prittwitz und Gaffron, received the military-strategic directive from the German high command, known at that time as a deployment directive, to protect "our eastern provinces against a Russian invasion", for whose implementation "only the overall situation existing after the staging of the 8th Army" could be "decisive", and to consider "supporting the offensive Austria intended to launch" against Russia.
The Austrian forces deployed against Russia along the general line west of RADOM-PRZMYSL-STANISLAU and wanted to attack quickly.
The military-strategic directive went on to state that the aim was to harmonize action with the Austrian Army and that, in an absolute emergency, Prussian territory east of the WEICHSEL had to be abandoned until the Army could be reinforced by bringing up other forces.
