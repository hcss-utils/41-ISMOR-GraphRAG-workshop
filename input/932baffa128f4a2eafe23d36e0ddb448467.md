While the significance of cyber domain is increasing, traditional terrains are remaining crucial as well.
The human terrain is highly vulnerable against sophisticated influence warfare operation or weaponized information.
Estonia and Germany provided examples for how individual states can take countermeasures against cyber-attack or influence warfare.
Hungary also suffers Information Warfare attacks from Russia, which affect the public opinion, economy, and diplomacy fields, even intending to weaken connections with other NATO and EU Allies.
