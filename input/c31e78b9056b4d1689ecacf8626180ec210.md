Conflict over the Arctic is unlikely, but conflict in the Arctic is possible because it represents a significant theater in a broader great-power conflict.
The most dangerous potential threat to the U.S. and its allies remains Russia's ballistic missiles-including nuclear weapons-which are based in the Arctic and would likely transit it in the event of a large-scale conflict.
If such a conflict were to occur, a large-scale ground component in Scandinavia would also seem likely, as this is the shortest route to Russia's strategic Kola Peninsula.
Additionally, there are potential naval and amphibious operations, particularly in the strategic maritime chokepoints of the Bering Sea or the Barents Sea Opening.
China cannot compete militarily in the Arctic at present.
However, Chinese ballistic missile submarine patrols in the Arctic could become a reality by 2035.
