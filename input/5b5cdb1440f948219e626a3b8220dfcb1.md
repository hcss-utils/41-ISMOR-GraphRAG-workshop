With the 2022 Russian Invasion of Ukraine, the U.S.-led international world order awakens to a potential New Cold War between democracy and autocracy.
Like the previous one, this Cold War will see numerous proxy conflicts through all instruments of national power, or DIME.
State and non-state adversaries have learned from the American Way of War, allowing them to flow to an advantageous position in the gray zone below the threshold of Western War and avoid potential military collisions.
Consequentially, partnership, posture, and position through security cooperation will become increasingly important as the U.S. should Go Byzantine by empowering the Free World to prevent and shape conflicts to be fortuitous to the American Way of War and policy.
Our competition may be a partner's conflict, but we must choose the right partners.
Through case study analysis, this paper will explore who are the right partners and how their DIME increase is essential for the American Way of War and deterrence in strategic competition.
