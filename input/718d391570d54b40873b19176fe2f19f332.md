Derbala, one of the leaders of al-Jama'a, is currently spending a life sentence in prison for his role in the 1981 Sadat assassination.
He drew on religious texts to show that al Qaeda's attacks violated Islamic law, which "bans killing civilians" of any religion or nationality.
Derbala and his associates denounced al Qaeda for preaching that American and Muslim interests would never meet and that "the enmity is deeply embedded and the clash is inevitable."
They cited several cases in the 1990s when the United States had helped to resolve international conflicts, with results that had benefited Muslims: American military and financial assistance in the Afghan war tipped the balance in favor of the mujahedeen against the Russian occupiers; from 1990 to 1991, the United States helped Kuwait and Saudi Arabia expel Iraqi forces in 1995, American military intervention put a stop to the persecution and massacre of Bosnian Muslims by Serbs, and in 1999 the United States led a NATO military campaign forcing Serbia to end ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.
