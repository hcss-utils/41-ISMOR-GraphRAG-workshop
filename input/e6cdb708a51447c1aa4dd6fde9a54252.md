Since the revolutionary advent of airpower, the US has been wedded to the paradigm of leveraging air and maritime Long-Range Precision Fires (LRPF) to achieve decisive effects. Despite evolutions in longrange capabilities, including the development of the cruise missile in the 1980s, the US has only further cemented this paradigm through highly successful operations in Desert Storm, Desert Fox, Iraqi Freedom, and subsequent Flexible Response Options (FRO) from 2003 to present. Yet since Desert Storm, adversaries have been carefully observing US operational success and reorienting their doctrine, prioritizing rapid technological advancements that specifically target US bilateral dependency. In light of these new challenges in the operational environment and the recent prominence of Multi-Domain Operations (MDO), this monograph explores the problem of the LRPF paradigm through leveraging the theoretical lens of systems thinking, architectural design, and John Boyd's Destruction and Creation. Using Gharajedaghi's "mapping the mess" as a framework for searching, mapping, and telling the story, this monograph proposes that the current LRPF paradigm is insufficient for the emergent operational environment and that a paradigm shift must occur that is informed by balance, time, and phasing.

Human life, even the entirety of human nature, is nothing but war of the future against the present.
-Helmuth von Moltke, War and Peace By focusing on itself, architecture has entered an unavoidable paradox that is more present in space than anywhere else: the impossibility of questioning the nature of space and at the same time experiencing a spatial praxis.
-Bernard Tschumi, Architecture and Disjunction Since the advent of airpower in the beginning of the 20th century, the US has been captivated by the ability to achieve long-range effects in pursuit of tactical to strategic level objectives. Yet, this infatuation with range and weapon effects is as old as warfare itself, predating airpower advocates. This is seen in 1346 at the decisive English victory over the French at the Battle of Crécy, where the increased range of the longbow singlehandedly "ended the long supremacy of feudal cavalry," leaving 1,500 "lords and knights" dead on the field.0 F 1 However, it was with the birth of airpower that the nature of range itself inherently changed, as Billy Mitchell asserted when he prophesied that distances would be "measured in hours and not in miles."1 F 2 What made early airpower particularly unique was not merely its increased range, but the method used to deliver its effects. In Command of the Air Douhet writes, "Now it is possible to go far behind the fortified lines of defense … It is air power which makes this possible."2 F 3 On 12 June 1918 when the 96th Aero Squadron flew the "first American bombing raid" over Étain, France, the paradigm linking the method of airpower and deep strike was consummated.3 F 4 Following the Second World War, sea power became a major element to this paradigm when through the aircraft carrier the "role of ships became firstly one of carrying air power to sea."4 F

The truth of Holley's statement was reinforced during the development of the cruise missile, which Richard Betts claims is the "most revolutionary" change in the US force posture since the atomic bomb.7 F 8 Eric Arnett in Sea-Launched Cruise Missiles and U.S. Security describes this technological innovation as "a grail sought by U.S. policymakers and technologists for at least fifty years."8 F 9 However, in Betts' Cruise Missiles: Technology, Strategy, & Politics, he describes how the cruise missile was viewed by the services as an evolutionary rather than a revolutionary change: "As with most new weapons, the cruise missile is being fitted … into existing operational concepts."9 F 10 Thomas Kuhn in The Structure of Scientific Revolutions 4 James J.

-Nassim Taleb, Antifragile Before making sense of the LRPF paradigm, this section lays out the theoretical lens through which this problem is explored. Frans Osinga in Science, Strategy and War: The Strategic Theory of John Boyd argues that "we can't just look at our own personal experiences or use the same mental recipes over and over again; we've got to look at other disciplines and activities and relate or connect them to what we know from our experiences and the strategic world we live in."2 3F

In Systems Thinking: Managing Chaos and Complexity, Gharajedaghi argues that chaos and complexity are not characteristics of a new reality, rather "features of our perceptions and understanding."2 4F 
25
Gharajedaghi describes searching as "watching how a system actually behaves, learning its history, and understanding why it does what it does."2 6F 27 This monograph focuses on the "systems analysis" method of inquiry within the searching phase. This method of inquiry emphasizes the structural, functional, and behavioral aspects of the system. For the LRPF problem exploration, this analysis is shaped by examining the historical backdrop of the LRPF paradigm, which begins with the revolutionary birth of airpower and culminates in the most recent FROs.
The second step of mapping involves analyzing the "deep-rooted assumptions that are at the core" of the system.2 7F 
28
Gharajedaghi states, "As long as the assumptions underlying the action are explicit, there exists the chance to learn from experience and improve the quality of our practice."2 8F 29 Consequently, section three of this monograph explores the underlying assumptions of the LRPF paradigm.
Finally, step three titled telling the story is the "early warning system" that "reveals the undesirable future implicit in the current state."2 9F

Architectural Design: Klaus Krippendorff, Bernard Tschumi, & Le  Corbusier   In addition to systems thinking, this monograph leverages a theory of architectural design that challenges the classic dictum "form follows function." Coined by Louis Henry Sullivan, "form follows function" is built on the conviction that once the function of an artifact is understood, its form naturally emerges from that understanding. For example, Krippendorff writes that tableware designers never questioned eating practices, while radio developers assumed the whole system of radio transmission and programming to be a given. Krippendorff argues that the strategic implications of this lack of questioning are severely limiting: "Taking the larger whole for granted is, of course, a way to limit a design problem and get it done, but it is also a way to submit to prevailing conceptions that restricted spaces for design."3 3F

The Evolution of Long-Range Precision Fires in the 20 th Century
The history of the modern LRPF paradigm began with the revolutionary birth of airpower.4 8F 49 While the radius of strategic aviation in World War 1 was at times no more than 25,000 yards in advance of friendly troops, early airpower theorists kept looking ahead to the future application of airpower.4 9F

Eric Arnett defines the cruise missile as simply "an armed missile that is neither a ballistic missile nor a rocket," taking advantage of aerodynamic lift tantamount to "unpiloted airplanes." These cruise missiles leverage the advances of terrain contour matching (TERCOM) and digital scene matching area correlator (DSMAC) technology to mitigate the limitations of inertial navigation systems (INS). Long-Range Precision Fires in Operation Desert Storm, Desert Fox, and Iraqi Freedom Instant Thunder, the Desert Storm air campaign, was designed by USAF Colonel John Warden to dislocate the Iraqi leadership and communications so that any offensive Iraqi operations out of Kuwait was infeasible.6 0F 61 Colonel Warden constructed his air campaign on the theory that a "properly sequenced and massed air attack" would dismantle enemy air defenses and command and control systems in a single stroke, "leaving the nation-state and its fielded forces defenseless against aggressive exploitation."6 1F

Only by discovering and interpreting our deep-seated assumptions can we see ourselves in a new way.
There are five key assumptions that underlay the current LRPF paradigm.8 5 F 86 While identifying the logic behind these assumptions is critical, David Metts writes that "even the most logical processes can result in disaster if they are founded upon false or faulty assumptions."8 6F 87 As Browne and Keeley assert in Asking the Right Questions: A Guide to Critical Thinking, when analyzing assumptions, one is identifying the link between a reason and conclusion. "If this link is flawed, the reason does not necessarily lead to the conclusion."8 7F 
88
The LRPF paradigm assumes that the USAF and USN are the primary players amenable for achieving long-range effects beyond the Fire Support Coordination Line (FSCL).8 9F 
90
In Giulio Douhet's opening chapter of The Command of the Air, he writes that aeronautics has opened up a new field of action "radically different" from any other field in its ability to expose the enemy's territory with "utmost ease."9 1F 92 Admiral William Moffett, the recognized architect of American naval aviation, extended this "radically different" field of action to the seas with his theories regarding a "true air navy" in the interwar years.9 2F 93 Fifty years later technology further "corrected" any deficiencies in this bilateral form when John Warden 90 US Department of Defense, Joint Staff, Joint Publication (JP) 3-09, Joint Fire Support (Washington, DC: Government Publishing Office, 2019), GL-7. JP 3-09 defines the Fire Support Coordination Line (FSCL) as "a fire support coordination measure established by the land or amphibious force commander to support common objectives within an area of operation, beyond which all fires must be coordinated with affected commanders prior to engagement and, short of the line, all fires must be coordinated with the establishing commander prior to engagement." proposed his air campaign would achieve independent "decisive effects" against Iraqi Centers of Gravity (COG).9 3F 94 Doctrine is also implicit in providing a logical basis for this bilateral assumption in the LRPF paradigm. USAF's Volume 1: Basic Doctrine begins by adducing that airpower, "with its speed, range, and three-dimensional perspective," operates "fundamentally different from other forms of military power."9 4F

The logic regarding basing is cardinal to the LRPF paradigm, which assumes that air and naval assets will be able to operate from secure basing outside the range of enemy threat systems.
This assumption finds many of its roots in World War 2, particularly in the Pacific Theater where US bombers were able to launch from secure island bases to strike targets in mainland Japan. The LRPF paradigm enables USAF bombing assets like the sixty-five-year-old B-52 to remain operationally relevant while generating from secure basing outside of enemy Missile Engagement Zones (MEZ). Forrest E. Morgan writes in the RAND publication titled Crisis Stability and Long-Range Strike: A Comparative Analysis of Fighters, Bombers, and Missiles: "Substantial numbers of standoff and penetrating bombers could be deployed to regional bases to generate a deterrent threat but kept well away from the opponent's defended airspace to mitigate the threat of surprise attack."1 05F 106 This is perfectly illustrated in the Continuous Bomber Presence (CBP) mission, which from 2004-2020 has seen an unremitting rotation of B-52 & B-1 Expeditionary Bomb Squadrons (EBS) to Anderson AFB, Guam.1 06 F 107 USAF doctrine underscores the importance of secure basing by recognizing that fixed bases are "especially vulnerable" because they must withstand enemy air, ground, and cyberspace 105 Christian Brose, The Kill Chain: Defending America in the Future of High-Tech Warfare (New York: Hachette Books, 2020), 94. Brose's assertion is transparent in the historical precedent that every application of the modern LRPF paradigm has been offensive in nature.

At the time of the CBP implementation, this island airfield provided a safeguarded basing option for bombers to generate well outside potential US Indo-Pacific Command (USINDOPACOM) threats, while still being close enough to provide credible LRPF options. The maritime aspect of the basing assumption also finds its roots in World War 2 where US carriers operated hundreds of miles off the Japanese coast relatively secure from enemy threats.1 10F 111 Robert Futrell writes that the carrier continued to prove itself a "very effective cold war instrument" during the 1958 conflict in Lebanon, providing a safe base of operations in a region where overflight rights and landing fields presented limited options.1 11F 112 This operational autonomy married to the modern LRPF paradigm continues to make USN assets a key long-range instrument.1 12F

This section analyzes the threat to the current LRPF paradigm posed by China and North Korea, two adversaries who will serve as a sampling from the two levels of the National Defense where for the first time China's leadership realized "that there was little they could do to stop the United States from coming to Taiwan's assistance."1 42F 143 Chinese strategists understood they were "dealing with a new way of war" marked by "battlefield dominance through precision strike," and that Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities were required to "deter, delay, or deny an advanced enemy from entering the theatre of operations in Asia."1 43F 144 These A2AD capabilities were directly aimed at neutralizing the LRPF paradigm that had been the hallmark of US dominance.1 44F 145 141 Gregory D. Foster, "The National Defense Strategy is No Strategy: It's closer to a call for a new cold war," Defense One, accessed 01 December 2020, https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2019/04/national-defense-strategy-no-strategy/156068/. The 2 + 3 mnemonic associated with the NDS prescribes the priority of challenges requiring US attention (China and Russia being the "2", and North Korea, Iran, and violent extremism being the "3").
142 Anthony H. Cordesman, The Iraq War: Strategy, Tactics, and Military Lessons (Washington:  Center for Strategic and International Studies, 2003), 482, 485. Cordesman writes: "Rather than being trained properly for asymmetric warfare, troops were often given pointless ideological nonsense." Additionally, "Iraq was never credited with having more than 12 to 25 surviving Scuds, and its Al-Samoud II and Ababil missiles and rockets lacked the range, accuracy, and lethality to be much of a threat."

Even if the LRPF paradigm is able to reorient to defensive assumptions, it still relies on secure basing, another area that has been challenged by the PLA framework. RAND asserts that "an ascending China also means a more difficult operating environment" in which the US should "anticipate increased risk to already threatened forward-based forces in Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines and a loss of the ability to operate routinely in the air and sea space above and in the Western Pacific"1 53F 
154
155
Challenging the LRPF paradigm's offensive and secure basing assumptions significantly reduces its ability to dictate the tempo of operations. Even if the US is able to seize the initiative at the outset of hostilities, China's potential to threaten USN ships while disrupting airbases in the theater forces the USAF to rely heavily on Continental US (CONUS) based bombers to project power, a move that greatly inhibits US capacity to maintain the tempo of operations. As Ronald O'Rourke writes, while China primarily sees A2/AD as an ability to deter US intervention, should deterrence fail, it will also be able to significantly "delay" or "reduce the effectiveness" of subsequent operations.1 55F 
156
158
Finally, China's A2/AD framework creates range, survivability, and weapon effects problems which markedly impede the LRPF paradigm's ability to achieve the desired effects. The fixed IADS on the man-made islands of the South China Sea, complimented with mobile maritime systems, create myriad range problems for even TLAM and JASSM platforms. In regards to survivability, the Pentagon report went on to say that China's "robust and redundant" air defense systems are some of the best in the world, leveraging Russian-built S-300 and S-400s  MIT Press, 1996), 196-197. "China also mounted a major industrial and technological effort to acquire long-range anti-ship systems such as the DF-21 and DF-26, so-called carrier killer ballistic missiles capable of carrying conventional or nuclear warheads more than 2,000 miles and equipped with maneuvering reentry vehicles employing radar and other sensors to allow them to strike a moving target at sea."

augmented by indigenous systems with emergent capabilities to intercept ballistic missiles.1 58F 159 Lastly, in terms of weapon effects, the mobility and redundancy of the PLA IADS and LRPF systems present further Find, Fix, Target, Track, Engage, Assess (F2T2EA) problems.
The Hermit Kingdom's New Look
In the mid-1990s North Korea (nK) also began to reorient and reform their military framework. In the context of severe economic decline, food shortages, and the overwhelming success of the US LRPF paradigm against Iraq, the nK regime recognized the infeasibility of reunifying the Korean Peninsula through conquest.1 59F 160 As RAND asserts, nK no longer dreamed of "tank divisions streaming southwards," rather new "functions" had to be created to achieve political objectives.1 60F 161 This required a shift in nK strategy toward asymmetric advantage where, similar to the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, limited military objectives could be leveraged to achieve disproportionate political effects.1 61F 162 The capability to achieve this strategy came in the form of an asymmetric triad consisting of Long-Range Artillery (LRA), Ballistic Missiles (BM), and Special Operations Forces (SOF).1 62F 163 Each part of this triad is directly aimed at neutralizing the LRPF paradigm, rapidly enabling the achievement of political objectives.1 63F 164 nK to seize the initiative prior to a USN LRPF reaction. Additionally, the early challenges to air base sortie generation decreases the ability of the CFACC to neutralize time-sensitive Coastal Defense Cruise Missile (CDCM) and minelaying targets, which pose a considerable threat to future 7 th Fleet operational freedom of maneuver.1 67F 168 RAND proposes this potential situation in The Korean Peninsula: Three Dangerous Scenarios where they surmise that the existing use of air and maritime capabilities in operations plans may not "align with the changing nature of the North Korean threat."1 68F 
169
In The Hermit King: The Dangerous Game of Kim Jong-Un, Chung Min Lee asserts the "one area where the ROK has an advantage" is in its offensive force projection capability through the US 7 th Air Force in Korea, the US 5 th Air Force in Japan, and US bombers in Guam.1 69 F 170
Unfortunately, this assertion is becoming disjointed from the operational environment in the Peninsula since nK asymmetric capabilities are inherently offensive in design, aiming to "achieve reunification by force, employing surprise, overwhelming firepower, and speed."1 70F 171
This premise directly challenges the offensive assumptions of the LRPF paradigm, which assume USAF and USN offensive capability at the outset of hostilities. In fact, the LRPF strategy in the Korean Peninsula assumes enough Indications and Warnings (I&W) will arrive to "fight tonight" and generate overwhelming offensive airpower through an intricately mapped out compresses the decision time frame of the opponent, making the capacity to "assess (measure) and react using standard methods and means" increasingly difficult.1 77F
178
Similarly, nK's ability to achieve surprise and disrupt the LRPF paradigm at the outset of hostilities assists in their ability to control the tempo of operations and create political conditions favorable for success. For example, with the LRPF paradigm unable to achieve effects at the outset of hostilities, nK is free to disperse its critical BM and Nuclear assets from their garrisons, creating insurmountable future F2T2EA problems for ROK-US forces.1 78F 
179
Finally, nK has challenged the weapon effectiveness of the LRPF paradigm through their extensive use of UGFs. According to a South Korean military journal, there are between six to eight thousand UGFs scattered across the country.1 80 F 181 In addition to their strategic northern location, BM and Nuclear UGFs present multiple targeting dilemmas for LRPFs, particularly USN TLAMs which are inferior to hardened targets. While the JASSM has some penetrating capability, these assets would be launched from the peninsula at Kunsan AB, which is at high risk of being disrupted by nK asymmetric capabilities. Furthermore, with the CBP mission removed from Guam, the nearest JASSMs have to come from CONUS, only further exasperating US response time while favoring nK capabilities.1 81F 182 RAND projects that because China will most likely be able to contest all domains of conflict by the mid-2030s, "the U.S. Army as part of the joint force will need to be able to respond immediately to crises or contingencies at various points of contention," while operating "inside the wire at the outset of a crisis."1 97F

Leonhard contends that all forms of conflict have traditionally unfolded into two distinct phases: the protective phase, in which actions are taken to neutralize the enemy's strength to prevent interference with the friendly operations, and the dislocation phase, in which actions are taken against enemy systems to gain a clear advantage.2 01F

Contrary to popular belief, twentieth-century American operational practice saw few genuine Kuhnian paradigm shifts to revolutionary ways of thinking. Rather, what took place was more akin to paradigm "tiering." Like layers of sediment, earlier paradigms were partially covered by newer ones but were never physically displaced.

It'll go several hundred kilometers beyond that, but we're also in the process of coordinating with other services to bring some other mid-range capabilities into play. Think about Tomahawks and think about shorter-range hypersonic weapons. We're looking at land-based, land launched Tomahawk Missiles and SM-6s, which are in the Navy's inventory. We're looking at launching those from the land. That capability is coming third quarter of '23."

For example, he shows how legacy bombers like the B-1B possess an overall penetration probability of 60%, versus the much higher 90% of the B-2 stealth
bomber.132  Ibid., 91. Because there are no figures for the probability of penetration for cruise missiles, Graben substitutes comparative data from other air-breathing systems to determine the Air Defense Probabilities for cruise missiles. What Graben does not take into account, which would further increase the survivability, are the varying mitigation techniques mission planners build into cruise missile profiles to further enhance their survivability -like terrain masking, altitude selection, and flight path
deconfliction.133  JohnBirkler, A Framework for Precision Conventional Strike in Post-Cold War Military  Strategy (Santa Monica: RAND Publications, 1996), 28.

"Once they launch, the TELs[Transporter Erector Launchers]  or MELs [Missile Erector Launchers] will quickly displace to another pre-surveyed launch position or UGF (other than those at the missile operating base) where they will meet up with the technical support element and its equipment (i.e., reload missiles, warheads, fuel, crane vehicles, etc.). Once serviced and rearmed, the technical support element will move to another prearranged location while the TEL or MEL will either wait for a launch order or move to another pre-surveyed launch position and wait there for a launch order. As the conflict develops, rather than returning to an operating base-which will undoubtedly be the target of repeated attacks-both the technical support element and launchers will remain in the field using pre-positioned reloads and supplies while moving frequently to different pre-surveyed locations."

Focusing on VOLUME 1 BASIC DOCTRINE using a medium is a vital first step to integration of efforts.

Anti-Access Area Denial ACC Assumption #4: Tempo Another major assumption in the LRPF paradigm is its ability to dictate the tempo of operations.1 13F 
114
115
116
The goal of controlling operational tempo is rooted in the assumption that the LRPF paradigm will be able to mass effects at the outset of hostilities and thereby seize the initiative. Section 5: Toward a New LRPF Paradigm
In rounding this Cape Horn the new horizons before us will only recover the grand line of tradition by a complete revision of the methods in vogue and by the fixing of a new basis of construction established in logic. In architecture the old bases of construction are dead. We shall not rediscover the truths of architecture until new bases have established a logical ground for every architectural manifestation.
-Le Corbusier, Towards a New Architecture
Having "mapped the mess" of the LRPF paradigm through searching, mapping, and telling the story, this section looks to the future potentialities involved in building a new LRPF paradigm. Using Robert Leonhard's Fighting by Minutes as a framework, this section asserts that balance, time, and phasing must inform the future LRPF paradigm to adapt to emergent threats.
Robert Leonhard writes that since warfare involves the "interaction of opposites, the enemy will invariably react to any particular style of warfare in order to diminish its success. 185 Ibid., 30-33. Leonhard writes that the three principal activities in war are moving, striking, and protecting. Due to "the tradeoff nature of the three activities … commanders and military thinkers in the past have (sometimes unknowingly) developed three theories of style (and countless variations of each), designed in each case to emphasize two of the activities at the expense of the third." Maneuver Theory: "Through momentum [and strike], an attacking army can both defeat the enemy and implicitly protect itself." Positional Theory: "Emphasizes the two functions of movement and protection, while avoiding a direct strike on the enemy." Interchangeability Theory: "Simple notion that firepower [and protection] can be substituted for maneuver in war."
Clausewitzian dictum that defense is the stronger form of combat.1 85F 186 It also neglects the preeminence of firepower over maneuver in the land domain, relegating primary long-range indirect fires to USAF and USN functions. Leonhard questions this imbalance when he notes that future warfare may see indirect fires moving from a "supporting role to the decisive element of land combat power."1 86F
