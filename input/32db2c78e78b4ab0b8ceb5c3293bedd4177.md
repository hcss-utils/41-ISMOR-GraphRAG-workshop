After annexing Crimea, Russian-backed separatists, and eventually Russian troops, began a conflict with Ukrainian troops in the Donbas region.
Russian OCO are alleged to have begun as early as 2013, with malware such as RedOctober, MiniDuke, NetTraveler, and Uroboros, though the attackers showed voluntary restraint in target selection and attack at the onset of the conflict.
In lockstep with Russian military thought, OCO were predominantly integrated into reconnaissance support for military strikes, as well as information operations facilitated by cutting-edge malware, until the scope broadened and restraint withered as the conflict continued.
