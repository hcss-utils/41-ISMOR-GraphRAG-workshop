This armored division would be the first of three whose task it was to cut the ground line of communication between Poland and Lithuania and complete the isolation of the Baltic states.
A fourth division was also preparing to envelop Vilnius.
These units had, until hours earlier, been taking part in Exercise Zapad 2021, a vast quadrennial exercise conducted in Belarus and Russia's Western Military District.
Meanwhile, units from the Russian 11th Guards Army in Kaliningrad were preparing to drive north to seize the key Lithuanian port of Klaipeda.
