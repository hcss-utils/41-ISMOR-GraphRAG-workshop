Improved C 4 ISR Capabilities.
The information revolution that is now sweeping the world will create more opportunities for regional powers to access advanced space-based communications and reconnaissance systems.
Much of this increased opportunity will result from having relatively easy access to multinational commercial assets; some will come from being granted access to dedicated military satellites owned by major powers that could become hostile to U.S. interests (e.g., China, Russia, India); and yet a smaller amount will be due to the development and exploitation of indigenous capabilities.
