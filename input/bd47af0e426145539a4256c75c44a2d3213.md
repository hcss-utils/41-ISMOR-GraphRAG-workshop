The first set of contingent events relate to the potential expansion of Al Qaeda or Islamic State in the Levant-like violent Islamist groups into Central Asia and Western China.
Russia's wars against majority Muslim areas such as Chechnya in 1994 and 1999 could easily creep to the east.
Greater instability in Central Asia is the likely result of the inevitable changes that are coming in the Soviet-era authoritarian leadership in the region.
This could easily spill over into China.
Since 1949, the PRC has used overbearing military and police power to control the Central Asian Turkic Muslim Uighurs in Xinjiang.
For China, the Uighur-based East Turkestan Independence Movement is more than a potential threat.
A senior Chinese official recently announced that "hundreds and thousands" of Chinese Uighurs have joined ISIS.
