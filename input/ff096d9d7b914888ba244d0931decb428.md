Russia's 2014 offensives in the disputed regions of Crimea and the Donbass in Ukraine present a different challenge-an undeclared form of warfare that relied on a mixture of conventional and unconventional tools-from the one that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had prepared for during the Cold War.
There have been many terms used to describe these unconventional Russian campaigns, including "gray zone conflict."
This study was tasked with examining the "gray zone" in Europe, which is the expression we will use.
