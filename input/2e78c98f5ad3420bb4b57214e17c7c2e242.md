The German invasion of Crete, Operation Mercury, would become the apex of German airborne operations in WWII.
This operation would apply all of the lessons that the airborne units had learned from their previous operations in Norway, Holland, and mainland Greece.
Although the island of Crete was captured, following this operation German airborne forces would never be used again in their traditional role.
Instead, the airborne arm would fight as regular line infantry in Russia, France, Italy, and other sectors, until the war's conclusion.
