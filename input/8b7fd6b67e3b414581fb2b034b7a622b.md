B ill Clinton's promise to end the ban on homosexuals serving openly in the-military, and-the continuing furor -over women -in combat, threaten an ongoing-civilmilitary battle thatcould damage military professionalism; alienate an otherwise friendly incoming Administration, and, ultimately, ruin the military effectiveness of-the American-armed forces-for the -foreseeable future. Military leaders who:-oppose -these changes ought to-consider some facts -and principles -that might changetheir -minds.
First, -history. Women have -fought successfully, sometimes -integrated-with men, as in the World War II Allied underground, where they proved just as adept at slitting throats,:leading men in battle,-suffering torture, and-dying, as -men; sometimes segregated, as in -Soviet air-force uniis, which produced many female aces -fighting -the-Germans. Homosexuals -have -for centuries served -honorably and effectively, in the UnitedStatesand abroad: Arguments against open service assume that -proper -policies and effective leadership will fail, even though the services succeededin integrating African-Americans and women, switchingto a draft-military in--1940 and-then.

-or excused-on-religious or-moral grounds, or because their skills need to be -used in some other -capacity. But also, participation -in combat-dying for one's country-has historically enabled minorities to claim the-full privileges of equal participation in society, something basic-to our-form of government.
That is why-African-Americans for generations "fought for-the right to-fight" and why combat and-military service are soimportant-to women-and homosexuals. Combat and service promote equal protection of-the laws-and under--mine prejudice anddiscrimination. Third, the very real practical problems can -be overcome. Without question,-change will -be-complicated and costly and-take time,-and-military efficiency will, suffer in -the short term. Unless carefully explained to the American -people, these changes -could-harm recruiting, precisely in those areas and. among-those groups which -have Tbeen traditionally supportive of military service. To-accommodate women-on-combat ships and-in flying units (few-advocate women in ground combat units),facilities-andperhaps-weapon systems will--need modification. There will' be ticklish,-perhaps:intractable, problems-of privacy and.personal discomfort (there already are in the-military). The services will be-distracted froin-their-primary peacetime-duties-of readiness, preparation, and -modernization. Leadership-at-all-levels will-be challenged--to maintain morale and effectiveness in circumstances where, historically, macho-behavior-and explicit-sexual banter helped forge -the personalbonds-that-enabled units to train-and fight-effectively.
Cohesion,-the key-to military-success, will-be more difficultmwithout traditional-methods-of male -bonding. The strict-authority, harsh discipline, and-instant obedience required-for victory in-battle have always -been-subject to abuse, and adding more-women and ending-discriminationagainst-gaymen and -lesbians-will-increase the problem.To-deal with -it, -military leaders will have-to redouble their effortsto define appropriate conduct and -to punish or expel-.those in the ranks who cannot -or will -not-control -their language and their behavior. The -problem, -as Tailhook so clearly revealsi already-exists; the -fundamental issue in-theshortrun~will not be attitude, but-behavior, andthe military can be extremely-effective-in controlling behavior. The services will-have to-review policies-onracceptable cohduct,-on and off duty.Research on -maintaining cohesion -without scapegoating -homosexuals and& treating Dr, Richard I.

women as sex objects will have to-be undertaken. The challenge-to our military leadership, at alldevels, will be enormous, and-it will-last as long-as sexism andhomophobia afflict significant portions of our population.
And yet, our military can-adjust--nceagain. It is naturalto--resist , because -change posesza diversion from-the primary purposes of preparingfor and deterring war, and engaging in combat. That-is why as outstanding a public servant as General George C. Marshal!during World War :l opposed racial integration,believing it divisive-and concerned that the Army could not afford to act as-a "social laboratory"-during a-national emergency. But civilian control means that our military willbe organized and will operate according -to the nation's .needs and desires. Historically our national security and our -social, legal, and constitutional -practices-have-had to-be balanced. The services know that -military,efficiency and combat effectiveness do not always determine our military policies, and less so in times of peace-and lessenedthreat.
If-President Clintonfollows through on-thepromise-to let gay men and lesbians serve openlyi and if, -for reasonsof fairness-and justice, -he -permits women-to fight in-combat units at sea and-in the air, then the American-military must comply,-and Without resistance. To resist-wouldonly make-the-adjustmentmore timemconsuming and-disruptive, and would itself undermine, military effectiveness.
'In the long run, the services should -find that their effectiveness,-as--inthe experience--of racial-and genderintegration, willbe enhanced -rather than. diminished. The strength-of our-military depends ultimately upon-its bonds-to thepeople; -the armed-forces will -be -stronger the-more they reflect the-values and -ideals, of the-society-they serve.
For perspectives strongly at odds with -that of Dr. T1lie -experience of -Israel is ofteni used--to support-the case for sending
IAmericari-women intov combat. -Israel, after all, has a--reputation for military strength; if-women-have. proved-to be usefuizin-combat there, it surely -reinforces the-,argument for their -inclusion in, US-combat forces. There is, however, a -serious -problem with -this analogy. NoIsraeli woman-has-sered -in combat since the establishment of thie-state -of-Isracl-in _1948-.Even though -the IstaeliDefense Force (IDri)-has-very often faced-overwhelming odds, we--in--israel are very proud that Israeli women--have -never deliberately been--exposed-to the risks-of combat, not-even in. the most-desperate-situations.
-Women -have never taken a major-part in-combat-inwany culture, -in any country, -in any period-of history. Thc myth of the-Amazons is just that-a myth. The-few-woiefi-Wo-did join~armies and-fightdid so disguised as mfen, aiid-when discovered -were-usually -su munarily discharged-. A handful of such cases are --known, including somne during -the American Revolution =and the Civil-War.
On the-offher hand-, women have-always taken~partin-rebellions -andinsufrections. In-fact, as -Marx once sadadas-the Vietnam War pioved, the extent-to-which -women ate -swept-along is a-very good -index of whethera has-succeeded, an established-state does not send its women-intogcombat.-This rule holds true-for the:Israeli 1 re'ocs -1 a-idmd-ocs
Before .1948 the Jewish community in Palestine fought the British to gain our independence.. In that struggle, women played an-important and active part. Women served in-the Palmach, anl underground paramilitary force. Women went on undercover missions, and often smuggled weapons because British soldiers were more hesitant to search women than-men. Women often-were used for carrying messages and for -surveillance work. In fact-it-was the practice of Palmach to send a young man and woman together to dosurveillance work. If caught, they could alwaysplay-the-role of-loving couple. Thus, -women did play a role in-the underground before the establishment of the state. Even-then, when Palmach undertook a larger military operation, for example, a retaliatory raid against-some Arab village, the women-would be-left behind.
It was only -when isolated-settlements were attacked by Arab-irregulars, and later by invading Arab armies, that women-fought shoulder to shoulder with the men. This was a matter of home defense. When a remote kibbutz of 100 or 200:people was attacked-by-a regular force, it was -a desperate situation that required -everyone to fight. Even so, the number of -women -who actually -handled rifles or threw hand-grenades was-very small. I -amunaware-of a -single Israeli-woman-who-has claimed; "I was in combatin 1948-. I-handled a rifle. I threw a-hand grenade. I fired-a-machine gun." There may have-been a-few-such-women, butffor the most-part they existed only inthe Arab imagination. More typically, women were kept very busy lookingafter, the essential needsof combat, such--as nursing,-preparing and bringing up supplies, communications, and-looking after the children; after all, these were-civilian settlements underattack.
The first thing-the IDF didafter-it was established on 26 May 1948 was to-exclude all women-from combat; While women do-serve in, and in fact are drafted into, the IDF, their role is-to provide essentiala-auxiliary servicesin order-to free-men for combat. Furthermore, -the IDF does not-have -mixed units on-the American -model; rather, women-form-part of-a separate Women's Martin-van Creveld is a professor of history attlcbrew University-in Jerusalem He received his Ph.D. fromirthe London School of Economics and has been a Fellow of War Studies-atKings-College, Cambridge, During the 1991-92 school year, he taught at the US-Marine Corps Conimand" and Staff College in Quantico, -'iginia.-lie is the author of Fighting -Power: German and U.S. Fetformance, 1939.1945 Corps, known as CHEN. Originally CHEN was an acronym meaning Women's Corps; it also happens to mean "grace" in Hebrew.
For administrative and disciplinary purposes, women are subject to other women..Far from treating men and-women draftees equally, the IDF has whole volumes detailing exactly what may or-may not be done to-or with women soldiers to prevent them frorn-being harassed or otherwise maltreated. For example, women soldiers may -bedisciplined only by female -officers; women soldiers-may not-be touched-by male MPs; and women soldiers may -not be treated by male doctors unless there-is a-woman present.
What-weapons training-women receive in the -IDF is almostentirely symbolic. At-best,,they will-receive enough-training-to enable them to defend themselves, if necessary, -and :even-that is very often -omitted. -For -example, my-daughter, who-is -19, spent-only-ten days-in basic training. She was one of a select group of women pre-designated for certain slots -because -they -had specific qualifications for-these jobs. Thisgroup was put through a-Very short basic training course so-that they could-immediately go on to:theirjobs. True, most-female-draftees -will spend considerably more-time in basic-training, -but -that is only-because their ultimate assignments are-not yet determined.
Israeli -women, like Israeli-men, are subject to the-draft. However, the draft-is not applied equally~to men-and women. The IDF drafts-about 90 percent of Israeli men-between-the-ages of 18 and 21-, but only about-60percent of the women. This is-because the IDF will take all-men regardless of education, putting them through-remedial -courses if-necessary; women who fall below a-certain-educational -standard. are simply not-accepted.
Also,-men serve -longer than-women--three years as opposed to two. Unless they are discharged for disciplin.,ry reasons or are found unsuitable, both sexes are expected-to serve out-their term. In practice, however, the forces-have a-surplus of women-draftees, -so women are often given an-early discharge.
Women-who are-married, pregniani, oI h Ve-ctiildren are-exenptfronv the draft. -Further, as a rule,-women who have served their term are not recalled for reserve-duty,-the main exception being a-few vital-hand-picked personnel.
Although women officially can-be called up through age-34, very few serve -in the reserves after-age 2-5. Conversely, Israeli men are required-to serve-inthe army reserves until age 51, and must report-for one month of training each year until they reach that age.
Women who join the -professional-standing -forces -after their twoyear conscript service are treated equally with men, with-three exceptions. They are subordinate to the Women's-Corps; they do not participate in combat; and, as a result, they cannot rise above the rank-of brigadier general. These distinctionsapart, the IDF treats its male and female career -soldiers-equally. It does not distinguish between women soldiers who are -married"or single, with or without children.
Because Israeli women do not serve in combat, and because the vast majority serve on rear bases-on which they live-or to which they-commute, even pregnancy is not-much of a problem.-Most pregnantsoldiers are-able togo on withtheirjobs, just like-civilian women who -are pregnant and-working outside the -home. Also, -Israel, -like-most Western -countries -except--for the UnitedStates, -grants women maternity leave. A woman, whether-in-or out of the military, is-free to take up to a -three-monthleave-either -before or after childbirth. Whileon leave, 75-percent of her salaiy is paid-by Social-Security.
Apart :from-their work in-the Women's-Corps (that is, training and supervising -other women), women in -the IDF serve -successfully -in many varied:and essentiaLfields,including-nursing, social -work, clericalactivities, psychological -testing, -intelligence, communications, and -radar. Although there are no women pilotsi the-IDFdoes employ womenasinstructorsinsome combat-relatedactivities, -such-as driving -tanks and -heavy self-propelledartillery pieces. This-policy was-first institutedduring-the -late 1 970s against a backgroundzof breakneck expansion and-sharp manpower shortages.
Considered purely from a technical point of view, there-is certainly no reason why a:womancannot-learn-and subsequently teach-how to drive-a tank. Male trainees,zhowevet,-do not always-readily take to female instructors who, ". an established-state , -, -does hot Sehd~ts WOmllen ito coinb-"
through no fault of their-own, will never-see combat and are unable-to apply what -they-teach. As a result,-the policy has not-been an-unqualified-success. Regular combat units-deployed in the field-for example, the Infantry Brigade or-the ParatrooperBrigade-usually have a very small-number of women -attached to them, two or three per battalion, who perform administrative work. Should'fighting break-out, these women are immediately evacuated from the combat zone-although not always successfully. When Israel came under surprise attack during the -1973 War, a-few women were killed by missiles that hit bases in the Sinai. Generally, however, the IDF does its utmost to prevent such situations.
The differences-between the Israeli and American societies are numerous, deep, and striking. One of the most admirable -things about-American society is the way -in which issues such as women in combat are debated -publicly, in-such depth, 1 and -on the basis of-the best professional-knowledge. Israel can't-afford-to do it-in-this-way, at -least-not -in-the case of-the military.
Asked-about their-impressionsof women in combat, Israeli-officers are united in their-view that-it is no-place for them. This-is because, unlikemost Americans, Israelis-are familiar-with-combat; they-know that:the favorite American-method of breaking war down-into-Military-Occupational Specialties-distorts the issue. For example, women cancertainly pilot an Apache helicopter as well as men. -However, it is equally certain-that their weaker -physiques-willput them at-a disadvantage when-it is a-question of-flying that helicopter eight times a day-under enemy fire, with-the chance of -being shot down, wounded, and-forced-to make their-way back on-foot.
Combat, in-other-words, -is not-merely-a matter of doing a-job. It--is the toughest,-most demanding, most terrible activityon earth. It-is far beyond -the imaginaion of anybody who has not-experienced-it. The demandsthat-it makes in-terms of physical strength, endurance, and sheer-wear and-tear are -horrendous.
Are there some Women who are capable of performing well -in combat? Undoubtedly. Are-most-womeh -physically less capable -of doing -so than-most men? Undoubtedly; And-that, in-fact, -is the best-possible reason-forexcluding-women-fromcombat. The-added overhead -needed to-incorporate those-few exceptional females would-be so large-as to-make the Whole exercise -counterproductive. Israel is not the United States. -Its-defense budget is -not $300 billiona year,but oily abouu5 billion. Neverthclcss,-thc IDF maintains -land forces that, -once-the United-States carries out its -projected-defensecuts, will -be larger. thanAmerica's. Even-so, experimenting with-women in-combat is a-luxury Israel-simplycannot afford. 0 Spring=1993-consequences.

The idea of homosexual' integration, so divisive in its implications, thus presents -pro fou nd-quest ions and practical considerations -for the institution.
We believe there exists a-cultural divide in our society, an ideological chasm-between-competing views of -morality. In many -instances -this is a confl ict-between -a traditional--view of morality on-one side and-an-opposing view-which holds -that -there exist no-objective standards -of morality. However one chooses to-view mforality,.it is safe-to-say that-it is a-unique-aspect-of our -humnan nature, one which separates man from -the-animal -world. And-whether -it-has -been workers' safety regulations, the-repeal. of slavery,-ot modern-day civil ri ghts-legislation, -our-laws have-fouind their-basis -in, moral judgmentsthis despite what-may-have seemned like-sound-economic or rational atgumnents against-their -enactment? As Jud-e -Robert-Bork -pointed-out -in -his -book The -Tempting-of-Arerica~-it is ai"common-yet wholly fallacious" clichd6 to say that-"you-can't--legisl ate -moral ity. "-On -the -contrary, -that-is-precisely -what we,-do legislate-otherwise we -would-be-free-to rob, steal, swindle -and'-kill without--fear of legal sanction. rt-is clear that-mnost people understand and-accept-the concepts of good -and--bad-right and-wrong, and-live-by such'creeds; morals, and -laws -on a-daily -basis. Some may argue theoretically that -m~orals ate-relative -and-subjective, but-they rarely live -that way. A-civilized community cannot -lono -bear.-the anarchy inherent-in-such a-view. If-the statement-that onematis-morajudognent-is -as-good as-another's -were -taken seriously', it -would= -be impossible-fod-aw-on any -subject to-exist. After all, one -man's larceny-would -become-another's just, redistribution of-goods .
Inour demnocracy -we-handle-our-moral -differences -through mutual toleration. We can fltolerate a-rangce-of undesirable practices or-bel iefs while -recognizingthe bad-or -falsehood-in -themi. Iihvrecognizinig-our-human failing, the vices within us all, toleration precludes the -resort to the .totalitarian impulse-oftimposing-a single virtue over society.

Ir must-be recognized, however,-that toleration, -by definition, -is inherentlyjudgmental, permitting-some-morally questionable-practices of fellow human beings -while simultaneously recognizing that those practices constitute a-deviation from the-established norm. It respects and recognizes the -rights, opinions, and practices of others, while still allowing us to discriminate between -right-and wrongin-establishing desirable norms-of conduct and behavior. it
The "new-morality",of the last-30 years, however, goes much further; it demands neutrality (as opposed to-toleration)-toward:competing views of moral -life.

Historical analysis -suggests-that-homiosexuahs have not been characm -terized-as a groupunti-relatively recently--and-even-thAt.has been-a-result-of -their own organized lobbying-to,be-recognized as such. For, unlike demographic groups, they havebeen distinguished ndt-by-physical-characteristics, -place of birth, or creed,-but--by individual behavior. -But the bandingtogether of individualsiunited by shared behaviororflifestyles, -to seek-,redress does not make it incumbent on government to acquiesce inilegally sanctioning their -particular behavior.

It turns on its headthenotionof individual equality-before-the -law: toone where law, that-makes-moral distinctions itself becomes invalid before-equal individuals. This-tactic results-in "the legal disestablishment of morality.""
Some researchers have sought to find a genetic or physiological root to homosexualityto-lessen-or remove-moral judgments about-it. But the jury is still-out-on-the degree to-which prenatal (as opposed to-postnatal)-determinants affect sexual'orientation.' On-the-other hand, some-homosexuals maintain that--homosexuality is-a-behavior-of choice, "a-political statement?'--or-as PBS's "Tongues -Untied"-described it, "the revolutionary -act." This dynamism,-then; this energy and force that characterize the homosexual movement in America, -places the question of the avowed :homnosexual's -integration into the armedforces in a new-light:-the-issue is-about:power,-political power, andrevolutionary change. As columnist-Samuel Francis writes,.-it-is about who determines-"the norms by-which-we live, and by Which-we define and-govern ourselves.'

What about-rights? Excessive talk about rights tends -to-polarize debate~between absolutes-and-does not-allow -forpoliticalM consensuswbuilding. Does-anyone:have-an:unconditional right to be in the Army (or-in any of the services) ? The historical -answer is clearly no. The Army routinely discriminates--wheivrecruiting -soldiers, enrolling-ROTC cadets,-or-considering -, appointmefitsto-West Point. The Army must consider-not-only skill fequire--mcnts and-the-educationallelvcl-of-appliants, but-such-factors as -personal.. histories, past-.criminal behavior,. and~overall mental -and physical-aptitudes. Itis~simply-arfact that some of these -discriminators are-based in-part on the Spking 1993 13:
€ negative impact some -people would'-have -on the ability of the Army to "preserve good order-and-discipline" and-accomplish its missions. Some'will say that these-same arguments were made against the integration-of minorities and-women, but -thle -fact--is that race and--gender a're -not-behavior. -Sexual conduct is. We allI-have-choices-to-make in-life about-Who-we want-to -bet. -By these--choices we define and limbit ourselves from-being other -things.

That-is,,homosexuals would be incorporated-into-the force, but only-on-the-condition that-they never engage in homosex uall activities.

Thus, to-arguei-with a-straiaht-face-for -chastity as-a-condition-for service-membership-by-homosexuals is either--atally niaive-or-cynhically-disingenuous.

General-Schwarzkopf tells--his-comnplete -life story: in -his own-words with a capital "L." In-the preface, he professes his admiration for Grant's-mnemoirs, probably the -finest military mnemoirs ever written-in the-English -language, -but, as Schwarzkopf acknowledges, -his -hook bears no-resemblance -to -that classic. Those segmnp of the book-coverin g ' his-' ro wi ng oli!' -years, -his---service-d uring -the-Vietnam War, and his-rple in-the-Grenada-inter-vention-of :198-are especiaIly-interesting, but-the-rnost fasciiatinig,-host-significant partis-his. ac-count-.of -Operations -Desert Shield-and -Desert Storm.--
The defining influence onl General-Schwarzkopf's life-was no-doubt his-fitther, a West, Point -graduate, Class of -1-91-7, who -instilled-in-his son at an -early age--the ideals of the US Military Academy-Duty, Honor, Country-andencouraged--himto -follow -in-his father-'s -footsteps at West Point-The younger--Schwarzkopf stoocf high in his-Class of -1956 and could have chosen-assignment to any branch-of the Army, itncluding-the-Corps -of Engineers,'but to his credit he chose-the infantry-tile-heart and-souL-of any -great-army.
-Long -before -he became a second lieutenant of infantry, however, Schwarzkopf had-seen -a -lot-of the world be-yond -his -family home in New Jersey. Shortly after his _12th-birthday-in August 1946, he went to Tehran to ,live with his father, then Co loneI-S chwaitzkopf, who was -a-special -advisor to--the Shah -of Iran; 'Attending -the -Presbyterian -Mission-School -in Tehran -with other foreign -students, be was, exposed-to-the vastly different ways of the
-world as well-as the customns of -he Arab-countfies -neighboring-(Persian) -Iran. In 1947hie went-to Geneva-to-Attend L'Ecole -Internationalb, whose students were children, of diplomats -in 'the region. -Here -he became fluent in French. (He was already -familiar with-Germian-his farnily'being of German descent.) In-Switzerland he was exposed to another-wide spectrum of nationalities as well as to-kids from the other side of -the political fence, young Marxists and communists. In 1948, when his-father was transferred to-Germany, he attended successively the Frankfurt and Feidelberg American high schools, graduating-in 1-950. After spending that summer in Rome with his family, lie returned to the United-States to attend Valley Forge Military Academy-before entering West-Point.
Schwarzkopf's unusual background was-to stand him in good stead throughout -his military career. It seems as though he had been destined to -become-the Commander-in-Chief of the US-Central Command-(CENTCOM), whose area of responsibility included the Persian Gulf -area and much of the Middle-East. Nearing the end of his Army service, lie chose CENTCOM over -two-other four-star commands-lie was offered.
Given-his overpowering personality, it is not surprising that-Schwarzkopf likes to-brags about himself, at times exaggerating -his story -beyond the substantiated-facts. He also-tends to monopolize credit for some of the contributions and-accomplishments-of others. Nevertheless, his refreshing-candor adds credibility-to his story, even though he can-be unthinking and can hurtpeople unnecessarily. When-it comes to his beloved soldiers,-however, he is very caring.
Unfortunately,-Schwarzkopf's bent toward magnifying.his ownrole at the -expense of -others has -gotten him into hot water with-Lieutenant General-(Prince) Khalid-biSultan, a senior member, of the ruling-royal family-of Saudi Arabia. General Khalid, who-was co-commander of coalition -forces participating-inDesert Storm, wrote-a scathing article titled "Schwarzkopf Falls.ShortIn -Writing History," which appeared -in Army Times on-2 November 1992. -Khalid--declared that-"there are so many inaccuracies and slanted-remarks in [Schwarzkopf's] -book that-I feel I-must se~the-record straight . . . . Many ... events described-in It Doesn't Take-a Hero will-be remembered differently-inRiyadh and in the capitalsof other-coalitionypartners." This-controversy will-no-doubt--boost book sales, -but regrettably it is bound -to-hurt US relations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf nations, an area-of-vitallimportance -to the-entire world -Despite General Khalid's unhappiness, nothing can-detract from Schwarzkopf'sinagnificentperformance inDesert Storm as a US and allied commander. Bringing together in harmony -the-many-disparate-allied-andiUS forces involved; -fitting themall-in-the right place whereeach could make the -most valuable contribution-to-the overall effort,,and committing-themto battle in a cohesive,synergisti'cmanner led to-a brilliant-success.
-S--7Ii -aeai'iir part-of.the book, addressing Schwarzkopf's-first-tour-in Vietnam-(1965-:66), one is struck by a-curious-omission.-As a junior officer, Schwarzkopf served as an advisor-to Colonel Ngo Quang Truong, an-outstanding -leader in the Airborne Brigade (later expanded to a-division), -an -elite element of -the South-Vietnamese army. Schwarzkopf -tells us he came to
admire Truong as an exemplary fighting leader he--could never forget. But Truong is never mentioned again. Schwarzkopf seems to be unaware that Truong went on to command-a division, then a corps in the Delta, and then another corps in -the north, all-with great distinction. Indeed, he became one of -the most admired military leaders in South Vietnam. When that -nation collapsed in 1975, he -was evacuated to the United States. Thus it is difficult -to-understand why Schwarzkopf did not recognize this great soldier -further in his book.
Another curiously incomplete picture is found in his account of his second tour in Vietnam (1969-70), when he commanded a battalion in the Americal Division located in the -northern part of the country. His division commander was Major General Lloyd B. Ramsey (now -retired), a -highly experienced and decorated combat leader, -wounded five times in actions previous-to-the Vietnam War. -Schwarzkopf speaks disparagingly about Ramsey's headquarters at Chu-Lai, singling out the officers' mess-for, being too plush for a warzone.-(-The way the warwas-fought, all of South-Vietnam was a war-zone! Moreover, Schwarzkopf, on his firsttour in Vietnam as a junior-officer, lived in a -villa in Saigon when-he-was not out in-the-field-with-his South-Vietnamese counterpart.) Ramsey inherited the headquarters at Chu Lai from a succession--of previous division commanders; he had-to live somewhere, if not-at -the division's established-command-post. But, unaccountably, Schwarzkopf does -not mention what happened to -Ramsey. On 17 March 1970; his helicopter crashed -in a remote jungle area, and after every available helicopter in the division was tasked -to-find the-crash site, a:chopper with Schwarzkopf abo;ird found Ramsey. Badly injured, Ramsey had been-unconscious or semiconscious -for some 18-hours whewhe-was-rescued. He was evacuated to the United States and miraculously lived to-tell the-tale. Again it iszdifficult-tounderstand-why Schwarzkopf made no mention of this dramatic episode. In the book,moreover, Ramsey's successor as the division commander--is -incorrectly identified as Major-General Stan Meloy when in -fact it was Major General A. E. Milloy. Assumingthat Schwarzkopf knewrthe correct-name of his division commander, such an-egregious error does not-reflect well on the editing-of the book.
The composite-picture of-Schwarzkopf. as a personality-that emerges from-his story-is a complex-one. Perhaps the strongest-impression -is that-of a man with raw courage-and -an overweening ambition, but with a-hair-trigger, -explosive temper that often got-him into trouble.-In his first tour in Vietnam, for example, as a captain and aMACV advisor, Schwarzkopf -blew -his stack and got~away with~flagrantinsuibordinationv toward -(US-Army-colonel-that-shouldnot-have gone unnoticed.1-e wasn't-even ', 2rbally-reprimanded by his senior-in. the MACV advisory chain-of command. 'During the -Grenada intervention of 1983, now Major -General Schwarzkopf 10st-his cool and threatened to courtmartial a-Marine colonel in a-situation that-could-have been better handled with To complete the portrait, it should be added that Schwarzkopf is a superb briefer, talented speaker, and consummate actor. Although he apparently does not care for the media and goes out of his way to keep them out of his hair, he knows how-to use television effectively -and can con the media when -he has to. But above all, Schwarzkopf is a charismatic-leader who-was favored by Lady Luck.and knew how-to exploit good fortune.
Although it is fortunate that this book was written while-things were still fresh in Schwarzkopf's mind, it still leaves some unanswered questions. One hopes that after he has-had time to reflect and mellow, he will sit-down and write -a-more contemplative-sequel; or-at least an-article or -two. Meanwhile, here-are some lingering, unanswered-questions -to -ponder. They are not intended -to detract from-Schwarzkopf's brilliant record in the US Army, but rather to bring to light important areas that for reasons unknown were not addressed-in the book.
Overall joint~planning for Urgent-Fury, -as the operation-was called, was apparently fii at Headquarters CINCLANT with all major commanders present. What guidance did the JCS provide? -How were special operations melded into the-plan? Were they-conducted-independently from-the main H-Hour show? How were they coordinated with the main operations ,plan? Who had ultimate responsibility fo" determining their-feasibility? (Most * of these pre-HrHour operations failed, resulting in a badbeginning for the main evenl.)What were the major planning lessons? Why wasn't an individualdesignated in advance to take-command of the various ground forces-82d Airborne, Marines, Rangers, Special Forces, etc.-after-tley had -been-inserted on -land? (This-is-normal joint and service doctrine.) In Grenada, after the JTF Commander, Vice-Admiral Metcalf,.had in *effect-made Major General-Schwarzkopf his deputy-commander, why didn't the latter -take over ashore? He roundly criticizes -the 82d Airborne Division-for being slow and-timid in-its advance n its objectives-why didn't he-assert himself.and-get the-82d moving?
-. Desert Shield, 1990:
General-Schwarzkopf's command, CENTCOM,-had a good-grasl of the situation in the region just-before Iraq invaded Kuwait-in -early August 1990 and indeed had predicted--the invasion, but did not believe that Saddam would seize all-of Kuwait; However, why did-CENTCOM and-the-intelligence
Parameters-_ _ -r-t7 -7---------_ community so grossly overestimate Iraq's military capabilities? Meresize and numbers-of troops, tanks, aircraft, etc. are meaningless in themselves. As any student of military-history knows, time and again-far smaller forces have decisively -defeated much larger-enemy forces. What counts is the qualitythe fighting heart and will of an army. For several decades, Israel with much smaller forces had decisively defeated any combination of Arab-forces oppos--ing her. The question of quality applied in spades in the case of Iraq, greatly weakened by enormous casualties, during its eight-year war with Iran, a conflict that had-indeed-demoralized Iraqi forces. Why then did the-United States make the Iraqis out-to be ten feet tall? In the event, the Iraqi air force declined -to fight and even the vauntedRepublican Guard was no-match for US forces. How could Iraq possibly be expected to vie successfully with, the world's only superpower reinforced-with strong allied contingents? Moreover, how could Iraq~possibly be a nuclear or chemical threat to theUnited States? Saddam was not crazy enough to Use such weapons, assuming-in thefirst place that he had-the capability to deliver any, knowing full wellthat US retaliation would be-devastating. In sum, it seems reasonably clear,-not just in hindsight, but withthe knowledge of Iraqi -capabilities-possessed at the-time, that the United States could-have decisively defeated Iraq with a smaller force buildup and accomplished this at an earlier date and at lesser cost.
In hindsight, it-does seem clear that the 100-hour ground-battle was endedprematurely -when-our top leaders in Washington, feeling the heat-of public, pressure to-stop-the "wanton-killing" of the enemy, persuaded General Schwarzkopf to agree to a cease-fire before-he could-be reasonably certain-of the destruction of the Republican -Guard. Schwarzkopf had exhorted his forward -battle commanders to-make every possible -effort to-assure totaldestruction, emphasizing -that anything less -was not acceptable. Yet at -the crucial moment, General Schwarzkopf -gave in-and agreed to a-cease-fire at a--time-when only a fewmore hoursimight have-allowed his field-commanders, all of-whom wanted to pressthe attack, to accomplish their mission-Perhaps Schwarzkopf was influenced by the possibility -that our-Arab allies might-not -like-to see the Iraqis crushed-to the point of upsetting the balance of-power in the region. But the fact remains that some half -of the Republican Guard j escaped, leaving Saddam -still entrenched in power. In any event, hopes:for a decisive -military victory, which -had been within-the -grasp of US forces, appear to have -beenthwarted. Only time will-tell howthis-outcome is to be judgcd-It-was not-.he-first-time, -however, tbat-nol iticaloconsiderations-hay e .... taken-precedence over -militaryobjectives.
Finally,-have our-armed Services thought-long and hard enoughabout -----could not maneuver herforces and in effect was almost helpless. What are the implications for all US-services-in the future, not, only with respect to their roles andmissions, -but-also -for service and joint operational doctrine?
In the opinion of this -reviewer, there is -one major flaw in the book-the absence of any strategic overview that puts things in a larger perspective. In referring to the Vietnam War, for example, General Schwarzkopf seems unaware that the President, not the military chiefs, decided the policy on how the United States would fight the war. From the beginning, starting with President Truman and-followed by five successive American Presidents, the decision-was to support South Vietnam, but to-avoid expanding the conflict;-later, when US forces were committed, we were to fight in effect a limited war. North Vietnam was-supported by -the Soviet -Union, a-superpower, and by-China;, the risk of another world--war was very real. South-Vietnam, outmanned and-outgunned by the-North,-could not have survivedwithout outside assistance. Had the-United States not-committed major ground forces in 1965, South Vietnam-would have disappeared-as an -independent state that year. By the same token, had the Soviet Union opposed military action against" Iraq-in -1990, there would'have -been no -UN ultimatum against Iraq, and Desert Shield-and Desert Storm would not have occurred. -In other words, there is a-vast, strategic difference -between the 25-year struggle in Vietnam-and -the six-month-crisis in-the-PersianGulf.
Pursuing this strategic vein, in the broad sweep of history that occurred during-the four-decade period between WorldWarItandthe end of the Cold War, the United-States and its allies-succeeded in containing the Soviet Union and in-preventing any -niajor -territorial-communist-gains:other ' than-China. The presence-of NATO forces -in-Europe, and the-prosecutioh of the-Korean and Vietnam wars, were together largely responsible for this triumph of the Free World. Thus it can zbe said With conviction that the sacrifices of our young-men and women in-those two distant wars were notin vain. Sooner or later, the American people will come to this realization. Schwarzkopf's book would have served -readers-better had he paused at-the end-ofhis distinguished-35-year military-career-tolink-our-post-World-War II conflicts-into a coherent geostrategic-weltanschauung.
The United States remains blessed-with-unsurpassed young American men and women in our armed forces who wilI-carr-outthe-ordersof-their Commander-in-Chief-with no questions asked and without complaint. Likewise, our country continues to produce leaders -worthy of the trust-of our fighting forces. Indeed, -these young people serving in our armed forces know what the motto, "Duty, -Honor, Country," truly means. And so-does-General Schwarzkopf.
Pa- E xternal events arestimulating-our armed forces to think-creatively about E the-future. Although the services are focusing primarily-on how to cope with force reductions,-the-prospect of dramatically smaller-forces should-also prompt the-military to, think aboutways to-improve and-increase capability to help offset loss of mass and combat power. Maneuver warfare is one-way toincreasecombat-effectiveness without-increasing-force size or budget-outlays; However, many sincere and knowledgeable professionals view maneuver warfare with skepticism. Thisessayseeks to clarify and refine the maneuver warfare debate. Many prominent figures,-both in-and-out of uniform, have expressed reservations about maneuver -warfare. Their criticisms deserve a substantive response. If the times do-indeed -demandfundamental change, the-price of -failure requires the most searching examination-before we move to replace current methods -and-theories ofwar with ne-w ones.
Much of thecriticism of maneuver warfare.does not seem to be based on a careful reading and analysis of maneuverwarfare. as a body of thought orset of concepts. In the past decade, a number of-erroneous conclusions were drawn about maneuver which are now commonly accepted as fact. To fairly judge maneuver warfare on its merits, it is necessary to address-some of these common misconceptions or "myths",which surround it. First; however, before addressing-these misconceptions, it may ,be useful to, inquire into the basic assumptions which inform the maneuver -warfare argument.
For many-military professionals,-the-label "maneuver warfare' itself evokes a-certain measure of hostility. This is a product of.the-contentious -debates of a decade ago, -when the so-called-"military reform-movement" took
,.
L --:.: -:-€A on the military establishment and asked it-to revisit what was widelyperceived. to be a uniquely American style of war.' In the views of the military's critics and-many -historians, the American approach to war focused on-a few simple themes: mass, fires, an overwhelming logistical effort, and-a centralized and relatively methodical approach to battle 2 -or, aggregately, what we can call "attrition" warfare.
The first assumption, then, -is -that attrition--warfare has been the American style of war. Of course, American forces have not-always sought victory through-massed fires and overwhelming -force. We have-had our share of Anthony Waynes, Nathan Bedford Forrests, Ranald S Mackenzies, and George C. Pattons. But these outstanding American fighters wereremarkable, perhaps, precisely because they departed from the military norms of the day. Yet, if one looks closely, it is possible-to see in them and-in -others-the outlines of a different way to fight, another way to look at war.
A second basic assumption, AirLand-Battle-doctrine notwithstanding,-is-that the emphasis-onmassed -firesand the linear battlefield still retains a powerful hold'on the institutional consciousness ofthe-American military. The historical -record-supports this-view, and so-does a review-of our-performhance at the National TrainingCenter; Moreover, a-first-1ook~at the-analyses coming out of the-Gulf War suggests that "victory -through-superior firepower" remains central to the American .way of war. 
3
A third assumption is -that the American-military -is. capable -of evolutionary and even revolutionary change in-its -approach -to war, contrary to the views of come detractors. We are-not necessarily-wedded to techniques, doctrines, and -routines which descend from our defining, experiences innorthwest Europe-in 1944, or the amphibious campaigns in-the:Pacific,-or the strategic bombing campaigns-over Germany and Japan. 
5
Againstcredible opponents,. anordered or methodicalview -of the battlefield probably will not reflect reality--if-it ever did. As Clausewitz argued so tellingly a century. and a half ago, the battlefield is a place of friction, of chaos -and uncertainty, of error and-bad weather and missed opportunities. Those who believe otherwise-and there are many these days who see perfect transparency and perfect target acquisition just over the horizon-are engaging in an old, familiar game. They see, inthe-next technological-advance, or perhaps in the nexrdoctrine, a way. to bringabout what all combatleadersdesperately -want: a tactical and operational-universe that is ordered-and understandable. They want aqinear-battlefield.
There may be times when the-battlefieldassumes a linear-character. But-even ifthis-is-so, we canbe confident that-the -human dimension of battle will retain its traditional importance despite -the age of rapid technological change. This is-not to-suggest that-technology -is not of -great-importance in war. But-an emphasis on-technology -that neglects the role of human factors is fundamentally misplaced.
If-the -world -is-fated to.remain -a -dangerous place (and all militaries are:founded on the-supposition-thatit is) and-if the battlefields of the future--continue to be dominated by friction and a-relative absence of order, -how-can a-smaller, less-robust force prevail? Maneuver warfare provides one promising answer. In its exploitation of the fluid nature of-modern-war, itsrecognition of friction, and its-potential for rapid victory without the high casualties and enormous consumption of wealth which-can attend modern war, maneuver warfare offers one answer-to-an -increasingly compelling dilemma.
Keeping in mind.these assumptions and observations, let us examine the more common criticisms of maneuver -warfare.
Myth-Number 1 Maneuver -waifare is nothing more than another set of rides. All theories are-based on a set oforganizing concepts. For maneuver warfare, these-include: emphasis on how-t6 think, hot what to do; targeting the opponent's will-to resist, not-just-his physical resources; a preoccupation with * decisive battle; and the application of strength-against weakness. However, it is difficult to find-a school -of thought that argues so strongly against set rules as a guide to battlefield behavior. This does not mean that AirLand Battle-imperatives or the principles of -war, for example, should be ignored or that-they are unimportant. It does mean-that all rules, -principles, precepts, or whatever we may choose to call them are meaningless except in the context-of the present operation.
Combat situations-cannot be solved-by rules. The-art of war has no traffic with rules, for the infinitely varied circumstances and conditions of combat never produce exactly the same situation-twice. Mission, terrain, weather, dispositions, armament, morale, supply, and comparative strength are variables whose mutations -always combine to form new patterns ,of physical encounter. Thus, in battle, each situation is unique and must be approached-on its-own -merits.
Maneuver warfare eschews absolute rules absolutely. At-Chancellorsville,-Lee dividedhis-force and divided it-again,-trusting to speed, deception, and a certain moral ascendancy over-Hooker to retrieve his-exceedingly dangerous situation.

At Chancellorsville and Tannenberg, the situation, not the rules of the-game, -was-supreme.
Maneuver warfare preaches the futility of formulaic rules -more strongly thanany theoryof war. Itqsbased~on-an-intellectual tradition which stresses "how to-think," not ".what -to-do." The-use-of strength. against weakness to-break thle enemy's willis the analytical framework -which-providesa guide -to action. Possession of -experience, talent, intelligence, will-and, above all, character-is theiprecondition for-applying-this thought process-tolocal conditions. These essential characteristics distinguish those who-can adapt the principles of war to the local situation-and win, -from thosewho-will apply them by rote-and lose-orwin at-great-and -unnecessary-cost.
Myth Number 2: Maneuver walfare exalts the bold -thrust while ignoring firepower. Understanding -the relationshipof fire to mineuver is central-to understanding war. Fundamefitally, this relationship is-not-a functionof the relative "quantity" of one vis-Ii-vis-the other. Despite direct quotations -from the -literature-stating unequivocally that "them-importance of firepower-in maneuver warfare cannot be overenihasized' -critics persist-.Jii the-belief~thatmaneuverists -ignore or neglectlthe role of fies.
It is time to-put this charge, to-rest. Arniies fight wfth-fires. Period. But-some armies emphasize the Use of riassed fires to physically destroy 30  Paranicters
enemy forces for the purpose of-assisting maneuver units in the occupation of terrain. Other -armies use discrete fires-to facilitate decisive maneuver against weak points -inorder to cause the collapse and-disintegration of the enemy forces. Some-armies do both, whether by accident or not. But generally speaking, armies-fight in the spirit of the former-as France did-offensively in 1914 and defensively in 1940, and as wedid inKorea and Vietnam-or in the spirit of the latter-as reflected in the operating styles of the Wermacht, the Israeli Defense -Force, and -the North Vietnamese army and-Viet Cong. What-is different in maneuver warfare is the relationship between fire and maneuver. -In maneuver warfare, the object of maneuver is not to position fires-for the-ultimate-destruction of the eneroy. Ideally, fires are used to create conditions which support decisive maneuver-that is, movement of -combat-forces in relation tothe enemy so as to destroy his will to resist. In the 1973 and 1982 wars,-the Israeli Defense Force used battalion-sized units as a base of fire to support maneuver by other forces moving to deliver-a decisive -blow. But overall-they possessed many -fewer -artillery systems. and tanks than their opponents.
Local conditions (for example, a holding operation) may dictate something different. But-under normal-circumstances the technique of choice should-be decisive-maneuver supported by fires, and not the reverse. Armies that emphasize, maneuver will require -a. lesser. degree of-fire support-because the-objective-is not the physical annihilation of enemy forcesand equipnent. Instead-of-the brute massing-of fires, concentration and-timing become the keys to-effective fire-support. Fire systems must of course exist in reasonable numbers,but it should not be necessary to overwhelm-the.enemy with-artillery. It -is illuminating that-large -numbers of massed-fire systems breed in the Army's institutionalmind a confidence that our maneuver capabilitydoes not, * Myth Number 3: Maneuver warfare is inconsistent with American military culture. This is a-favorite bromide with many-critics who-argue that America's predilection-for "industrial" Warfare is a:cultural imperative. It can -be summarized in the .quaint -allegation that-the American-military won't change because it can't."

the, charge that American soldiers are hostage-to a -historical-determinismthat denies them the capacity for progress and change.
As'an institution we have-shownrourselves capable of absorbing the lessons of the-past and applying them-to-the present. There is no-reason why a-military as professional as ours, with the kind of intellectual -resources-we dispose and-the caliber of soldiers and leaders we-can boast, should remain wedded to the practices of the past. If we-as a profession:see a path to a-better way, our reach, need not-exceed -our -grasp.
* Myth Number 4: Maneuver waifare -promises bloodless war. In conventional -conflicts, the ideal outcome is the rapid collapse of the opponent without protracted combat. The United States and-its coalition partners achieved such an outcome in the Gulf War, it-can be argued, largely through the-application of maneuver warfare at, the operational -level of war. But in a contest -between -rivalstates,, where the contending parties-are roughly equivalent and armed with-modern; lethal weaponry, maneuver warfarepromises no free-ride.
The -1866 Prussian-Austrian War, -the 1940 invasionof -France, andthe 1967 Six-Day War each-brought about-the humiliationof worthy-foes by rivals of approximately equal strength. In -each -case victory was -achieved quickly and decisively. But these victories were not bloodless. Some victorious-units suffered terribly, andstrategic success overshadowed -many -tactical defeats and reverses. No doctrine, no methodology, no art-can-fairly promise overwhelming victoiy without cost, Yet these three campaigns stand out in military history as brilliant examples of -what can be accomplished through the dislocation in timeand-space of-an-opponent-otherwise equal.in numbers and-weaponry. By-avoiding-known enemy strengths-and striking at sensitiveand vulnerable:centers of-gravity,-the victors-achieved-the collapse-and -disintegration-of their-opponents '-field forces in short order. They avoided a protracted series of debilitating battles, each with its-inevitable casualties-through grinding-exhaustion, sanguinary fire, and headon collisions with enemy force. While no war is bloodless, maneuver-warfare offers the possibility of reduced casualties-throughthe-rapidity of-operational, and-strategic-success.
-. Myth Numbe 5: There-is no-such thing as attrition waifare. One sometimes -hears-that-no such-school as attrition warfare actuallyexists, and $ thus that nianeuver warfare throws its intellectual-punch at empty air.

Only-inthe past.decade-has-ptblished doctrine explicitly addressedthis -mbalance, and we cannot yet know how -well -we have absorbed the -------..
..
philosophy of AirLand Battle. While its-outlines seem clearly visible in Operation Desert Storm at the-operational level of war, at the tactical level combat very much resembled traditional smash-mouth-warfare, with huge quantities of firepowerbeing poured on enemy-formations in lieu of maneuver. This is not necessarily a-bad thing-if-our forces can quicklyswitch doctrinal-gears in circumstances where such techniques-are-not effective. The historical record suggests, -however, that many American commanders,-with notable exceptions, could -not. A maneuver-focused force can adapt when faced with-equal or superior firepower. A mass-focused, force-cannota.
It is perfectly true that there is no, systematically articulated or codified theory of attrition warfare. Yet, the continuing outlines of an industrial approach to war, decade after decade and conflict after conflict, suggest that the mass vs. maneuver debate is both relevant and real.
Myth Number 6: Maneuver waifare is "just fighting smart." Certainly -there is nothing new or even particularly original about -maneuver warfare. What is new-is the attempt to-organize successful concepts-from the -past around a unifying theme and then articulate that theme so it canbe understood and applied-more readily. Ardant Du-Picq-warned-that while technology-chan-g-i, human nature,-and its -influence in battle, does not. -And while use of maneuver is indeed-fighting smart, itis~a whole lot more.
Most leaders have been schooled to solve battlefield problems-through the application -of !echniques-and -a standard -repertoire -of -tactical solutions. These solutions -presuppose -near-perfect control. The desire for control is nothing more than a natural desire to impose order on disorder. When-we lunge for a flank we are trying to do-the same thing. We-have been taught that-flanks are-vulnerable places and we shoukdtgo forthem, thus imposing "order" on war by rule.
The-problem is that often flanks are not vulneiable, -as the Germans discovered to their-chagrin atiKursk. The ability to-discern strength from weakness-is -not -a-programmed -response. It is, largely an art, developed by years of thinking about-such things, and-it is mastered by some better than others. But. it is, in -fact,-an intellectual discipline, practically derived.
-Inibattle, many leaders-will, do -one of two -things. They -will -bring heavy-fires to bear and attack-frontally, or they willsuppress the enemy and maneuver to a flank. Both options are conditioned -responses. They -reflect patterned-behavior. When -and if -they succeed; we call it "fighting smart." Neither response,:however,,is based-upon a-bonafide-thought process. Most leaders use the commander's estimatej the staff-planming-process, and mission, a naysis to plan an-peration. While these are useful -and necessary -mental checklists, they-are at best a mechanical planning process-a wayto-organize one's time and ensure the completion of-necessary planning tasks--but-not-a -true thought process. They-do not providea mental-framework-for the analysis Spring1993, 33
andsolution of battlefield problems. They do not represent a theory or philosophy of warfighting, unless we consider the reduction-of warfare to target lists, phase lines, and timetables a philosophy. What then, is the thought process he should-employ? At a crude level, the-process goes something-like:this: identify a decisive-weakness, find or -make a gap, ruthlessly exploit it, and continue to do so untilthe enemy collapses. The means-used to-do this-fires, maneuver,-reconnaissance, intelligence,-the will and-vision-of the commander, the courage and initiative of subordinates-are means-to achieve the enemy's collapse. They are not ends -in themselves. The terms we use are not-important (for convenience I call it "maneuverist," but other -terms couldserve). What is important and defining
is the thought-process -behind the methodology and the results achieved.
-0 Myth Number 7: Maneltverists see maneuver as all end in-itself. This is a persistent claim whose origin is-difficult to-trace. Presumably it is a response to -the label "maneuver-warfare" , and to criticism directed against the promiscuous use -of firepower. A close -reading -of military -history and-of maneuver literature, however,-quickly-reveals thetrue end of maneuver operations.
Running -throughout thememoirs of successful-Germangenerals of the-First and Second-World-Wars is a preoccupation-with-decisive-action. One cannot read, Von Mellenthin, Von Manstein, Rommel, or Guderian without being struck by the constant emphasis-on the decisivebattle. Whereas attrition or industrial warfare "seeks battle-under any or all conditions, pitting strength against-strength to exact-the greatest-toll -from-the-enemy,""-maneuver warfareseeks battle-only under advantageous conditions where a-decisive result can be achieved.
This obsession-with forcing a decision is'the defining characteristic of maneuver warfare. It undoubtedly descends fromthe experiences of -the Prussian, -German, and Israeli armies, which, when faced with superior numbers-and enemies on-all sides, developed a:theory of war to-compensate-for numerical -inferiority withintellectual and-moral-vigor. These armies-could not, afford to--become locked in attritional exchanges where -mass could dominate. Instead, they sought -to--create conditions where speed, tempo, focus, and -initiativecould-be used-to-score aknockout.
These armies and others like them-did not see~nmaneuver as an end in itself, nor do maneuverists tout maneuver as an end-in itself. To seek and gain the decision-as rapidly, vigorously, andeconomically as -possible--is the true-end-of -battles and campaigns. The Marine Corps' doctrinal discussion-of the-conductof war in -its principalwarfighting manual captures the-essence of -maneuver warfare simply -andsuccinctly: "This is.'how 1 will, achieve a decision;everything else is-secondary. Our recent experiences with armed conflict in Panama.and -Kuwait suggest that we mayhave-graspedmaneuverwarfareat the operational level 4 but not at the tactical. Furthermore, there is much to suggest that technology, among other things, will make maneuver-warfare at the tactical level even less likely to take hold in the American military.

What-is the evidence that the United States practiced maneuver warfare -operationally -during-Operations JustCause and<Desert-Storm? The strongest indicator in both cases was-an evidentdetermination to strike swiftly at an identified center-of -gravity and-avoid force-on-force engagements with large enemy units, except on favorable -terms. A-distinctive-feature in -both operations was-the attempt-to stun or-paralyze the enemy's ability-to command and control his-forces-to shock the enemy's nervous system at the outset and prevent a coordinated response. In both-campaigns, -the operational plan sought to, create conditions that-would force-a-decision quickly, without the need for extended combat."

While US forces may have carried traditional methods, techniques, and doctrine to new heights, they have not absorbed maneuver warfare at division level and below. Command and control-remained-rigidly centralized. Units moved in strict conformance-to planned control measures.:Fire control of artillery and close air support was consolidated at high levels; much was planned in-advance.'

Thesemethods worked well against a passive enemy. But they do not reflect thespirit of AirLand Battle-doctrine at the tactical,level, and they do not-reflect a conceptual -grasp-of maneuver warfare.
* Myth Number 9: Maneuverists have failed-to definectheirterms. This myth is sometimes colorfully packaged, as in the following: "Many discussants held-that reformers had-done their cause a great disservice by failing to identify and clarify the most-significant-empirical -referents of the maneuver notion."'

The study-of war becomesmore-useful-and relevant as its students strip away the6 peripheral'-to come -to grips with the true nature of human c~ifflic.Real-piogress becomes possible only-to the extent that students and practitioners of the-militarysart can focus on this essential concern objectively. Soldiers and scholars (as-well as those who are-boih)-have important roles to play in what-is fundamentally a-dynamic, Hegelian process. Neither has -a--monopoly on the-truth.
By now, the important assumptions-and the organizing-concepts -of maneuver warfare are well known andwell articulated. There is a substantial body of literature on ihe-subject-and no lack of advocates and critics on both sides of the issue. Experts may disagree on the validity or applicability of maneuver warfare as a theory of war. Butthe charge that it has never been adequately defined is thin indeed.
Ifyou' ve never done it, you can't theorize about it. Regrettably, many ofthe early debates about-maneuver warfare focused on personalities. While civilians and academics charged senior military leaders with lacking a real understanding and historical grasp of their profession, military professionals responded with harsh criticism of thereformers' lack -of combat experience and understanding-of the realities of moderh warfare. In the exchange, both sides sometimes failed to listen to the other;both missed opportunities-to further the study of-the profession.
No-civilian-theorist or-historian-unbloodied by fire-can answer the charge-that-he lacks practical experience-,in war. No officer-who.has never marched to the sound of guns can rebut the criticism that he has not commanded troops in combat. Nevertheless, the charges laid against such thinkers • are criticisms of individuals, not of their intellectual contributions to the debate. These latter must-stand-or fall on their owii-merits, not on the resumes of their proponents. Military history is-replete with-examples of outstanding military figures, such as Nathan-Bedford Forrest, Wade Hampton, and Joshua Chamberlain, who possessed a flair-for command but lacked practical experience or-profes--sional training. Others, such-as-Alfred-Thayer Mahan, Ardant duPicq, Liddell Hart, and Clausewitz himself, distinguished themselves as outstanding-military theorists despite a lack of impressive credentials as wartime commanders. Their example suggests -thar-it is vigorous debate carried on in-a collegial-and constructive manner-and not ad-hominem barbs at the-participants-that is most essential to the furtherance of the military art.

The core issue in the debate is the disappearance of our long-standingprincipal adversary, the Soviet Union. As-a-result, -the-military-has. felt-itself -constrained -to -identify other threats-and -produce theoretical scenarios -that wouldjustify future force structures. This approach is-doomed-to defeatinthe current political environment by-those who willbrand aff potential-threats and scenarios -either as-too-pessimistic-or as outlandish, self-serving-fantasy.
-The -truth is, -the simplistic:identification-of a principal enemy,--the foundation-of Cold War thilitary-poicy-no-longer works. Itis asystemically -flawed-procedure based on assumptions that-consistently proved wantingeven, during the-Cold War. Further, the-vain-searcil-for-an enemny~has so dominated -the-defense, debate that important issues that should affect the debate -have been-all but ignored. What follows is an explication of the flaws in the "traditional" method, a proposal for a-iore rational approach, and-a, discussionof some important submerged -issues rwhich have not yet been uncovered-by the -shallow digging-of the current debate.
What is wrong with identifying -the enemy as the first step in the traditional defense decision process? The answer-is twofold. First, such an approach seeks-short-term guidance to solve a long-term problem. Interna--tional power politics are volatile. Yesterday's adversary becomes tomorrow's ally, and vice versa. But building-a-competent-and effective military organization is -a long-term process -often extending over decades. Modern armies, navies, and air forces are extraordinarily complex organizations whichctake considerable time to fashion into-effective-fighting forces.
Considerfor example, that-it requires-two years to-train-a pilot to Pninimum combat proficiency in modern, high-tech aircraft. Yet minimum combat -proficiency does not-easily translate to victory and generally results in-very high casualty rates. Consider-the lowly infantryman who, unlike his counterpart in earlier wars, now must master and-use some of the -most sophisticated equipment imaginable--satellite-based positioning systems and night vision systems, for example. The-days in which we could-justput a -carbine-in an infantryman's hands, give him some target practice, and send him off to-war have long since passed.
Consider, too, the amount of-time it takes to -build -modern, weapon systems.-Even discounting research,-development, and procurement time-(some--times stretching over a-decade),-sophisticated aircraft, ships,andltanks take a great-deal -of time to-produce. With-the:decline-in our industrial -base, even-in-an emergency we-could not produce these-weapon systems with the speed and-in -the numbers we mighthave earlier associated-with -industrial mobilization. Finally, consider the time required to educate and seasonmilitary leaders-both commissioned and noncommissioned officers. War-is as much a mental struggle as a physical contest. Educating military officers in-the complexities of modern warfare-is a time-consuming task. Seasoning those officers to leadforces in battle effectively and confidently or to plan complex military campaigns requires even more time. If this corps of officers does not already exist when the fighting starts, there-will be precious little-time to produce these leaders.
All of these'factors-procurement, -training, education, and seasoning-compound the time problem. They explain why it took more than a decade to build from the hollow force of the mid-1970s to the robust force the United States fielded in Desert Storm.
On'the other side of the equation is the enemy we identify. Predicting who will be tomorrow's adversary, or where and when-the civilian leadership will commit military-force, is-a risky business. We were-not very successful making these predictions even during-the Cold War, when we -were-confident we had accurately identified-the enemy.
Consider-the following examples. As little as six months-before the outbreak of hostilities in 1-950,-no-one in a-position of-authority, including the Secretary of State, seems to have-considered that we might-be drawn quickly into a-war against-North Korea. 
3
Two of these examples took place during the-heightof the Cold War when we-hada clearly defined enemy-(the Soviet-Union) and had assumed from the beginning -that the critical flash-point -was in Europe. We should remember that beyond the two "hot" wars the-United-States fough'cduring the -Cold War (Korea -and. Vietnam), we also used or threatened-to use force in-the Straits-of Formosa, Lebanon-(twice), Grenada, Panama, and Libya, to name but a few examples. None of these situations-directly involved the Soviets, and-none took place in Europe. So much for the accuracy of our-predictions.
The second problem in basing force structure on a definitively identified enemy is that it promotes worst-case planning based-on faulty assumptions. Such was the case during -the Cold War. With the Soviets identified as -theenemy, the United States built a military establishment-to deter or defeat the worst-possible case--nuclear confrontation -or an invasion of Western Europe. That was-a natural and logical'policy. However, implicit in the policy was-the general assumption that if we-were prepared-for the worst case, -we were automatically prepared for -lesser cases. ' The war-in Vietnam demonstrated -that our military must also -be prepared for different cases, not
--just lesser cases. Although possessing far superiortechnology and firepower, we were woefully unprepared for the-kind of war waged in Vietnam.
Predicting the -Iong-terhi adversaries of the United States -is a-difsficult, -if not impossible, proposItion. Moreover, it is adangerous exercise in A that it 'may leave us unprepared for the kind of conflict actually. encountered. The United States-needs a longer-term strategy that considers both the unpredictability-of international politics and the full range of threats we might face.
The key to this strategy is what the -United States will'tace rather than-whom.
Even in the face of an uncertain future, we can say with--great confidence that the-US-military must be prepared-to deal-with three fundamentally different-kinds -of warfare.' Each requires-its own strategy, 'force structure, operational methods, equipment, and training. The -generalized -(and clearly oversimplified) descriptions of these kinds -of warfare that follow illustrate -theirfundamental -differences.
Americans are most familiar with conventional warfare. In-this century the Gulf War,-the various Arab-Israeli wars, the Korean War, and-both World Wars were prominent examplesof conventional warfare. What did these-very different conflicts have in common? Operationally-they emphasized large-unit operations and a heavy reliance -on firepower. Maneuver was based on-the mechanizedmobility of -large-units. As with all-conventional wars, strategies revolved around perceived "centers of gravity" of the antagonists. 
'
Insurgencies a, wars of the weak against the strong-of those out of power against-those in~power. They-are revolutionary civil wars generally fought for. political -control-of the state in question. Although there ate many insurgent strategies theyall-have niuch-incommon, and~they~all-turn-conventional strategies on-their collective ear.'
Insurgencies use a sophisticated mix of political, economic,-psychological; and-military operations:to drain support away from-the government and -build support for the insurgents. The-military portion of the mix often -plays only a supporting role, and therein-lies both a dilemma and an advantage. 42  Parameters
The insurgent needs to, win either the non-militaryor the-military'struggle to achieve victory. The government-must win both the military and non-military aspects of the struggle. Time-is a. key weapon-for the insurgent. Rather thanproviding-quick victory, insurgencies are protracted affairs-every day thatthe insurgency survives-heaps more discredit upon the government. The very survival of an insurgency provides the~impression that the government is not in control of its future.
On the military front, guerrilla tactics are the-norm for the insurgent because the insurgent generally -cannot -compete directly with the military forces of the government in power. Guerrilla tactics dictate that insurgent military maneuvers be based on the-mobility of the individual soldier rather than the mechanized mobility of-large formations.,
The most important difference between insurgent and' conventional warfare:is-that-the centers of gravity for-both sides-are-the same-the population of-the nation-under siege. Insurgents cannot survive without significant support from the people, nor can the government. This fact-brings into question the-basic'military strategy of attacking the enemy's center ofgravity by-putting-fire and steel'on target.
Though-the threat-of superpower nuclear confrontation has significantly-subsided; nuclear weapons will not cease to exist and thus their threatening nature will continue. Many commentators have -postulated-that the spread of nuclear weapons -to-new-,potential antagonists -will-only heightenthe threat.
Nuclear-warfare -is fundamentally different-from other types of war -on at-least two counts. The first is the potential-destruction -that could result from the detonation-of even-a single-nuclear weapon. As-aresult, the declared policy of the United States for nearly 50 years has put -the deterrence of nuclear warfare as the first -national security priority! Another -important difference betw -n -nuclear -warfare and all other forms of-conflict is the ignorance of those who wage it concerning-the ultimate -consequences. Setting aside the isolated, unilateral strikes-against Nagasaki and -Hiroshima at-the end of World-War 11, there has never been a nuclear war. We have no-empirical evidence as -to what might happen once the first nuclear detonation takes place against an enemy who possesses the means to retaliate in kind. Can-escalation-be controlled? What-would constitute victory? What would bring the enemy to his knees? Why would-one use such weapons, -given the potential risks?-For these and-a thuusand-other questions, ranging fromthegrand, strategic to the tactical; We-have no evidenceand no answers, only opinions.
Even more-troubling is the-notion that traditional-concepts of deterrence-may -not apply to some new members ofthe nuclear club. The Soviet Union was a very good enemy in-,its day! Deterrence concepts-seemed to work. Will they also -work against nations that have 'much less -to lose, or against Spring 1993 43
nations motivated by religious, ethnic, or nationalistic fervor only dimly understood-in the West?
Armed-with an understanding of the three fundamental types of warfare with which our military forces may be forced to-deal, we can begin to estimate the size and kinds of forces we will need. The most-rational approach;in-view of the volatility of international-power politics-is to analyze each of the types of warfare we may face (conventional, nuclear, insurgency) in the'light of those forces extant in the world that could realistically wage a particular type of warfare against us-no matter who possesses those forces. The key is what-not who-may cause the problem in an-uncertain future.
This approach is-not new. Before World -WarI, the British sized their -fleet-which-they -considered-crucial-o the maintenance and defense-of-their global empire-using a-similar process. The-British policy was to-maintain a fleet equal in size to the -two next largest fleets combined. 
9
-Finally, the two-power standard provided a logical rationale-for adjusting the size of-theRoyal Navy, over time, based on something more than-temporary budgeting problems or-passing political whims.
A similar example can be-found in-the construction of the Washington Naval Treatiesnegotiated-during the 1920s. In those instances, the great-naval powers established size ratios for their respective navies without. reference -to specific enemies." 0 Again, whether ultimately successful in their-purpose or not, these ratios provided a rationale for force size without regard to currentenmities.
The point is, of course, that rational decisions for the long term-have been and can be made without identifying specific national actorsas -the "threat-" That process, -however, -still leaves the question of the decisions themselves. What guidelines-should the United States use to develop a modern version-of the British two-power -standard? Guidance can be found in some issues that-have yet to surface-in the public debate.
The shallowness of the debate and its misguided focus on threat . . ...
-identification have prevented-discussion of several crucial-issues that bear on theproblem. These hidden-issues fall-into four broad categories: lead-time, force structure, -forcequality, and consequences-of-error. Lead -Tine Time, once squandered; cannot be-reclaimed. This is particularly significant to defense policy for at leasLtwo-reasons. Thefirst has to dowith the peculiar nature-of the American democracy. Americans have traditionally viewed-war, as an aberration in human affairs. As-a resulti there has-often been a reluctance to-respond to growing threats. A prime example of this phenomenon took-place in 1941 when the world Was in already in flames; The Germans-had overrun western and central Europe. The Soviets reeled-under the blitzkrieg. Axis troops rummaged around North Africa and threatened to make the Mediterranean Sea their-private-lake. Passage--through the North Atlantic was hotly contested, In the Pacific, Japan-continued-its endless -war in China and made threatening noises toward the-entire Pacific -region. Even-in the face-of-these -obviousthreats, the US House of Representatives managed to pass a renewal-of the SelectiveService Act-by only a one-vote margin. Justover two months later, the Japanese struckPearl Harbor.
With the demise of the SOviet -threat, there is the-distinct -possibility -that we rnight slip back-into the kind of myopia that gripped much of the nation before-World:War IL It would be:foolhardy to-base our:military preparedness on-the assumption that-future threats will-present themselves-unanibiguously and that they will conveniently provide -a-reluctant-democracy with enough time -jo -build sufficient forces. Strategic warning is more often -lost in the -background noise of world affairs,-ignored for a variety of reasons,or fritteredaway in the laborious -decisionmaking -processes--of -the US government.
-Responsetime -is a crucial element, and-the ability-to -respond in time-can be heavily influenced-by the size-and-structure-ofstanding armed forces.
The difficulty of -recognizing a growing-threat and :mobilizing the political will-to meet it-is magnified by the time-related-problems discussed, earlier. Effective military forces cannot be-designed, procured, -trained, and educated-quickly. A standing.force -made too-small, a -shrunken -defense-indus, trial-base, a reluctance-to recognize-an emerging threat, and a prolonged decision to react could-combine to give-an aggressive adversary an-insurmountable leadin military capability. The-results-could be catastrophic. Time,-in all'its ramifications, must remaina centrallelement in the-defense decisionmaiking-process.
The -structure-of -the future US force is, at least-equal in -importance to its size, but-there is insufficient informed-discussion -of structure in-the -current debate. Any decision -must consider the factor of which kinds .of warfare will likely confront-us-in-the future. The strategies, tactics, weapons, :triningand' organizatiornappropriate-for one.typeof warfare-are not necessarily appropriate for the others. The sweeping-maneuvers-of heavy armoredforces would-be of little use against insurgents using hit-and-run guerrilla -tactics in a jungle. Nuclear-tipped'CBMs may-have little effect ontheconduct of conventional -or-counterinsurgent operations-.
Anotherfactor influencing force structure-is geography. The United States is-essentiallyzan-island nation with'fewthreats-toits territorial'integrity.
But the United States has far-flung national interests reaching into virtually every corner of-the world, No one can predict which of thoseinterests might become so-important in the-future-that, when-threatened, their-defense would warrant the use of military force.
At the same-time, .the American body politic shows-some signs -of wanting to retrench to!Fortress America, or something close to it. If that comes to pass, future employment of American a'ms-will be -in far-off places, requiring massive and rapid deployment, efforts. An expediionary armed -force -in that scenario-one not-reliant-on forward pre-positioning'of -troops and-equipment--.rnust-be highly mobile, quickly transportable, and'have-large amounts-of high-speedolibg-range air and sea lift. Further, it should-be able to put -fire and steel on targets quickly and over-extreme distances -to discourage, slow -down, and ,possibly d'feat an, adversary, -or -to!prepare the battlefieldfor other-forces-being deployed.
Futureforce structure-is crucially importantlest the-United-States be caught-with the wrngforce-at'the wrong-time, and-unable'to get to-the right place. Close, attention-to -the kinds of warfare we will~face-and where we will face then-is essentialto -produce an effective force structure-regardless-ofsize.
Adversaries-on-both sides -of -the-questions-concerning the future-of the American military-probably can agree on one point. Whatever the size of the future force and-whatever -its structure, it--must be the best---_the most effective force person-for-person and weapon-for-weapon in existence. Evenwith-all sides in-agreement, -however, the-quality issue-(or non-issue, if you prefer)-has significant implications-for both the size and-structure of the future force. For example,-a-quality force requires extensive infrastructure-(including -associated-manning and-funding) -for intense and-realistic -training, and professional-education of its commissioned and-noncomnmissioned leaders. Aquality force also requires a robust research and-development program 'oproduce-superior technology for that-force. The proper size of the-future-force is determinedby much more than-just-soldiers-in-thefield, rubberon-the-ramp, and-keels in the -water. The infrastructure of a quality 'force must -be a prominent consideration -in the defense debate.
Thefinal-hidden-issue-in the defense-debateconcerns the consequences of er-t Only the consequences of buildiig-a future military that is too large-have beeh-well vetted. Those-consequences are important-money-andmanpower wasted that could-have been-better spent on:other pressing national needs. -But-erring on-the low side alsoleads to serious-consequences.
The first and-most obvious consequence-of a-too-small, ill-equipped, -or ill-structured force is -that it would-tie-the hands of policymakers. They 46 Parameters i i would find -it increasingly difficult -to deter threats -to our national interests. They would be unable to defeat those who transgress. Indeed, such a-predicament would likely encourage transgressions.
Another possible-consequence is victory at a high price. This scenario would have US leaders committing forces to the battlefieldeven though-they are too smalli ill-equipped, or-ill-structured. Many Americans would die unnecessarily-paying the price for errors on the low side-even though-US -forces managed to carryonand muddle through to eventual victory. This has been the story of American arms for-much of the history of this nation. Such was the case in the Civil War, the two World Wars, and the Korean conflict. The ghosts-of Pearl Harbor,Bataan, Corregidor, Kasserine, and Task ForceSmith bear witness to-the folly of thistraditional -US approach to defense policy.
-Still another consequence of erring on the-low side is a replay of'the second, but--withan-evenmore tragic outcome. Again Americans Woulddie--unnecessarily, but-this time in vain-we-lose. Some would argue that this is what-happened-in Vietnam. The United-States went to war-in Southeast Asia with amilitary unprepared for thelkind of war going on,and-then compounded the error with poor decisionmaking at-every leveL In-the -future, -the -consequences for the United-States could-benimuch-more severe than those-stemming from ourmisadventure in-Southeast Asia-.
The-point is that-errors on-thelow-side lead to consequences-that are at least as unacceptable as~errors-made in building and maintaining a military establishment thatis--toolarge. This problemneeds to be set firmly in--the minds of our pdlicymakersaidwell-articulated in the defense debate. A nation thaitcalls-itself a superpower must'have the armed forces of a-superpower.
Clearly, the current defense debatemust be recast. The new debate frameworkmust take-into account-the volatility of international -politics and juxtapose that-reality with the long-term consequences -of defense policy decisions. Continuing-to -focus on the identification-of anenemy as-the basis -for -defefnse policy--i.e., seeking short-term solutions -to a long-term problem-will-likely result -in.aiuture strategy/capability mismatch,
The hidden issues -must also come to the-fore-as-primary modifiers to what otherwise-might seem a straiglitforward,almost mathematical-calculati on § War and peace, victory and defeat, are not engineeringpr0blems tha tcan be solvedwith calculator aridcomputer. NOr can force size and structuredecisions be-calculated using -Desert-Storm, JustCause, Provide Comfort, or any other equivalents. If one could constructsuch balanced equations, the task of providing fo the commondefense would indeed be simple; Nor should the reader -conclude that. the hidden issues discussed -here are -the only salient -variables. This-article has discussed only those issues that-have been largely
ignored inthe current debate. The number of.issues that will-and should bear on the problem remains imposing.
Of equal importance to recastingthe framework-of the debate are-the participants in the debate. To this point, theinformed debate has been among military professionals, politicians, and--occasionalcolumnists. We have not -brought the publicinto the process. This is a crucial error. The need for national consensus is paramount when there are so many, importantcompeting demands for government resources-Further, the new Administration does not have a clear -political -mandate and-needs broad-consensus on issues of such magnitude. If we fail to fashion-a national-consensus, our plansfor the future American military -will almost certainly founder under-pressure fromiconipeting-domestic agendas. 4. This concept approached its zenith in the 1950s. During 1956, Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles publicly stated;"It seems logical if we have the strength required for global war we could handle any threat of lesser magnitude." Secretary of Defense Charles Wilson turned opinion into policy when he told Congress in 1957. "We are-depending on atonic-weapons for-the defense of the nation. Our-basic defense-policy is based on the use of such atomic weapons as would be militarily-feasible and usable in a smallerwar, if such a war is forced upon us." Quoted in Robert F. Futrell, Ideas, Concepts, Doctrine:AlIlistoyofBasieThinking in-the Unitei States Air Force 1907-1967 (Maxwell APB, Ala.: Air Univ. Press, 1971), pp.227.232.
5. The reader shouldtnot think that warfare P'as only threevariations. Althouoh there appear to be, at this point in history. three fundamentally different kinds of warfare, there are many variations on these three thenties. Nor should-the reader confuse tactics (e.g. guerrilla operations, terrorist-operations) that-are used in many different kinds of-war with the kinds of-wars themselves, 6. Carl von Clausewitz describes center-of gravity in On Wtas "the hub of all power and movement, on which everything depeids, That is tile-point-ag:inst which all ourenergies should be directed" (pp. 595-96). He goes on: "The first task, then. in planning for a-waris-to identify the etiety's centers of gravity.... The second task is to ensure that the forces to be used against-that point are concentrated for a main offensive" (p, 619). Carl von Clausewitz, On Ma,, trand ed, Michael Howard and Peter Paret (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1976). T he overwhelming success of-the United-States -and-its coalition partners 1-in-the Gulf War of 1991-was a -demonstration-of raw military power-that shocked-hot just Iraq, but -uniformed and-civilian pundits-worldwide. The efficiency, lethality, and, most-of all, ease with-which-the-UN coalition forces destroyed:their enemy's ability to-resist was unexpected. Iraq, possessor of the fourth-largesi army -in the -world and the best modern: weapons it could buy,-legally or-illegally, had everyright to anticipate causingheavy casualties to-its opponents.' Onvpaper, Saddam-Hussein's large, battle-tested-army and -air -force -should have been a-formidable force, -able-to give even as tough-anopponent as-the-Americans a-bloody nose.-A number of reasons-have-been-putforward-for the surprising-success of the-US-led coalition. Almost all of them are at-least-partially-true. What has -been largely ignored,'however, is thechanged equation-of military-force deffon-7' strated-by the war, andtheimplications of that change. Alnost-unnoticed; the -technology that drives he science-of war-has taken a giantleap forward; and the Third World has-been left-behind.In any-conventional conflict in which-the -United States or-any ofthe major-Western powers ispitted against a-Third World --adversary, the outcome is-preordained. -In effect, the change isso significant that we have returned-to the military equation of-the 19th century, when colonial warspitted small-numbers of disciplined, well-trained-Western troops with rifles -against-hordes-of-tribal -warriors-armed with only-shields and spears.

Technology and qualitativemanpower improvements are -thus what have made the-offset-strategy -work. -In order to fully -understand the changed military-equation, however,-one must consider several-supplementary-factors.
The first of these is mobility, both -strategic and tactical. So -far as strategic -mobility is-concerned air and sea-power make it-possible. No-other nation on earth-can equal-the quality or quantity-of the ships and-transport aircraft of the -US Navy and Air Force. -Coupled with their overseas bases, which aid deployment, resupnly. and protection capabilities, US strategic -mobility was-unique-even before the demise-of the USSR.

A third factor-is the-sophisticationi ofmunitions.-During the Falklands Wa-, the inability-ofthe-Argentinians-to-properly-fusetheiirsimple iron bombs was a major -factor -in the survival-of a number of British ships, greatly influencing -the overall outcome.

The-force-enhancing-factors mentioned above are not intended to be all-inclusive, but merely suggestive of how technological changes-in -the 
have givena-tremendous-advantaae-to the industrialized -nations. Prior to-the third-technological -revolution; -advances -in warfighting were like linksin-a chain--the--whole being only as strong as -the -weakest -link. The present -capabilitiesof -the US and-Westernmilitaries are different. The -new advantages-in conventionalmilitary-power shown-in the Gulf War are-more -like a woven-nylon-rope, where each individual strand has its own strength, but -together they are stronger-than the sum-of their-parts.
Memories of Vietnam bear -much of -the -blame -for the -failure to recognize key events -that-foreshadowed the Gulf War. The--images -of a victoriousforce of poorly armedand pajama-clad VietCong, unbowed by the power of themighty American-Army; the -vivid-pictures -of overloaded US helicopters taking off-from the-Embassy roof in Saigon only afew steps ahead ofthe-triumphant North Vietnamese; the-panic in the -faces of US-allies leftbehind-these-scenes-andm ore-fIood the -remembrances of a-war fought-for the-wrdng reasons in -the wrong way, and-in the w rong place.

That-is-not to-say we-have-no-weaknesses-or areas for improvementu-the-need-for more strategic lift comes to mind--but the decisions to-invest'in technology and-people-have -paid off dramatically.
* Military power is still useful as-q-diplomatic-tool. Military force has-returned as-a-tool of-diplomacy forthe-UnitedStates.-It'is a-powerfuLtool, It restored national-sovereignty to-Kuwait-and-a-balance of power to the Gulf region.
While the threat-to-the United States and its Western-allies -has assuredly diminished with the end-of the Cold-War. the Gulf War itself, as well as more recent events in what-was formerly Yugoslavia and parts oftlhe former Soviet Union. have vividly illustrated that tle world still faces an -uncertain -future.

There is one final lesson-that-should be -learned from-the Gulf War: Clausewitz was -right-military as well as civilian-leaders must always he mindful -that wars are fought for political -ends. It is time that-the cherished Americanmyth of apolitical warfare-ended. There-are signs that-it is.

Indeed,-the military and politicalrole playedby the-US government was-one of-the-most significant aspects of the-Salvadoran -war Shortly afterhe inauguration of President Reagan ,tlhe United States began an ambitious prograin of security assistance to-El Salvador -that -continuedinto-the Bush Administration. During this period; the Unite States-provided-hundreds of military trainers, tonsof -military -equi pment, and over $4 billion in assistance to-help ensure the survival of the Salvadoran government. On average, El Salvador receivedaboutone million-dollars a-day in -US-assistancefrom 1981-to-19922 American involvement--in-El Salvador and-the results -that -were achieved have generated -agreat deal-of controversy. One-of the-most common themes has-been the "failure"-of US policy in El Salvador. The-signing-ofthe Salvadoran -peaceaccordis -an appropriate juncture to examine -whether that judgment-is valid.
For 1-2 years, the United States walked a policy tightrope in El Salvador. -One US goal was to-stopcommunist expansion and defeat the -military aims-of the leftist-guerrillas. To that endthe United-States-generated one of the greatest military force expansions in Central American history.
-However, the-other-major-US-goalwas -to foster-democracy in-a country-that j Spring 4993 59-V -had-been -ru led -for mios -of fthe 20th-century by a-repressive military -regime. Therchallenge-facing US policymnakers -was-to develop-the Salvadoran-armned forces in-such a-way-that they-becamie both-militarily effective and politically inactive. The primary -thesis -of this art ic1e,con trary-to-most -analyses,-is -that thle United-States was reasonably successful in rneeting-this (IlifficuIt -policy challenge. I will-argue that US success -was based-on the development of a polIicy-that -proved-to -be-flexi ble, effective, and-durable.
Additionally, 1r believe -that-our role -in -thle transformation of the Salvadoran armied forces may-be instructive as-we-seek to-influence thle course of -political change in other countries. In the 1970s and 1980s, thle United States was -concerned-with-authoritarian regimies in-Latin America. Now our concerihas shifted to -political development in -thle -Countries of -Eastern -Europe-and-what uscd to-be-the Soviet -Union.

In-a regional context this meant that-Administration policy was-significantly-influenced-by the-actions of states perceived-to-be Sovietclients. This would include-a-newly Sandinista Nicaragua-and Fidel-Castro's Cuba; both-of whom were instrumental in sup--porting revolution-in-El-Salvador.

Statements by President Reagan and senior Administration officials made it-clear that a very different prism was now refracting-S alvadoran-reality?
The Reagan-Administration-became focused-on EI Salvador -because of the purpose -it could serve in US-Soviet relations. However, the military -component of Reagan's policy was significantly influenced by -the course of events -within-El Salvador itself. During tle 1970s it became clear that -the-Salvadoran-government-was-incapable of-managing internal pressures for political-and economic change By 1980, E1Salvador,'historically a-violentsociety, had-becomiie thekilling grouid-of-Central-Alnerica-.

Over -thenext ten years, the Salvadoran military establishment would! be transformed beyond recognition. Throughout Salvadoran history, the army has-always been the most influential element of the armed-forces and, not surprisingly, much of the American assistance effort centered-on-it. During the-decade of the 1980s, the army expanded -from 6500 to 38,650-soldiers. In-other words, in a country the-size of Massachusetts, with a GNP smaller-than-the annual sales of Apple Compuiter, we see the-development of an army that-was larger than the armies of-five NATO countries. 9 -During this-period,-the Salvadoran armed forces also-became-a more complex organization. An extensive military constructiofi: p-rogram was initiated,-with airfields, depots,-and barracks being builtall overElSalvador. Afnational military training center capable of housing, -feeding, andtraining-9000-recruits a year was rapidly constructed. Regional intelligence centers were built at alf six brigade headquarters -to provide timely collection and analysis-of intelligence.-Military hospitals and a mede-vac system were set-up, drastically-reducing tlhe mortality-rate of woundediSalvadoran -soldiers.'

Both-the-Reagan-andl~ush iadmninistrations-conisistenitly made-two-4+Spriuig 1993 -65 messages quite clear concerning civilian-governmentin-ElSalvador. The first -message was -that-the US-government strongly supported the democratic -process. One-vivid-example wasthe May -1984 election-of President-Duarte. Within-five=days of winningthe election, Duarte-was on anofficial-visit tothe -United-States and-meeting -in -the-OvaIOffice with President Reagan. The second message -was that-the presence of a-civilian government-in-El Salvador was an essential-precondition for US -assistance-The-long-tern nature of-US support -for the'Salvadoran -government-gave Salvadoran -presidents a-powerfulzsource-of leverage intheir-relationships-withthe Salvadoran-military.
The UnitedStates also-workedltto-help-shape-the composition of-the Salvadoran military's leadershlip. -US policymakers -vigorously-supported the moderate officers-wlio-emerged-in the-1980s, such-as-General Vides Casanova, the Minister of Defense, and General-Blandon, the armed -forces Chief of Staff. These-officers realized thatthe S alvadorafri armed forces had been badly splitsby the -1979 coupand-by-the subsequent course of Salvadoran-po1itics. On se-veral-occasions-in the early 1980s,militaryliard.-liners sought-to undermine-the-Duarte administration. The-actions of Vides Casanova-and-Blandonduring -these-potentially divisive -times -demonstrated-their commitment -to a more moderateand-more-unifie&Salvadoran military.
-Putting all:of these achievements -into-the context of Salvadoran political-hiistory,-it would certainly be safe-to describeUSpolicy-as successful. However,:itis not-an unqualified success. Thereare stilsome potholes on the -road-to democracy tithave-to-be safely negotiated.
-One strategic potlole-is that the United States has-hadg-reat difficulty in-fostering-a-close working relationship between the Salvadoran-government and-the Salvadoran military.-For example, several observers-of the warnoticed that-the -Salvadoran-government-never-developed-the Salvaloran-equivalent of a National-Security-Council. Itis-clearthat-this deficiency hamperedthe ability of-le-Salvadoran governmentto carry-out-tlewar. There-were-several so-called' National Plans ldevelopedduring-the war,-but there was never my comprehensive national strategic plan developed as-a result of close coordination between civil-and-militaryleaders.
A political-pothole is-the issue-of defense spending. Over-the last decade, -the-Salvadoran government was-highly successful inobtaining military assistance-from-the USgovern ment. But during their spectacular military -buildup, the Salvadoran-,armedforces and-the Salvadorangove!nment-never had -to -face-the problem of sustaining an armed force -primarily -based-on Salvadoran-resources. in-1990!-El -Salvador. spent only about_2.8-percentvof its gross domestic product-on -its defense-budgeta Many-developing-countries spend-much rnore. By comparison, the-United-States spent 5.4-percent-of -its GDP on-defense during the same-period-.' There are-twoertainties concern--ing -the issue of military funding. One is that US-military aid-to ElSalvador -66
Tarameters-
V will be-substantially reduced--or eliminated.-inthe near future. In fact, the handwriting is-already on the wall.-For over a-decade (from 198 -to -1-992),-E1 Salvador-receivedmore-US military assistance than-any-other Latin Americancountry. That changed in the-FY 1993 budget, -however,-with the Bush Administration-providing Colombiamore -military assistance -than-El Salvador.

The long-term significance of the development of -the Salvadoran armed forces is -not entirely clear atthe-present time. In late 1992, the peace process hit a-snag when the FMLN -temporarily -halted -their:demobilizationprogram. -Guerrilla -leaders -were reacting to an increase in political tension between -the army and-the government-thatoccurred-over the-issue of which officers would-be "purged" froinivthe army.

Many of the recent-political events in Central America -would have seemed improbable several years ago. i 1989 the United--States invaded-Panama with such overwhelhnig -military force -that FI 17-A Stealth -aircraftwere-used-to-bomb Panamanian Defense Force barracks. In 1990 the-Sandinistas-held open elections in-Nicaragua and-voluntarily ceded power to-a 14-party political-coalition headed by Violeta Barriosdce Chamorro. For sheer political improbability, -however, the events in El Salvador rival those-of Panama or Nicaragua. -Based -on recent developments in the relationship between the civilian government and its -military leadcrs, here-is-reason-to-be optimistic about-this-aspectof politics in'EI -Salvador.
The signing of the Mexico Citypeaceaccords was a powerful symbol of -the success of US policy. Put plainly, What-the United States setout to achieve in--ElSalvador was, in large-part, accomplished by January of 1992. Previous attempts to negotiate-peace agreements had been-strongly-opposed -by members of the Salvadoran armed forces. This was-not the casein -1991when senior military leaders-clea!'ly-andipublicly-supported the peacenegotiations. There now exists in El -Salvador a much stronger degree of military support-for civilian leaders than has-existed-atny other time in the last-half century. Another cause -for-optimism is that the armed forces-have become Spring1993 more supportive of -civilian government without splitting into antagonistic factions. The-example of the rebellious cara pintadas in Argenlina (who staged an uprising shortly before President-Bush's state visit in 1990) clearly illustrates the danger of military factionalism-during times of political and economic turmoil. This danger was highlighted -even more dramatically during the attempted-coup in Venezuela last February, when-President Carlos Andres -Perez barely escaped with -his -life.
An examination-of this-decade of American involvement presents some interesting lessons for future US administrations. One-is the durability of-US policy. US policymakers succeeded in crafting a-Salvadoran policy that was both long-term and--expensive without the-benefit of widespread support -from the American public. Another rteresting characteristic is the policy's effectiveness. Some-mayarguethat-US-policy would-not have been-successful if the Soviet-Union had-not-collapsed, thus-reducing-US policy from a causal to-a -coincidental-factor. However, as Stalin-once said, "Quantity has a quality all its-own." There was-a-great deal of "quantity" in-the Salvadoran policy of -the-Reagan Administration. The US government devoted money, materiel,-and -the-attention of its policymakers to the conflict-in-EI-Salvador. The Salvadoran military establishment was transformed. It became more-combat effective, and this gave Salvadoran politicians -time to -become poliically flexible. Salvadoran soldiers also stayed out of the PresidentialPalace, and this gave Salvadoran politicians-room-to be politically flexible. It is remarkable, -given the context of Salvadoran-history and the blunt nature of US policymaking tools, that the US government was able to successfully navigate its policy between-the Scylla of a rightist military coup and the Charybdis of FMLN military victory.
With-the end of -the Cold War, American interest in El-Salvador will fade. The United Stales was willing to helpEl Salvador confront a-communist insurgency and -begin-the f:tnocratic process. The policy objectives that the US government set for itself in Januaiy 1981 concerning El Salvador were in large part-accomplished by the time of the January 1992 peace accords. The future challenge -for US policymakers will be to understand and apply the lessons of El Salvador. The future challenge for the Salvadorans will be-to win the long-term struggle of making democracy work. M obile missiles pose a difficult challenge to US intelligence collection -capabilities. Fhe use of a-mobile launcher, unlike a fixed site or silo, enables a missile unit to employ unique operational practices and exploit natural surroundings in order to elude satellite detection. During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, US intelligence capabilities supporting military targeting missions had limited success in detecting Iraqi mobile missiles, This raised concerns in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf War that US national technical means of intelligence-the primary arms control-verification asset-would be insufficient to satisfy Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) verification requirements fol the SS-25 road-mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) deployed in the former Soviet Union. One critic stated, "The intelligence-gathering apparatus that can't find Scuds in California-size[d] Iraq is the same technology we depend-on to enforce arms control agreements."' This implied that the SS-25 force, operating in the expansive landmass of the former Soviet Union, would prove to be even more elusive to US reconnaissance capabilities than did the relatively smaller and less technologically sophisticated Iraqi missile force.
The dissolution of the Soviet Union, moreover, raises an important question: will US national technical means be sufficient to verify Russian compliance with START provisions for road-mobile missiles, given the likelihood of changes in the size, deployment, structure, and perhaps operations of the SS-25 force?
In order to answer -this-question, it is necessary-to -look mort closely at the role and functions of intelligence in the mobile-missile context. Although Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm demonstrated that mobile targets do pose a difficult intelligence challenge, it is not evident that the problem is linked solely to the capabilities, numbers, or types of reconnaissance assets used to search for missiles. US intelligence performance during the war, moreover, does not serve as a precedent of probable US verification capability under START. Intelligence collection tasks and the types of information required to support mobile missile targeting operations in a-wartime environment differ significantly from the requirements for monitoring treaty-limited items in a peacetime arms control context. The Gulf experience-underscored the-premium that a crisis places on precise and timely intelligence data, and it also demonstrated how limited-understanding of a target set can substantially degrade detection capabilities. US-efforts to monitor START, however, will be-somewhat facilitated by a familiar, less time-urgent collection environment, regardless of the-political changes that have occurred in the former Soviet Union.
A-close study of START mobile -missile provisions also-reveals that the treaty significantly limits any adverse impact on US monitoring capabilities resulting from the -alteration-of SS-25 deployments or operations. START tightly restricts mobile-missile basing and deployment practices and mandates-notification of-certain SS-25 activities and changes in data related to deployed SS-25s and associated facilities. The treaty also includes cooperative measures and inspections that-are designed to enhance monitoring confidence. All of these provisions are applicable to theJanuary 1993 US-Russian START II accord, which is directly linked to the START-framework. Furthermore, practical considerations beyond START will create disincentives for large-scale changes to the SS-25 force.
In order to evaluate the-US ability to monitor SS-25s under START, it is useful to return to the basic issue of the-US intelligence capability against mobile missiles, using the Iraqi experience as a-case study. Spring 1993 71
The Iraqi Al Hussein--or Scud-medium-range ballistic missile was a key coalition target during the Gulf War. The Al Hussein-is a-liquid-fueled system with an approximate range of 600 kilometers and -a 500-kilogram high-explosive warhead witha circular-error probable of about 1000 meters. The -missile's inaccuracy and limited -payload restricted Iraqi use of the Al Hussein in both the Iran-Iraq and Gulf -wars to striking large urban-targets and population centers. By comparison, -the SS-25 is intended -for use against specific military targets. 
"
Both types of missile are also subject to some similar operational practices-that are designed to-promote-force survivability.-For the Al Hussein, these include long-duration -field deployments, frequent and prompt relocation following launch, reload and-refire capability, and-extensive deception techniques -including camouflage and concealment. Available information suggests that SS-25 -forces operate in a similar manner. 
3
The United States used a large number and variety of national and tactical intelligence assets to-support the coalition targeting effort against the Iraqi missile force. US reconnaissance satellites reportedly provided extensive support to military operations and bomb damage assessments.' One important asset used to detect Iraqi missile-launches was the Defense Support Program satellite, a missile warning vehicle equipped-with infrared sensors to detect launch ignition or the rocket -plume of a-missile's trajectory during flight.

-In particular, -Iraqi deception-practices, communications security, and-the desert-environment all complicated-detection-efforts.
The.Iraqi-deception effort associated-with mobile missiles used-many Soviet-style-techniques.' For example, Al Hussein launches-usually-occurred at night,-under the cover of darkness. The-few launches that-did take place-in -the -early morning -hours were -conducted under cloud cover to--minimizedetection-by coalition reconnaissance assets. The Iraqis also adeptly useddummy launch sites and decoy-missiles. Some-sophisticated dummy sites, for example, used heat generators to simulate-active-missileengnines. The-Iraqis also constructed a-network of-drive-through trenches -that might-have served as dummy hide positions.1'4 These sites, most likely-intended to confuse US targeting efforts, were covered -by metal plates and a layer of camouflage netting. The metal-plates -probably were intended-to simulate hide positions for missiles or missile-related equipment, thereby attracting and wasting US fire assets.' Iraqi use of strict-communications security during missile launch procedures might also have complicated coalition targeting efforts.'

signatures suggests that the Iraqis might-have relied-on the use of previous missile launch-trajectories instead of balloons for missile -calibration.

Although the Al Hussein -and-the -SS-25-share some similarities, one should not-infer from the-coalition targeting-effort-against the Iraqi -force that the United States-is incapable of verifying Russian-compliance with START mobile missile -provisions. This-is-thecase-for two reasons: First, the United States knew less about Iraqi missiles than it-does about the -Russian SS-25 -force. Second, requirements for wartime-targeting and peacetime arms-control monitoring differ greatly in-terms-of the type, specificity, and-timeliness of information required;
The-hunt for Iraqi Scuds in the-Gulf War represents the first time a modern intelligence infrastructure was -used-to target mobile missiles in a wartime environment.

ifrom -planning for acquisition,-through research and development, to production and deployment.
In-contrast to its knowledge of the SS-25 threat, the US intelligence community apparently -lacked familiarity with -the -doctrinal, organizational, technical, and operational -details of -the Iraqi missile systems. A Pentagon report to -Congress on the Gul f-War indicated that the intelligence -profile -on Iraqi mobile missiles -and -other equipment was prepared'from scratch during mobilization-for Operation Desert Shield. 
2
During-Operations Desert Shieldand Desert Storm, the intelligence community was -unable -to -establishthe exact number-of Iraqi mobile-missiles and launchers. US -intelligence agencies estimated thatthe Iraqis had 30 fixed launchers, more than 20 mobile -launchers, and-from 300 to 1000 missiles at the outset of the war. 
2
2
The Iraqi experience also-differs from the SS-25 arms control-monitoring problem because the intelligence requirements to support an arms control-agreementdiffer-substantially from those-to support-crisis or wartime conditions. During wartime, intelligence collection is focused on the use of mobile missiles-on the -battlefield. Perishable information about the number ofdeploycd -systems, their -status, and their locations at any given time must reach-military-commanders in-a time-urgent-fashion. Locational data-must be accurate enough tosupport targeting against launch-and support units or command and control elements. Moreover, military'-eaders need-timely battle damage assessments and knowledge of changes-in the enemy's order-of battle.
During peacetime, however, -the -intelligence problemis broaderbased; There is no requirement for precise and timely information-about the Spring4993 exact location of treaty-limited missiles and launchers. Instead, the intelligence community focuses on-changes in -force-status and-readiness, forcesize estimates, and system characteristics, doctrine, and operations. The -intelligence community is able to monitor compliance with arms control treaty provisions, moreover,by -observing daily activitiesat missile production, testing, deployment, training, and maintenance facilities. The objective is to detect anomalous behavior -related to the size, capability, and status of the force. 
2
The basic START requirements -for monitoring the deployed SS-25 force -include verifying-compliance with numerical-limits onroad-mobile missiles and-launchers -and-detectingany cheating activity. 
26
The SS-25force will undergo some changes. The May 1992 Lisbon Protocol to START, signedby -the four republics with-strategic missileforces, designates Russia as thesole nuclear successor of the-former Soviet Union and commits-Ukraine, Belarus, and Kazakhstan to accede to the Nonproliferation Treaty asnon-nuclear states.

Parameters _ 1-
One key treaty provision-is a mandatory data exchange that includes -detailedinformation on the number and location of deployed SS-25s. An initial data exchange on strategic forces took place after START was signed. An update will occur 30 days after the treaty enters into force, and regular updates will occur approximately every six months thereafter. The United States will verify the accuracy of SS-25 data with inspections of SS-25 facilities. Russia is obligated to notify the United States of-any changes in the Memorandum of Understanding -data, including the number of SS-25s and their locations. When the SS-25s in Belarus are relocated to Russia, Russia must-provide site diagrams and-photographs-of any-new-bases -that-are opened to accommodate-the forces.
One concern resulting from the Gulf War experience -is that the SS-25s-are deployed in an area many times larger than-the-localizedregions in which the Iraqi Al Husseins operatedY. 
2

2
Inspections, another key provision, are designed to -helpverify the accuracy of data, supplement coverageby nationaltechnical means, and complicate evasion activities. -Baseline inspections will confirm--the initial Memorandum of Understanding data, and 15 annual data update inspections Spring 1993 will help to verify any changes. If new SS-25 facilities are opened to-accommodate any divisions moved from Belarusto -Russia, for-example, then the United -States will-have the right to conduct new facility inspections as well as close-out inspections -to verify the eliminationof -the old -bases. Conver--sion/elimination inspections are also permitted to confirm the destruction of SS-25 missiles and launchers. Inspections may also take-place following-an exercise dispersal-to ensure that-the-actual number of SS-25s does not exceed the number of SS-25s declared for the base in question.
Open -displays-of SS-25 launchers at road-mobile missile bases, a START cooperative measure, will alsohelp -the intelligence community -to monitor the numbeiroftmissiles atJICBM-garrisons-by increasing the visibility of the force. The United States -may -request an open display -of up to-25 -launchers -or ten-percent of the entire force, whichever is larger. During an open-display, the roof of the SS-25-single-bay garages must-reimain open,-and -the launchers -must-beI ocatedeither halfway-outside -their garages-or adjacent -to-them so-that the -SS-25s are -readily -visible -to satellite reconnaissance.
-Concealmentzmeasuresairezprohibited-during a display, which-could-last-up to seven-liours.
The United-States currently -possesses a strong intelligence base on -the nunber-anddeploymenl--practices -of SS-25s. Assuming-that-Russia does not change SS-25 standardoperating -procedures -in peacetime, the United States shouldbe able to-successfully verify the-quantitative restrictions on deployed -road-mobile-ICBMs. Changes-indeployment practices that-might adversely affect-US monitoring capabilities-at least-in the short-term-include -the dceployment of SS-25s-outside of declared deployment areas, -or -an increase in the -number of SS-25s-out of their-garrisons-at-any one time. These types of activities,however, would violate the-treaty. In crisis-or wartime, of course, it is-likely that SS-25 deploynent practices would change in order to impede US-targeting efforts.
One importantlesson from the -Gulf War -is that effective mobile missile monitoringinpeacetime or targeting-during war-requires-along-term collection effort to create a sound intelligencebase and-improve target familiarity. US--ko-ldge-ofthe SS-25, supplemented with restrictive treaty provisions and -inspections, will enhance-the role of-national technical -means in START verification. Although-a-targcting mission requires more accurate information about the number, status, and-location of deployed systemsand theirsupport units, a high degree-of-famniiiiarity with peacetimeforce size and deployment-and training praclices -can-be -invaluable duringawartime. -In-Iraq, coalition forces -might-have fared-better againstthe Al Hussein threat if'they had had-a robust knowledge-base-similar to-that developed-for Soviet mobile missiles.

in prison and-four months in-house detention to-be followed by one year of supervised-probation-and monetary restitution. How can Army leaders avoid having these unhappy outcomes visited upon either themselves or their subordinates? This essay will undertake to explain how.
The Army is committed to environmental compliance in its operations to a degree that would have shocked its leaders of 20 or even 15 years ago. The Secretary of Defense's statement at -the headFof this article -demonstrates that this commitmentextends to the highest levels in-the Department of Defense. The Secretary of -the Army and -the Chief of Staff have been equally direct in their guidance regarding environmental compliance: "Although the-primary mission of-the United-States Army is national defense, we are committed to protecting our environment and-conserving our natural resource heritage -both for ourselves-and -future generations. 
'
Environmental compliance obligations arise -in many contexts. The installation commander typically runs a-number of operations that come complete with arange of environmental compliance obligations. These operations include wastewater treatment:plants, -boiler plants, drinking water systems, solid waste disposal, range operations, and removal-of-hazardous wastes such as-asbestos, to name some-of the more obvious. Perhaps the obligations of the lower-level-leader are not so obvious, but they are real. Motor pool operations -generate hazardous wastes in-the form of -used oil and other lubricants and solvents that must be-collected, -labeled, stored, and-disposed of properly. POL supply points require spill-prevention and control plans, spill reports, and proper maintenance and record-keeping procedures. Army installations have recycling programs for-paper, waste oil, lead, -brass, and other materials. Army -leaders are responsible for sanitation and waste disposal during field-exercises and other deployments. A leader's failure to attend to the details of proper disposal of hazardous wastes can impair installation 
operations, as Fort -Polk discoveredto--its sorrow when JP-4 aviation fuel -flushed into the sewage treatment plant, destroyed !heplant's ability to treat wastewater, and led-to violations -of the plant's discharge permit.

The several-executive-agencies charged with implementing and enforcing this system of laws, -principally the US -Environmental lProtection Agency (EPA)-andstate environmental-regulatory agencies, further complicate the systei as-they -tend to-compartmentalize themselves along the lines of the-laws-they are implementing.' Thus-Army-leaders are-likely-to-deal-with one-regulatory official regarding air quality-permits, another regarding waste- water -treatment -plant:-operations, and--another regarding hazardous waste programs. Unfortunately, our system of environmentallaws has made onestop shopping for-environmental complianceimpossible--in-most states.
These same-executiveagencies -have added to tle complex nature-of environmentallaw with thei r own bodies of regulations that further interpret the requirements-of the -tatutes passed-bythe-legislatures. These regulations have the force of-iaw-and are as enforceable-as-the-statutes themselves.' 0 Spring 1993 83 ~4
The system of environmental laws is thus not a coherent whole, but rather a series of legislative judgments and executive interpretations about the appropriate approach to each specific type of pollution. Army leaders as-a result confront great complexity in implementing the requirements of this system.
Considering how broadly our system -of environmental laws has atfected life in the Army and in the nation in general-influencing everything from where we can-conduct maneuver training to the contents of our underarm deodorant-one might-assume that it has been with us for many years. But this system-is very young, with most of our existing -federal environmental laws dating back only to the early 1970s."
The fact that our environmental-laws are-recent has-several significant implications for Army leaders. These laws were in many ways experimental, since they imposed-controls for the first-time. The same lawmaking bodies that created the statutes and implementing regulations have amended-them-repeatedly, refining their experimental approaches to-pollution control. 
2
Finally, these comparatively new laws and -their implementing regulations can lead to delays in obtaining the approvals required for complying with the law in a particular situation. The often-uitested techniques available for responding to a unique pollution prevention situation-lead to a predictable = institutional inertia. Higher commands may prove unwilling to approve a new approach until they have subjected it to a lengthy staffing-and review process. The regulatory agency charged with enforcing the law at-the-installation level will face the same dilemma through its supervisory chain. -Ifthe tried-and true methods do not apply in a given situation, Army leaders are likely to find themselves picking their way through a minefield of vague or even conflicting guidance from regulators and higher command-and-staff elements.
As our system of environmental-law matures, and it is doing so quickly, regulatory agencies and the military are-developing greater familiarity with the range of issues and-options involved-in a given-pollution-control situation. As we confront fewer "first times" in our environmental compliance 84 -Pawneters I issues, we will -find -the solutions-more readily, and-the compliance process will become less contentious-and frustrating.
i Environental-Law Is Technology-Based
Our system of environmental -laws -relies heavily on science and technology to accomplish its -mission. For example, -the statutes and their implementing regulations rely on scientific studies to-establish-standards for acceptable levels of pollutants.' 
4
The technical nature -of environmental, law with its scientific andtechnology-based compliance standards cancause apprehension. -But Army leaders confronting a pollution compliance-problemn quickly-develop a working familiarity with-the scientific and technological-issues involved -in-the problem. Every installationhas staff officers -in-the -office of-the staff judge advocate and environmental rnanagement-office-whose job-is-to assist com--manders to-identify-and resolve environmental-compliance issues. Developing a working knowledge of technical or scientific concepts-as they apply to-an environmental-compliance problem is-no-different-from'developing a-working knowledge of any other part of an operational mission which-needs attention.
-Environmental -Law Is-Participatory
Our system of environmental -laws boldly goes where -no law -has gone before-in providing generous-public access-to military installations and to militarydecisionmaking. The system frequently opens-the-front gates of-an Army installation and -the rationa!e-for installation environmirental-decisions to -public inspection. -Congress mandated-this openness to generate public support for environmental-actions through-community input inthe environmental decisionmaking process.'s
The National Environmental-Policy Act (NEPA) and the Superfund Law are good examples of this-legislative-tendency. NEPA requires-the now--familiar Environmental Assessment/Environmental Impact Statement before any federal action which significanttly-affects the environment.' The r MuaIS governing the impact statement require public notice and encour'age public involvement in evaluating-the-proposed project and'its alternatives. This public involvement can include public meetings, correspondence with uniquely affected-persons, and opportunities to submit written or oral comments regarding -the proposed-action. 
7
cleanup under the Superfund-Law must publish-a notice -of tile-proposed RemedialAction Plan-the Army i ntends-to-use to-accomplish7thecleanup. The Army mustprovide-a-reasonable opportunity for written and oral-commrents-and must hold a-public meet ing-regard ing-the plan. 
8
Beyond the-pub lic-participation-envisioned in NEPA-and Superfund, Congress strongly believes in the effectiveness of permitting citizens to sue to enforce-the requirements of environmentallaws. Joe-Citizen-may-bring suitagainst-any polluter,-including militaiy-installations andtheirleadership, who stands in-violation-of environmental protection -laws. " Congress-envisioned thc. citizen's suit as a goad to effective enforcement by regulatory agencies like-the -EPA and as-a-direct enforcement--tool-to -be used-against polluters.-This vision-has come-to pass as concerned-individuals and-groups file-large numbers of citizensuits-each year. The citizen suit provision of the Clean Water Actis-particularlypopular, generatin g-over 880 lawsu its-between 1983 and 1988. And-tliis-figure, impressive tliough it-is, doesn't tell-the whole-story. Just one-environmental-group, the Natural Resources-Defense-Council, during 1984 issued 12 1-notices of intent-o sue under the Clean Wate:Act citizen suit section-and ultimately elected to-file suit in-only 13 of those cases.

As we have seen, our environmental laws have:tough enforcement mechanisms which military installations are-encountering Nwith greater frequency. Violations of environmental compliance obligations generally expose the violator to-civil-and-criminal penalties-and-tothepossibilityof-iaving tocease operations pending resolution of the violation. These legal-sanctions, whether civil-or criminalare -frequently keyed-to each day of violation, making continuingw iolations-especially costly.

The Army's commitment to environmental1 compliance is summarized-in the following-set of environmental-quality goals published as Army policy-in-AR 200--l ."
-Demonstrate leadership in :protecting and improving-the environment. -Minimize environmental-impacts -while maxi nizin readiness.
• Integrateienvironmental considerations into Army decisionniaking. lcRestore lands-and waters damaged by past Army waste disposal -practices. * Support-recycling programs-to-conserve natural resources and minimize generation of wastes. * Actively address environmental -quality -issues in-relations with neighboring communities.

It obliges Army -leaders -to-be -environmentally conscious -in their decisionmaking, in their relations witli thecivilian community, in-field and garrison, and in correcting pastimistakes.

There are two -principal ways in which -the Canadian Forces can be authorized to deal with civil unrest. First, the federal government may-call out the troops under the Emergencies Act, which specifies-several types of civil and military national emergencies where the -federal government is authorized "to take special temporary measures that may not-te-appropriate in normal times" (Preamble). This act-replaced-the War Measures Act, originally written to deal with situations involving external hostilities. Since the War Measures Act permitted denial of basic legal rights, it was viewed as inappropriate in peacetime. Its shortcomings were brought to light in October 1970, when le Front de Liberation du Quebec (FLQ) abducted a British diplomat and-a Quebec cabinet minister, the-latter eventually -being murdered. Prime Minister Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act on the grounds that the actions of the front-constituted a real or apprehended insurrection. The military deployed widely, rounding up and detaining members of the FLQ, as well as some innocent citizens. Partly as a result of what were seen as such unjustified-abuses, the older act was replaced by the Emergencies Act in 1988, which provides -for better safeguards against arbitrary actions.
A second legal mechanism for-calling out-the troops is the National Defence Act. In the United States, state governments have the responsibility to maintain law and order, including dealing with riots and disturbances of the peace. States maintain a National Guard to back up the local-police when its resources prove inadequate. In Canada, the provinces have no comparable force. (Indeed, only three provinces have their own police forces; the rest rely upon local police forces or. where-there are none, on the Mounties." 2 ) The National Defence Act gives a provincial attorney general the power to "requisition" elements of the Canadian Forces "in any case in-which a riot or disturbance of the peace, beyond the power of the civil authorities to suppress, = prevent or deal with and requiring that service, occurs or is, in the opinion of an attorney general, considered as likely to occur."'

This was the situation in the summer of 1990. When the Quebec government requested-troops to deal with armed Mohawks at Oka and Kahnewake, the military had to respond. It was up to the Chief of the Defence Staff, General John de Chastelain, to decide on the extent of the military's support and how the operations would be undertaken. As the standoff continued, both tile federal and Quebec governments adopted a hands-off policy, giving the Canadian-Forces "full rein to handle the stalemate."'

Another concern raised-by the committee was-the "financial responsibility for use of armed forces in aid -of civilian police forces."

A similar warning was recently sounded by Colonel K. T. Eddy, director of Land Studies at the Canadian -Forces Command and -Staff College. Colonel Eddy laments the lack of operational training within the Canadian Forces. He argues that this deficiency ( )uld affect thz ability of the forces to deal with a major internal disturbance through conduct of an actual military campaign:
While the Canadian Forces, especially the army, are capable of dealing with minor internal security threats by means of aid to the civil power,-it is-simply not capable of sustained-operations against any large-scale threat. Of equal concern, the Canadian Forces are not capable of managing multiple threats, internal or external, simultaneously. A more sophisticated and responsive operational doctrine is required than-now-exists. 
28
Thus too-much emphasis upon-aid-to the civil-roles and-the need for greater domestic capabilities could backfire on the Canadian Forces and undermine their standing with -the Canadian public. General-Dan-loomis 2 9 wrote of the FLQ-crisis that there was "not much glory" in-that experience." As much as-the forces are necessary and can-be counted upon-to come to-the aid of the civilpower -in a -thoroughly -professional and-disciplined manner, there are really "no-victorsin-civil disorder.' 3 Nothing could -do -more -to further alienate the military from -the -people of Canada-than-for it to come to be regarded-as-the Canadian equivalentof the notorious national guard-forces found in some Latin American countries.
The A rmed Forces and:the Constitutional -Crisis -Recent discussion-of the-proper role-for the-Canadian Forces in cases of domestic violence has become particularly sensitive in lightrof Canada's on-going constitutionalcrisis. An effort-to finally solve the crisis -was-made in August 1992 when the fedelai governmnt, the-,"ov, c,,,cm s, and= native -leaders -reached a-complex agreement on revising -the constitution. It 
rejected across the country, not just in Quebec, its-defeathas left the future of-that province in confederation still uncertain. (Although, ironically, support for sovereignty within Quebec declined slightly in the wake of the referendum.) The Mulroney government-has stated -that it will-not reopen constitutional talks. The next crucial event is therefore likely tobe the provincial elections in Quebec expected within-a -year. If -the separatist Parti Quebecois wins, it has said it will quickly hold another referendum-in Quebec only-on sovereignty, thus heating up the unity crisis-again. General -de Chastelain has stated that it is not-the role of the armed forces to maintain the unity of the country. The-forces would-be used only to maintain law and order."

One hopes that Canada-will be able to solve its-constitutional crisis and remain a united-country. -If, -unfortunately, this-proves impossible, then at least new arrangements with Quebec should be made with a view-to precluding violence and-having to resort to-fragmenting Canadian Forces to maintain law and order. There are good reasons to expect that this will be the case. As heated as the constitutional debate became, -there was never even the-faintest hint of violence throughout-the recent-referendum campaign and-after. Ideally, the terms and conditions of Quebec -independence could -be settled through negotiation before legal separation actually-takes-place. At the-same-time, an element-of uncertainty and danger exists. Thus there can be no absolute assurance that this peaceable kingdom of unmilitar-y people will be immune to domestic strife-if the 125-year-old confederation begins-quickly to unravel. The world today is full of -examples-of political-change gone out of control and turned violent. It is because of the violence now plaguing other parts of the world-that the new -Canadian statement on defense policy places such particular emphasis upon peacekeeping on foreign shores. How tragically ironic it would be if Canada's overseas-forces had-to be-recalled to-perform-a peacekeeping role in their own country. Perhaps some consideration of this chilling prospect will help Canada's politicat leaders solve the national unity crisis which continues to hover just over the horizon. 2. This is out of a total budget of S159.6 billion or approximately 7.7 percent. In terms of Gross Domestic Product, Canada has spent about two percent on defense for mos of the past 20 years.
3. Canadian-Defence-Policy. p. 14. 4. During the 1960s, the Royal Canadian Air Force, IheRoyal Canadian Navy, and the Canadian Army were unified into a single body. the Canadian Forces. Unification of the three services involved two steps. The first, in 1966, involved the integration of the three service headquarters into a single -National-Defence Headquarters under a single Chief of the Defence Staff. The CDS presided-over-a unified staff, although the three services continued to exist and had theirown chiefs. In 1969 the services themselves were abolished and all forces adopted the same uniform.

While the early pages of the-book discuss medical care and other relevant contextual matters, the volume also chronicles the end of the Warsaw Pact and Mikhail Gorbachev's role as a historic transition leader. The celebrated "missile gap" that Senator John F. Kennedy alleged during his successful candidacy -for President deliberately receives scant treatment in my book because recentrevelations in Moscow have cast new light on this topic, which necessitates a-more fundamentalre-look.
-History niay be a moving stream of consciousness that-knows no-end, but military professionals and strategists need to monitor the flow. The-threat of surprise attack is a-universal phenomenon little affected by-the Soviet Union's demise, and Strategic Surprise in the Age of Glasnost continues to-be-relevant to -this key issue.
The Reviewer Replies: I am surprised to learn I "did-not address" Colonel Twining's central thesis as in rereading my review I-discover-I not only acknowledged that central-thesis but noted it to be-"particularly satisfying." I do-not regard Strategic Surprise as irrelevant, merely badly timed. Those very watershedevents -which now offer-the Soviet Union a future-have robbed this book of one. That is a conclusion, not a criticism. It is very difficult-to write about the present when the future keeps interfering.
As Colonel Twining.points out, "recent revelations-in Moscow" promise new analyses and interpretations of events already on the shelf as history. But-if the past is undergoing reevaluation, so is the future. Strategic-Surprise provides a-notable start point from -which to -weigh-the central problem that an inadvertent or accidental missile launch could ignite a-nuclear-war.-Events since this book's publication-the Ukraine'snuclear weapons stance, American-efforts -to-assistin-the accounting-and safeguarding-of Sovietnuclear weapons -regardlessof who claims entitlement, and even our recent election-demandeven heightened concern-for that-possibility and careful-consideration-of even-newer, more-complex options-for the -future.
-Because Strategic Surprise-and the Age of Glasnostwas -written before the Soviet Union's disintegration. much of-it is simply dated. That does notmean, nor does my review-claim, this is an unworthy-book. World events just:moved too quickly, strategicallysurprising us all.-Even-inthe Age of Glasnost. "Now Henry is devious. Henry is difficult-some people think lie's obnoxious-but lie's a terrific-negotiator," said Richard Nixon about Kissinger years after they worked together in triumph. Nixon's characteristically cutting praise was spoken during a rare television appearance on "Meet the-Press," as lie urged then-President Ronald Reagan to appoint Kissinger as a "heavy-weight-negotiator" on the Middle East. The relationship-between Nixon and Kissinger-sidekicks, rivals, co-conspirators, colleagues, and-competitors-is among-the -most bizarre of personal-official -relationships. Kissinger's gifted biographer Walter-lsaacson writes, "As-each of them acquired the power lie had long sought. they retained the persomal insecurities that they found reflected in each other."
Kissinger is a marvelous bigger-than-life-biography about a bigger-than-life figure. While it intrigues by delving into personalities-a Time magazine editor like Isaacson naturally injects-Tme-like color and verve-the-book also instructs us on a critical period of postwar foreign policy.
Nixon and Kissinger did not know each other well-they had met just once-when the President-elect selected the-Harvard professor as his National Security Advisor in 1968. After that, they fawned overeach other when together and bad-mouthed each other when apart. After leaving the White House. Kissinger liked to tell of Pat Nixon 'squestion-to Kissinger when-he initially-told her liow-brilliant-her-husband-was: "You haven't seen through -him -yet?" she reportedly replied. As Isaacson pointsout, Kissinger was brilliant in capturing the-essence of both a person and a problem.-Kissinger wrote later how Nixon "had set himself a-goal-beyond human capacity: to make-himself over entirely. But the gods exacted a fearful-price for this presumption." -Kissinger believed. "Nixon paid, first, theprice of congenital insecurity. And ultimately lie learned what the Greeks had known: that the worst punishment can be having-one's wishes filled too completely." Kissinger caught the "titanic struggle" -that ensued within Nixon's being: "Most men mature around-a central-core; Nixon had-several. That-is why-he was never at-peace with-himself."
Still Kissinger was so sickeningly sycophantic-toward Nixon-documented throughout this biography-that it dilutes-any admiration-for Kissinger's insightfulness. Indeed, one may-and should-adinire-Kissinger for-his foreign policy analysis and skills-a! enunc;aLtg-and-exec,,,t;ng policy Fre-stri;ns wil1-.. ik-h,.'m-as-mong the best US-diplomats of this-century. Yet-no one can-admire-Kissinger for-his character.
lsaacson's 800-pages force-the-reader-to confront that character as Kissinger allows-wiretaps-to be-placed on journalists, on his own-staff,-and on-personalfiiends. This-led-to the Nixon-Whiite House establishing the Plumbers "dirty-tricks" unit, -which inzturn led to the Watergate-break-in. -Page-after page-recounts Kissinger's duplicity, -, 3t back-channels, secrecy, and -intrigue. While-an exciting story-and an inspiring one, of a Jewish boy in Germany who fled Nazism to make good in America-it is not a pretty picture of personal decency. Wal ter -Isaacson writes: "Napoleon once said of Metternici-that-he confused policy with -intrigue, Kissinger was a master at-both." That certainly sounds true, but is it? Was he a-master at policy?-Specifically, how do-the Nixon-Kissinger policies stand up nearly 20 years-later? Spectacularly well on one-fourth of their-majoi' policy moves. Kissinger's-step-by-step disengagement negotiations-on the Middle East were spectacular. They allowed the 1973 Yom Kippur War to end by paving the way to peace -between Egypt and Israel. That agreement has-withstood the -test of time. For it, Kissinger deserved -though didnot receive a Nobel Peace Prize.
His dealings on Vietam-for which he-was awarded-the Nobel Prize-lie at-the other end-of the spectrum. They were a dismal-failure. Vietnam was, of course, the premier issue when he took office and-throughout nearly all-of his eight years with Nixon and President-Ford. Their-failure was painfulrfor the-United States Army, as for the United -States.
-From the start,-Kissinger viewed our-involvement-in Vietnam as a-test-of-our commitments everywhere. Thatrwas the lofty-explanation; Less-noble, though, was his notion -of creating a -"decent-interval"between the time-when -US ground forces (and -then all-US -forces)-withdrew and when South -Vietnam-either was overrun or collapsed. The-key decision Nixon and-Kissiinger made, -relatively -early on, was-toallowv North Vietnamese-troops-to-remain -in the South during a cessation-of hostilities. This was finally agreed to-by Hanoi in th,. summer of -1972, as the-North Vietnamese dropped-their demand-for an -immediate toppling-of the-Saigon-government. That-government, realizing the danger of North's regulars staying on-its territory,fiercely-resisted Kissinger' "peace is at hand" pre-1972 election statement. This led to the post-election "Christmas bombing," a phony -peace -accord (which -Hanoi failed to -impletnent, even -under its undemanding terms), andthe-loss of so-many more Vietnamese and-American lives. The poignancy of Vietnam lives-on,tmuchto-ourshame~andiorror.
As -for the -otlier-twomajor foreign policy preoccupations-relations with the -USSR and-China, forming the Kissingerian triangular diplotnacy-these are harder-to judge. Personally, 1-give-low marks on his-approach toward the Soviet Union -and-higher (though -not laudatory) grades-on-the China-opening. "Detente" with Moscow -initially seemed-great. -It produced a greater comfort. level regarding the threatened-nuclear holocaust, plus lots-of visuals-of champagne glasses clicking.But_ detente's-real -benefits-have-become harder and harder to see.-SALT land the ABM Treatywere both-glaringly deficient, the-latterbecoming positively harm ful to President Reagan's -push for a genuine SDI program-ofmissile defense. And despite -Kissinger's -longing for linkage, Moscow never helped where-we most needed-it, on extracting-us-fron -Vietnam.
More-fundamentally, Kissinger's-views toward-Soviet-leader-Leonid Brezh- i, 'T decency than that with which they treated their own people. Once the communist rule ended, fundamental changes in foreign-policy flowed forth-Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe, a halt to-support for communists from Cuba to Afghanistan to Africa, an -end to the Soviet military buildup, the demise of the Soviet Union itself, and the emergence of normal-democratically inclined states in place of the Evil Empire. We now know that detente postponed that blessed development,-however unexpected that surely was in the -1970s. To be-fair, Kissinger can-contend that detente helped get us through-a bad patch of history and opened -the way to this-marvelous ending. But that view will remain contentious. On China, nearly-everyone thought Nixon and-Kissinger's opening was a great historic event. I certainly did at the time. in 1972. Yet there now seems to have been-a certain inevitability about it,-and the-Chinese-government never-did do much for us in return. Sure, they -tied up 43 Soviet divisions on their border, but that happened before our normalization and continued-afterwards. On Vietnam, the Chinese-never cooperated; at least whatever efforts they-made (probably none) yielded no results in North Vietnam.
Regardless of how-history-finally judges Kissinger's four key foreign policy moves, each was planned-and executed with duplicity. This-was related toKissinger's and Nixon's personalities, and to their specific policies. "Diplomacy based-onthe moral-idealism of international law-is easy to wage openly," as Walter Isaacson rightly sums up, "but-a realistic approach involving ambiguous compromises and power ploys lends itself-to covert-acts and deception, since it-is-likely to arouse popular disapproval if -publicly articulated." The -best-judgment on Kissinger was -made -by -his family friend, Nahum-Goldmann: "If he-were-ten percent less-brilliant-and-ten percent-more honest, he would-be a great man." In-any case, this-is a great book.
-Understanding War: Essays-on-Clausewitz and the History of Military Power. -By -Peter -Paret. Princeton. N. J.: Princeton Univ. Press, 1992. 229 pages. $24-.95. Reviewed by-Professor-Edward-M. Coffman, author of-The Old Army: A Portrait of the American Army in Peacetime, 1784-1898.
-During-the-last three decades, military-history-has-expanded-and prospered much-more-than anyone-would have predicted-in the 1950s. A survey of-376 colleges in -1 958-indicated that only four percent offered -courses -in the subject. While-there was significant interest in the American-CivilWar and:WorldiWar lat-thatiime,-the historians-who worked in-those fields tended-to-be either non-academics or employed in official-history-programs. Within-the Army, there had-been-a-fal ling-back from-the pre-World War!Ii years when-mi litary-history-was-a )rominent offering at the senior service-schools. Today, the teaching-ofthis-subject is widespread throughout'academe, with excellent graduate'programs at several major universities, and there are substaniv,-offerings at-tic-serviceschook.
Peter -Pareu is a prominent figure in:the revival-of this field: hence, -the publication of'his-collected-essays -s amatter-of ihport-to those-who are interested-in--the-subject. Over the-last 30-years, he-has-taught-at the-University ofCalifornia-Davis, Stanford, and; most-recently, Princeton, where he is a-.member of the Institute -of 108 Parameters j 4-Advanced Study. A prolific author, the topics of his publications -span periods from the Napoleonic era to the post-World War II guerrilla wars. His most prominent work, however, focusses on Carl von Clausewitz. In 1976, ie published a masterly biography of this greatest of military thinkers (Clausewit-and the State). and lie and Sir Michael Howard brought out their edited translation of Clausewitz's great work On W7ar. In Understanding War, Paret has collected 16 previously published essays. For the reader's benefit, lie introduces each essay with a few comments on how it came about and how it fits into the context of his work. To use a metaphor from the art world in which lie grew up in Berlin. lie presents these essays in the form of a triptych-a three-panelled work of art. The central panel is of course concerned with Clausewitz while the side panels are-devoted to War and Its Institutions and to the History of Wa; To be sure, there is a numerical imbalance in that there are nine essays about-Clausewitz and six on -War and Its Institutions-but only one on the History of War, but then, of course, all are essentially on the History-of War. It should-be added that one of Paret's hallmarks is-his insistence that the history of war is an integral part of history.
The first group of essays ranges over such topics as military-power; nationalisn and the military-obligation of the-populace;how European military thinkers and people -used -or, -to be -more accurate, did not use-the experience of the American Revolutionary War; a comparison-of conscription in France and Prussia; how his enemies viewed-Napoleon: and a study of the battles of Jena and-Auerstidt. In academe, where -specialism reigns, it-is refreshing-to see such command-of a broad range of topics and-the skillful-use-of the comparative-method.
The nine essays-in the-group-about-Clausewitz would serve well as appendices-to-his -biography of-that great figure. They include, among the several topics covered, further explorations-into some political-aspects of Clausewitz's career and his-relationships or comparisons with such personages-as Alexis de Tocqueville and the writer Heinrich von Kleist. Then,-Paret analyzes a hitherto unknown letter'writtenjust-days before Clausewitz's death. Finally, in the sole essay in-the-last section. he combines-parts of essays-he (lid in 1971 and 1991 on the-New Military-History which ie characterizes as well as any -historian-"a -partial turning away from the great captains and-from weapons, tactics, and operations as the main concerns of the historical exploration of war. Instead, scholars-and-students are-asked to pay greater attention to-the interaction of war with society, economics, politics, and culture."
There is-much in this small-book for-the-soldier as well aszthe-historian. For the-latter, what-better advice-could he get-than-Paret's-warming about-the dangers of creating a "muddle" ifone attempts to-put-in too much.-hence the-necessity for careful delimiting-of both description and-interpretation.-Every commander would-profit friom reading-the-essay "Napoleon as -Enemy" in that it-explains how this great captain differed from his military-contemporaries. -Inliis-analysis-of Jena-and Auerstidt-the author returns to this point. After listing flaws in the:French conduct-of the-battles,-he poiits out:"But-such -flaws were made-good-by -a pervasive-energy, -by-the intuitive understanding of thousands of -veteran soldiers led -by a man who recognized the essentials-ofthe-problehefao allow no sidieibsue to distract either himself or his subordiiates from its-solution."
-Finally, the value of-this book -is-enhancedby an-elegant style-that often delights the-reader withssuch-thoughtful -turns-of phrase as-theautior uses-in-describing  But it is also a very difficult book to review. The author-provides such a flood of extraordinary detail that-the reader-and occasionally even the athor-loses sight of thle big picture. Newinan gives metictilous attention, for example. to proposals for US intervention with combat troops in thle very early days of the Kennedy Administration. None of these ever got to first-base. andgiving themn such p~rominencc obscures some of the more central issues. Another factor complicating review-of-the book.is that Newman-'s judgments onl thiepaIyer-s-pricipitly-Kenncidy himnself~-are extremely complicated; Newmairleaves no0 doubt that-Keninedy -was absolutelyderermnined not to send American combat forces-to Vietnam. But hie argues that Kennedy did give in to p~ressutre to-mnake a commitment shot of using American troops-in-the hopes that "American technology and know-how would work a miracle." This made Itis dVeiitiial-decision to disengage more difficult. "Although-he [Kennedy)l-would notaccept the reconmendationsof his advisors for combat troops-.an-act of-great moral-courage-neither would hie accept defeat." I! is not that Newman's judgments are unsound, only-that they are sometimes-hardt, follow.
While one can make no major criticisins of Newminan's accounrt-of-even ts,-ai few quibbles are-probably ini-order. Newman's account of Vice President Johnson's trip to Asia and the-disagreemnnts about that trip between the -President and-the-Vice President leaves thle reader with thle impression that Johnson did not want tosgo onl the trip-and Kennedy ordered-hint to-go; Ini-fact, thle trip was Johnso'i's-idea. -What-made him angry was that -newvs of it leaked before Johnson himself could make thle announcemnent, so-he toyed with thle idea-of canceling thie trip entirely. ]In later years, Johnson-actually reversed some of his-decisions about.-high-level appointments solely because the news leaked before he-could make the.-announcemnent himself.
Newman corr-ectly~describes~thec v.-rious-JCS--proposals for Americanl-intervention in Vietnam in thle early days of--the Kennedy Administration. No-quibble here. But what-does not comec through is tlie-Chiiefs'-dlete-rifiniaiion not to let-theinselves-be snookeredito figlig_-a-war-in-Asia "withtrone-hand. tied -behind-their back" as-had happened-iwi-Koreia-deteiminiiationiha,)tPresident Johnson eventually. fotmnd-a--way to get arounid. It was because of this determinaition that thle JCS came to be called-the "Never Again Ciub"-neveragaini-L-hiinitedliand war-in -Asia;
The controversy about-thie -so-called -24-Ati(,ust:-1961-cab~c-crjjiceriitg-ihic Vietnamciise-genicrals':plan f-or-a-coup:agaiinst Ngo:Dinli:Diemi: was~i-atlier-thoroughily discussed: in-the A uulun-1_9 of Parameters. The quibble to be made of Newman's account is that he does not make it-entirely clear that the 24 August plot was aborted and that the successful coup of I November included a number of different players.
One fitial quibble relates to-the subtitle of Newman's book and the fact that Newman sees many of the events in precisely these terms-deception, intrigue, and the struggle for power. Certainly the struggle-over policy was often concerned with a struggle for power. Certainly, too, most players held their-cards as close to their chests as they could and did not tip their hands until they had-to. -But it would be a mistake to think that deception and intrigue were central.
The tragedy of Vietnam was not-that the American military in Vietnam lied to Washington about how the war was going or tried-to keep-vital-information from reaching Kennedy, or that-people in the State Department skewed the facts or schemed against the other players to bring about Diem's downfall. The real tragedy was different. Part of the.tragedy was that the different participants in the policy debate were lookingat:comnpletely-different aspects of the-probleln. The point is illustrated by the story that Newman tells of the trip-to Vietnam justafter the Buddhist crisis by General Victor Krulak, representing the JCS, and -Joseph Mendenhall, representiig the State Department. Krulak visited the-military commands ii the field and:reported to Kennedy that things-were going-exceedingly -well. Mendenhall visited the civilian leaders in the cities and'reporied that things-were going from very bad to very much worse. After bearing them out Kenniedy-had only one-question: "-You two'did visitthe same country. didn't you?"
Another part-of the tragedy was that all participants in the policy debates wanted so badly-to-win the battle against the cofumunists that they came to believe what they desperately wanted to-believe-on one side, thatby going ahead full-steam militarily, or-on the other side, by changing theprime minister andhis inner circlethen all the messy and intractable problems would:be solved.
Given the difficulty of the problems, it-was inevitable and even desirible that the participants in the policy battles disagreed in their judgments. Given the importance of the-stakes involved, it was entirely appropriate-that they fought hard and passionately-indeed, it-would be-cause for distiay-if it-hadlbeen-otherwise. But anyone who has been involved in-such-battles-knows that these matters are never black and Whlite. that -there are persuasive arguments 6n-both sides, andthat the final judgments are always close. So the motives of both-hawks and doves on Vietnam policy cannot really be questioned. In the case-of Vietnam; as in most others, the people oit both -sides of the arguments were honest, intelligent, reasonable, and patriotic men and women. sti uggling as best' they could-with tnean and-intricate problems of the-highest-importance. There may-have been-no heroes in-the policy battles-over Vietnam. but there-weren't any villains, either. who did it right and-who did not, peppering us with asides and exclatmationi points. Indeed, hie knows so much about the Atlanta campaign that sometimes he grows impatient with its part ici pantts. General So-and-So "should have done this . . ..

Sherman's advance fromiChiattanooga toward Atlanta starting in May 1864 was the western half of Grant's grand (anl I grandly direct) strategy for ending the wvar. "ie was to-go for Lee and I was-to go--for Joe -Johnston," Sherman explained. "That was his lan. No routes prescribed. . . ." Castel Carefully exp~lains thle shifts in this strategy as they-applied to-Shiermian. First-it was-his task to so pressu re-the Confede rate Army of Teninessee-under Johnston_(aftcrward-under John -Bel IHood) that it-could-not reinforce Lee-in-Virginia. AfterGrant's bloody offensive bogged-down in theitrenchies of Petersburg-Ji-becamec essential for-Shermian-to winl a. major victory in-Georgia so as to secure Lincoln's reelection-in the fall. Finally, -to gain -that-victory Sherman detertmined to make Atlania-itself the objective rather thtan-the Army of Tennessee.
Sherman's-reputation as-a-battliefieldl-commiianider derives from--this Atlanta campaign. Before Atlanta hie served under Grant and~did nothing outstanding; afterward, tmarching throutgh Georgia and the Carolinas, hie faced no credible opposition. Castel thinks Sherman's reputation to be overblown, especially by-tile eulogistic Brit ishi .military-theorctician Basil Liddell Hlart, and-lhe-quotes with obvious relish -a Unioil-general's observation that-Sherman was "a splendid piece ofniaclinrery with all of the screws a little loose." Castel argucs-thfat "Shermian.'s preference for. raidingover fighting" gave him Atlanta well enough Itbiti-not, the-enetmy's army. In-the final operations against Atlanta lie-listssixoccasions-when Sherman "did not close his-fist" onl H-ood. Indeed. Castel insists that had Sherman's chief lietenant, George H-. Thomas,-been-incomniand of-the-campaign, lie would-have-promptly accomplished---".the elimination of the Army of Tennesseefrornvthe-war."
Sherman's-opponents do not-conie off very -well,-either.

For-those of-us whom Colonel Art: Lykke (USA -Ret.) cipscribes as " Clatusewi tz Ntmts," Coloinel(USA--Rct-.)-Irr-Summeilrs' On Stralegy -In an arguable passage on the same page, Summers gives great credit for the success of the campaign to the effects of the Goldwater-Nichols Reorganization Act. There is considerable merit to this position, but -it should never be advanced without two accompanying caveats: first, there was-only one war and, therefore, only one "supported-CINC," a situationin which Goldwater-Nichols is somewhat irrelevant. It did-serve to-insure that-all:knew who was in charge, but that may well have been a more direct function of personalities than the legislation.
The second caveat is that the chemistry of the-personalities at the-top is best described as a unique gift from God: In an interview at the Army War College, General Donn A. Starry (USA Ret.)-said, "Thank-heaven-for.George-Herberv Walker Bushll"He then went on to draw comparisons-betwden the-keyfigures of-the-Busl-Administration and several combinations of those who-had gone before. His -onclusion was that Goldwater-Nichols aside,-the-United States was absolutely~blessed by the persoialities at the top for this operation. Readers niay find some difficulty in dealing with Summers' constant Vietnam reprise. Subiiners:was the firstprofessioncal;officerto:truly come:to grips in print witfthe trauma of that war. It is understandable that much of-wha:he writes in On-Strategy 11 would-reflect-his deeply held feelingitha.ttlie:United States must never commit the errors of Vietnam again.-Summners has beenadamant that if the American people do-not support the cause, American soldiers-shoul&not be sent to-fight. It should be recalled-that lie made his case-directly on-Larty*KingLive 13 August-1990,-declaiig that-until the 48th Georgia Nationil GuardBrigade-was-cailed upi the United-States-was "just kidding." Consequently, the thrust:of-much:of-the:book is really "how we-licked the Vietnam syndr6ne." After all, President Bush hinself declared-on I March that "we've-licked-the Vietna_ m syndiome-once and for all."Various readers will disagree with some of Summers' formulations, but professional soldiers will-be comfortable-with the -language, format, and general line of reasoning. This is an easy read, an:important book, and certainly worth -the paperback-price.
One-can criticize John K. Cooley's-book Payback: America's Long War in the Middle-East for someof its factual errors and its not-too-well-handled combat portions, but this too is ani important -book-. What Cooley -has done, and in artful fashion, is recount the-history-of US-:inv6lvenfient in the Mid dle East over the-last decade. Payback is c6mpelling reading-arid ]naccurcies aside, should be read-by every professional soldier arid ibost-Americans.

Cooley pursues two principal theses. One is that the old law of "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" dominates relations at all levels in the Middle East. The revenge motif, of course, provides the book title, but it-does-not reveal the theme beneath the theme-iran's attempt to extirpate all vestiges of Western thinking and influence from the Middle East. This serves to explain many of the attacks upon the American University in Beirut. The second thesis is that during the period of the late 1970s and into the 1980s, the United States had chosen-to play a game in a distant arena without knowing the rules, without a game plan, and without the required talent or tools. While the principal antagonists in the book are the United States and Iran, the book concludes with the US-Iraqi antagonisms.
It must-be said that Cooley is-at his worst dealing with combat-operations, mistaking, for example, the 3d Cavalry D~ivision for the 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment. In contrast, he is impressive at piecing together events on the diplomatic stage, and is equally impressive in detailing the contributions, positive and negative, of the intelligence community. Cooley conducted; and duly recounts, the details of numerous personal interviews with-.prominent-Middle East players. These interviews -provide significant insights.
One conclusion drawable from this book is that-the United.States ought to get-back-into the Hurnan Intelligence (HUMINT) business in the Middle-East. There is-considerable risk inattempting that, but-Cooley-makes it clear that we have been blind and have been led astray, on occasions, by our willingness to let the Israelis do our dirty work for us and by assuming they know a good deal more-than they do.
In deiling with Operation-DesertStorm, Cooley is relatively conventional; repeating some simplistic-conventional wisdom in-the recounting orthat-campaign. His description of the diplomatic-events leading up to the-campaign, however, are more plausibie than those -described -in Triumph Without Victory: The Unreported 1-fistor-y of the Persian Gulf lVar.a_Pyback is well worth a two-day read.
Ifthe U.S. News-and World.R-eport book Triumph-Without Victory were-to be the basis for subscribing-to the magazine, Lwould say, "Save your money." The book is useful in that it is relatively comprehensive, but it is uneven and is badly flawed in several areas. Beginning with what has come to be the expected journalist's whine about lack of access to information and sources, there follows a list of personalities interviewed that would seem utterly to belie the opening whine. The next unfortunate portionois in the "Prologue." where one finds-alist of things-previously "unreported" and-now "revealed;" Yet almost nothing listed had gone unreported; inshort, this is not the "Unreported History"-by a long shot. Interestingly, this book-and several-others, as well-as several-news articles, would have been set on the correct footing had the authors deigned to read the various service-journals. There is a plethora offirst-person, professionally useful:and thought-provoking articles in these jou-rn~als, evidently terra incognita to mainline-publications.
One-of-the-more distressii g-aspects of-Triumph-Withomt-Victori-where knowledgeable sources were -interviewed-by interviewers ignorant of-the material. The writers.the-n produce a summary ofathe inteiview--that makes-no sense. There is little evidence of cross-checking-6f matenial; withthme-consequence-that really_ silly comments pop-up-from time to:tiie ,giving the-reader:cause to wonder-aboutother material; As an-example. -there is an-absurd-pasage where the-Marines' C-60A3 is Spring-J993 described as a "lightweight and small-gunned" lank. In the passage where this occurs, the writer is in the process of commenting upon the fact that the Marines are essentially a light force. The appropriate reference -would have been. to the Light Armored Vehicles (LAV) which the Marine-Corps has in considerable numbers. Any tank, and especially a T-72, will eat a LAV for lunch. But as those same Marines demonstrated on the second and third days of the war, the M-60 tank was perfectly capable of bashing the T-55s and T-62s against which it was designed to fight, and it can deal with T-72s under the right circumstances.
Another example is the authors' failure-to read the map. They make reference to the two "tiny" islands of Warbah and Bubiyan. Warbah is a large island which is, in reality, nothing but a mudflat-a large mudflat about ten kilometers in length. Bubiyan is a huge island, roughly 20 by 40 kilometers in size, partially developed and occupied; Warbah could be dredged out of existence over a period-of several years if the capable Iraqi engineers were directed-lto do that. Even atomic demolitions could do littler-o budge Bubiyan.-however, and-acursory glance at almost any maj would reveal that fact. It is such sloppiness that-seriously degrades this book's usefulness.
The redeeming part-of Triumph W;thou Victory is its first-person accounts of combat. For those who continue to believe that the Iraqi -army simply-rolled over and quit en masse, here is a sharp corrective. Between the stories recounted here and in the Army Times' 14 "Desert Stortn After-Action Review" articles (10 June 1991 through 2 March 1992), there should be no doubt that-this was-war for the soldiers involved.
The most problematic part of Triumph Without Victory is the title -itself. Much of the book is devoted to-the military campaign-and there can be no-doubt whatsoever that the coalition -accomplished its military objectives and -in-doing soaccomplished-the UN-approved-political objectives. -It is bad scholarship but-probably good press technique to-stir up a-tempest-by raising tei cry "but not-enough!"-which is heard all too often in the land. Operation Desert Storm was a resounding military victory, as the accounts reported'in this-very book attest. At the beginning of The Sword and the Cross, James H' Toner notes that "like Sisyphus, we must spend our live inakingbd'eision:-the full consequences of which are hidden-fron:our eyes; but we:must move a hea d. We-mi ust-do:lhe very best we-can." Inthese -two-books, Toner makes clear what:he believes-slhould.guide inet and-womeniri uniform.as:they try to dotleir=best.
Toner's books provide particularly interesting commentary in.comparisolh with two other-new-bodks,-Generall-. Norman Schwarzkopf's The Autobiography: It-
Prmtr  In the:firstdialf of The American Military-Ethic, we-find the story of Toner's military life,-from basic training. which-staried about three -years after thela-Drang battle, through-OCS and his years-in Europe. Toner shows us, through his-personal experiences-as a junior infantry officer, what led to-his-beliefs about the nature of military service, much as-General Schwarzkopf-does. What follows in Toner's:book, however, -is asearching-examination of the principles that guide the conductof military leaders.
A:sizable portion of The American Military.Ehic-describes through narrative the-process by which basic training andOCS provided-us with young soldiers during the Vietnam War era. -Because Toner relates his experiences with a keen eye for humor and-tells us a.story, the first half-of the book moves-quickly. Without doubt, anyone iiterested in that pefiod of-our-military history-or concerned -with the means of developing combat-ready troops will find tlie reading informaiive. Besides advocating-tough training, Toner-maintainsihat the "officers of the-future cannotknow what-to do unless they first-know what to be."
That presentation-provides his point:for departure in-the second half of-tle book, which analyzes the-foundations for the rfiilitary ethic and explains how the ethic should -be developed -and applied. -He focuses in particular on the importance of character and the-role of liberal education in developing persons of.-bothvcompetence and conscience. -In -the author's view, military leaders should have a broad-based liberal-education-with an-emphasis on history, which lie argues--iust-be continued through the existing military education system. :He describes -that system, largely approvingly,-in-considerable-detail.
Professor Toner devotes only one chapter specifically to tie Aijierican militar-yethic. While rea(lers-faniliar--with-the-subject -will:find:little new-insight here, the aulhorldoes-have t:talent-forarticulating'beclrock idd as.-le explains that-ihe-ethic incorporates a moral-conim.itnent: to-valucsthat-trnscead~botlparticuIlar-orgafiizalions-and particularsocieties. The-transcendent values-provide-iliefotndations-for and shalpe the-ifnstitutioils-of_,our-nntion,-to.include:the-iilitay-services.
In -The Swor(I-ad'the.ross, Toner.exploreson-wamore elevated plane. While we call-relate-the subject-matter:of The Awnerican-Military:Ethic to Moore's book (basic soldiering) and to Schwarzkopf's book (autobiography and subsequcnt reflection), The Sn'ord and the Cross moves into a-different realm. Here Tonler examines the confrontation that so often occurs-between the demands of individual conscience and the demands of role responsibil ities, most particularlythlose-weiginig onl military and political leaders. He indicates his primiary-concern in-this book in-the following passage: "To maintain and, where possible, to enlarge thle initersect ioni-between thle ethics of the cross and the politics of thle swordl is-our burden and our glory and is the true test of the civic virtuie to which we are callcd as Christians and as citizens."
This book is -difficult to classify. -It is not history, despite historical examples, and it is not au tob iographty, despite-thie presence of-personal experiences. At the same time, it does not qualify as a work-of philosophy in terms of intellectual rigor. Tonler states that th~e book-is simply the reflection of a quarter century of thought on the subject of command and conscience.
The reflections provide an ed ucated-conservat ive -view of the causes, initiation,-and con 'duct of war, cinpliasizing:that "survival of thie-nation alone makes-no sense-unless -it is in service offundamental va [ues -thatimbue the nation's existence I with-meaining--and--purpose."-But-the-book-gocs considerably further-in anial yzing thle role ofireligion-in-the process of commai,-nd-decisioinaking;. Though he-tells us that while the sword serves ain indispensable function; thle cross is paramount, Toner no netheless -conclIudes: "~Religion-, then~, does-not solve thc-ancient problem ofcommand:,tnd conscience, of sword--and cross." lf~the-two claims-seem-to conflict, the resolution for Toner appears to lie-in a comniitment--to-religious belief;, Still, he-holds that"our [win duties, sacred and-secular,inust-be merged into a-civic virttue, enabling us-to-know hlow we should act-for the coninionlinterest-as'-well as for our own.

As Bard O'Neill notes in his preface, "The study of insurgency is fraught with perils, because of-the zealotry and partisanship that surrounds the subject." As a way of overcoming the all-too-prevalent biases, O'Neill provides-"a systematic, st rai ghitforward format for comprehensively analyzing or compiring-insurgencies" for the use of "participants, journalists, students, government analysts, and scholars." The goal is laudable, and thd approach described in the book is-clearly a-useful one.
O'Neill urges his readers to base their-study on aset-of questions designed to focus attenition-onmimiportant--aspects-of-iiisurgency. What are:tlie.instirgents' goals and what-iiieans-are they using. to-accomplish them? Whavis-the-i nsuyrgent -strategy? What is-the physical and-liuman enrvironment, and:how can-it-be expected-to influence the insurgency? What kind of -popular suipport -do the insurgents have, and what -techniqtues are they using-to develop it? What form of-organization does the insurgency have, and how great-is-its-uni ity or cohesion? I-lowv extensive is external-support, and what kind of suppor-isbeing received? Other, -more specific questions -exist within-each category,-and-O'Neillencourages readers to add:questions of their-own to make his analytical-frameworkeven more useful.
When enipldyed-by thoughtful individuals interested in miinimizing-their biases, O'Neill's framecwork will-provide valuible insights. It-is -neither rigid-nor dogmatic, andithe-systematic approach to-amnalysis that-iiprovides-can help analysts identify what they do and'donot-know about-an insurgency.
In presenting his framework O'Neill makes nulnerous~generalizations about insurgency, citing a wide variety -of cases to-support -them, and a number of his observations are quiteastute.ile notes, for example, the fallacy ofattempting to lump together many dissimila-r-types of-conflict under the low~initensity-coniftictrubric, and more-than once he~draws-attent ioiitostlie-tendency of-govdirnments to-misunderstand or falsely portray insurgencies -and the-negative -conscquenccs that :result. O.!Neill notes-also-that alth ough external support-is often important~i-t-is much more precarious than commionly-assumned.

forms of terror were very effective in destroying leftist insurgencies while protecting thle interests of local clites. Although O'Neill rightly emphasizes tile importance of good police work. intelligence-gathering, andju dicial-sanctions-in counterinsurgency Operations, his claim that "civilian governments stand a better chance of success than military governments" is not sustained by thle ewidence.
Fortunately O'Neill rccognizes thle difficulty inherent-in any attemipt to genceralize-ahlout-inisurency. and hie often identifies exceptions-to his own generalizations. In many places wvhere he-fails to-note exceptions, readers famnilijar with thle topic wilt no-doubt supply their own, seeing. for example, the way-in which generalizations supported -by references .to -Rhodesia/Zimibabwe arc u ndermiined by thie example of £ South Africa.

III-MAF didn't give Khe Sanh-the command-attention that the dangerous situation deserved; they-reinforced that-garrison only reluctantly. -The Marines suspected that General-Westmoreland-wanted-to establish-a base at-Khe Sanh for an offensive into Laos, anotherplan for-which-they had-ittle-enthusiasn. Westmoreland-later-stated that that-was exactly what hiehad wanted-to do. Such an offensive would-have been-a good strategic thrust, but-it would-have been politically unacceptable-at-that time.-Lack of IllI MAP commitment caused Westmoreland to send his Deputy, General Creighton Abrams. to-take -command -of all US forces in-the -region, -though -in this book -the -command -relationship-between Abrams and lIMAF is-described as "coordinate." Westmoreland was concerned,-rightly so in my opinion,-aboutless-than-aggressive senior leadership then-in II1-MAF;-he wanted-to insure thatthe-Marines at-Khe Sanih were fully supported and properly employed. The MACV historian, -Colonel "Hap" Argo, -had-heightened Westmoielancl's concern by reporting history's verdict: the defeat of most besieged -forces that-surrender the-initiative-to the-besiegers.
As the US firestorm around--Khe Sanldecimated-the besieging North Vietnamese army,-enemy pressure gradually subsided. One can sympathize-with the -Marines at-that point, -resenting "rescue" by-the Army's 1st Air-Cavalry Division (which-had -been-directed -to-open a -corridor -into-Khe Sanh) in-Operation -Pegasus. Whether-the Marines could-have-reestablished and-maintained -ground access to Khe Sanh without-Pegasus is less clear, but -it is true that major-North Vietnamese army , forces -had-withdrawn-by -the -time the -1st Air Ca -launched its operation. To this division-nmust go credit-for employing-a-uniquely effective combination-of airpower and-helilift-in-relieving Khe Sanh. The-ultimate=withdrawal of the Marines -from-Khe Sanh'throws-into question the reason forestablishing the-basein the-first-place, despite -claims=by MACV that-an important-task had-been accomiplished.
Although-the-preface claims -that-the-book benefits from the-discovery of hidden records, -there-is-little -new in this-refndition of-the siege of Khe-Sanh. Some historians argue-that the siege was not decisive (contrary to the title of this book). But -[agree with the authors that-Khe Sanh was ainutually accepted test of the-powerand--the will-of North Vietnam and the United States-and its indecisive results added -to tilepressures-on our-governmentio e ithdi'mw-fom VietniL.

The-Marines inirVietnam -were just-too far inland-for too-long. And-at-Khe Sanh they were committed to-a ground-holding operation which was outside their arena of professional expertise, which was seaborne assault and -ampliibious-operations. Bookshelves of libraries are becoming increasingly-burdened by books onl the Second World War. Due to-both the scholarly and-popular interest in-this-subject, the number of volumes canl only continue-to increase. Yet despite the number-of books produced onl thle subject, the-number of professionally written-works on-the National Guard and--its -role in thie-coniflict-remiainis-smiall. Robert Sligh's short but-schiolarly book offers-to fill part-of this void-by present ing-a-study of thle mobilization-of-the Guard in 1940 and its role -in-the-defcnse-of the nation.
As-Sligh-correctly notes, mobilizingdthe-Guardsin 194Ozwas-no -small -task, consder ng-tht -hena ion-wa -nt-t-ar ad-as-uncn vi ned-lia~patic pa io in a European-warzwas-i i its-best-interests. Thius,it-is-the pol itical -processfor nmobil ization tha-,t-conicernis-the-authior. The book focuses-on thepolitics necessary to-mobilize -the -Guard and-the-i iportance of the political-situation-between -these-two-defen~se establishments" (the -Guard and the Active Army), to include -the impact -of -the dynamnics-betweeh -these-two-grouips-onzlater-defenisc policy~aiid -legislation.
To fulfill-this stated -purpose, -the-writer-beginus by giving a brief-synopsis of thezdegenerating -world-situat ion-in 1939-40-andA Ihen-launches-into a history-of the comnplicaited-politicaiiimanetiverinig necessary-to bring the -Nat iona[-Guard, a -force-of 18 divisions, into federal service. That-t his-acti onl-was -necessary -now seems obvious since the Active Army had a-combat strength-of only 187,893 officers and men inmid-l939-and-wa,,s-facing-zani-incrcasinigly-lhostile-world. Suill-l-in-1939-and-early-1940, neither the American -people nor Congress-were convinced that--the -nation-should mobilize its reserve forces for possible -commitment -overseas. -It is agai nst--this backdrop that Sligh-describes-the halting -efforts -tomobil ize the Guard and-expandthe ~nation's defense capabilities.
Perhaps the key value of this work lies in its detailing-of -the interplay between -Genera IGeorge C. Marshall,-Chief of-Staff of-thle Army,-ahd Major-General-Milton A. Reckord. Adjutant General of Maryland-ancl-chie' -lobbyist of the-National Gtuard Association. Using -tile Marshall -papers, -thle-records of -the National-Guard-Association, and the National Archives, Sligh-traces the difficult problem-that -Reckord faced, that is,-u lfiIIi ng-the-G uardcl -des ire-to-have-an-effective rol e-in-the-defense of the nation but at-the same -time avoid-erosion -of state -controls -by -the federal government. In addition, while hie -portrays -Reckord-asan-astute lobbyist,-for th e-National_-Guard, Sligh-fincis-him-to-be a -realistwho -knew the-Guard -needed -more equipilenz and-training -before it went-to-=war. -Thus, -Reckordfought perceived attempts to ignore -the-Guard's combat--role; -he also workcd -to -preserve -ftle state character of the Guard-and, at-thie sarnezmlncn,-to-inainitain -support of the-Associati on's -pro ram b-tile Adljutanits Genieral-from -the-48-states.
Slighi's-,portrayal of Marshall-as a -manl who -understood -both-the politicalprocess-and-the-Guard-sign ifi can tas-wel1. Du-bolth-is-wisdom -and-to-the-three years-lie -had -spent [as a-Guard -advisor, Marshall-uhderstood-the Guard-far-betterthan-
Parameters-most active-duty officers of his rank. With a knowledge of the Army, the Guard, and the American political-process, Marshall was able-to work successfully-with both the legislative and-executive branches in achieving the National Guard's-mobilization for one year's training and then extending that period-until the United -States entered World War II.
Still, this book has some noticeable-faults as it attempts to assess the impact of the mobilization-on the Guard's larger-role. According to the author, the Guard's desire to play a prominent part in national -defense and -receive federal fnding undercutzan additional-prime goal, that of avoiding additional-federal-controls. Sligh asserts that-the mobilization of-the Guard-in 1940 spurred-increased control over the Guard, and that this battle-for control culninated in 1990 when,-through two separate court-cases relating to overseas training, a "last battle for-control" was waged-and lost by the Guard.
-In-reality the battles--over state-vs. federal control continue even today, -involving such issues as-force-structure-and-numbers,-and-they will-ikely continue as long-as-there-are-constitutional-prov isions fora -distinctly separate militia/guard and an Active Army. And While -the 1940 mobilization certainly affected-the Guard's -future, the National Defense Act-of-1933 was actually responsible-forestablishingthe Guard's -legalstructure as it exists-today and-by far-overshadows the-effects of the 1940 mobilization.
In short, the-body of -the book centering-on-the-politics of mobilization is well done and worth -reading-for the information-on -that -overlooked -period-The introduction and conclusions, -however, which-attempt-to convince-the reader that-the mobilization of 1940-hastened-the Guard to a final -and last-battle-between-stateand federal control, are at best dubious and-should be read-with considerable caution.
Civil WarCoImmandrand Strategy: The-Process of Victory and -Defeat. By Archer Jones. New York: The Free -Press, -1992. 338 pages. $24.95. -Reviewed by -Professor -James-Kirby Martin, cur--rently engaged in a comparative study of -the generalship of Robert E. Lee and Benedict -Arnold.
Civil War buffs and-students of military strategy will relish the consumption of this delectable new study by respected historian-Archer Jones. The author begins-with certain-assumptions, the central concept being -thatneither the Union nor the Confederacy-had-major advantages at the war's outset. -Withthe-playing-field-thus-rendered so-level, "much-would depend on-the quality of each's command and strategy," declares Jones. Both-the North -and-the South -demonstrated considerable -sophistication in -the organization of their command structures and the execution of their strategies, the investigation of which represents the principal task ofthis -book.
The combatants,-according to Jones, cach constructcd a command structurc that-effectively integrated military and -political-decisionmaking, and -eacluhad solid wartime -presidents. -Stated-differently, Jones does not -rate Abraham Lincoln as superior to Jefferson Davis, whose "mastery-of strategy and-. . .-management of it [are] deserving -of high praise." Davis comprehended the-advantages of the strategic defensive in utilizing theimmense-reach of Southern-space-to-neuttralize the superior Spring 1993 123 numbers of Union armies. Northern armies would-have to reckon with maintaining their ever-len gthlening stupply lines, which would-reduce their manpower advantage as well as constrict their ability-to maneuver in timely fashion.

Northcrn planners, by comparison, knew they-would have-to take the wvar to the enemy, but they realized-the futility of a combat strategy designed to-rcconquer the vast-Sotithern territory. Inistead they chose-a p~ersisti ng logistic strategy that-emphiasized the depletion of Conifedera-te -resouirces.-Elemienits included the Union naval blockade, which Jones arpzues was porous-at -best, ancl=simultaneously advancing armies, whose combined goal was-to reduce the Confederate base support-area of-food-suppl ies and war materiel.

The authors identified the reason for the Army Guard's success in Desert Shield and Storm as "collective or unit mission training." Peacetime collective training provided the Army with mission-capable Guard-units at the time of mobilization; that's unprecedented-for reserve-force mobilizations. Yes, leaving retraining of individual skills for post-mobilization was the intent; those skills are quick, easy to teach, and-not equipment-intensive, which permits-major items to be deployed early, before actual troop deployment. As a mater of fact, many if not most-Guard units could-have been deployed directly from-home station with no loss of unit efficiency.
Richardson and Brayton mentioned certain individual survival-training that needed to be conducted at the mobilization stations. These training shortfalls were not "war stoppers" and could have been achieved incident to deployment either in or out of the United States. As the article states, using the short period between mobilization and deployment for improving individual-soldier skills "was-probably the correct approach." It was indeed the correct-approach and could and should have been applied-to both combat and support units. The only variance I-might have with the authors' views is that they appear to believe-there is-a current desire for the-Army to have-ready Guard-units. It appears to me the intent is, with the exception of some-support-units, to-focus-the Guard on long-periods of post-mobilization training. Given the-nature of-the threat, this may-be desirable.

The Authors Reply:
We are pleased that Lieutenant General Temple, former Chief of the National Guard Bureau, is in general agreement with us. While we feel the reserve components have come a long way since the early 1970s, all is not perfect. Those important individual skills which were fotmd wanting during the Desert Shield mobilization can be improved within present resources through better and more intensive use of the limited training time available. Initiatives recently fielded under the Bold Shift program, such as live-fire lane training for platoon-size units, operational readiness exercises, and revitalized Directed Training Associations, may help improve soldier survival skills and squad/platoon operations. We believe that it is unrealistic to expect each unit to train itself; external training resources must be used more extensively to attain higher levels of proficiency.
Unfortunately, the emphasis on individual training and small-unit tactics will most probably result in a degradation of the unit mission competencies gained over the past 20 years. We continue-to believe the real solution-lies with improving the quality and intensity of each and every one of those 39 available training days. The NCO does not have to be prioritized out of business, and collective training does not-have to stop. We must, however, do a better job of managing training time. This would-sharply improve individual training and would also permit substantial collective training as well.
That a-lower standard of readiness is acceptable for National Guard combat units may be a reality, but we should strive to have all our reserve force units as ready as they can possibly be all of the time. Our proposals are offered to help improve current combat capability by achieving the maximum possible readiness within the allotted resources.
To the Editor: I enjoyed Charles R. Shrader's article, "Friendly Fire: The Inevitable Price," in the Autumn 1992-issue of Paraneters. His allusion to the friendly-fire incidents at Pearl Harbor on 7-December 194-1 (page 36) deserves elaboration.
On the night of 7 Dccember 1941, six Grumman-F4F-3 Wildcats from-Fighting Squadron Six-which L., been launched into the gathering-darkness-that day as the escoit for a strike launched at Japanese ships -purportedly lurking off Oahu-were instructed to land on Ford-Island, the fleet air base located in the center of Pearl Harbor. Apparently, a warning that incoming-planes were friendly failed to-reach all hands, and antiaircraft fire-principally-automatic weapons and-rifles-eruptedfronall over'the harbor-area.-Of the six-planes, four-were shot down.
A full accounting of friendy-fire shoot-downs -would-not-be complete without mention of a-Douglas SBD-3-Dauntless of Scouting Squadron-Sixthat had been-one of 18 launched on the morning of 7December in advance of aircraft carrier Enterprise's projected return -to Pearl Harbor that-afternoon. The -Dauntless-was-shot
down by antiaircraft fire from Fort Weaver and ditched in the shallows off Hickam Field. An Army crash boat, sent out from Hickam, soon rescued the two crewmen and headed ashore for treatment, with boat crew and rescued aviators alike enduring a brief flurry of more friendly rifle fire (from edgy soldiers ashore) el route to the dock! Several other Dauntless's from the morning flight experienced friendly fire as they attempted to land at Ford Island as the Japanese attack unfolded.

To the Editor:
I read with great interest Charles R. Shrader's article "Friendly Fire: The Inevitable Price." I thought he provided excellent groundwork establishing among other things that friendly fire is not a new war phenomenon.
Concerning-the incidents on 7 December 1941, the only people not-shocked apparently were-the Japanese.-For thenext 24 to 72lhours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. there was-mass confusion and little or no coordinated American communication throughout the entire Pacific Region. This resulted in countless unconfirmed Japanese "invasions" from Singapore to San Francisco. American and Allied forces took up what defensive positions -they could and adopted the motto "IfIt-Flies, It Dies!" Time after time Americans and Allies shot up-(and down) their own aircraft. They were convinced the Japanese were just-over the-horizon and coming back again.
Although the losses from Pearl Harbor-and the Pacific were not as-horrific as some of those Dr. Shrader discusses, they confirm that (1)-friendly fire is not-new, and (2)-lack of proper coordination and communication will do you in every time.
The Author Replies: I am most grateful to Dr. Cressman for filling in the very interesting details regarding the various occurrences of friendly fire at Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. Major Holland also provides an iinportant-reminder-regarding the role of poor fire discipline as well as inadequate coordination and communication in bringing about friendly fire incidents of the very types encountered at Pearl Harbor.

MacArthur and the Politics of Promotion For those in today's At my. where politicking for promotion assumes subtler forms than in day., past. it is sometimes instructive to revisit historical instances of particularly crass efforts to prejudice the legitimate opeiation of tile promotion system. Take tile letters-of Mrs. Arthur MacArthur. mother of Douglas MacAt thur. to Secretary of War Newton D. Baker and AEF commander General John J. Pershing. On 12 June 1918. for example. Mrs. MacArthur sent tile following letter to Pershing regarding the promotion of her son, who as a colonel was chief of staff of tie 421 "Rainbow" Division in France:' My dear General Pershing: I am taking the liberty of writing you a little heart-to-heart letter emboldened by the thought of old friendship for you and yours. and the knowledge of my late husband's great admiration for you. First allow me to assure you that my son. Colonel Douglas MacArthur, knows absolutely nothing whatsoever of this letter and its purport to you. I undeistand there will be made, in the near future, approximately 100 new appointments to General Officers and that all appointments for the Expeditionary Forces in France will of course be made upon your recommendations. I am most anxious that my sonshould be fortunateenough to receive one of these appointments, as he is a most capable officer and a hard working man.... I know the Secretary of War and his family quite intimately, and-the Secretary is very deeply attached to Colonel MacArthur and knows him well, as he served for two years as his Military Secretary at the same time that he was the War department's Censor. both positions which he asked to be relieved in order to go to France .... As much as my heart and ambition is involved in this advancement, neither my son or 1 Would care to have a Star without your approval . . . . as we both feel so loyal to you and tile cause you are defending.. I am free to confess to you that my hope and ambition in life is to live long enough to see this son made a General Officer,. and I leel I am placing my entire life, as it were. in your hands for consideration, and I trust you can see your way clear. dear General Pershing. to gve him the recommendation necessary to advance him to the grade olf Brigadier General.
With best wishes for yourself, I remain with great esteem.Very cordially yours, Mary P. MacArthur MacArthur was unaware that his mother had written Pershing. and in any event it is unlikely the letter could have reached the AEF commander in France in time to influence the promotion. which occurred on 26 June 191. I lowever despite the fact that with hindsight we can see the inevitability of MacArthur's eventual rise to high rank. biographer D. Clayton James concludes that his elevation in thiN instance was likely -instigated by Baker and reluctantly approved by Pershing.
