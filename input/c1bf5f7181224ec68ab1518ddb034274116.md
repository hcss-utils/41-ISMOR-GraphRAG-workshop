Moltke reinforced systems necessary to enable this planning well before the Austro-Prussian War.
In this regard, he drastically expanded the role of the Prussian General Staff, the better to train for and plan future campaigns.
The way in which he expanded the staff reflected a large, Kantian human mind, so to speak.
It was comprised of constructed categories that aided Moltke in processing, deconstructing, and synthesizing complex information into a usable plan, in the same way the human mind processes synthetic judgments a priori.
For instance, he developed a mobilization section to manage rail schedules and troop movements.
In this vein, he participated in the strategic railroad development program, which facilitated deployment of armies to multiple fronts.
He then used his mobilization section to establish the detailed movement timetables for the Austro-Prussian War, deploying troops along a 275-mile-long front that extended from the borders of Saxony and Bohemia into Silesia.
