The reader will also benefit from Delbriick's methodology, for by combining meticulous research with the practical military knowledge of his own day he demolished many of the legends that survived antiquity.
Thus when Herodotus claimed that the Athenians charged into the Persians at Marathon after running for some 1,500 meters, Delbrick consulted his own experience as a reserve officer and the most recent pamphlets on military training and tactics before stating this to be a physical impossibility.
A large unit in his own day could cover at most 150 meters at a run during maneuvers (Prussian regulations in fact permitted the soldier with all field equipment to run for only two minutes, or 350 meters).
From his study of Greek society he knew that the Athenian army comprised men of fifty as well as youths in their prime, and personal experience taught him that a closed mass (the Greek phalanx) runs with much more difficulty than an individual.
Finally, an incident in the 1864 war between Prussia and Denmark provided a useful example of what can happen when a body of troops enters hand to hand combat after a forced run of 400 paces.
He rejected therefore the version of Herodotus, and a personal study of the terrain enabled him to revise the traditional version so that it might make more sense to the modern soldier.
