The U.S. government needs to prepare for direct and indirect confrontation with Russia outside of Europe.
As in former Soviet republics, the United States and its partners will likely face Russian proxies with advanced military tactics and technology.
A clearer understanding of what capabilities Russia can provide through training and equipping partners may illuminate potential capabilities that the United States could provide to its own partners.
Furthermore, the U.S. military needs to prepare for the potential that in a conflict like Syria, where both U.S. and Russian forces are deployed, a direct confrontation between the United States and Russia could emerge.
Beyond contingency planning for such scenarios, the U.S. Army should assess whether forces deployed in areas where a conflict with Russia is conceivable have the necessary training and equipment and are prepared to take action while avoiding escalation.
