In the years immediately following the 2008 war with Georgia, Russia embarked on a series of military reforms that eventually had a considerable impact on the quality of its forces.
The transition to a brigade-centric army-which is now in the process of evolving further into a mix of brigades and divisions-brought with it notable improvements in readiness.
The number of volunteer soldiers serving under contract in the Russian Armed Forces appears to have reached about 350,000-380,000; as the high-readiness elements of the Russian military are reliant on contract soldiers, this has substantially expanded the number of units ready for operations on short notice (Golts, 2017).
Russian military units have also seen a relatively high pace of exercisesboth programmed and unannounced "snap" exercises-as well as active combat operations in Crimea and East Ukraine since 2014, and Syria since 2015.
2 Finally, Russian military modernization efforts have resulted in the fielding of some very capable air defenses, and long-range strike weapons, such as the SS-26 STONE (9K720 Iskander-M) tactical ballistic missile, as well as large numbers of more modestly improved weapon platforms, such as upgraded T-72B3 tanks.
