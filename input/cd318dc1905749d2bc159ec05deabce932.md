This paper uses unclassified, publicly available information to both explore the events surrounding the Havana Syndrome, and to understand this apparent new form of warfare called neurowarfare within a greater strategic and neuroscientific context.
The authors argue that not only is neurowar coming, it is already here now, and it will be a crucial part of this era of GPC.
Our research indicates that not only is the U.S. government, and specifically the national security community, investing heavily in neuroscience and neurotechnology-neuro S&T-but also its largest competitors, China and Russia, also believe it to be the future of warfare.
