As the year 2000 continued, the war transitioned from Russian attacks against Chechen defended positions to a classic guerilla phase with the attacks perpetrated by mobile groups of Chechens directly targeting Russia's military forces.
Russians responded to these attacks with overwhelming force and pressure on civilians.
Following the fall of Grozny, Russian forces, without warning the civilian population commenced an hours long aerial bombardment of the village of Katyr-Yurt.
The use of 500lbunguided bombs was reminiscent of the carpet-bombing of World War II and resulted in the deaths of over 350 civilians.
