The experiences in Spain and Finland did not clarify Hitler's thinking.
He made a dangerous short-war assumption when he attacked Russia in June 1941, before he could defeat England in the west.
He asserted that the Soviet house of cards would collapse with the first kick on the front door.
But when that did not happen, he found himself hopelessly outnumbered.
The qualitative edge his Luftwaffe had shown in Spain and the surprise he achieved allowed him to run wild for a time, but the assault bogged down at the gates of Moscow.
Meanwhile, the surprise attack caught many Soviet aircraft on the ground.
The planes were destroyed but not the aircrews.
They would soon be reequipped with new generations of aircraft (and many of them) that would gradually close the qualitative gap.
