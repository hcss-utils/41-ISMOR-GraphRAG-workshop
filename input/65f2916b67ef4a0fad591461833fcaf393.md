Altogether, these diplomatic and military efforts to deter Russia, from inside Romania and from NATO, rely heavily on the assumption that the current balance of power is maintained.
Yet, the assumption is flawed, because if even one of the 28 NATO countries does not vote to respond to an outside aggression, the aggressor can continue to pursue its interests without any repercussions.
The aggressor's interest, therefore, is to create inside the alliance a lack of consensus about what the threshold is for a "grey area" aggression like cyber-attacks, subversion, or economic support of populist movements, and to develop new internal disturbances inside the alliance.
The pressure on Russia's neighboring countries for timely measures to maintain their independence comes from their need to consolidate the balance of power stability assumption with facts: increased economic growth, increased military readiness, enhanced capabilities of internal first responders to deter hybrid threats, and close intelligence monitoring.
