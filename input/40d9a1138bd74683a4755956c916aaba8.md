Russia and China employ nonlinear techniques to counter the traditional military strength of the United States.
For example, China's use of nonlinear warfare is guided by its unconventional doctrine of "Three Warfares."
First introduced in 2003, China's nonlinear approach utilizes psychological, media, and legal warfare to gain both strategic and operational advantages over the West.
As China's economic and geopolitical influence grows, China analysts look closely at both China's conventional and unconventional methods of influence within the Indo-Pacific region and beyond.
The overarching objective of China's "Three Warfares" is the employment of information and cyber warfare to gain a strategic, operational, or tactical advantage over its adversaries.
Some experts compare the concepts and structures associated with China's "Three Warfares" to Russia's use of nonlinear warfare as it also incorporates cyber and information operations within gray zone conflict.
As China and Russia continue to exert their regional power and place increasing pressure on neighboring countries within their respective spheres of influence, much can be gleaned from how both countries exert influence through the information and cyber domains.
