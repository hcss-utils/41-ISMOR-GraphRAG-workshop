As the Army prepares for warfare in the next century, advocates of Arvin Toffler's Third Wave theory argue that the vertical hierarchical organization of the levels of war have been changed by new technologies. Figure #1 depicts the vertical hierarchy, which reflects the concept that the operational level serves as the "vital link" between tactics and strategy.
Toffler's advocates believe that the tactical level directly links to the strategic level as a result of the introduction and wide spread use of the microprocessor. Figure #2 represents this connection Figure

Has the Information Age really produced a unique phenomenon? Have the levels of war historically remained in a hierarchial pattern in application? This monograph proposes that the strategic, operational, and tactical levels have always been interconnected, and practical requirements such as military command placed them in a vertical hierarchy.
Toffler's advocates suggest that the traditionally accepted view of society and man's environment undergo significant change due to the forces released by Third Wave technology. These adherents believe Toffler's theory that civilization is divided into three waves -an agricultural, an industrial, and an informational, each of these developments fundamentally changed the way people lived and interacted.
For example, prior to his First Agricultural Wave, man lived in small, semimigratory groups which foraged, hunted or fished for food. As the Agricultural Wave swept through these groups, man changed his way of life and began to settle in small villages surrounded by cultivated land. During the Second Wave, industrial forces transformed these small villages into larger cities to meet the pressures of manufacturing and the demands of mass production.

Toffler's "wave" forces that changed society in th Agararian and industrial Ages would also change the relationships between strategy, operations and tactics as defined by the Army's FM 100-5, Operations. His advocates perceive a direct realtionship between the strategic and tactical levels as a result of Information Age forces. They argue that Information Age forces have altered the hierarchial pattern of strategy, operations and tactics as defined in the 1993 edition of the Army's FM 100-5, Operations. This manual defines these echelons as starting with
Strategy and running through Operations to Tactics.

At the operational level of war, joint and combined operational forces within a theater of operations perform subordinate campaigns and major operations and plan, conduct, and sustain to accomplish the strategic objectives of the unified commander or higher military authority. 9
At the lowest echelon lies the Tactical level. This level concerns the employment of forces to win engagements and battles and thereby achieve Operational objectives.

The Third Wave automobile, previously used to explain Toffler's themes, furnishes a means to analyze the significance of understanding the relationships between the three levels of warfare. First, the tactical level of war is considered as the numerous, minute functions that allow the engine to start, the wheels to roll, the brakes to stop, or the steering to turn. These functions such as fuel injection or spark plugs firing represent engagements and battles. Next, the automobile's systems represent the operational level of war. Similar to war's operational level which connect engagements and battles into campaigns; the cooling system, fuel system, electrical system, and exhaust system groups dozens of minute functions into a single, complex effect. Lastly, the strategic level is the automobile running on a road with all of its systems smoothly operating through their thousands of minute functions. With this analogy in mind, the Army officer is the automobile owner and driver. Similar to the driver knowing the multiple steps involved in effortlessly operating his automobile, the military officer must grasp the relationships between the levels in order to engineer successful combat operations.
The Agrarian Age -Toffler's First Wave
The levels of war were first defined for the late Agrarian Age, or Toffler's First
Wave, by two veterans of the Napoleonic wars, Antoine-Henri Jomini (1779-1869)   and Carl von Clausewitz (1780-1831). While the names for strategy, operations and tactics have been modified over time, the elements within the three levels have remained relatively constant with most of these theorists' fundamental concepts adopted into modern American military doctrine. The problem that arises is the misinterpretation of the theorists' ideas of the relationships and inter-connections between strategy, operations, and tactics. This misunderstanding occurred because of the complexity of the subject and style of the writers. Jomini and Clausewitz wrote about war on both a theoretical and realistic level. Over the years, interpretations of their writings have blended these two levels. While translations to English cause controversy with these difficult concepts, their style additionally leaves room for confusion. Jomini's writings are didactic and prescriptive in marked contrast to Clausewitz' metaphysical and philosophical technique. These styles cause many to believe they held opposite opinions when in fact they shared similar meanings only different approaches. 
11
To remain on firm doctrinal ground, a common description of the levels of war must be understood. FM 100-5 presents the levels of war as strategic, operational, and tactical. Jomini depicted the levels as strategy, grand tactics and tactics, while Both theorists defined strategic elements and links to the operational level that remain current in military doctrine. Although Jomini regarded The Art of War as a strategic guide, he concentrated more on our present day operational and tactical levels to the detriment of the strategic level. At this level, he described the relationship between the people, the economy, the military, the government, and the nation that prevail during war.

16
This political objective represented his connection between the strategic and operational levels.
Both theorists attached great significance to what is now referred to as the operational level. Jomini's definitions of Strategy and Grand Tactics fell within the operational level. Jomini focused on decisive points, bases of operation, lines of operation, and lines of communications, which clearly reflect concepts relating to FM 100-5's operational level. His definitions emphasized four maxims that generally pertain to maneuvering an army to attack an enemy's decisive point or cut his line of operation, while negating the enemy's efforts to execute the same maneuver. 
19
21
For Clausewitz, the operational level was the use of engagements for the purpose of war to attain the political objective. 
22
23
24
25
Both theorists tended to agree on the elements which compose the tactical level of war. Jomini was inclined towards the battle as the principle event at the tactical level, and delineates three types of battle: offensive, defensive and unexpected or meeting on the march. He additionally grouped courage, genius, and fortune as elements of tactics. 
26
27
29
Jomini created a non-linear pattern to explain the relationships between the levels.
Jomini presented evidence of a bond that joins strategy and tactics. This interrelationship occurred in Jomini's description of a national political leader taking the field to perform "great actions" that could be done by his subordinate generals. 
30
Clausewitz opined that the reason for the effectiveness of most attacks lies in the general, the political conditions of war? 1 He additionally furnished specific practical evidence of this theoretical connection between the strategic and tactical levels. He offered examples of national leaders at the strategic level who knew everything turned on tactical results? 2 For both theorists, political considerations represented a vital coupling of strategy with tactics. Jomini and Clausewitz drew the evidence for this theoretical relationship from their interpretation of the experiences of Frederick the Great and Napoleon.
The battle of Rossbach on 1757 demonstrated the impact of a tactical battle on the strategic level during the Seven Years ' War (1756-1763). This conflict pitted Prussia against Austria, France, Russia, Saxony, and Sweden. During the war,
Frederick successfully led his country in all three levels of war simultaneously. His Strategie war aims were to retain possession of Silesia, continue his dominance in central European politics, and win economic and military assistance from Britain.
To achieve these political objectives while surrounded by three invading armies,
Frederick organized a large mobile striking force and smaller frontier detachments.
His operational plan sought to slow the penetrations of the enemy armies with his frontier defenses to allow the strike force, bk√üre brigade, to defeat each uncoordinated thrust. Frederick knew that the tactical victories of the strike force would blunt his enemies' enthusiasm to continue their invasion, and ultimately achieve his political objectives. Therefore, Frederick personally took the field and commanded the strike force. His defeat of a French army at Rossbach on November 5, 1757, quieted hostilities on the western frontier, and allowed him to turn his attentions toward the eastern frontier. More importantly, this tactical victory reversed the British strategic decision to provide only economic assistance to the Prussians, and began the British commitment of troops on the continent against France.

The Industrial Age -Tqffler's Second Wave
Toffler's advocates assert that Industrial Age, or Second Wave, warfare existed under a vertical hierarchy for the levels of war. Primarily this relationship between strategy, operations and tactics resulted from requirements for a command structure to control the large armies developed during this period. While this vertical hierarchy ran counter to Jomini's and Clausewitz' theoretical non-linear relationships between the levels of war, warfare still reflected these theorists' concept of a dynamic coupling of strategy and tactics. However, the vertical hierarchy influenced military command systems and received acceptance throughout the Industrial Age. While that hierarchy existed for command purposes, the non-linear phenomenon continued throughout this period.
The Prussian tactical defeat of the Austrians at Koniggratz (Sadowa) on Jury 3, 1866, demonstrates the existence of the non-linear pattern for the levels of war during the early Industrial Age. The Industrial Age, or Toffler's Second Wave, had just begun when this battle was fought. 
43
46
To comprehend the significance of Koniggratz, one must understand the central   Moltke changed the theorists' connection of strategy to tactics based on his military leadership experience. Rightly or wrongly, such a command system influenced European and American military institutions during the First World War.
The principle antagonists fighting in the western theater had all adopted systems similar to the Moltke model by 1918. Predictably, Germany continued the Moltke system, but military leaders became increasingly isolated from strategic political concerns. In their case, the politicians and military combined to oust the chancellor, Bethmann-Hollweg, because of his attempts to inject politics into the military effort. This concept ran contrary to contemporary German viewpoints, and served to bring in the Hindenburg-Ludendorff team and military control of the government. A grand strategy conference held on November 11, 1917 best exemplifies the separation of military objectives from the strategic level. With
Ludendorff as chairman, the assembly busied itself with finding a military solution to winning the war, and their discussions were completely divorced from any political objectives. 
69
On the other hand, political considerations acted as a connection between the strategic and operational levels for the Allies. Surprisingly, the British came closest to emulating the German war experience with the Moltke command system.
Unlike Bethmann-Hollweg, who attempted to insure the war remained an instrument of policy, British politicians tried to keep out of the way of the military.
Either because of a lack of military expertise or a fear of public rebuke, Prime Ferdinand Foch, during the dark days of the Ludendorff offensives in the spring of 1918. Under the French system, the strategic leader, Clemenceau, would also involve himself with the operational level, but he remained aloof from the tactical fight. In France at this time, there was no interaction between the strategic level and the tactical level. The French command system continued the political connection between strategy and operations.

74
The Japanese political objectives in the war arose from their determination to create a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere over an area roughly stretching from Siberia through Australasia. With these strategic objectives, Japan laid out military objectives and prepared operational plans to achieve its war aims.

The operational plan called for Navy aircraft carriers to transport Army Air Corps bombers near Japan and launch them. The bombers would then fly to their targets, drop bombs, and land in China. 
79
The Doolittle Raid occurred on April 18, 1941. The battlefield for this engagement encompassed the sky lower than one thousand feet above the island of Honshu. The engagement featured eighty United States airmen in sixteen B-25 bombers against the home island population of Japan. Doolittle planned for the aircraft to fly to their targets, drop a mixture of demolition and incendiary bombs, then continue their flight and land in China.

States, was the shock it delivered to Japanese confidence. This minor tactical engagement demonstrated the vulnerability of the home islands to airborne attack, and posed a direct threat to the Japanese emperor. Because the continued safety of Hirohito was a political objective, the Japanese operational plan had failed to meet this requirement. To rectify the strategic situation, the Japanese adopted a new operational plan that shifted the main war effort from defense to an offensive operation into the central Pacific to establish a deeper defense. The offensive they undertook resulted in the Battle of Midway, the climatic event of the Pacific 
War. 85
Undoubtedly, the non-linear relationships between the levels of war existed in the Industrial Age. While Jomini and Clausewitz proposed these dynamic relationships in the Agrarian Age, this phenomenon continued in the Industrial Age.
In 
The unique technology introduced during the Information Age has not produced a revolution in military affairs concerning the levels of war. Toffler advocates failed to notice the non-linear connections between strategy, operations, and tactics during the Agrarian and Industrial Age. Throughout the First and Second Waves, tactical events directly impacted on the strategic level, demonstrating that non-linear relationships existed over the last two hundred years.
Two Agrarian Age theorists, Jomini and Clausewitz, were the first to conceptalalize the levels of war. Their theories grasped a coupling of strategy to tactics, based on the experiences of Frederick the Great and Napoleon.
Misperceptions developed and obscured the meaning of this strategy to tactics affinity based on the theorists' writing style and the difficult concepts that dealt with war. However, historical examples, particularly Rossbach and Austerlitz, reveal the powerful political impact of tactical victories on strategic decisions. The argument that the non-linear relationship is possible through the technology present in the Information Age is disproved by these events during the Agrarian Age.
The late 19th century and World War I saw the development of the vertical hierarchy as a structure for military command as a response to the unwieldy proportions of the Industrial Age armies. While this vertical hierarchy ran counter to Jomini's and Clausewitz' theoretical relationship between strategy and tactics, political considerations remained an element of the operational level. Only when political considerations were excluded, such as in Germany, during the last two years of World War I did problems develop. This vertical hierarchy system of command, or Moltkean model, continued to shape command structures through World War II. But, while this hierarchy existed for command purposes, the nonlinear phenomenon remained applicable to explain the relationships between the levels throughout the Industrial Age.
The latest edition of FM 100-5 continues to follow the vertical hierarchy, similar to the Moltke model, for the Army's command structure. While the fundamentals within strategy, operations and tactics were based on the theories proposed by Jomini and Clausewitz, the manual fails to address the non-linear relationships between the levels of war. To remain with this vertical hierarchy is similar to the automobile driver not pumping gas into his vehicle. Using the analogy of the automobile, as explained in the Introduction, the minute functions of the engine represent the tactical level, car's major systems are analogous to the operational level, and the act of driving on a road illustrates the strategic level.
When the gas gauge registers empty, the driver fills the tank. If a tire looks flat, the driver changes it or adds air. When the thermostat shows hot, the driver adds water and coolant. These circumstances are comparable to a tactical event impacting on strategy. The Army must realize that such events occur, and re-examine its doctrine to include this phenomenon. This Prussian invasion portrays the beginning of modem operational art as defined by the criteria from the Military History Course. In fact, there exist many similarities between this campaign and Napoleon's Campaign of 1809.
First, Frederick's strategy called for the survival of his country against four enemies. He chose to defend against two (Russia and Sweden), and attack the third (Austria) before the fourth (France) could interfere. This offensive against Austria signifies an integral part of his strategic plan to save his kingdom.
Napoleon conducted a similar strategy in 1809. He placed minimal forces against Britain in Spain, and diplomatically isolated then militarily defeated Austria.
Second, the Prussian campaign effectively linked strategy to tactics. Fourth, the opposing forces were symmetrical and approached a corps-type organization. The Austrians fought using a regimental system and the same weapons as the Prussian Army. While not named as a corps, they possessed rudimentary staffs and approached the corps in size. From east to west, the Prussian columns numbered 19,300 soldiers, 39,600 soldiers, 20,300 soldiers, and lastly 34,000. The Austrians were arrayed in groups of 24,000 soldiers, 30,000 soldiers, 28,000 soldiers, and 27,000. 
90
Fifth, the Prussians employed decentralized command and control. Each advancing column possessed a commander with specific orders for the invasion.
Prince Moritz lead the eastern most column, while Frederick was his overall commander and lead the second column. Field Marshal Schwerin commanded the western forces consisting of his column and the Duke of Bevern's column. The
French columns in 1809 also received detailed instructions on routes and timings.
Sixth, the Prussian advance exhibited sequenced and simultaneous engagements. Specifically, orders to Moritz and Bevern were for independent movement and raids to confuse the Austrians, then to unite with Frederick and Schwerin respectively. Once the two major forces united, Frederick's pushed an Austrian force south along the Elbe, while Schwerin's moved independently against another Austrian force toward the rear of Prague. 
91
Seventh, as discussed above, the Prussian Army possessed a common understanding for their unique tactics or doctrine. But, these procedures extended into higher level methods. Frederick, a prolific writer, wrote three military works that included instructions on technical, campaign and tactical procedures. These doctrinal works were Prinicipe generaux de la guerre written in 1746, Testament politique written in 1752, and Principes generaux provided as an attachment to the latter. The Prussian field marshals read and understood Frederick's methods from these books. The French field marshals fought alongside Napoleon for many years
