In his 2014 writing that examined Russia's evolving character of war that was witnessed during the Georgia and Ukraine conflicts, Frank Hoffman recognizes the term "hybrid warfare" as many scholars soon began using the term to label Russia's actions in Ukraine.
In addition, Hoffman describes the Russo-Ukrainian War as an "unconventional conflict" that might also resemble certain characteristics associated with the description of political warfare and defined by George Kennan in 1948.
