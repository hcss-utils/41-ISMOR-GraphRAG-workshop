The students who still believed that Russia on balance would profit from closer ties to China, enabling it to become stronger-absolutely and relatively-in economic and strategic terms, constituted a significant minority.
But more students than not viewed the Kremlin's turn to the East as a hazardous gamble that threatened to undermine, rather than advance, Russia's interests and values.
In order of preference, the students expressed the following strategic choices for Russia: look inward and focus on domestic problems, carefully balance between America and China, lean to the West, and favor closer ties to China while moving away from the West.
These sober expressions of geopolitical caution challenge the common Western portrayal of Russia's world view as self-confident and expansionist.
Instead, the national perspective of most of the students was defensive, revealing a keen understanding of Russia's multiple vulnerabilities as a state.
