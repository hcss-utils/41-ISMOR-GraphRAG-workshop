europe can no longer assume a peaceful russia.
russia's national security policy presupposes conflict with nato and sees the united states as its primary enemy-a designation russia will soon enshrine in new defense doctrine.
its basic nuclear policy rests on the corollary that for Moscow to be secure, no other european capital can be secure.
russia wants to return to the Cold War politics of intimidation with tactical nuclear weapons, shortrange, inter-continental, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
