In 1866, Bismarck had a sophisticated understanding of his primary rival.
He needed to defeat the Austrians to dissolve the German Confederation-over which Austria presidedbut he knew that France lurked in the background as a more potent and threatening enemy.
This was an atmosphere tailor-made for Bismarck's ingenuity.
To weaken both Austria and France, he entered into alliance, in February 1866, with the new Kingdom of Italy.
Italy itself was in large part an 1859 creation of the French army.
But France's decision to renege on its pledge to "free Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic" (they freed it only as far as Milan, stopping short of Venice) and Napoleon III's demand for the Piedmontese territories of Nice (Nizza) and Savoy (Savoia), opened a rift between the two powers, which Bismarck slid into.
He agreed that the Prussians would attack the Austrians in Bohemia if the Italians would attack them in Venetia.
By making an ally of France's protégé, Bismarck not only opened a second front against the Austrians, he insured that if the 1866 campaign became a long war, the Italians would not mobilize with the French against Prussia.
