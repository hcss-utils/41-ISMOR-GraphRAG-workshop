It is my pleasure to Introduce the Air War College Maxwell Paper Anthology, a compilation of the award-winning papers from our 2010 graduates. Since we published the first Maxwell Paper in May 1996, we have distributed 47 papers demonstrating the highest level of analytical creativity and scholarship. The 12 papers presented here provide insight into and promote discussion on topics of importance to senior leaders.
In the opening paper. Col Rolanda Burnett argues that the Air Force master tenet of centralized control with decentralized execution is no longer applicable. He highlights the tenet's key doctrinal strengths and weaknesses and explains how it can be improved. In the next paper, Col Kenneth Hall describes how the emphasis on bioengineered threats since 9/11 has had unintended consequences for the US vaccination program. He concludes that we are all at great risk because of inattention to common diseases that affect our entire population. Our Canadian international fellow, Lt Col Michael Rafter, analyzes the legal and ethical implications of the United States' 1970 incursion into Cambodia to determine if it was justified.
Several of our papers address the influence of emerging technology and trends on US security strategy. Lt Col Kevin Coyne examines the US European Command's intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) strategy and suggests a road ahead for ISR integration. Col Rebecca Keller analyzes the intersection of influence operations (IO) and cyberspace operations. She identifies current operational and legal constraints on the execution of IO using cyber technology and offers remedial actions to enhance the use of the Internet as a military IO tool in today's cyber world. Another international fellow, Lt Col Lars Helmrich of the Swedish air force, critiques US Arctic policy and argues for an increased leadership role for the United States. Lt Col David Baylor analyzes the strategic implications of a reduction in nuclear weapons and asks the important question "Are there different negotiation considerations and dynamics in play when Russia and the United States go below 1,000 strategic warheads?" These papers all tackle the influence of change on the strategic environment while another batch addresses how change should influence the Department of Defense (DOD). Col Carl Schaefer assesses the DOD's procurement system and concludes that the services could learn from the Special Operations Command's streamlined acquisition system. Lt Col James Michael Doolin evaluates technologies to meet the US Transportation Command's need for a situational aware-ness tool. And Lt Col Matthew Smitham argues that the time is ripe for a US-led space traffic control system.
Our anthology closes with a pair of papers that address DOD human capital challenges. Col Julie Bolt analyzes the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy and offers specific policy implementation recommendations for the DOD. Col Stella Smith examines the potential loss of intellectual capital as measured by the number of undergraduate and graduate degrees earned in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Her analysis suggests dire consequences for the US technical base and our ability to deter future adversaries if this critical capability is allowed to atrophy.

Col Rolando. Burnett Sr., USAF*
The US Air Force should adjust its time-honored master tenet for the employment of alrpower: centralized control and decentralized execution (CC&DE). This Mosaic Law equivalent remains as valid today as when the airpower forefathers divined it amidst their operational context. It is, nonetheless, incomplete.
The United States conducts air operations over a wide spectrum of conflicts producing many varied conditions. Correspondingly, the military has adapted. From counter-insurgency operations to thermonuclear deterrence, America's strength has been the ability to create flexibility to effectively respond to the types of wars it may face. Why then should the Air Force assume its master tenet is the right approach to all operational contexts? Many Airmen view the master tenet as the only way to employ air and space power; however, restrictive doctrine and thinking have contributed to the master tenet's unenviable status as a "bumper sticker."
This paper considers why centralized control dominates an Airman's thinking, the doctrinal history of centralized control and current doctrinal concerns, how different operational contexts impact the Air Force's master tenet, key doctrinal strengths and weaknesses, and how the master tenet can be improved upon.
What Is the basis for an Airman's total commitment to this age-old edict? Some may argue that the Airman's allegiance stems from fear-fear of losing the status of an independent service. Centralized control holds a special place in airpower history, underpinning the argument that led to an independent US Air Force in 1947. Therefore, if an Airman compromises-even one iota-on the master tenet, it would be tantamount to undermining the value of an independent US •Gp Capt Raymond Goodall, Royal Air Force, was the essay advisor for this paper.
Air Force. Most would agree that airpower has come of age in the last 63 years, based on the experiences in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq, with the chances of returning the Air Force back to the Army slim to none.

Paranoia is not the only explanation for an Airman's loyalty to the master tenet. The origins for such loyalty can be traced back to lessons learned by early airpower practitioners. As a result of the British experience prior to and during World War II and the US experience during that war, Airmen would rightly conclude that centralization (command and control) was the foundation to effective airpower operations.
Following the Battle of France in 1940, numerous events shaped Britain's approach to the employment of airpower. The Battle of Britain, lessons learned in North Africa, numerous exercises, and technological advances all contributed to Britain's approach to joint operations. During the fall of 1940, exercises in Northern Ireland resulted in air support controls which embodied the technical and organizational means to enhance support of ground forces. Another development emphasized colocated army-air headquarters and a signals network that linked forward and rear airfields with the joint army-air headquarters and deployed army divisions and brigades. Sorting out the best of the emerging systems led to delays. Even more daunting was introducing these concepts in the crucible of battle against the Germans in North Africa during WWII. However, they proved effective once fully developed. A hybrid of the two systems, developed by Air Marshals Arthur William Tedder and Arthur "Mary" Coningham, gained acceptance in the summer of 1942.

To realize these advantages, airmen needed a mechanism to wield airpower to leverage its flexibility. The mechanism was central control, in the form of an airman who commanded air assets and was coequal and preferably colocated with the ground commander. Sadly, the Americans and British did not incorporate the lessons learned and executed by the British during Operation Torch, the massive operation in November 1942 that intended to remove the Axis forces from Northern Africa.
An untested American airpower doctrine-Field Manual (FM) 31 -35, Aviation in Support of Ground Operations-bounded the initial foray into joint and combined operations by the Americans and British. On paper it looked sound, with "a comprehensive tactical air control system: a central air command, a sophisticated network of ASC [air support control] centres and various levels of communications between the ground and air forces." 
5
The doctrine's emphasis on corps-level support and the ground commander's decision authority for target priority and selection led to dispersion and subordination of air assets to the "narrow closesupport interests of the ground commanders."

FM 100-20 is a product of Its environment, which was unlimited in nature where overwhelming force was required to destroy the enemy to achieve military and strategic objectives.

The doctrine of centralized control was essentially formed in a conventional operational environment-force-on-force on a linear battlefield, a type of fight the United States has become very adept in prosecuting. Therefore, centralized control, through a single Airman commander, is rooted in validity. It is understandable why Airmen have created and clung to the master tenet. Given the conditions and operational context, centralized control was a logical and pragmatic approach to fully exploit airpower. The tendency of Airmen to default to centralized control is warranted. Centralized control is still relevant today; however, its relevancy does not necessarily mean it is without shortcomings.
It is important to establish a background of post-WWII doctrine with regard to CC&DE because it serves as a foundation to evaluate and determine possible improvements. Historically, what does USAF and joint doctrine reveal about CC&DE?
In 1954 the USAF's doctrinal approach to managing air operations was "centralized overall direction and decentralized control of operations."

17
There is confusion over the relationship between command and control. The terms are mistakenly used interchangeably. 
18
An overriding aspect to the debate over CC&DE is command. Joint Publication (JP) 1-02, Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Associated Terms, defines command as "the authority that a commander in the Armed Forces lawfully exercises over subordinates by virtue of rank or assignment. Command includes the authority and responsibility for effectively using available resources and for planning the employment .... organizing, directing, coordinating, and controlling [of] military forces for the accomplishment of assigned missions. It also includes responsibility for health, welfare, morale, and discipline of assigned personnel."

The following excerpt from a proposed revision in USAF doctrine continues the Air Force's long-standing focus on and fascination with control: "Centralized control empowers the JFACC to respond to changes in the operational environment." 
21
JP 1 -02 defines control in two ways-at the operational and tactical levels. Operational control is defined as "organizing and employing commands and forces, assigning tasks, designating objectives, and giving authoritative direction necessary to accomplish the mission." 
22

25
26
It is clear that within US doctrine there are differences in how control is viewed. JP 1-02 makes allowances for effective control of forces at the operational as well as the tactical level. Though not explicitly mentioned, this would include air and space forces. On the other hand, air and space operations doctrine, JP 3-30 and AFDD 1, re-ports effective control only in the context of the operational (centralized) level.
At first glance, doctrine regarding decentralized execution seems more unified and less confusing than either command or control. AFDD 1, JP 1-02, and JP 3-30 define execution in terms of decentralization. The doctrine explicitly defines decentralized execution but not execution. AFDD 1, JP 1-02, and JP 3-30 characterize decentralized execution as "delegation of execution authority." However, AFDD 1 and JP 3-30 say that "decentralized execution helps achieve effective span of control and flexibility to deal with changes and uncertainty." 
27
As Daniel Baltrusaitis states in Centralized Control with Decentralized Execution, "Current AF doctrine fails to adequately and consistently define the central terms of command, control and execution. This causes major weaknesses in the debate over command, control and execution concepts because there is no agreed upon definition of the terms." 
28
In Command in Air War, Lt Col Michael Kometer observes that "what control is to one may be execution to another." 
29

This doctrinal analysis offers insight into the arguments over CC&DE, but it doesn't answer all the questions. In fact it raises an important one: can something other than CC&DE be a better option for air and space operations? When we consider this question through the lens of differing operational environments, it adds clarity.
There are weaknesses with the master tenet. It is not the optimal approach for every situation-it is necessary but not sufficient to overcome the vast diversity of challenges posed by airpower employment across the spectrum of operations.
FM 100-20 represented the best way to use airpower-one might say an optimization-based on the operational environment of WWII. However, the conditions which shaped and led to centralized control were not universal. One could reason, then, given different operational circumstances and conditions, that centralized control may not be the optimal approach in conducting air operations. Control is a subset of command; therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that ideas on command could also apply to control. Martin van Creveld writes about varied contexts and the impact these variations have on so-called immutable laws of command. He suggests that since "command [is] so intimately bound up with numerous other factors that shape war, the pronunciation of one or more 'master principles' that should govern its structure and the way it operates is impossible."

The contextual divergence is staggering. First, counterinsurgencies are limited in nature, and the use of overwhelming force can possibly cause negative political fallout that can be detrimental to achieving military and strategic objectives. The United States and its allies had air superiority by default-the enemy posed no significant air capability. Next, the notion of a decisive point or points where massing combat capability decides the outcome is simply not applicable in a counterinsurgency. If massing airpower is less advantageous, then the mechanism (centralized control) that enables the massing of airpower is also less advantageous.
The current insurgency in Afghanistan is comprised of many varied mini-insurgencies-each with different challenges and requiring tailored approaches. Afghanistan is a nation of ethnic tribes. It becomes difficult for a single commander to understand interrelationships between the mini-insurgencies as capability is moved between local insurgencies, as opposed to the homogeneity of the North Africa operation in WWII. It is reasonable to conclude that this type of operational environment may benefit from an increased level of decentralization. In fact, the land forces have done just that by "pushing" the planning down to the division and, in some cases, to the brigade.
The shift toward decentralization in response to the diverse nature of counterinsurgencies is understandable for land forces but does not apply to air and space power. This view is shortsighted and does not take into account many instances where the Air Force has departed from its master tenet, based on the conditions. For example, "Air Force participation in Operations Northern Watch, Southern Watch, Allied Force, and Deliberate Force emphasize [sic] the use of centralized execution to manage the application of air power [because of political influence and force protection requirements for coalition aircraft]. In each instance, the operation's small scale [and] limited objectives . . . allowed the C/JFACC to pay individual attention to the execution of the air effort and thereby to achieve the desired political and military objectives." 
35
36
The AF doctrinal approach to centralized control, coupled with Army trends to further decentralizing planning, has made it more difficult for air and ground planners to cooperate. A key characteristic of centralized control is the Airman's approach to planning. Significant planning occurs centrally at the CAOC, although detailed planning also occurs at lower levels upon receipt of the air tasking order. 
37
38

40
41
The absence of robust air planning capability at lower Army echelons results in Airmen not providing air expertise where it matters. Often, ground commanders do not realize all the benefits airpower could provide because air isn't an integral part of the planning. Sometimes this can cause ill-conceived and poorly executed operations. Lt Col  William Pinter believes that "the air component needs to commit to developing the necessary resources to allow for the full degree of airground integration to occur at the lowest planning levels required for effective combat operations." 
42
43
Colonel Hinote comments that "not being in the mud" with the ground planners limits opportunities to build trust. "There are not many shared experiences between the air and ground. . . . There is no sense of trust between air planners at the CAOC and ground planners at the many decentralized fights which are going on." 
44
45
From the analysis above flow three broad conclusions. The first is that the master tenet is incomplete; it does not address the variety of ways air and space power has been managed. Differing operational contexts have led to different, but valid, ways to conduct air and space power operations. For the most part they are not addressed in USAF doctrine. The second main conclusion is that USAF doctrine, although incomplete, is still relevant. As long as there remains the possibility of the United States engaging in major combat operations, CC&DE is an option. Third, confusion abounds over centralization, decentralization, command, control, and execution. The varied interpretations of these terms and how they relate reflect the profound complexities associated with conducting air and space operations.
Centralized command, flexible control, and flexible execution seem to be a sound basis from which to articulate airpower philosophy. The new and improved master tenet unequivocally places the emphasis on command. It recognizes centralized command as the most likely constant across the spectrum of air and space operations. Control is inherent to command; by emphasizing command, the confusion over how they relate can be lessened if not totally eliminated.
Control and execution, however, need to be flexible. Sometimes it may be best to centrally control and execute (e.g., nuclear deterrence mission); at other times, controlling and executing in a decentralized fashion (e.g., counterinsurgency operations) may be best. And there are times when they may fall somewhere in between this continuum. The issue of centralization and decentralization is a matter of degree when applied to control and execution. In Command in Air War, Colonel Kometer states that "control of airpower has varied among different types of wars and even among different missions within the same war." 
46
47
Airmen have a hard time articulating beyond the bumper sticker, partly because the Air Force has failed to systematically document these complexities and their all-important implications. The Airman's understanding is stifled, lacking in-depth comprehension of command and control of air and space operations. USAF doctrine penetrates only surface deep and leaves much to be learned through trial and error or word of mouth. It is time the Air Force adjusted its master tenet to reflect those complexities. If it continues to allow the doctrine to be what amounts to a caricature of reality, its Airmen's ability to explain the doctrine will also be a caricature. Sadly, that amounts to nothing more than dogma.
Col Kenneth E. Hall, USAF* For over 230 years, vaccines advanced by the US military research and development (R&D) community have dramatically reduced the impact of naturally acquired infections not only in America's armed forces but in society at large. In recent years, however, the military's infectious-disease vaccine program has lost considerable emphasis, funding, and mission capability. In the 1990s, with the burgeoning concern for weaponized bioagents in Iraq and North Korea, Congress turned its attention to combating biological threats of deliberate origin over those of natural causes. The Department of Defense (DOD) responded by partitioning its biodefense and infectious-disease vaccine acquisition programs, with biodefense vaccines holding a higher acquisition priority and receiving more robust funding than infectiousdisease vaccines. The result has been a significant erosion of the DOD's ability to ensure the acquisition and availability of the right vaccines at the right time to optimally protect US forces from established and emerging natural infections now and in the future. '  In this paper, I argue that the DOD needs to take swift actions to revitalize its infectious-disease vaccine program and enhance the synergy between biodefense and infectious-disease activities to resolve vaccine acquisition and availability shortfalls. Specifically, the DOD must collectively assess and prioritize all biological threats, whether natural, accidental, or deliberate in nature; consolidate redundant vaccine acquisition activities; elevate the priority of infectiousdisease vaccines; and provide ample resources to sustain a robust vaccine acquisition capability to protect US military forces against validated and prioritized biological threats. 
2
hindering infectious-disease vaccine acquisition follows, including unbalanced threat assessment and mission focus, ineffective organization, insufficient funding, and inferior priority status. Finally, I recommend ways to enhance FHP vaccine acquisition and availability that will posture the DOD and America's military forces for twentyfirst-century national security success.
Throughout America's wars, naturally acquired infectious diseasesmany preventable by vaccine-have eclipsed bombs and bullets as the culprits of morbidity, mortality, disability, and mission degradation. This section investigates the criticality of infectious-disease vaccines in protecting force health and explains why US military R&D leadership is vital to their development.

The DOD's FHP doctrine characterizes every service member as a human weapon system requiring total life-cycle support and health maintenance.

In defeating health threats, primary prevention-action prior to exposure-reigns supreme. Immunization affords the lowest risk, highest efficacy, and most cost-effective protection to vaccine recipients. Immunization is superior to therapeutics (e.g., antibiotics and chemoprophylactics) and personal protection (e.g., repellents and bed nets) since it does not require knowledge of exposure; is not contingent upon an accurate and timely diagnosis; protects against severe diseases (e.g., rabies) and those for which treatment is unavailable, ineffective, or prone to cause side-effects; does not require individual compliance (e.g., antimalarials); and neither contributes to nor is fazed by microbial resistance. As well, immunization can notably reduce the medical logistical footprint in theater since, for every casualty, five personnel are required In the evacuation and treatment support chain.

In Africa. HIV/AIDS is spreading fastest in the Horn of Africa, where the US already has deep concerns about lawlessness and extremism. In both Ethiopia and Kenya, potentially important regional hubs in the violent and volatile East African sub-region, adult HTV-prevalence rates are over 10 percent. Nigeria, an essential guarantor of security and economic growth in the West African region, has more than 3 million citizens living with HIV or AIDS. The adult prevalence rate in South Africa, which plays a similar economic and security role in the southern African region, is 20 percent. If these two regional hegemons cannot send peacekeepers, contribute to growth and stability, or guarantee their own internal stability, US security interests in the continent. . . are severely threatened.

Since the Cold War's end, the DOD has become fixated on combattog biological threats of deliberate origin over those of natural causes. This section examines the DOD's lopsided focus on notional bioweapons while natural infections continue to plague military operations.
Despite its remarkable history, the US military infectious-disease vaccine program has taken a backseat to countering the bioterrorism threat since the mid-1990s. Beginning with its stand-up of the Joint Program Office for Biological Defense in 1993 and formalized requirements for biodefense vaccines in 1995, the DOD-with a push from Congress-justifiably turned a focused eye to biodefense.

While its emphasis was shifting to biodefense, the DOD was losing ground in its portfolio of infectious-disease vaccines. Table

Despite overlapping missions, the DOD maintains separate organizations for infectious-disease and biodefense vaccine development, procurement, and product management. Each has exclusive budgetary authority and product-line responsibility. This section investigates the negative impacts from the DOD's decision to decouple its vaccine programs while granting preferential funding and priority to its biodefense efforts.
The Military Infectious Diseases Research Program (MIDRP) mission is to "protect the US military against naturally-occurring infectious diseases via the development of FDA-approved vaccines" and other protection systems.

First, separate acquisition precludes a unified approach to the identification and prioritization of vaccine solutions based primarily on operational risk rather than the nature of the threat. Similarly, it impedes a united approach to the acquisition of "dual-use" vaccines, those which could counter both a natural and a weaponized threat to military personnel. 
70
71
Third, separate acquisition dilutes limited expertise and splits budgetary power. Because vaccine development is so complex, highly skilled and experienced professionals are required in all facets, from scientists to administrators. Also, the industry average cost to bring a new vaccine through the development process from concept to licensure ranges from $800 million to $1.6 billion over 14 years; to sustain a fielded product costs millions more. Separation curbs professional and budgetary synergy. 
72
73
74
75
These issues have contributed to significant vaccine availability problems, such as the loss of the adenovirus vaccine as previously described. They also signify the level of commitment required by the DOD not only to bring militarily important vaccines on line but to keep them available. 
76
77
While discrete programs with no single oversight authority are problematic, the pivotal issue in separating the acquisition of infectiousdisease and biodefense vaccines is budgetary. In 1993 the DOD's annual budget for the advanced development of biodefense vaccines was $1 million.

To make the best use of limited resources, the rules of the Defense Acquisition Management System govern the acquisition of military vaccines. Acquisition categories (ACAT I, II, and III) are used to assign priority and determine the level of DOD review, decision authority, and milestones that apply to a given project.

This section recommends four imperatives for ensuring the DOD's ongoing ability to produce vaccines against natural Infections and provides final thoughts on reversing the dangerous decline in US military infectious-disease R&D capability. While the challenges are formidable, the DOD can return its ailing infectious-disease vaccine program to its former status as the world's premier force health defender. Here is what needs to be done.
Concurrently consider all biothreats regardless of origin. Then prioritize them based on a balanced assessment of notional and experiential risks to war fighters independent of the nature of the threat.

A single DOD program is required to unify needs identification, prioritization, basic and advanced research, production, procurement, and ongoing product management. 
93
Like those intended for biodefense, vaccines to counter natural infections should be managed at the ACAT II major-system level (or higher). This is in alignment with the first recommendation above to consider all biological threats-regardless of origin-of equal threat potential to war fighters. This will ensure appropriate visibility and emphasis of both infectious-disease and biodefense vaccine acquisition within the DOD.
In addition to raising overall program funding, each infectiousdisease vaccine should be funded as a separate line item in the Future Years Defense Program to ensure TLCSM. 
94
95
The president's 2009 National Strategy for Countering Biological Threats calls for "a comprehensive and integrated approach to prevent the full spectrum of biological threats . . . whether natural, accidental or deliberate in nature." 
96
Staying ahead of the changing threat requires the DOD to refocus on the full range of biothreats and commit ample resources for the sustained development of infectious-disease-as well as biodefensevaccines. Anything less places force health, combat readiness, and operational effectiveness at serious risk. Notes 1. In thi9 paper, acquisition is defined as the DOD's process for ensuring that vaccines are acquired and maintained for the protection of its forces, from needs identification, prioritization, and basic research to advanced development, testing, production, and procurement. Availability is having on hand the right vaccine for the right threat at the right time. 
A Case Study Lt Col Michael Rafter, Canadian Forces* Throughout its history, the United States rarely shied away from using military force to confront perceived threats to its security and to support its interests abroad. The one element which sets the United States apart from virtually all other states maintaining an expeditionary military capability, particularly in the post-Cold War environment, is the scope and size of the missions and military engagements that it is capable of undertaking. This fact, combined with the reality that it must provide transparency and remain accountable, means that its actions are far more open to scrutiny and criticism from both within and without. Despite its status as the sole remaining superpower, the US government must garner the support of allies, likeminded states, and nations with which it does not traditionally align itself if its military actions are to be considered reasonable and justifiable. The key to ensuring this support is a timely provision of legitimate legal and moral justifications for war.
While it is true the executive and legislative branches of the American government have an important role to play in the approval mechanism to launch military operations, the president, as commander in chief, has the greatest overall influence on the decision-making process. This is not entirely surprising, as the president will normally be criticized when the decision to go to war is questioned. The war-making powers assigned to the president are enshrined in the US Constitution, largely "as a result of the unity of the office of the presidency . . .
[where] speedy and purposeful action is often requisite to counter moves from abroad and to deal with rapidly changing international events [and because] Congress, it is claimed, is too cumbersome and ponderous a body to meet and deal with foreign policy and foreign military complexities.'' 
1
the motivations for going to war will turn to the president for an explanation or a clarification. The ability or inability to convincingly validate the military action taken-particularly to those whose ongoing support is vital to the United States-will have an important impact on American economic, foreign, and military relations, as well as national interests. In situations where use of military force is in direct response to an attack or a verifiable and imminent threat to the United States, the case for war is often quite obvious and understandable.
When the recourse to military action is both legally and morally defensible, the likelihood of negative repercussions will be lessened. In fact, it can be argued that this capability to frame the decision in legal and ethical terms best serves the president in substantiating a military reaction to a particular situation.
Over the past century, which constitutes the period of time when the majority of US expeditionary military operations have taken place, American presidents have effectively explained the rationale for war or military activities in terms of legal and ethical considerations. In instances where the substantiation has been less credible, presidents contended with domestic and international condemnation and opposition to the use of armed force. Given the existence of established laws of armed conflict (LOAC), determinations regarding the legality of military action have proven far easier than confirming the morality of these interventions. Many presidential explanations have been more compelling when evidence confirmed that moral principles were present and played an important role in the war decision. The fact that a particular president truly believed that a moral imperative existed for war has gone a long way in deflecting criticism in the past.
Although the end of the Cold War brought an expectation that a new era of worldwide peace and cooperation would emerge, the ensuing two decades have been fraught with conflict and strife which ultimately resulted in war or warlike confrontations-many involving the US military. Though the need to defend the use of armed forces has always existed, a growing political awareness among the general population, combined with improved media coverage and near real-time communications in recent years, has made the need for legal and moral justification for military action by the commander in chief all the more important.
Examples of specific instances where presidents articulated why compelling arguments existed for international military engagements are relatively straightforward. During the 1999 air war in Kosovo, Pres. Bill Clinton clearly explained that US participation in the operation was legally justified since it equated to an intervention in an escalating humanitarian crisis and that the United States was "acting out of a 'moral imperative' to help the people of Kosovo." 
2
Pres. George W. Bush enjoyed widespread support for his decision to authorize the Southwest Asia mission, principally due to the solid legal and moral arguments in favor of the operation. Conversely, the president's failure to credibly highlight the legal and moral Justifications for the war in Iraq, despite his genuine belief the United States was morally bound to redress Saddam's mistreatment of Iraqi citizens, resulted in an unprecedented erosion of confidence in the office of the president and a suspicion of American intentions. 
3
To validate the premises proposed, a case study from the Vietnam era is elaborated upon. While both legal and moral justifications have been offered for more recent operations, they are ongoing to this day. The long-term consequences and final outcomes of the wars in both Afghanistan and Iraq have yet to be determined, making a final conclusion difficult. For this reason, this paper considers the decision by Pres. Richard Nixon to authorize the 1970 Cambodian incursion. The results of actions taken almost 40 years ago are well known and unlikely to change.
From the day the Cambodian incursion was announced, and through the intervening decades, historians, political scientists, and armchair generals have sought to rationalize and criticize Nixon's decision to authorize this operation. Few, however, have been able to place themselves in the shoes of the target of their criticisms; even fewer truly understand the context and situation at the time the decision was made. With these facts in mind and by using recognized ethical models as well as precepts related to LOAC, this paper demonstrates that from both legal and ethical perspectives, the president's actions were justi-fied. Politicians or military leaders finding themselves in comparable circumstances would approve of the president's judgment and choices, however unpopular they may have been. The paper also shows that the final findings can thereafter be applied to more contemporary situations, whether ongoing or in the future.
At the end of April 1970, American and Republic of Vietnam (RVN) forces launched a series of attacks into the territory of the officially neutral state of Cambodia. This operation-which came to be known as the Cambodian incursion-involved approximately 50,000 ground troops from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN) as well as 30,000 US Army personnel.

From a purely military standpoint, the Cambodian incursion, dubbed Operation Toan Thang 43, 8 was deemed a moderate success in that it "set the NVA [North Vietnamese Army] offensive timetable back at least a year, probably 18 months, and possibly two years." 
9
10
The legal aspects of conflicts of an international nature are unarguably complex, numerous, and multifaceted-the 1970 Cambodian incursion is no exception. Nevertheless, those who have embarked on a detailed study of Operation Toan Thang 43 have usually limited their focus to three central themes relating to the legality of the operation: the neutrality of Cambodia, the right to collective self-defense, and the constitutional powers of the US president. That many disparate experts have singled out these three facets of LOAC and American constitutional law In their examinations is no coincidence, given that they were repeatedly trumpeted by both Nixon and members of his administration as the sources from which the legitimacy of the incursion was derived.
Customary international law and LOAC are very clear regarding the concept of neutral states as well as the responsibilities of these states in ensuring neutrality is maintained in times of conflict. Specifically, duties of a neutral state include "obligations to prevent belligerents from transporting troops or supplies across neutral territory and to prevent neutral territory from being used for base camps, munitions factories, supply depots, training facilities, communications networks, or staging areas for attacks." 
11
12
Not surprisingly, the decision to question Cambodia's neutrality as a pretext to launching the operation met with some resistance by experts opposed to the incursion. Many in the media and the antiwar movement questioned the US and RVN authorities' assessment that Cambodia had forfeited its neutrality. They explained that the apparent inaction was largely due to that nation's physical inability to repel the PAVN forces rather than a conscious decision by the Sihanouk and Lon Nol governments to allow the unrestricted use of their territory. 
13
14
The second legal argument on which American officials based their decision to undertake the incursion related to the inherent right of nations, in this case the United States and the Republic of Vietnam, to practice collective self-defense. To a lesser extent, the stated principle of collective defense was also meant to include Cambodia itself, regardless of the fact that its government had not formally or directly approached the American government for military assistance. As communist forces continued to flood into Cambodia in the spring of 1970, the Lon Nol government put out a general plea for aid, and the United States answered with the incursion. Nixon argued that this indirect request further reinforced the rationale for the operation. 
15
16
17
18
In addition to the LOAC, the Nixon administratin relied on UN agreements in justifying its actions. John Lawrence Hargrove, director of studies at the American Society of International Law, explained that Article 51 of the UN Charter did not exclude, in the case of a military attack, "an exercise of the right of self-defense on the territory of a foreign state which is not itself the attacker, even without the consent of this state." 
19
The Nixon administration further tied its rationale for the incursion to the premise of collective self-defense by relying on other key aspects of the UN Charter. In particular, legal advisors cited the passages which confirmed that the "use of armed force is prohibited except . . . where the Security Council has not acted, in individual or collective self-defense against an armed attack."

Just as Nixon was accused by many of initiating an illegal military operation and overstepping his constitutional authority, so too was he criticized regarding the morality of his decision. Following his 30 April address to the nation, widespread protests and civil disobedience ensued throughout the United States. He was lambasted in the press, and the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee convened hearings where prominent American religious leaders questioned the moral leadership of the executive branch. 
26
In considering the morality of Nixon's order for US and ARVN forces to embark on Operation Toan Thang 43, a number of moral philosophies or doctrines, including variations of each, may be considered. Two of these moral theories, utilitarianism and Kantianism (or Immanuel Kant's moral theory), prove relevant in demonstrating that Nixon did act in an ethical manner by authorizing this military action.
The most logical method of determining whether the actions were ethical is to apply the principles of utilitarianism or, more precisely, a more modern form known as preference utilitarianism. The basic premise of this theory states that "the action that is best is the one that satisfies the most preferences [of individuals], either in themselves, or according to [the action's] strength or . . . order of importance." 
27
Since the beginning of the Cold War, successive American governments emphasized that the struggle against communism was a worthy moral crusade, based largely on protecting the values of democracy and freedom throughout the world. Preference utilitarianism helped validate the US predilection for a world order based on the concept of self-determination and devoid of political and military oppression. This corroboration drove many of the American leaders' decisions regarding the conduct of the war in Southeast Asia. It was therefore believed that a firm stand in Vietnam would counter "the much wider scheme of world domination by the Soviet Union and contribute to [the] larger global struggle against this new form of imperialism." 
28
29
The morality of the decision to order the incursion can also be assessed by utilizing Kant's moral theory, which posits that "an act has moral worth only if it is done with right intention or motive." 
30

33
Nixon's decision to authorize the 1970 military incursion into Cambodia was unquestionably controversial. Much of the literature written about this operation, especially in the years immediately following its completion, is critical of the rationale and explanations that Nixon and the administration provided in justifying their actions. More recent studies, however, tainted far less by the widespread antiwar sentiment that existed in the United States in the early 1970s, have provided more balanced and objective scrutiny.
Undoubtably, many will continue to believe that Nixon made the wrong decision with respect to the Cambodian problem. As is normally the case, the voices and views of the vocal minority often eclipse those of the silent majority. The final assessment about whether the Cambodian incursion, regardless of its long-term impact, was the right thing to do at the time is best summarized in a letter to the New York Times from the father of a US soldier killed in Vietnam:
Had the fathers of these young men known that this nation would countenance a sanctuary a scant 50 miles from Saigon, we would have counseled them against induction. That we did not is a burden we will always bear. A great percentage of our ground [troops] dead from 1965 to 1970 came from an enemy who with impunity was staged, trained and equipped in the Parrot's Beak of Cambodia. The perfidy ... is anything but the US bombing of the sanctuary itself. The perfidy lies in the fact that for more than four years the United States of America, without serious recorded concern, allowed her fighting men to be attacked, maimed and killed from a position which was itself privileged from either ground or air retaliation.

The actions taken by Nixon justifying the 1970 Cambodian incursion were rooted in the legal and ethical aspects of decision making. In doing so, particularly in his capacity as commander in chief, he was by no means unique. Previous presidents, as well as those following Nixon, also understood this important fact: while a decision by an American president to use military force may be permissible under international and constitutional law, that does not necessarily make it right. Equally, even if recourse to war may appear to be the right thing to do from an ethical perspective, it may not be supportable under the law. Only when a president effectively shows that he is both legally and morally justified in turning to war to address a threat to national security and national interests is he thereby more likely to avoid a tempest of criticism and a degradation in internal and external relations. Despite all of his own personal foibles and character shortcomings, Nixon understood this fact clearly and took the steps necessary to safeguard his position and reputation. Had others followed his example in more recent years, some of the criticisms aimed at certain commanders in chief and their administrations could have been avoided. 33. Nixon was repeatedly accused of misleading Americans regarding his intentions with respect to this operation. Some theorized that his actions were intended only as a face-saving measure against the bellicose North Vietnamese, who refused to consider a diplomatic settlement on US terms, and as a way of containing the feared spread of communism. It would be naive to believe that Nixon did not consider the favorable political Impact that would result from an orderly withdrawal from South Vietnam in the shortest time possible and with the fewest casualties. However, these considerations were secondary to his belief that he was doing the right thing for the country.

-Maj Gen Michael T. Flyrm, US Army "Our number one priority is the current fight, which means the fight in Central Command." said Gen Roger Brady, commander of the US Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), highlighting a major challenge facing most of today's theater component and combatant commanders.' As the United States continues to fight overseas contingency operations (OCO) in Afghanistan and Iraq, the nation's war-fighting resources remain dedicated to prevailing in today's wars.

To begin this discussion, the impact of ISR operations in USEUCOM during the 1990s is introduced, followed by national and Air Forcespecific strategies and their impact on USEUCOM's strategy of active security. The topics then turn to specific threats to US national security Interests in the USEUCOM area of responsibility (AOR), the command's responsibilities versus these threats, and USEUCOM's ability to meet its responsibilities and requirements with allocated ISR resources.
I propose a three-tiered mitigation strategy based on this information. For a long-term solution, USEUCOM ISR planners can mitigate command collection gaps through the use of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's (NATO) alliance ground surveillance (AGS) system, scheduled for delivery in 2014. As a mid-term solution, the United States would team with the Royal Air Force (RAF) to begin planning the Integration of US-purchased RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft into •Mr. Michael Ivanovsky, USAF civilian, was the essay advisor for this paper.
USEUCOM ISR collection profiles. Finally, in the near term, USEUCOM can engage with the German Air Force (GAF) to develop tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) for combined postmission processing of EuroHawk-derived signals intelligence (SIGINT) to meet command collection requirements. With most ISR assets still dedicated to supporting OCO in USCENTCOM, I contend that other theaters competing for remaining scarce ISR resources-such as USEUCOM-should develop requirements-based collection strategies that better integrate current and planned allied capabilities to offset collection shortfalls.
USEUCOM witnessed a high point of theater ISR collection operations in the 1990s due to the Balkan crises in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Kosovo. In 1995 the Bosnian civil war was in its third year; by that summer, the international community coalesced to put an end to the conflict by attempting to coerce the Bosnian Serbs to the negotiating table through an air campaign primarily targeting their heavy weapons. Operation Deliberate Force lasted from 30 August to 14 September 1995, with airborne ISR sensors playing a critical role in verifying Bosnian Serb compliance "by obtaining needed combat information in the planning, execution and combat assessment phase" of the operation.

Renewed violence in the Balkans from March to June 1999 due to the Kosovo crisis affected US ISR programs, had an impact on future ISR asset availability, and highlighted shortfalls in connecting allied ISR capabilities to the US federated intelligence architecture. In an after-action lessons learned report to Congress on Operation Allied Force, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS), Gen William L. Shelton, and Secretary of Defense (SecDef) William S. Cohen, notified Congress of the Department of Defense's (DOD) increased investments in ISR programs by approximately $2.5 billion for sensors; aircraft; and tasking, production, exploitation, and dissemination (TPED) capabilities.

Finally, the CJCS and SecDef stressed that "the Department must develop a clear policy and implementation plan to explain when and how coalition partners can be connected to US networks and how data can be shared with those partners." 
10
Unfortunately, the DOD calls for greater ISR investments, and process overhauls did not come in time to meet the challenges caused by the terror attacks of 9/11. Still reconstituting after Operation Allied Force, US ISR assets and personnel surged to meet USCENTCOM requirements during Operation Enduring Freedom in October 2001. The surge in ISR operations exceeded steady-state operating levels for service ISR assets and continues to impact the requirements of other combatant commanders (COCOM). Today, USCENTCOM collection requirements absorb the majority of US ISR assets, with other COCOM requirements met by residual US ISR assets on a shared or rotational basis.
This US ISR strategy review will not only reemphasize and highlight US priorities but also offer strategic areas where competing theaters can explore ways to leverage allied ISR capabilities to meet their needs. The 2006 national security strategy (NSS) stresses three major threats to American and allied interests: global terrorism, regional conflicts, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD).

Leveraging and expanding allied capabilities and coming to terms with efficiently managing LD/HD ISR assets are DOD-level issues. First, to address the problem of LD/HD asset management and developing an ISR strategy, the 2006 quadrennial defense review (QDR) established a joint functional component command (JFCC)-ISR under US Strategic Command to "synchronize strategy and planning and integrate all national, theater and tactical ISR capabilities." 
16
The 2010 QDR continues the trend of expanding DOD ISR capabilities through greater investments in "long-dwell unmanned aircraft systems (UAS), such as the Predator and Reaper."

At a service level, the Air Force's 2006 Security Cooperation Strategy (SCS) is in line with the DNI's vision of increased intelligence cooperation with partner nations. In fact, the SCS states that "intelligence relationships provide a means of unique access to data that the US might be otherwise unable to obtain." 
22
23
Air Force security cooperation objectives are important, but do they coincide with Air Force ISR strategy goals? A review of the service's 2008 strategy for ISR lacks any mention of partnering with al-lies, expanding allied capacity, or leveraging allied unique ISR capabilities to satisfy US national or COCOM collection requirements. This does not mean that the SCS and ISR strategies contradict each other. While there is no specific mention of partnering with allies, the Air Force's ISR strategy stresses the criticality of "global cross-domain integrated knowledge dissemination." 
24
USEUCOM's strategy of active security is fully in line with the three major threats found in the 2006 US NSS. USEUCOM's mission statement calls for maintaining ready forces for global operations, securing strategic access and global freedom of action, strengthening NATO, promoting regional stability, and countering terrorism.

NATO traditionally does not conduct its own intelligence collection. In fact, NATO's intelligence warning system (NIWS), with the NATO situation center at its hub, is primarily an analytical function that relies on information feeds from a variety of sources that include NATOreleasable messages from member states and information provided by the NATO political and military committees. This structure created a dependency on national architectures, with no ability by NATO to leverage those architectures. This offered little value-added to the nations providing the bulk of the information, that is, the United States and USEUCOM.

Mid-and near-term solutions to USEUCOM ISR collection gaps can be found in existing bilateral partnerships. Many changes are under way in the development and fielding of allied capabilities that promise to alleviate "fragile dependence." Both the UK's RAF and the Federal Republic's GAF are in the process of leveraging and procuring US ISR technologies to meet their national intelligence requirements. There is no reason why USEUCOM and USAFE should not work with our allies to fully integrate their systems into USEUCOM's ISR collection profiles and fill command collection gaps. Due to severe cost overruns of Project Helix, the replacement program for the UK's ageing Nimrod aircraft, the UK approached the United States in 2007 to inquire about procuring three RC-135 Rivet Joint aircraft. Approved by the USAF chief of staff and Congress in 2008, the United States and the UK are now engaged in an FMS contract to deliver three RC-135 SIGINT aircraft. The deputy chief of staff for ISR and the DNI describe this effort as a "win-win" for both parties and an opportunity to improve integration. 
38

In the immediate future, a near-term opportunity to overcome USEUCOM's collection capability shortfalls presents itself in the GAF's fielding of the RQ-4 Block 20 "EuroHawk" remotely piloted aircraft (RPA). After a 2003 transatlantic test flight and associated sensor demonstration from Nordholz, Germany, the GAF signed a memorandum of understanding with the DOD in May 2006 that set the parameters for proceeding with a DCS contract of five RQ-4 RPAs. 
41
42
43
One way to engage the GAF is by offering US expertise in developing TTPs for postmission processing of EuroHawk-derived SIGINT. The GAF will not be getting a turnkey system since the procurement effort is a DCS contract, consisting of the air vehicles and not the sensors (being developed by EADS). The 2003 electronics intelligence (ELIOT) sensor demonstration showed that the GAF will be faced with significant mission and postmission processing challenges as it tries to operationalize its sensor packages.
According to a GAF spokesman, we were "surprised at the huge amount of radar emitters (merchant ships, airliners) that showed up in addition to the prepared [demonstration] profile . . . the ELIOT Ground Support Station (EGSS) was quickly overwhelmed." 
44
45
This study shows that despite continued DOD investments in 1SR platforms, these capabilities will remain LD/HD assets as long as the United States is engaged in OCO with USCENTCOM. The Balkan conflicts of the 1990s proved ISR capabilities are force multipliers in the modern battlespace, prompting senior DOD leaders to take the right steps in calling for more ISR resources. These DOD leaders also acknowledged that due to the increased demand for ISR, they would be hard-pressed to field sufficient numbers of ISR assets to meet global needs. After the 9/11 attacks and the subsequent surging of ISR forces to the USCENTCOM AOR, ISR requirements from competing COCOMs could be met only through ISR rotational forces. This is still the case, causing collection gaps in all commands. National security and intelligence strategies, as well as USAF security cooperation and intelligence strategies, recognize that DOD ISR forces and capabilities are stretched thin. As this analysis demonstrates, national strategic direction provides guidance to warfighting commands to partner with allies and leverage their capabilities to help meet US national intelligence requirements. Intelligence is a field where synergistic efficiencies of cooperation can easily be achieved.
Given that President Obama's Afghanistan strategy calls for a surge In US forces and capabilities through 2011, USEUCOM must continue to look to other sources to mitigate its ISR collection gaps. In light of significant advances in allied ISR capabilities, teaming with NATO, the RAF, and the GAF presents itself as a unique opportunity for USEUCOM to bring about a revolution in intelligence sharing that could prove to be a benchmark of security cooperation success for other COCOMs to emulate. The conduct of information operations (IO) by the US military, which Includes military deception (MILDEC) and psychological operations (PSYOP), is based on doctrinal precedence and operational necessity. The Increasing use of cybertechnology and the Internet in executing IO missions offers technological advantages while simultaneously being a minefield fraught with legal and cultural challenges. Using Joint and Air Force doctrinal publications, published books, and academic papers, this thesis defines relevant terminology and identifies current operational and legal constraints In the execution of IO using cybertechnology. It concludes with recommended remediation actions to enhance the use of the Internet as a military IO tool in today's cyber world.
According to Joint Publication (JP) 3-13, Information Operations, IO Is "integral to the successful execution of military operations. A key goal of IO is to achieve and maintain information superiority for the US and its allies ... [in order] to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own."

According to JP 3-13.4, Military Deception, short of perfidy, the intent of MILDEC is the execution of actions "to deliberately mislead adversary decision makers as to friendly military capabilities, intentions, and operations."

Propaganda is "a form of communication aimed at influencing the attitude of a community toward some cause or position." 
8
Where PSYOP and propaganda are communications directed at foreign audiences, military PA offices provide similar information to journalists and the American public to articulate DOD positions on policies and operations. The same principles based upon the freedom of the press that guide civilian journalists also guide the activities of PA professionals. Military PA responsibilities are captured in JP 3-61, Public Affairs-"providing truthful, accurate and timely information ... to keep the public informed about the military's missions and operations, countering adversary propaganda, deterring adversary actions, and maintain[ing] trust and confidence of the US population, and our friends and allies."

Increasingly, the use of the cyber domain is being actively researched and exploited by the United States and its adversaries to conduct influence operations via cell phone, e-mail, text message, and blogs in both peacetime and combat environments. The cyber world will progressively become both a boon and a bane to IO personnel, allowing a global audience reach but providing a large vulnerability to enemy deception and PSYOP efforts requiring a near immediate response to worldwide operational events.
While traditional forms of MILDEC-operational feints, displays, or instances of camouflage and concealment-are increasingly negated by advancements in intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technology that quickly uncover the deception, cybertechnology has brought a new generation of MILDEC options to military planners. 
12
Ubiquitous Internet availability and the global use of cell phones present new opportunities for PSYOP efforts. The proliferation of cell phone ring tones offers options for embarrassment or message delivery.

The traditional airborne psychological leaflet has been modernized by an Internet version called an "E-flet," and the loudspeaker is being superseded by text messages delivered to cell phones and called the "silent loudspeaker." 
15
16
Web sites like You.Tu.be and other social networking sites have become a battleground for "a global audience to share firsthand reports, military strategies, propaganda videos, and personal conflict as it unfolds." 
17
One method to fight foreign propaganda and lies is for the United States to use a blog or Web site in native languages to educate foreign citizens on political issues and to influence attitudes and advance education on a topic area. For example, if a country holds a constitutional referendum to do away with presidential term limits and the incumbent president is not a US ally, the United States could use the Internet to educate the citizens about the significance and impact of the referendum prior to the vote. Another example is "alert" software, such as "Megaphone," that notifies a special interest group about chat rooms or Internet polls that are counter to their special interest. This alert enables a counterpropaganda response and offers alternate or contradictory views. 
18
While the lanes in the road between MILDEC, PSYOP, and PA seem clear cut in doctrine and theory, cyber operations have blurred the lines between operational missions and authorities due to outdated US laws, Internet technology, global media, and transnational threats. Seven challenges highlight conflicts and uncharted cyber areas in IO that must be addressed if the United States' national defense is not to be left vulnerable, both legally and defensively. If these areas are not addressed, the United States risks not only the ability to conduct effective cyber-related influence operations but also the capability to effectively employ military instruments of power throughout the range of operations from peacetime to wartime and defend against the same.
The American public plays a large role, both directly and indirectly, in the arena of influence operations. Doctrinally, "MILDEC operations must not intentionally target or mislead the US public, the US Congress, or the US news media."

In June 2007, the deputy secretary of defense (DEPSECDEF) issued a "Policy for Department of Defense (DOD) Interactive Internet Activities" memo authorizing the geographic combatant commands to provide information to foreign audiences via two-way communications-e-mail, blogs, chat rooms, and Internet bulletin boards.

Related to the discussion of geographic COCOM and DOS responsibilities are the legal boundaries in the conduct of US propaganda instituted by the Smith-Mundt Act. Passed in 1948, the US Information and Education Exchange Act, also known as Smith-Mundt, was enacted to counter the worldwide communist propaganda being released by the Soviet Union during the Cold War era. The Act's principles are timeless: tell the truth; explain the motives of the United States; bolster morale and extend hope; give a true and convincing picture of American life, methods and ideals; combat misrepresentation and distortion; and aggressively interpret and support American foreign policy." 
29
30
31
With the collapse of the Soviet Union and the worldwide communist threat, as well as the shrinking of the world due to the cyber age, a number of Smith-Mundt constraints have outlived their usefulness. First, the Smith-Mundt Act restrictions only cover the current DOS activities previously conducted by USIA, and not those of the entire US government. A 2006 legal review requested by the Defense Policy Analysis Office concluded that "the Act does not apply to the Defense Department." 
32
33
Finally, the ability of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and US Northern Command to counter radical ideological products of terrorists, foreign and domestic, requires US truthful information developed by the DOS to be made available. For example, a Minneapolis, Minnesota, community radio station requested permission to rebroadcast a VOA news show that targeted Somalians. The intent was to "offer an informative, Somali-language alternative to the terrorist propaganda that [was] streaming into Minneapolis," home of the largest Somali community in the United States. 
34
While Smith-Mundt prohibits dissemination of US influence information to American citizens, no corresponding law prohibits foreign nations or organizations from targeting US citizens with propaganda and/or deception. The lack of public awareness of this threat and the proliferation of cheap means for global message distribution leave the US public vulnerable to influence operations (propaganda) and deception by adversaries and other nations. This can include altered imagery, intentional falsehoods, and planted rumors. Some modern examples of influence operations against the US public include the Soviet KGB spreading "bogus stories linking the United States to the creation of HIV/AIDS . . . and [accusing the United States of) employing a Korean civilian airliner as a reconnaissance aircraft over the Kamchatka peninsula. [Additionally], John Kerry appeared in an al-tered image seated near Jane Fonda at an anti-Vietnam War rally." 
35
36
It seems that the modern usage of the terms propaganda and psychological operations is generally viewed by Americans as pejorative in nature, in spite of the fact that conventional military IO missions are truthful and accurate. As Hubert H. Humphrey once said, "In real life, unlike in Shakespeare, the sweetness of the rose depends upon the name it bears. Things are not only what they are. They are, in very important respects, what they seem to be." 
37
That the United States has no peer competitor in conventional war fighting is not in question. However, the use of nonconventional, asymmetric techniques, particularly those enabled by the Internet, allows nonpeer competitor nation-states and nonnation-state actors a strategic equivalence or an advantage not found in conventional settings. During past conventional conflicts, the US military PA structure could effectively manage the information released to the public by civilian combat newsmen, protecting operations and personnel. However, today's technology, such as the cell phone, enables everyone the "capability to transmit audio, video and photographs . . .
[and] such contributions from the street carry their own form of psychological persuasion."

With the growing dependence on the use of interconnected networks to function in an e-commerce society, cyber weapons are rapidly becoming the "nuclear weapon" of the millennial age. In the past, nuclear weapons were considered the ultimate deterrent and battlefield equalizer, which prompted the creation of international controls on development and possession of such technology. Fortunately, the cost of a nuclear weapons program was prohibitive to all but a handful of sovereign nations. But cybertechnology is inexpensive, easy to obtain, and ubiquitous, thus offering an asymmetric advantage to adversaries, state sponsored and otherwise, to conduct "quite literally, war on the cheap."

The 1907 Hague Convention requires combatant nations to recognize the rights of neutral nations and that the territory of a neutral nation is inviolable by combatant nations. 
42
Specifically, the Hague Convention states that, "belligerents may not move forces, weapons, or war materiel across a neutral country's territory, or conduct hostilities within a neutral's territory, waters, or airspace. A neutral nation jeopardizes its status if it permits belligerents to engage in such violations." 
43
During the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah conflict, Israel bombed the Al-Manar facilities in Lebanon prompting Al-Manar (an organization outlawed in the United States due to its jihadist activities) to rehost its operations on an Austin, Texas-based server owned by Broadwing Communications. 
44
Another example of Internet rehosting by a belligerent took place in July 2008 in the cyber portion of the conflict between Russia and Georgia. When the Georgian government's Internet capabilities were rendered virtually nonfunctional by a Russian denial of service attack. Tulip Systems, a US Internet hosting company in Atlanta, "contacted [the] Georgian government officials and offered assistance in reconstituting Georgian Internet capabilities." 
45
Another gray area in the realm of cyber neutrality deals with influence operations and the release of E-flets, text messages, or deception efforts (such as altering the contents of a Web site) that involve crossing sovereign borders with respect to physical infrastructure. Similar to the conventions limiting belligerents' use of radio towers and broadcast equipment in neutral countries, does the execution of a cyber mission traveling across a neutral country's web infrastructure violate international neutrality laws? The neutrality laws must be modernized or the negative impact to the DOD is obvious.
The breadth of questions raised by the use of cybertechnology in the prosecution of influence operations requires further investigation and correction. To deal with the challenges discussed in the previous section, the following represent some suggested remediation efforts.
As a public service, DHS needs to develop and implement an IO education campaign to develop critical thinking skills to assist the American public in identifying foreign propaganda and deception encountered on the Internet and in cyber media. Additionally, busi-ness owners of Internet servers would receive education on how their actions in hosting or assisting corporations or nations in countries under cyber attack could put the United States in jeopardy of losing its neutral status and unintentionally becoming a warring party within a conflict.
The DOD must determine whether new legal authorities to undertake Internet-based communications and Web site interactions with foreign audiences are required, as directed by secretary of defense policy letters of 2007. Regardless, the DOD must inform Congress of its public diplomacy (vice PSYOP) efforts and may even need to leave public diplomacy responsibilities to the DOS.

Assuming all of the previous challenges are addressed and resolved, the following example summarizes how the military commander can benefit from information operations in the cyber age. The examples use radical Islamic extremists as the notional enemy.
As radical Islam extremists expertly use the Internet and global media to publicize and advance their propaganda and lies, an educated American civilian and military population can recognize misinformation and deception using critical thinking skills, asking hard questions, and seeking alternate or corroborating sources of information before making judgments or believing the foreign stories. With a Smith-Mundt Act modification, DHS, in conjunction with the Northern Command, can provide a direct counterinformation campaign within US borders via the Internet, radio, and television (in English and other foreign languages). This campaign will reduce the domestic threat from misinformed potential terrorist recruits living in the United States.
Once cyber TTPs are codified and a well trained cadre of military professionals developed, the combatant commander will be able to informationally bombard Islamic terrorists and their potential supporters by sending precision-guided messages to specific cell towers, cell phones, e-mail, or Web sites as part of a public diplomacy or CYOP effort. 
54
Once international norms are established for cyber-based laws of armed conflict, commanders will better understand legal boundaries to recognizing, initiating, and defending against cyber warfare. This, in turn, leaves a training and education task for both the military professionals and the American information technology public. But, until those norms are codified, the United States is at risk of unintentionally becoming a belligerent in other countries' conflicts, having our military and civilian cyber professionals unwittingly held liable under the international court of justice or not recognizing that a cyber war attack has taken place against our nation, thus forfeiting our opportunity for a prompt and appropriate response.
The remediation actions and operational examples outlined in this thesis are not exhaustive and still leave a large gray area in the realm of influence operations and the use of cybertechnology. They do represent a start, however, in identifying doctrinal gaps, outdated legal roadblocks, and deficiencies in policies, laws, and education. The United States must "amend existing policies to allow [Influence operations] to embrace the range of contemporary media ... as an integral asset" to military operations.

Change in the Arctic Lt Col Lars Helmrich, Swedish Air Force* Historically, dramatic changes in strategic geography have had a big impact on international relations, as illustrated by the discovery of America and the building of the Panama and Suez Canals. Today the warming climate is changing the strategic geography in the Arctic. The ice coverage is decreasing, which makes shipping possible and increases the possibility of extracting natural resources. Hence, the strategic importance of the Arctic is increasing.' This essay discusses the strategic impact of environmental change in the Arctic. The purpose is to explore how this change affects US national security and to suggest a future US policy in the region.
The existing academic analyses concerning US climate policy and Arctic policy generally propose increased international cooperation. However, the existing international framework for the Arctic is disputed and is not ratified by the United States. Moreover, the actions of countries in the Arctic suggest, contrary to their stated policies, a desire to unilaterally maximize their own economic gain. The United States does not have a well-developed Arctic policy. This essay suggests that the United States first ratify the United Nations (UN) Convention of the Law of the Sea. Then it needs to negotiate, bilaterally, agreements regarding the extent of the Arctic countries' exclusive economic zones (EEZ). To be successful, the United States should broaden these negotiations to include other areas of policy. The suggested policy does not seek to maximize the US EEZ; rather the objective is to reach a peaceful agreement with a positive effect on the world economy, while at the same time strengthening US strategic leadership.
The essay starts with a brief summary of environmental change in the Arctic and how that affects the strategic situation. Thereafter, it presents a synopsis of academic recommendations concerning US policy. This section is followed by an analysis of the current situation in the Arctic, pertaining to the status of international cooperation and the actions of involved countries. The fourth part covers US policywhat it is now and what It should be in the future.
•Dr. Christopher Hemmer. USAF civilian, was the essay advisor for this paper.
Climate change in the Arctic is fundamentally altering the region's strategic importance. Increased accessibility, due to decreased ice coverage, leads to new possibilities for shipping and extraction of natural resources. For some time, the debate about whether the climate is changing has been decided. Currently, the debate concerns its implications, among which are those that affect international security. This is evident from President Obama's speech at the UN General Assembly on 23 September 2009: The danger posed by climate change cannot be denied. Our responsibility to meet it must not be deferred. If we continue down our current course, every member of this Assembly will see irreversible changes within their borders. Our efforts to end conflicts will be eclipsed by wars over refugees and resources."

The actors in the Arctic consist of international agreements/institutions and states. Those discussed here are the UN Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), the Arctic Council, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the Seabed Arms Control Treaty, and the Arctic countries. For brevity's sake, this essay will analyze only the Arctic countries of Russia, Canada, Denmark, Norway, and the United States. Based upon tradition and geography, I deem these countries most important. The United States is discussed in a separate section.
The UNCLOS was established on 10 December 1982 after 14 years of work involving more than 150 countries. It entered into force on 16 November 1994. The UNCLOS establishes rules concerning use of the oceans and extraction of their resources, as well as serving as a legal framework for dispute resolution. The UNCLOS defines a state's EEZ, in which it has the sovereign right to extract natural resources, as an area within 200 nautical miles (nm) of its baseline. 
23
Of the Arctic countries, the United States is the only one that has not ratified the UNCLOS. 
24
25
The main purpose of the Arctic Council is to maintain peace and stability in the Arctic. The council was established in 1996, and today all of the Arctic countries are members. Besides nations, several organizations of indigenous Arctic populations are included as permanent participants in the council. The Arctic Council does not handle matters associated with military security. Instead, it contributes to peace and stability by addressing issues such as living conditions, sustainable development, and environmental protection. However, according to its chairman Lars Moller, the Arctic Council together with the UNCLOS can be viewed as the main framework within which security-related issues can be dealt with.

So in a region that is changing and increasing in importance, there are conflicting interests, demonstrated national resolve, little historical guidance, and an impotent international framework. The framework that does exist is being used to promote national interests. Furthermore, the discussion above suggests that unfavorable recommendations by the UNCLOS and CLCS will not be easily accepted. With this conclusion in mind, the next section analyzes US Arctic policy.
There are not many official documents concerning US Arctic policy. The 2002 and 2006 national security strategies and the 2008 national defense strategy do not include any specific US policy in the region. The White House Web site concerning foreign policy discusses a number of issues and identifies climate change as one of several distinct challenges but does not include a specific Arctic policy.

In contrast to other countries, the United States does not have a highly developed Arctic policy and is not a member of the most important international institution concerning the Arctic, the UNCLOS. The directive that does exist is a legacy from former president George W. Bush.
The Arctic policy of the Obama administration should be shaped by overall US interests and the larger context for the policy. Although the new administration has yet to publish a national security strategy, US overall interests can be described as a combination of long-and short-term objectives. The long-term objectives concern the United States' role in the world and its perception in the international community. It is obvious that President Obama strives for a change in strategic leadership. The emphasis when interacting with other nations is on multilateral cooperation. The administration's preferred leadership style appears to be more persuasive than coercive and more inclusive than exclusive. 
58
The short-term objectives encompass avoiding military conflict as well as denying any other country dominance of the Arctic. From an economic perspective, US interests can be described as maximizing its access to natural resources and securing the access of new shipping routes. But solving the disputed issues may be more impor-tant, and even more profitable, than maximizing the extent of the US continental shelf. Ensuring that available resources and shortened shipping routes benefit the world economy may be the true economic interest.
Besides considering US objectives, US Arctic policy must address recent and likely future developments in the region. A decrease in the Arctic ice cap will make new sea routes available and permit extraction of more natural resources. Since climate change is likely to increase instability in the Middle East, the strategic significance of the Arctic will grow, resulting in greater commercial as well as military activity in the region. The key strategic challenges are to settle the dispute concerning the EEZs and, to a lesser degree, the control over new shipping routes. It may be tempting to pursue a policy similar to that of other Arctic countries: to ratify the UNCLOS and then file US territorial claims. However, that would not bring the issue closer to a solution. Another possibility may be an international conference to reach an agreement concerning the continental shelf. Because of conflicting interests, this approach is unlikely to succeed. But it is possible to formulate a policy that creates synergy by combining the objective of increasing the credibility of US strategic leadership with securing economic gain and a peaceful development in the Arctic. Actually, this opportunity exists because of the conflicting national interests and the uncertain significance of the international framework. It combines multi-and bilateral initiatives within the existing international framework.
My suggestion for US Arctic policy encompasses broadening the issue to other areas and contains activities at several different levels. First, the foundation of the policy is the UNCLOS; it needs to be ratified by Congress. To convince the Senate, President Obama needs to invest political will in the issue and compromise in other areas. Next, it is highly unlikely that the concerned nations in the near future will be able to agree upon a solution about the continental shelf. Therefore, the US Geological Survey should be tasked to make an overall, and objective, recommendation about the continental shelf issue. The recommendation should be used as a starting point in bilateral negotiations with Russia, Canada, Denmark, and Norway to reach an agreement.
The United States must add other issues to the discussions, issues that may differ depending on the counterpart. Introducing the issue of control of shipping routes as well as other economic and military/ security instruments of national power to the discussion can help the parties reach compromises. With Norway and Denmark, the United States could inject security and foreign military sales issues in the discussion-for example, the condition for purchase of the joint strike fighter. In negotiations with Russia, the strategy versus Iran, cooperation in the conflict against Islamic fundamentalist groups, and NATO's missile defense system are possible issues to discuss. With Canada, control of the Northwest Passage and trade issues may be included in negotiations. The United States can then submit a final compromise multilaterally to the UNCLOS and CLCS. Additionally, a securityrelated treaty similar to the Antarctic Treaty should be initiated.
From a military perspective, the division of the Arctic among several combatant commanders is not preferable. The commander of the US Northern Command should be responsible for the Arctic area north of each Arctic country's 200-nm zone. Such a change would facilitate coordination of the national instruments of power. From the United States' perspective, the suggested policy would probably not maximize the extension of its continental shelf, a stated goal in NSPD-66. However, it would strengthen US strategic leadership, have a positive effect on the world economy, and promote peaceful development in the Arctic region. Hence, the suggested policy accommodates both the long-and short-term objectives concerning US interests. If the policy is wisely introduced in a strategic communications context, its outcome may be further enhanced.
History has shown that strategic geography influences international relations. For example, the United States has frequently used military means to demonstrate its interests in the Panama Canal, and in 1956 the Suez Canal was the scene of armed conflict involving two of the great powers: Great Britain and France. It is obvious that the European discovery of America-with the ensuing competition for America's resources and the eventual birth of a superpower-has affected greatpower politics ever since. I do not suggest that these examples are perfect analogies. However, they do illustrate that important sea routes as well as disputed rights to natural resources can play an important part in international politics. A dramatic environmental change in the Arctic may cause serious competition over resources and affect international security.
The Arctic has some very specific characteristics. Most of its territory is neither a continent nor an island; hence, it does not and cannot have a tradition of ordinary human settlement. It has an inhospitable climate and was until recentiy extremely difficult to access. The shrinking Arctic ice cap will open new sea routes and permit increased extraction of natural resources. Therefore, the strategic sig-nificance of the Arctic is increasing. The international framework that does exist is not sufficient. At the same time, several nations' actions imply a risk of increased tension concerning unresolved issues about the right to resources. The key strategic challenge for the United States is to settle the dispute concerning the EEZs, while at the same time protecting overall US interests. The suggested US policy would enhance its credibility as the world's strategic leader and encourage development of the world economy. Hence, it meets the nation's longand short-term objectives.
Lt Col David J. Baylor, USAF* On 5 April 2009 in Prague, Czech Republic, President Obama committed the United States to seeking "the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons."

To start our examination of these players in the new world of everdeeper cuts, we will first look at those countries currently possessing nuclear weapons. Only five recognized nuclear weapons nations have signed and ratified the NPT: the United States, Russia, China, France, and Great Britain. Russia, with its large nuclear arsenal, possesses the greatest potential threat to US national security.

India currently maintains an arsenal estimated at approximately 60-70 tactical nuclear weapons delivered by aircraft along with shortand medium-range missiles.

Pakistan is estimated to possess 60 tactical nuclear weapons along with enough plutonium and highly enriched uranium to produce 40 more. 
29
30
North Korea has twice demonstrated the ability to detonate a nuclear weapon while it refines its ICBM capabilities. Iran, already with a proven short-and medium-range missile capability, continues to defy UN mandates as it develops its uranium enrichment technologies. Israel has chosen a nondeclaratory policy toward nuclear weapons, but some analysts estimate that Israel maintains approximately 100 nuclear warheads. 
31
For example. North Korea's nuclear ambitions affect the Republic of Korea and Japan. These are two of 30-plus countries under the United States' nuclear umbrella.

While prestige is a factor to consider, ironically, democracy will add one of the biggest unknown variables to all future negotiations. With elections held at periodic intervals throughout the various democratic countries around the world, internal politics of the moment can almost instantly change the direction that country takes concerning nuclear weapons. Some examples include the US election with the change in direction between the Bush and Obama administrations. The various NATO allies can easily change their stance on nuclear weapons and forward deployment of US nuclear weapons within their countries. The recent Japanese election demonstrates how an administration can take a significantly different approach to nuclear weapons, as demonstrated by their recently launched probe into reported "secret nuclear pacts" with the United States. 
35
Another potential problem is that verification of compliance by nine to 10 different nuclear-armed countries will slow the progress and complicate nuclear disarmament talks. Current bilateral US and Russian negotiations have yielded an accepted inspection protocol that works in the current negotiation environment. However, future multinational negotiations may present numerous new questions:
• Can 10 different states agree upon a rigorous and adequate verification regime?
• What kind of international inspectorate can be formed?
• Will each state be willing to open its country to adequate types of inspections?
• What is the role that the UN will play in treaty execution?
• How does the United States manage and verify stockpiles to ensure other nuclear states do not reweaponize?
• How do we prevent countries from nuclear weapons breakouts from their treaty obligations and, thereby, gaining strategic advantages denied to others?
• As we disarm further, can we ensure the protection to our allies currently under our nuclear umbrella?
• Will these countries pursue their own nuclear weapons as the US nuclear force shrinks?
• Will their foreign policies change in favor of nuclear neighbors, making us less secure?
• Is there some alternative other than nuclear protection that the United States can substitute?
This discussion identifies some of the players and future questions that must be considered in forging new nuclear arms reduction agreements, along with the dynamics in play within and among these nations. It is easy to understand why President Obama does not see a world free of nuclear weapons as happening within his lifetime. With the rapid spread of nuclear energy and weapons technology, we are about to enter a new world of arms negotiations much different from those we have practiced with the Russians. What this means is that we may be on a path to reduce our weapons and delivery systems to numbers closer to other nuclear-armed countries around the world in the next decade or so. If this happens, we will then enter a period in history with multiple countries possessing relatively equal numbers of nuclear weapons, while others still seek to acquire nuclear weapons.
When we negotiate with these multiple nuclear powers in the future in bringing our warhead numbers below 1,000 to around 500, we will be negotiating less from the position of superior numbers and relative strength and more from relative parity. This will require a dramatic shift in our national security outlook. Indeed, should such deep cuts be taken, we will have fewer warheads and delivery vehicles than we have had since the 1950s, and more countries will possess or be seeking to acquire nuclear weapons.
While most other nuclear nations around the world are upgrading their delivery systems and replacing their old warheads, the United States has placed a self-imposed freeze on the replacement of our nuclear stockpile.

While the United States and Russia have their understanding and definition of strategic nuclear weapons worked out by negotiations, it is difficult for most countries in Europe and Asia to distinguish between Russia's strategic and tactical nuclear weapons. To countries like Estonia, South Korea, or Japan, one low-yield "tactical" nuclear weapon delivered by a missile or fighter aircraft would have devastating strategic implications.
These tactical nuclear weapons present additional challenges to negotiations and proliferation. First, tactical nuclear weapons are, on average, smaller than strategic weapons. Yields can vary anywhere from subkiloton to the strength of a strategic nuclear weapon. Smaller-sized weapons present multiple challenges. First, these weapons are easier to hide, complicating verification of treaty limits. In addition, unlike a bomber, ICBM, or SLBM force, tactical nuclear weapons are easily moved, contributing to counting and verification problems. Finally, the relatively low yield of some of these weapons may increase the likelihood of use in certain crisis contingencies. In some cases, this can improve deterrence effects versus an adversary but also might tempt decision makers to use them more readily. These tactical nuclear weapons spread around the world will put the United States in a difficult strategic position. If moved forward nearer the United States either clandestinely or on mobile platforms, these "tactical" weapons could become "strategic."
As START Follow-on Treaty negotiations continue and as we strive for a nuclear-free world in perpetuity, the United States will find itself in a unique situation. Unlike Russia and China who have chosen to modernize their nuclear arsenals, or countries like India. Pakistan, and Iran who have recently developed or are developing new weapons, the United States has chosen a path of "life extension" for its weapons. 
42
43
First, as we move below 1,000 strategic warheads and toward 500 or fewer delivery systems, the Department of Defense will be forced to make difficult force structure decisions. 
44
45
46
Unfortunately, the Air Force, as has been documented in several recent studies, for a time had neglected its maintenance, security, funding, and advocacy for nuclear weapons, thereby somewhat eroding its ability to carry out its mission of strategic deterrence. 
47
48
This loss of mission focus may regrettably cause the Air Force to lose much of the nuclear mission it fought the Navy so hard for. 
49
Recent revitalization of the nuclear enterprise is not limited to the bomber force; it also includes the ICBM career field. As the Air Force strives to provide those who work with ICBMs a sense of purpose and mission in a post-Cold War era, it will be faced with increased reductions, as the ICBMs will be the second most likely delivery system in the US nuclear arsenal to be reduced, if not eliminated.
These reductions in USAF resources and missions, if taken, would exacerbate the nuclear culture problems it currently faces. With fewer nuclear billets in the Air Force at fewer locations, there would be an even smaller numbers of officers and senior noncommissioned officers to call upon to fill important command-and-control and critical nuclear-related staff and leadership positions. With a continued decrease in emphasis within the Air Force on the nuclear mission, it would be even more difficult to draw the best and brightest young Airmen into this dying career field, causing many to pursue other career opportunities. On the other hand, while it looks like there may be a reduction in Air Force strategic nuclear weapon delivery systems, there may be an associated increase in the deterrence role for the Air Force's fighter community.
To maintain some semblance of a triad to provide the necessary deterrence effects and security for our allies, the fighter community could ultimately pick up more of the aircraft nuclear weapons deliv-ery mission formerly provided by heavy bombers. With the new Joint Strike Fighter becoming the Air Force's weapons system of choice, its mandated nuclear weapons delivery capability will be a vital part of its mission. 
50

F-35s picking up the nuclear deterrence role from the bombers will present its own set of problems to the Air Force. Tactical nuclear weapons may not be regularly deployed to Asia and Europe due to the constantly changing political environments. However, if F-35s are to play a nuclear deterrent role, it would be wise to continue to deploy most of the estimated 200-350 forward-based nuclear bombs and air-to-ground missiles in NATO countries (see table l). 
51
In April 2009, President Obama set the nation on the path toward the eventual long-term goal of zero nuclear weapons. Nuclear disarmament has been a worldwide goal since the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty was opened for signature in 1970. Over the years, states have taken numerous positive steps toward that end. Now the United States finds itself in negotiations with Russia to further reduce our nuclear arsenal. Perhaps in later rounds, after the current START Follow-on negotiations, the sides may agree to levels below 1,000 warheads. Once we cross the 1,000 threshold, we will be entering a new, more complicated world of nuclear arms negotiations.
As previously noted, it will take time to understand the different players, motives, and issues that each of the new players brings to the negotiation table. The challenge is to coordinate the step-bystep disarmament of the nine current members of the nuclear weapons state club while simultaneously attempting to persuade others from "going nuclear." New challenges on the path to zero may emerge as allied nations consider acquiring nuclear weapons to make up for a perceived loss of US umbrella protection or as other nations see an opportunity to increase their relative military/ political power and prestige.
To counter these unintended consequences, it is important to bring into negotiations all of the world's nuclear-armed nations as soon as possible. However, even if we were to bring all other nuclear-armed nations into negotiations today, it would likely be a long time, if ever, before all parties would be able to agree on total disarmament or even on the next steps to be taken. During this protracted period of negotiations, we are going to find ourselves in a world with a group of countries that posses a relatively large and growing number of nuclear weapons.
The preponderance of weapons in this new environment will be socalled nonstrategic nuclear weapons, which will present a different dimension to our national security posture and force structure. The United States will have to make some tough choices as negotiations further limit delivery vehicles and warheads. With the most likely losses to the strategic retaliatory forces being first the bombers and then, possibly later, a reduction of ICBMs, the Air Force will need to focus more on its tactical nuclear mission. This proposed shift to tactical nukes would have a dramatic impact on the Air Force's efforts to reinvigorate its nuclear enterprise.
As the Air Force endeavors to recapture the pride and discipline of Strategic Air Command (SAC) without actually resurrecting SAC, it will be faced with the additional challenges of a nuclear force structure so small that it will be even more difficult to maintain and inspire those to join and work with high energy and commitment. In addition, if the United States shifts to F-35s as the foundation of its nuclear airborne arsenal, the service will experience a cultural shift among aircrews as fighter pilots more fully join the nuclear enterprise by taking on the traditional role of the bombers.
The United States is committed to a path of a nuclear-free world. Meanwhile, the Air Force is committed to reinvigorating its nuclear enterprise. The first is a noble goal fraught with unknown challenges, numerous new actors, and dynamics that will yield surprises. The latter will reinvigorate the USAF nuclear force while simultaneously downsizing that arsenal, reducing the role of nuclear weapons in the US national security strategy. This downsizing may ultimately result in a shift of focus on the Air Force's nuclear deterrence role from the strategic bomber community to tactical fighters.
Col Carl E. Schaefer, USAF*
In 1981 the Air Force completed the requirements for the Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF) and began the longest fighter aircraft acquisition program in history. The ATF was to replace the F-15, 13 years old at the time, and counter the proliferation of Soviet Su-27 advanced fighter planes. Ten years later, in 1991, Lockheed's ATF prototype, the YF-22, won the flyoff competition against Northrop Grumman's YF-23. The initial program called for 750 F-22s to be Initial Operational Capable (IOC) in 1995.' Following the flyoff and 14 more years of development, the F-22A became IOC with 12 aircraft in December 2005, 10 years later than desired. Twenty-four years of acquisition developed the most capable and complex fighter in the world, but the schedule and cost overruns contributed to the Air Force being authorized to procure 187 of the 750 required to replace the F-15.
Almost 25 years after the initial ATF requirements, Marine commanders developed the requirements for the mine-resistant ambush protected (MRAP) vehicle in 2005.

Currently, each service and combatant command (COCOM) has its own rapid acquisition process. The Defense Science Board (DSB) completed a study in July 2009 which states, "Current approaches to implement rapid responses to urgent needs were found to be unsustainable, and institutional barriers-people, funding, and processes-•Col Norman Potter. USAF. was the essay advisor for this paper.
are power inhibitors to successful rapid acquisition and fielding of new capabilities."

When people think of DOD acquisition processes, they are generally thinking about deliberate acquisition. Programs like the B-2, F-22, F-35, and the Army's Future Combat System come to mind. These large programs take years and billions of dollars to develop. Many don't survive the cost overruns and schedule delays associated with these programs. In May 2009, Defense Secretary Robert Gates announced the cancellation of the VH-71 presidential helicopter, the Air Force Combat Search and Rescue X program, ground components of the Future Combat System, and missile defense's multiple kill vehicle.

Deliberate acquisition is governed by the Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System (JCIDS) for requirements; the DOD 5000-series of regulations for acquisition guidance; and the Plan-ning, Programming. Budgeting, and Execution (PPBE) for funding.

In 1987 SOCOM was established to "oversee the training, doctrine, and equipping of all U.S. Special Operations Forces."

15
There are over 20 different urgent needs processes throughout the DOD, Joint Staff, COCOMs, and services. 
16
Joint rapid acquisition is centered on fulfilling a combatant commander's joint urgent operational need (JUON). A JUON addresses "urgent operational needs that: (1) fall outside of the established Service processes; and (2) most importantly, if not addressed immediately, will seriously endanger personnel or pose a major threat to ongoing operations."

21
22
The core of the Army's rapid acquisition process is the operational needs statement (ONS) process and the Rapid Equipping Force (REF). Army field commanders and combatant commanders submit an ONS to fulfill an "urgent need for a materiel solution to correct a deficiency or to improve a capability that impacts upon mission accomplishment." 
23
24
25
The Army G3 {Operations Branch) runs the REF process, and the Army vice chief of staff normally approves solutions. Commercial offthe-shelf (COTS) solutions generally take three to six months to field, whereas new technology may take 12-18 months. 
26
27
The Rapid Response Process (RRP) is the Air Force's rapid acquisition method, detailed in Air Force Instruction (AFI) 63-114, 12 June 2008. The RRP begins when a major command or COCOM identifies an urgent operational need (UON). The requirements of the UON are normally documented in a combat capability document and submitted to the assistant secretary of the Air Force for acquisition (SAF/ AQX), the focal point for the RRP. No specific funding exists for the RRP; SAF/AQX recommends sources, and the chief of staff, US Air Force (CSAF), approves them. 
28
29
The Urgent Needs Process (UNP) is the Navy's rapid acquisition system, outlined in Secretary of the Navy Notice (SECNAVNOTE) 5000, 12 March 2009. A combatant. Navy, or Marine commander identifies an urgent need, defined as "an exceptional request ... for an additional warfighting capability critically needed by operating forces conducting combat or contingency operations. Failure to deliver the capability requested is likely to result in the inability of units to accomplish their missions or increases the probability of casualties and loss of life." 
30
31
SOCOM's rapid acquisition process consists of the Special Operations Forces Capabilities Integration and Development System-Urgent (SOFCIDS-U). As described earlier, SOCOM is unique among COCOMs because Congress has granted it the ability to acquire its own solution to meet war fighter needs. SOCOM's rapid acquisition process is governed by USSOCOM Directive 71 -4, Special Operations Forces Capabilities Integration and Development System, which states that "SOFCIDS-U may be used when a SOF unit, either deployed or during pre-deployment, identifies an urgent and compelling capability gap or requirement derived from combat survivability deficiency or risk to op-eratlonal success." 32 SOFCIDS-U is initiated through the chain of command by a combat mission needs statement (CMNS). The CMNS process is well denned in USSOCOM Directive 71-4 and consists of denning the capability gap, environment, material approach, concept of operations, and an analysis summary. Once the CMNS is submitted, the SOCOM J-8 convenes a rapid response team (RRT) within 24 hours.

The table below summarizes the numerous joint. Army. Air Force, Navy, and SOCOM rapid acquisition processes: 
Only five of the more than 20 rapid acquisition processes have been discussed in this paper. As shown, there are numerous documents, timelines, definitions, approval authorities, and funding sources for rapid acquisition. In response to the numerous processes, the undersecretary of defense for acquisition, technology, and logistics directed the DSB to study the situation and present recommendations. In July 2009, the DSB published the study Fulfillment of Urgent Operational Needs. The DSB makes five specific recommendations for the DOD rapid acquisition process:
1. The Secretary of Defense should formalize a dual acquisition path (deliberate and rapid).
2. Executive and legislative branches must establish a fund for rapid acquisition and fielding.
3. The Secretary of Defense should establish a new agency: the Rapid Acquisition and Fielding Agency (RAFA).
4. Initial funding and billets for RAFA will be based on absorbing and Integrating existing programs and organizations.
5. DOD should establish a streamlined, integrated approach for rapid acquisition. 
36
37
38
This discussion supports the first half of my recommendation: SOCOM's rapid acquisition process offers a rapid acquisition benchmark that should be adopted throughout the military. SOCOM's SOFCID-U process stands out for one main reason: results. Based on data that the DSB has collected, if the goal of any urgent needs process Is to get a capability into the war fighter's hands, the SOFCID-U process has the lowest time to IOC for the war fighter. The data below were submitted by each major rapid acquisition organization and compiled by the DSB (see fig. 
2
The data indicate that SOCOM's process takes an average of 296 days to become IOC. Upon initial investigation, it appears the Army takes the least time to IOC. However, the Army process is skewed by 94 percent of the urgent needs being met by a redistribution of inventory. With only three UONs, the Air Force process does not meet requirements for statistical significance. Also  the only service or COCOM with a designated funding source and the congressional authority to acquire its own solution. This frees SOCOM from bureaucracy that exists in the other processes. These strengths of fastest to IOC, designated funding, and the ability to acquire its own solution are not without a few weaknesses.
The weakness of the SOFCIDS-U process is that it is only intended to sustain a war fighter solution for one year. Other urgent needs processes did not specify a specific length of time for sustainment. Sustaining a solution for one year cuts down on the planning and scope required for the solution and decreases the time necessary to field the capability. However, this limits the ability to perform a "system of systems" approach to acquisition, especially in the area of logistics. Ultimately, the war fighter desires the capability solution to integrate into other war fighting systems to enhance mission effectiveness. The logisticians want the solution to integrate into the existing supply and sustainment system. The planning required for the complete system of systems acquisition approach does not meet the war fighter's urgent timeline. However, the war fighter knows that the 80 percent solution now is better than the 100 percent solution years from now. The compromise is that under the SOFCIDS-U process, if the solution needs sustainment beyond a year, a CDD must be submitted and approved. Fortunately, the SOCOM CDD under the SOFCIDs has fewer requirements than a CDD under the JCIDs process.
In summary, SOCOM's rapid acquisition process rises to the top based on IOC results data, specified funding, and the ability to manage its own acquisition. This makes SOCOM's SOFCIDS-U process a DOD benchmark for streamlined acquisition. Based on SOCOM's success, a similar process could be used to acquire and sustain a limited major weapon system.
Funding changes could support my premise that SOCOM's rapid acquisition process is a model for acquiring a limited MWS, such as a light attack aircraft, in less than two years. Indeed, research shows that the Air Force has already accomplished something similar.
In a recent article, Gen David Deptula, the current deputy CSAF for intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), states "We need to make accelerated acquisition the norm. An example is the MC-12W [ISR aircraft]. The first was delivered in less than eight months." 
39
We are In an Information age, but we have an Industrial-age acquisition system. We have to be more agile In this regard because our adversaries are not limited by the same bureaucratic and legislative constraints that we have. AI Qaeda doesn't have a JCIDS (Joint Capabilities Integration and Development System) process. If we're going to succeed, we have to operate inside our adversaries' decision loop. To do that is going to require significant changes not just to the acquisition processes we built in the last century, but to our decision-making processes. 
40
To develop a limited MWS in under two years, the solution needs to meet three specific criteria: (1) stable requirements, (2) a COTS platform, and (3) stable technology for systems integration. First, to meet an urgent war fighter need, the requirements must be thoroughly vetted before acquisition and not change during the rapid acquisition process. SOCOM would be unable to achieve its average of 296 days to IOC with changing requirements. Second, the primary platform needs to be a COTS item currently in production. For example, in the case of a light-attack weapon system, the primary platform could be the T-6 Texan II. The Air Force uses these aircraft for primary training, and Hawker-Beach is still producing them. Third, any technology added to the weapon system needs to be stable technology. Using the Navy guidance for rapid acquisition, the solution would require an 8-9 technology readiness level (TRL) or better. 
41
Minor additions to the SOFCIDS-U process are required to support two-year limited MWS acquisition. Currently, the SOFCIDS-U process does not mandate a systems engineering plan, which would outline the cradle-to-grave implications of the MWS and integration with other weapon systems. A systems engineering plan needs to be developed for any MWS. A subset of the systems engineering plan is the supportability plan. Currently, the SOFCIDS-U process intends to support a solution for only one year and does not include a robust sustainment plan. To support an MWS, a supportability plan would need to be developed for the intended life of a weapon system. Although these two items would increase the planning time upfront, they would provide the war fighter a sustainable system into the future.
The current SOFCIDS-U process delivers capability to the war fighter in an average of 296 days; Big Safari was able to deliver the MC-12 in under a year. The limited MWS acquisition team could use either process as a timeline model. The crucial factors for maintaining an acquisition timeline are a small team of highly experienced acquisition personnel with an intimate oversight relationship with the contractor. As an example. Big Safari assigns program office personnel to oversee its contractor, L3 Communications, in Greenville, Texas.
Rapid acquisition funding needs to be a priority for the DOD and Congress. Currently, the SOFCIDS-U process uses CMNS funding specifically allocated to fulfill urgent needs. This should be accepted as the service model to fulfill urgent needs, including a limited MWS. Congress also provides the COCOM with the "Combatant Commanders Initiative Fund (CCIF) as a means to finance unforeseen contingency requirements critical to combatant commanders' joint warfighting readiness and national security interests." 
42
43
To summarize, the SOFCIDS-U provides a model for acquiring a limited MWS, but not the only model. Big Safari's acquisition process could also be leveraged to acquire an MWS, provided the MWS meets specific entry criteria and incorporates systems engineering planning. The acquisition team also needs to maintain an intimate contractor relationship as well as work with Congress on funding.
Based on the research presented, I propose three recommendations:
1. Rapid acquisition must be consolidated into one process. I agree with the DSB findings that over 20 rapid acquisition processes are unwieldy and redundant. As shown, with the myriad of terms and processes between SOCOM, the Air Force, Navy, and Army, rapid acquisition is disjointed and inefficient. Like the DSB, I recommend creating and codifying a separate deliberate and rapid acquisition system. This would identify a single rapid acquisition process and bring clarity to cloudy process and funding issues.
2. SOCOM's rapid acquisition process should be used as a benchmark. SOCOM's SOFCIDS-U process offers a streamlined acquisition process with proven delivery to the war fighter. SOCOM's process should be adopted by OSD as the single rapid acquisition process.
3. Future acquisition of limited major weapons systems (e.g., light attack aircraft) should use rapid acquisition processes. Acquisition of a limited MWS to support the war fighter should use a rapid versus deliberate acquisition process. Taking five, 10, or 20 years to field a system is unacceptable in today's rapidly changing environment. Our acquisition system must adapt to defeat the threat. MWSs that meet specific entry criteria-stable requirements, COTS platform, and mature systems integration (8-9 TRL)-should be considered for rapid acquisition. The SOFCID-U or Big Safari processes offer benchmarks for limited MWS acquisition.
In 2008 the Government Accountability Office published four main causes for defense acquisition delivering war fighter capabilities an average of 21 months late: unstable requirements, frequent program manager turnover, overreliance on contractors to perform roles previously performed by government employees, and difficulty managing software. 
44
This paper outlined the difference between deliberate and rapid acquisition; discussed the joint. Army, Air Force, Navy, and SOCOM rapid acquisition processes; argued the success of the SOCOM model; and explored the possibility of acquiring a limited MWS with a rapid acquisition process. My proposal was that SOCOM's rapid acquisition process offers a rapid acquisition benchmark that should be adopted throughout the military and that could be used to acquire a limited MWS (e.g., a light attack aircraft) in less than two years. The limited data showed that SOCOM's rapid acquisition process consistently fulfills urgent needs in the least amount of time-296 days. However, when proposing a process to acquire a limited MWS, both SOCOM and Big Safari stand out as best practices.
This paper made three specific recommendations: rapid acquisition must be consolidated into one process, SOCOM's rapid acquisition process should be used as a benchmark, and future acquisition of limited major weapons systems (e.g., light attack aircraft) should use rapid acquisition processes. These recommendations are congruent with Defense Secretary Robert Gates's comments during a speech in July 2009: The Defense Department needs to think about and prepare for war In a profoundly different way than what we have been accustomed to throughout the better part of the last century. What is needed is a portfolio of military capabilities with maximum versatility across the widest possible spectrum of conflict. As a result, we must change the way we think and the way we plan-and fundamentally reform-the way the Pentagon does business and buys weapons."

These broad findings highlight the need for the DPO to advocate development of information-confidence factors as a microlevel recommendation for its SA environment.
A basic definition of information-confidencefactors is a visual, audible, or textual indicator that communicates a level of confidence (low, medium, or high, based on appropriate business rules) for a given element of SA information. The basic business rules associated with information-confidence factors should be based on providing timely, accurate, and relevant information to the decision maker (see fig. 
I
Trusted Awareness
As a foundation to understanding the concept of information confidence, other elements should be addressed. This study introduces some of these, for instance, the basic process of decision making within the DPO SA environment. Its major premise, however, is that information confidence lies within the critical path of successfully providing actionable (decision-ready) information and, therefore, should be an integral part of any best-practice-driven solution (see fig.

This research provides recommendations for USTRANSCOM leaders to consider as they embark upon a major business transformation effort called "Agile Transportation for the 21st Century" (AT21) and rolls out information technology (IT)-enabled capabilities as part of its corporate services vision.

This study leverages specific research centered upon designing for SA and human factors engineering as the basis for its recommendations for USTRANSCOM. As a further clarification, one should consider that the distribution process is part of the greater domain of logistics within the DOD. As such, logistics-centered topics are directly relevant to the DPO discussions herein. A basic definition of SA is required to establish the baseline discussion. There are at least 26 SA definitions, according to a 2001 systematic classification of SA definitions by Richard Breton and Robert Rousseau.

One key to successful logistics planning and execution is the need for actionable information. For information to be actionable, however, the decision maker must be confident in the information being presented. Confidence is fundamentally achieved when the decision maker accepts that the information being acted upon meets the requirements of timeliness, accuracy, and relevance. To deliver these requirements for decision makers, it is necessary to develop and present information-confidence factors (high, medium, or low) in the SA environment. The decision maker can then consider a level of risk (low, medium, or high) associated with the decision to be made and decide-based on the confidence and risk levels-whether or not to make a decision that will lead to a subsequent action. The Importance of information confidence in the decision-making process leads one to deduce that information-confidence factors are in the critical path for the logistics decision maker. Therefore, information-confidence factors should be addressed as part of the solution to providing situation awareness for USTRANSCOM (see fig. 
3
To better understand the importance of information confidence, consider the example of a key logistics decision affecting the safety and lives of war fighters during Operation Iraqi Freedom. 
7
Although planners were leveraging all of their IT systems capabilities, there was no automated way to indicate a level of confidence in the information associated with timeliness, accuracy, or relevance. Conflicting information was available, and much of it was being validated verbally by a "human in the loop" prior to final decisions for shipment to Iraq by air or surface. Traditionally, critical logistics decisions have been made only after checking and double-checking information gained from the various IT systems available across the department, followed by verbal confirmation on the agreed-upon information from all parties involved. By implementing information-confidence factors associated with corresponding risk levels, decision makers can focus attention on the most critical decisions, trusting business-rule-based software to provide confidence and risk levels versus having to manually engage in the process every time. The bottom-line benefit to users is that they can allow software to perform confidence checks (starting with the least-critical decisions). That, in turn, frees decision makers to perform more critical analysis for the higher-risk decisions. Therefore, it is necessary for USTRANSCOM to define, develop, and field the capability to display information-confidence factors leading to trusted situation awareness and effective logistics decision making.
How does the DPO reach the objective end state of information confidence? To answer that question, this study highlights other critical-path requirements to illustrate how information confidence drives effective logistics decision making. The critical path to deliver actionable or decision-ready information contains DOD-level concerns, as well as those within USTRANSCOM's direct sphere of influence as the DPO and distribution portfolio manager for DOD distribution.
USTRANSCOM should continue to address concerns with the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD), the Joint Staff, the military services, and agencies such as the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), Defense Information Systems Agency, and others as appropriate to realize the stated SA environment end game. Of the many elements external to the DPO, three stand out as essential for success within the military services' purview to organize, train, and equip its forces:
(1) the need for trained personnel engaged in well-defined and understood DOD logistics business processes, (2) a disciplined approach to information gathering and reporting, and (3) universal access to information through appropriate fielding of IT. 
8
9
The scope of this research does not allow in-depth discussion regarding the importance of these DOD-level critical-path items or others like them. However, the DPO should pursue their accomplishment to realize its objective of a successful SA environment. It should also continue to leverage governance forums like the Distribution Executive Board and the Distribution Transformation Task Force to address essential elements within the critical path of providing decision-ready information for decision makers. 10
Three DPO-centric elements are necessary for USTRANSCOM to achieve success: senior leader buy-in and staff advocacy; ownership of processes, information, and business rules; and adopting a knowledge-centric culture.
Delivering a secure SA environment for the DPO requires that senior leaders are an integral part of achieving the endgame objective. This is apparent from General McNabb's statement to the Senate Armed Services Committee. In addition to senior leader buy-in, the power of the entire staff should be focused on the same goals. Success is predicated on a horizontal, integrated team approach to planning and executing the solution. Isolated requirements development and materiel solution design and fielding should be viewed as counterproductive to a successful outcome.
To achieve the desired confidence in information necessary for logistics decision makers in a future DPO SA environment, one must first ensure that ownership of major business processes and the information supporting those processes is clearly defined and that those identified as responsible are empowered, resourced, and engaged accordingly. For example, who owns the strategic surface transportation process from the seaport of embarkation to the other end at the seaport of debarkation? One can argue that ownership is split between two of USTRANSCOM's component commands, the Army's Surface Deployment and Distribution Command (SDDC) and the Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC), depending on the type of sealift employed (contract or organic). This is one example of the complexities associated with the duties of distribution process owner. Clearly understanding who owns a business process is critical to determining other key relationships fundamental to the discussion of information confidence.
The process owner should also own the information related to that process and be solely responsible for updating and reporting that information within the decision-making environment. In the current DPO environment, a user can determine which information source (IT system) to access for logistics information. This can, and does, result in different answers to the same question. To eliminate this occurrence, an integral first step in the right direction is to assign responsibility or ownership of information to an organization. Next comes designating an authoritative information source and providing a time stamp associated with currency of the information. This should enable tagging of information and subsequent development of information-confidence factors.
Achieving a successful DPO SA environment also involves business rules. The information owner should make information that is critical to a future DPO SA environment available in a standard manner that articulates the confidence level for the information being presented. The same pertains for other major process owners in the distribution domain. AMC should be responsible for airlift transportation information, the DLA and military service supply organizations should manage supply information, and USTRANSCOM should oversee information for joint intermodal transportation decisions. The information should be "tagged" to indicate high, medium, or low confidence based on a definitive, minimal criteria articulated as business rules.
To understand this concept, consider the following notional example of an information tag for an airlift transportation manifest:
1. type of information (e.g., airlift manifest), 2. organization responsible and point of contact for the information (e.g.. Tanker Airlift Control Center: TACC OpsCtr@AMC.af.mil. 618-229-3131), 3. authoritative information source (e.g., "Gates"), and 4. date/time stamp of last update for the information provided.
By providing basic tag information (also known as metadata) one can next move on to developing the business rules for displaying informationconfidence factors (see fig. 
4
A trusted SA environment for DPO decision makers requires a culture that values knowledge as a central theme for success. Along the path to process within the SA environment (see fig.

A review of readily available SA research led to several primary references that were pertinent to USTRANSCOM's request for best practices for a COP for D2, that is, the DPO SA environment. Two were considered most pertinent for discussion: Designing for Situation Awareness, An Approach to User-Centered Design by Mica R. Endsley, Betty Bolte, and Debra G. Jones; and A Cognitive Approach to Situation Awareness Theory and Application, edited by Simon Banbury and Sebastlen Tremblay.
Endsley has worked extensively in the SA field and is president of SA Technologies in Marietta, Georgia. Her area of SA expertise is in aviation, the military, and the medical profession. Her work provides a detailed approach to SA that focuses on the business of the user and a holistic SA business solution that guides development through user-centered design, focusing on user requirements, and applying SA-oriented design to the entire system of the mission environment.'

It will also cause the DPO to consider what information is most critical to its core mission and provide appropriate focus for SA designers.
If Not User-Centered Design, Then What Should Be the Focus? Some may still argue for a technology-centered versus user-centered design. However, the focus should be on human factors such as processes, information assimilation, business rules, and measuring successful mission outcomes. Reaching the DPO objective is also about technology-the good news is that technology is well matured and deployed in today's Web-enabled, connected IT world. Access to information is provided universally via portal technology, geographic visualization is readily provided by mapping tools like Google Earth, data warehouses and operational data stores are foundational capabilities in any corporate IT environment, and reusable Web portlets provide active content for the user experience. The user experience or interface is realized through common capabilities like iGoogle where a user can customize the views that are most relevant, such as international news, weather, sports, and so forth. All of the foregoing is made possible due to the years of foundational code development and subsequent proliferation through reuse in the world of software development. While technology is in the critical path for successful fielding of SA tools, it is well matured and readily available for implementation by any fundamentally competent IT organization. Therefore, a technology-centered design approach is not the answer for the DPO. Focusing on human engineering factors associated with usercentered design allows developers to focus on important outcomes, such as information confidence for the decision maker. Perhaps most critical to success, this strategy places users at the center of attention and involves them from concept to the fielding of capabilities.
SA research and design appear to have come a long way in the last 10 years. SA research for the military has centered on the command and control domain. But the basic research, which is focused on design principles, crosses over to the logistics domain. (Several reference books have been cited in this study.) Based on this research and the author's personal experience with USTRANSCOM operations and IT programs, USTRANSCOM is at an opportune juncture to benefit from the extensive work done by many in the SA profession.
The most relevant research for USTRANSCOM at this point in its maturity with DPO SA is that by Endsley. Bolte. and Jones. Based on their work, this paper identifies information-confidence factors as a microlevel recommendation and one of the key elements in USTRANSCOM's critical path to achieving successful DPO SA. Their approach to SAoriented design is founded on three overarching principles that are recommended as best practices for USTRANSCOM leaders to consider as they continue transformation of the AT21 initiative: (1) organize technology around the user's goals, tasks, and abilities: (2) implement technology according to the way users process information and make decisions; and (3) use technology to keep the user in control and aware of the state of the system. 
16
By adopting a knowledge-centric approach and redefining the DPO culture as dependent upon trusted information, the DPO will set the tone for taking its SA game to the next level. The DPO should not treat all information as equal in terms of relevance to its mission. As a start, the process owner should determine which information is relevant to its SA environment and then establish information-confidence factors. In turn, this will enable decision makers to more expeditiously make critical logistics decisions. To embrace a knowledge-centric approach, the DPO should institutionalize disciplined information management principles. Otherwise, future DPO SA solutions may be relegated to providing the latest ways to present "uncertain" information, or users will continue to be burdened with checking, double-checking, and calling someone to ensure information confidence prior to making a decision. To solidify this recommendation, the DPO should adopt process, information, and business-rule ownership, to include identification of ownership stewards and measurement of information and knowledge management performance.
As outlined earlier, several factors Influence the achievement of information confidence. They range from personnel training, disciplined information reporting, and access to appropriate technology, to ownership of processes, information, and business rules-to name but a few. USTRANSCOM should continue to leverage the DPO and department-level governance forums to better ensure information confidence within the DPO SA environment. Some elements are directly within USTRANSCOM's control (e.g., senior-leader buy-in), and many are influenced at the DOD level.
This study posed three questions to help frame the discussion.
First, what should be the endgame objective for DPO SA? The answer proposed forms the basis for the argument that the DPO should articulate the need for information confidence as its fundamental requirement for an effective and successful SA environment.
Secondly, what is in the critical path to achieve the DPO SA objective? The study provided an overarching look at several elements within the critical path for success (some within USTRANSCOM's direct control and some requiring coordination at the DOD level of responsibility). Finally, it asked, how does the DPO get to the objective end state? The recommendations given should provide a sound start to USTRANSCOM's pursuit of a future DPO SA environment. The author's intent was to address the DPO's considerations in a holistic manner, spanning multiple areas that will undoubtedly influence US-TRANSCOM's ability to transform to the DPO of the future.
There is no single silver bullet for success here. As USTRANSCOM moves forward with DPO transformation through implementation of the AT21 initiative and delivery of IT-enabled capabilities through its corporate services vision, it should take advantage of the aforementioned research, best practices, and industry standards. This will help guide its end game for a future DPO SA environment informed by an appropriate cost-benefit analysis to determine the value of such an undertaking. Losing a satellite to an accidental on-orbit collision is no longer hypothetical but real and increasingly likely. As a result, the spacefaring nations of the world, especially the United States, need to address a global space-trafnc-control service. The fiscal and national security ramifications are too significant to ignore. The replacement cost of a satellite, perhaps hundreds of millions of dollars, is the most obvious impact. But this may be the most trivial consideration. The greatest concern is the potential catastrophic loss of vital communications, navigation, weather, and other services we depend on for daily global commerce and defense. This paper explains the problem, examines some possible paths to address the problem, and recommends actions.
In February 2009, a spectacular collision grabbed headlines around the world. In low Earth orbit (LEO) 400 miles above Siberia, an American commercial communications satellite. Iridium 33, collided with the defunct Russian satellite. Cosmos 2251.

This paper advocates that the United States establish a global service with the cooperation of the international community and private sectors. To support this recommendation, we will examine existing global services that could serve as a model for a spacetraffic-control service. But first, we will review the functional components of a service, the current space environment, the state of fielded space situational awareness (SSA) systems, gaps in these systems, and liability implications.
Before discussing the current space environment and the systems which monitor space, let's first describe what would make up a worldwide 24/7 space-traffic-control service. From a functional view, this service must be able to accurately search, detect, track, identify, and catalog space objects in Earth's orbit. The service would then need to predict the future positions of these objects, analyze the traffic for possible collisions (referred to as conjunctions), issue timely warnings to affected parties, and direct avoidance maneuvers, if required. If damage is sustained, per international treaties, the service would then need to assist to the greatest extent feasible in identifying the space objects and nations involved to help determine liability.

In an apparent response to these deficiencies, three of the world's largest commercial satellite operators-Intelsat, SES, and Inmarsatin a cooperative private venture, created the Space Data Association in November 2009. They expect eight companies to participate in collision avoidance and another 14 companies to be involved in reducing satellite radio-frequency interference. Although they acknowledge that the US CFE program has some benefit, they feel compelled to invest their own capital because the "information is not always as precise or up to date-nor is it disseminated as quickly-as it needs to be to protect against close encounters between satellites."

Three existing services could be models for a global service. 
62
The Global Positioning System (GPS) demonstrates the first type of global service, one provided free by the United States. Today, GPS is used by virtually the entire world for positioning, navigation, and timing. According to senior US State Department officials, although its genesis was military uses, GPS evolved into a global utility and a centerpiece of US diplomacy. In 1983 President Reagan offered free civilian access to GPS to help enhance aviation safety around the world. President Clinton in 1996 expanded the policy to ensure the worldwide availability of the service for peaceful civil, commercial, and scientific purposes, free of user fees. In 2004 President Bush furthered the policy to ensure that the GPS meet the increasing and varied domestic and global requirements. These successive policies "helped unleash the power of free markets and private enterprise for the good of all users worldwide." 
63
A second precedent for a global utility is the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), a specialized UN agency based in Geneva, Switzerland. The ITU manages the worldwide radio spectrum usage and slot allocation for GEO satellites on behalf of its members. The ITU currently consists of 191 member states (nations), 574 sector members (commercial companies), and 150 associates (commercial companies). The members underwrite operations and participate in its decision making. 
64
65
66
Which model is most appropriate for the management of a global space-traffic-control service? One USAF general advocates a unilateral solution for protecting global utilities. "Having the Air Force assume responsibility for global satellite protection as an extension of its existing space-control responsibilities seems the most feasible option. Since the Air Force is tasked with controlling space, placing global utilities under the protective umbrella of space control would be a matter of policy-not an expansion of technology or costs." 
67
68
The first conceptual model is a US-owned-and-operated service akin to GPS. There are many compelling reasons why the US government could do this. First, it is probably the most expedient avenue to establish a global service because it could quickly leverage the existing SSN infrastructure and nascent CFE program. Second, the United States, as the leading spacefaring nation and the only nation with the necessary resources, has treaty obligations to ensure safety of space operations in the global commons. Lastly, as matter of national Interest, the United States has the most at stake and most to gain. As the world's superpower benefiting from globalization, maintaining international institutions and their associated systems that contribute to the current world order is paramount to its economic security. Moreover, a global space-traffic-control service would enhance military space security as a defensive system.
Many believe there is a significant drawback to this type of service: that is, a utility provided by a single nation with the power to turn it off. For example, despite US public law, presidential policy, and diplomatic engagement, many nations are still wary of US intentions with the GPS and are pursuing their own navigational systems. The Europeans, Russians, and Chinese all have satellite programs that aim to implement organic capabilities. With respect to SSA, it's much the same. ESA's director-general articulated Europe's worry of being "blind" and wholly dependent on US-supplled data. 
69
70
71
72
73
This construct does have several flaws. Data sharing could be sticky-especially Information about defense satellites that each na-tion would want to protect. 
74
The third model could be a commercial utility with clients-nations or private sector-that would pay for the service. A fledgling operation similar to this, the Space Data Association, is already in planning stages. The association plans to compile satellite positional data from its members' satellite telemetry feeds. A benefit to this kind of service is the built-in perception that it is independent from any one state or member. The association also aspires to be more nimble, timely, and responsive compared to the current US CFE paradigm. 
75
The last model examined is an international global utility similar to ICAO. Advocates for this model include Dr. Ailor and the Secure World Foundation, a space-policy think tank. They propose a nonprofit space-operations clearinghouse with a board of governors and members drawn from governments of spacefaring nations and major nongovernmental satellite owners "to establish common standards and practices." 
76
Because an ICAO-like service has the most advantages and is more likely to enjoy international support, it is most likely to succeed. Pursuing this model would constructively leverage existing SSA infrastructures and capabilities as well as international cooperation while also suppressing mutual suspicions. The United States, as the leading spacefaring nation in the world, would additionally benefit indirectly in terms of diplomatic leadership and international prestige. It would also benefit directly, as would the world, from improved mill-tary and economic security via Improved space control and a safer environment for commerce.
Based on this research, this paper identifies five critical findings. First, the big sky theory for safe operations is no longer valid. Space is becoming congested and prone to collisions. It will only get worse with time. Second, the global economy and international security are in part dependent upon space systems. Consequently, safe operation of satellites is essential. Third, no governmental, international, or nongovernmental organization is ultimately responsible for global space-traffic control. Some governments, namely the United States, and several nongovernmental organizations have taken nascent steps to address this problem. However, these efforts are not synchronized or comprehensive. Fourth, an international consensus Is building for improved SSA and space-traffic control. 
77
78
As revealed by the fourth documented collision in space and the increasing orbital congestion, the need for global space-traffic-control service is clear. Ignoring the issue will not ease the problem. Within the US government, the USAF, NASA. STRATCOM, the State Department, and Congress all have stated the need to improve SSA and mitigate orbital collisions. Outside the US government, the ESA, the Secure World Foundation, and private industry have also advocated the need. What is missing is a comprehensive, synchronized plan to addresses the problem in its entirety. As a matter of national prestige, leadership, and security, the US government should endeavor to establish an international institution to govern global space traffic.
vide insight to the United States as it prepares for its own policy change regarding homosexuals.

Those serving in the US military in the early 1990s remember the charged political debates and presidential campaign promises of Gov. Bill Clinton that eventually led to 10 United States Code 654, Policy Concerning Homosexuality in the Armed Forces, commonly known as DADT. While Clinton promised to lift the ban entirely, §654, enacted in 1993, was essentially a compromise based on fierce resistance by influential congressional members and senior US military officers.

The Military Readiness Enhancement Act of 2009, introduced in the House of Representatives and in subcommittee in March 2009, proposes to repeal the current law and the DOD policy concerning homosexuality. As written. It "prohibits the Secretary of Defense, and Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, from discriminating on the basis of sexual orientation against any member of the Armed Forces or any person seeking to become a member."

Having people from all levels involved brings in multiple perspectives, identifies unexpected problems, and can generate innovative ideas and solutions.

To illustrate the recommended thought process, note that OIPs include the American public, the media, and US allies. Making a concerted effort to reach out and communicate strategically with the American public through the media before, during, and after implementation can go a long way towards ensuring transparency and maintaining public trust. Strategic communication should also target US allies, especially since many of them no longer have a ban on openly serving homosexuals. Coalition partners must understand the change and the DOD's efforts to smoothly implement the repeal. In fact, many allies can offer potential "lessons learned" from their personnel policies, as will be discussed later. The key is to engage the right internal and external organizations from the start and to realize that others outside the US military are also impacted by a repeal of the DADT policy.
If elected officials change the military's homosexual policy, the DOD must appropriately implement and adhere to the new law to minimize negative impacts to its forces. Armed with the background and proposed legislation above, several recommendations, outlined in figure 
2
The DOD must be proactive and act now to involve such key players as those recommended in figure 
1
Part of a proactive approach should include consultations with allies who have lifted their bans to garner lessons learned. While such nations as Canada, Israel, Britain, and Australia did not experience the difficulties initially anticipated 
20
21
22
Regardless of these insights, the American military should still expect internal resistance; attitudes, social norms, and religious beliefs differ in the United States. For example, US military concerns regarding service of open homosexuals include undermining of unit cohesion, violence or abuse towards gays, violation of religious and moral beliefs, lack of respect for homosexual leaders, and the sharing of close quarters (such as foxholes, latrines, and operational spaces) between heterosexuals and open homosexuals. 
23
24
25
26
27
Finally, while this change may not exactly mirror previous integration efforts in the US military, the DOD should still consult lessons learned surrounding integration of African Americans and women for use during this effort. Consulting historical lessons can provide an essential base of knowledge leading to a successful transition. At a minimum, these experiences can provide insights into the military's adaptability to change. As RAND stated, "Experience shows that it is possible to change how troops behave towards previously excluded (and despised) minority groups, even if underlying attitudes towards these groups change very little." 
28
Gay service personnel know that they have the code of conduct to back them up in the event of harassment or bullying. And all servicemembers know that they have recourse to complain if they witness inappropriate comments or actions.
-Aaron Belkin and R. L. Evans
One successful implementation strategy used in the United Kingdom's transition in 2000 was the establishment of a code of social conduct modeled after the Australian armed forces. 
29
30
31
Using such a code tailored for the United States may work. If the DOD adopts this approach, the first step would be to create a guiding coalition of senior leadership across the DOD with enough power and vision to lead the change. 
32
1
Additionally, the stakeholder team should specifically address public displays of affection (PDA), since challenges in implementation may occur if heterosexuals and homosexuals have different standards in this regard. The team developing the code must realize that if PDA for a heterosexual couple is acceptable, the same standard should apply to homosexuals. In sum, an emphasis on professional conduct will be critical to successful implementation-and long-term adherence-to the proposed law.
It must be clear to the troops that behavioral dissentfrom the policy will not be tolerated.
-RAND Research Brief RB-7537, 2000
To effectively implement the DADT repeal, DOD officials must issue a consistent message from the top. DOD-wide talking points and senior leadership support and training must be central to this policy conversion. In addition to the message within the quote above, DOD guidance should include reminders that the US military is subject to civilian authority and that the DOD must make the change successful.
At all levels, commanders and their senior enlisted leaders must be the messengers, leading from the front rather than using the equal opportunity (EO) or sexual assault response coordinator (SARC) offices to deliver the news. Because the military is already under significant stress in Iraq and Afghanistan, leaders must also send messages of reassurance to the force, "convey[ing] that this policy is not a challenge to traditional military values." 
33
34
Any enterprise-wide change requires training and education to ensure the initial roll out is implemented appropriately and to ensure the message is reinforced as new members enter. This change will be no exception. Using the code of conduct and talking points described earlier provide a great start. However, the training should not resemble sensitivity training, as has been suggested by other recent articles. 
35
36
37
38
39
Although our allies did not experience great difficulties within their militaries and data from a 2006 survey of US, Iraq, and Afghanistan war veterans shows "declining support" for the homosexual ban, it is still prudent to plan for internal resistance. 
40
Furthermore, such support agencies as the chaplaincy and medical community could require help depending on the reaction of the force. Although the DOD approach should emphasize behavioral issues, this topic has spiritual and moral implications that need consideration. In terms of religious counseling, even though a chaplain "would not be required to preach something that he did not believe as a part of remaining in the chaplaincy, this community could face significant challenges as it seeks to minister to members of the force." 
41
Another important issue deals with reinstatement of individuals previously discharged under the current DADT law, particularly since the proposed legislation calls for "re-accession of otherwise qualified persons." 
42
43
44
45
46
However, a potential still exists that members may depart because their belief system will not allow them to adjust to the new policy, or they may depart to make a statement. The DOD should be prepared for this possibility, but such departures should not change an approach that incorporates an emphasis on professional conduct.
Another resource consideration mentioned in other literature stated that "dorm and facility upgrades would be needed." 
47
48
49
50
51
Lastly, it is accepted as factual that homosexuals already serve in today's armed forces and that there are no issues with the facilities currently available. Nor is there "valid scientific evidence to indicate that gay men and lesbians are less able than heterosexuals to control their sexual or romantic urges" or that "acknowledged homosexuals very seldom challenge the norms and customs of their organizations." 
52
In summary, good order and discipline, ensured through leadership, are what will make the transition work-much more than walls and stalls. Consequently, repeal of the DADT policy should not necessarily require special facilities accommodations-particularly given the enormous costs-but the DOD should look closely to consider all sides of the argument.
Upon the ban's repeal, the DOD's most obvious internal tasks are to rewrite or adjust directives, instructions, and regulations and task subordinate services to do the same. In fact, proposed legislation already includes a blanket statement to this effect: "Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall revise Department of Defense regulations" and each military department must revise its regulations "not later than 180 days after the date of enactment." 
53
Note that the proposed bill does not address a revision of the punitive articles of the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ). The congressionally mandated UCMJ requires the president to implement the UCMJ. The president does this through an executive order known as the Manual for Courts Martial. If Congress passes the DADT repeal bill, it follows that Article 125 ("Sodomy"), Article 133 ("Conduct Unbecoming an Officer and Gentleman"), and Article 134-4 ("General Article-Assault") would need to be aligned with the new law, since arguably these articles could no longer be legitimately enforced under a homosexual antidiscrimination policy.
Another internal consideration is to prepare for possible lawsuits from separated homosexual service members. An increase in litigation is especially realistic if the DOD continues to discharge military members while the DADT policy is under review. Interestingly, the British Ministry of Defence discharged its last homosexual three days before lifting of its ban in 2000, resulting in additional negative press and litigation. 
54
In addition to the considerations above, a broad range of personnel policies must be reviewed in the wake of the DADT policy repeal to determine if any other policies include discriminatory language. For example, service fraternization policies appear to remain relevant in any post-DADT world, with the exception of those paragraphs specifically addressing the current homosexual policy. 
55
56
57
/ think it's important, as we look to this change, that it be done in a way that doesn't disrupt the force at a time where it's under a lot of stress. And that, to me, means in a measured, deliberate way, over some time-to be determined.
-Adm Michael G. Mullen Chairman, JCS While some could argue that a gradual change may be more palatable because of current operations tempo (as the chairman states above) or because military culture does not change quickly and its customs are formed over generations, note that it has already been more than 16 years since the DADT policy was implemented. In other words, in a way, it has already been a gradual change.
Regardless, if the homosexual ban is lifted, the DOD may not have a choice in its implementation. The law may be directive and specific-the proposed bill's regulation rewrite timelines are a case in point. But even if there is a choice, most change experts recommend establishing a "sense of urgency" as the organization embarks on change and puts together its vision and strategy for implementation. 
58
59
Lastly, to ensure implementation is progressing as planned, the DOD must solicit feedback through hotlines, climate surveys, unit assessments, and possibly DOD-hosted conferences to identify and address issues during implementation. The DOD must also closely monitor retention and recruiting trends to determine the policy change's impact, if any.
Today's integrated force is the product of many years of effort, constant monitoring, and the sustained commitment of civilian and military leaders.
-RAND Research Brief RB-7537, 2000
The US military is the strongest force in the world, and if required by law, it is capable of integrating homosexuals as other countries have successfully done. The key in implementing a DADT policy repeal will be for the DOD to plan now and smartly implement any change to the existing policy by being proactive, emphasizing profes-sional conduct, implementing the change with visible support from senior leaders, utilizing robust training and education programs, considering manpower and facility ramifications, and leaning forward to make policy and regulatory changes required by the new law. Doing these things, particularly with a sustained leadership commitment mentioned in the quote above, will help to ensure that US military readiness and cohesion remains intact in the midst of such a significant change. With a repeal of the DADT policy likely in the nottoo-distant future, the DOD must be more ready than not-the American people and its government expects and deserves nothing less.
The potential for losing intellectual dominance in science and technology is a major threat to the ability of the United States to maintain national security and economic superiority. The United States must ensure it exercises the best possible options to grow, attract, and maintain enough qualified individuals to stay ahead of all adversaries. In addition to expanding the base of technology-educated individuals, the United States must counter threats to the intellectual capital base to secure its ability to deter the actions of adversaries. The primary measure of intellectual capital development is the number of undergraduate and graduate degrees earned in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). The United States must focus now on doing what is necessary to maintain educational excellence and post-education opportunities to ensure that the US knowledge base in science and technology will remain the strongest in the world.
The following discussion examines many variables influencing the future of US intellectual capital. I first review the strategic importance of growing, attracting, and retaining graduate-level STEM professionals. This includes the first-, second-, and third-order effects of having, or conversely losing, US intellectual capacity. I next address current trends and, specifically, the importance of benefiting from foreign-born students and workers. This analysis includes statistics regarding graduate degrees granted in the United States to both citizens and noncitizens. Subsequently, I review initiatives to ensure that the United States will have a robust technology-educated core in future years. Finally, the discussion lays out potential impacts of developing technology on deterrence. I specifically focus on the United States' ability to stay at the cutting edge of innovation and the correlation of maintaining STEM intellectual capacity to countering or deterring technically advanced threats.
The exponential growth of technology combined with rapid globalization points to a future that requires the United States to have an advantage in science and technology intellectual capital. Without this •Mr. Theodore Halles. USAF civilian, was the essay advisor for this paper.
resource, the United States will be at a disadvantage in many areas, including national security and economic stability. To best prepare for future threats, the United States needs to prioritize growing, attracting, and maintaining graduate-level technical capacity.
A loss of leadership in S&T [science and technology] could hurt the U.S. economy, living standards, and national security.
-Titus Galama and James Hosek
The United States earned and has maintained the preeminent place on the world's science and technology stage because of a robust higher education system and a pervasive culture of innovation. This advantage contributed to successes in all sectors and is a perishable resource worthy of attention and preservation. Exponential growth in technological change combined with rapid globalization increases the criticality of creating, recruiting, and maintaining science and technology intellectual capital.
STEM intellectual capital is the group of individuals with education and prowess in science and technology who use those talents to benefit the nation. This definition includes both American-born individuals and immigrants. Historically, the technological and scientific knowledge needed for US national security has not been a function of only domestic scientific talent. 
1

Retaining or increasing the advantage of dominant intellectual capacity in science and technology is critical to the United States' staying at the forefront of innovation and has potential second-and thirdorder economic, political, military, and social effects. Potential firstorder effects include producing new forms of energy, responding to diseases, protecting the environment, stimulating further interest and excitement in students to study science and technology, sparking the next technological revolution, and enhancing security. 
5
As an example, the National Academy of Engineering published an in-depth analysis of the impact of globalization on technical advancement. In part. It stated that "the United States must develop the necessary human, financial, physical, regulatory and institutional infrastructures to compare more advantageously with other nations in attracting the technical, managerial, and financial resources of globally active private corporations or individuals." 
6
One second-order effect of intellectual capital superiority is the national security activity of deterrence-influencing adversary leadership decisions away from actions deleterious to the United States. This endeavor requires an understanding of the actions an adversary is capable of taking, including threats based on emerging technologies. A decreasing science and technology intellectual base is likely to diminish the United States' ability to deter these threats. More simply stated, brainpower itself provides deterrence capability. If the adversary knows the United States has the intellectual ability to understand and counter threats, the chance of achieving his desired effect decreases. This change in the adversary's decision equation deters him from acting. Likewise, existing weapons are a key component of the US deterrent posture, and those weapons also require individuals with the intellectual capability to keep them viable. According to one estimate, the Pentagon is at risk of running out of scientists to operate and upgrade the nation's arsenal of intercontinental nuclear and conventional missiles. 
7
If the United States does not take the actions necessary to stay at least even, if not ahead, in science and technology, there will be significant and very negative impacts. No other nation is its equal in scientific and technological accomplishments, but this does not make the United States invulnerable. The globalized world requires that the United States be at least on par with all potential adversaries in every technology field so not even one adversary can get an advantage by an outpacing advance in one area. If an adversary were to develop an advantage in a technology beyond what the United States could deter or counter, that would cause a change in the balance of world power. For this reason, the United States must stay even or ahead in all areas or be prepared to exist in a world where it is not the number one power.
The number of university degrees a nation awards in S&E is an indicator of a nation's capacity to innovate in those arenas. S&E graduate enrollment in the United States declined in the latter half of the 1990s but has increased steadily since 1999. The most recent data, published by the National Science Foundation in 2010, shows that the number of bachelor's degrees awarded in 2007 increased in most technical fields, except computer sciences. 
8
Students in the United States on temporary visas earned only 4 percent of the technical bachelor's degrees awarded in 2007, but foreign students make up a much higher proportion of the master's and doctoral degree recipients. In 2007 foreign students earned 24 percent of S&E master's degrees and 33 percent of doctoral degrees, bringing the total number of doctorates earned by foreign students to 13,700-a new peak. 
9
10
Foreign-born intellectual capital is a critical asset. The United States has depended on the diversity, competition, and personal drive contributed by foreign students both during their education and afterwards in the highly skilled work force. Fortunately, through 2007 the trend of foreign-born students choosing to study in the United States is positive, as is the trend of foreign-born graduates who intend to stay here after graduation (fig. 
1
The United States is still the destination of the largest number of foreign students, but the numbers are trending downward. The US share in 2000 was 25 percent, but in 2006 it had fallen to 20 percent. The United Kingdom, Germany, and France are the other top destinations. '' This is a trend worthy of close attention because attracting foreign students is a primary way of recruiting foreign talent for the 16,000 14,000 1987 1989 1991 1993 1995 1997 1999 2001 2003 2005 2007    long term. Historically, graduate-level science and technology programs in US universities have been the world's benchmark. This acknowledged excellence, combined with the US culture of innovation, made degrees from US universities attractive to both US-born and international students. The secondary effect of attracting foreign students to US universities is that many of the international students have historically remained in the United States after graduation, increasing the intellectual resources available to US educational institutions, private companies, and government institutions.
Increased competition from other countries expanding their recruitment efforts is not the only threat to the United States attracting foreign students. Several trends threaten to decrease the US advantage in attracting foreign talent between now and 2035. First, US security concerns have increased greatly since the terrorist attacks of 9/11; as a result, visa procedures are more daunting, including those for foreign students and for foreign graduates of US universities who wish to stay in the United States to work. Second, at the same time that US policies are making it more difficult for foreigners to stay, improving conditions in many competitor nations are making it more attractive for foreigners educated in the United States to return home. The knee-jerk reaction to 9/11, which tightened visa policies, created a two-year decline in the number of foreign students in the United States. This trend later reversed, with the number of foreign S&E graduate students in US institutions increasing in the fall of 2006. 
12
13
Finally, the pervasive interconnectedness or "flattening" of the world is a trend that has made it more possible and palatable for foreign-born graduates who do stay in the United States to still commit all or part of their efforts to interests in their countries of origin rather than using them to benefit the United States. 
14
Attracting foreign students is only the first step in securing foreignborn intellectual capital for the United States. Obtaining student visas is not the only issue. After graduation, many foreign graduates have difficulty obtaining visas to stay in the United States. In a study of approaches to strengthening scientific technology. Col Walter Juzukonis pointed out that the United States provides fast-track citizenship for foreign nationals who serve in the US military and proposes a similar fast-track approach for foreign nationals who have earned doctorate degrees in fields we need to bolster. 
15
16
17
In today's environment, the United States must recognize and prepare for multiple levels of external threats. Easy access to information increases the possibility of high-tech threats being wielded not only by nation-states but also by groups and individuals. Some see this as an impetus for tighter restrictions on visas and the naturalization policy. Ironically, these same policies make it more difficult to expand the pool of individuals with technology and science skills needed to counter those threats. National policy makers must work these issues aggressively and recognize that keeping science-and technology-educated individuals out of the United States is a prescription for increased external threats and decreased capability to deter or counter them. 
18
19
Many ongoing initiatives are encouraging the future growth of technological expertise. Great examples already exist of politicians and educators focusing on this important venture. President Obama made STEM education a national priority by putting emphasis on science and technology early in his administration. Prior to that, initiatives already were underway at lower levels in the United States, driven by the efforts of interest groups, states, and individual politicians.
Even before his inauguration, President Obama recognized that science and technology need to be reinvigorated. 
20
21
22
23
President Obama is doing more than just talking about improving technology education-he included substantial funding in the proposed fiscal year (FY) 2011 budget specifically targeted at creating the next generation of scientists and engineers who can help drive economic growth in the coming decades. The budget provides $300 million in new grants for states to develop and implement instructional practices and improve teaching and learning in science and math. The Investing in Innovation Fund totals $500 million and includes $150 million for competitive grants for school districts, nonprofits, and other organizations to test, validate, and scale promising strategies to improve teaching and accelerate student learning in STEM subjects. The budget also directs the Department of Education to work with the National Science Foundation and other federal agencies to identify the most effective interventions that can help states, schools, and teachers improve STEM outcomes. 
24
The administration is not alone in attempting to reinvigorate science and technology education in the United States. In 2005 a coalition of 15 business-oriented organizations, Tapping America's Potential, set a challenge to double the number of American graduates with bachelor's degrees in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics from 200,000 to 400,000 by 2015. The number Increased each year through 2006, but not enough to meet the goal. Falling short of the target may not be statistically relevant because the target was chosen based on the professional judgment of business people, rather than the needs of the nation. However, the fact that business leaders are giving the issue specific attention is a positive indicator that experts understand the importance of intellectual capital. Colorado provides one outstanding example of a state-level project to invigorate technology education. Four institutions-the Metropolitan State College of Denver, Colorado School of Mines, Community College of Denver, and Cherry Creek School District-have formed an unprecedented alliance called the Colorado Academy for the Development of STEM-Related Careers (ADSC). It is designed to position the state as a leader in STEM education and to ensure that its students, from kindergarten through graduate level, are connected to cuttingedge innovation. Colorado's governor. Bill Ritter, has embraced and supported ADSC's vision. The academy's initial focus will be on air and space-providing education, scholarships, internships, career guidance, and mentoring to students desiring skills needed to build air and space careers. The Colorado ADSC will provide educational certifications and specialized training that connect its targeted learning communities from kindergarten to doctoral programs to ensure job readiness and career enhancement. It will also collaborate with Colorado Workforce Centers, which will facilitate training and assist in job placement. 
25
Individual politicians have also recognized the importance of STEM education. Republican congressman Randy Forbes (VA) obtained a National Science Foundation grant of $989,747 for Virginia State University to target minority students to increase the pool of STEM students. In the United States, this segment of the population has been underrepresented in the STEM fields, and tapping into that resource is another potential method to increase the intellectual capital for the future. The money will fund a three-year study aimed at improving test scores for minority students in STEM fields. Forbes hopes the study can become an education model. He said that it "is about more than just advancing test scores and equality in education; it is about economic advancement and ensuring that the United States retains its edge in the math, science and technology fields-a critically important requirement in today's global economy." 
26
The issues of creating and maintaining intellectual capital are complex and require a multifaceted approach. The initiatives listed above merely provide examples of methods which could yield benefits. Globalization increases competition for intellectual capital and makes it critical for all levels of US government, business, and education to find innovative, effective ways to encourage STEM education and attract and retain STEM-educated researchers and workers.
All indications are that technology will continue to develop at an increasing rate and that globalization will continue to "flatten" the world. The world of 2035 will benefit from positive technology innovations which improve health care, information availability, energy sources, and human performance. The technologies that will make these improvements possible will also offer adversaries opportunities to use them for negative purposes. As always, US national security in 2035 will depend upon the ability to deter adversaries. Intellectual capital in STEM professions, whether residing in US-or foreign-born individuals, is the foundation of any deterrence. STEM knowledge is an enabler for deterrence.
Deterrence is dependent upon a potential adversary determining that an action on his part will either fail to get the result he seeks or will create an intolerably high cost or risk.

There will be many areas of concern for deterrence in 2035. Primary among these will be threats in cyber, nuclear, biological, directed energy, nano, and space technologies. The space domain provides a valuable example as a critical area in which the United States must be prepared to deter threats in the future. It also provides a good example of second-order effects because space is an industry which drives economic growth. According to The Space Report 2009, "It is unclear whether the U.S. education system can drive growth in the number of new skilled science and technology graduates, espe-cially those with advanced degrees, needed to replace veteran U.S. space workers who are retiring."

Maintaining the advantage in science and technology intellectual capital is critical to the future of US security. Current trends are positive, and initiatives are underway to grow, attract, and maintain enough qualified individuals to stay ahead of adversaries. However, the past decade has shown that these trends are vulnerable to sudden change. The tightening of visa processes after 9/11 demonstrated that the inflow of foreign students and experts can drop quickly. Although keeping terrorists out is vital, the federal government must also recognize the ramifications of impeding one source of technical expertise. In the near term, the United States likely will continue to rely on foreign-born individuals to maintain its science and technology advantage. If the United States chooses to reduce its historic dependence on foreign-born brainpower, there must be a corresponding increase in homegrown expertise. The most robust pool of individuals can be amassed both by attracting foreign-born students and experts and by increasing the presence of US-born personnel who are highly educated in the technology arena.
President Obama has said that improving science and technology education is a matter of national importance, and he included substantial funding in the proposed FY 2011 budget. Industry, state, and local initiatives are also in place to provide educational opportunities to increase the number of US-born students earning technology de-grees. Adjusting visa and immigration laws to enable the United States to attract and retain even more talent from other nations will reduce the threat of the United States falling behind in the capability to lead innovation in science and technology. Its lead in technology is crucial to deterring adversaries, whether they are nation-states, nonstate actors, or individuals.
If the United States does not maintain the lead in critical technologies like nuclear weaponry, biological warfare, nanotechnology, cyber warfare, directed energy, and space technology, one or more adversaries likely will take advantage of areas of weakness. Current deterrence depends on the adversary believing that the United States has the capability to deter and the will to take decisive action. The capability is created by those who understand cutting-edge technology. If an adversary did not think the United States could act decisively, he would be more likely to take offensive action. A cyber attack could interfere with almost any US data system and could potentially disrupt most US military operations. A space attack could eliminate access to the global positioning system (GPS), which, at a minimum, would make navigation nearly impossible and disrupt banking worldwide. A biological attack could eradicate a vast portion of the US population. These are examples of events that, undeterred and uncountered, could change the balance of power and threaten the American way of life. Current intellectual capacity makes deterrence viable and supports development of methods to recover if one of these attacks should occur. Without qualified scientists and engineers, the United States could not replace or establish a workable alternative for the GPS after a space attack. Likewise, vaccinations and antidotes would not be available to counter or minimize the impact of a biological attack. These are just two examples of a plethora of possible threats if the United States does not maintain intellectual superiority.
The United States enjoys its position as the one remaining superpower in large part because of its broad spectrum of intellectual expertise in technology fields. In his February 2010 State of the Union address, President Obama stated that the United States is not going to be "number 2." Maintaining the position as "number 1" means more than maintaining national security. As the leader of technology development, the United States also gets to set policy. This has worldwide implications for areas like human genome mapping, nuclear weaponry, and biological warfare. As the leader in these areas, the United States can best influence international treaties, bans, and agreements. Intellectual capital is a critical national security resource that cannot be regained rapidly if it is allowed to deteriorate. Keeping the advantage is a wise investment in the future.

This study addresses three basic questions: (1) what should be the endgame objective for distribution process owner (DPO) situation awareness (SA)? (

In addressing how the DPO reaches its objective, this study provides three macrolevel recommendations for USTRANSCOM:
1. leverage pertinent SA industry research and adopt user-centered design as the foundation for a DPO SA environment:
2. adopt a knowledge-centric approach to DPO culture by defining ownership of information, processes, and business rules; and 3. address critical-path concerns for DPO SA through appropriate governance forums.

Practicing the fundamentals of disciplined information management is foundatlonal to achieving information confidence and realizing ultimate transformation to a knowledge-centric organization and culture. None of these can be achieved through technology alone, and all should be realized to ensure information confidence. The DPO should continue to institutionalize ownership of processes, information, and business rules to fully reap the benefits of a DPO SA environment enabled by technology.
To understand why information confidence is in the critical path of DPO decision makers, consider the mechanics of the decision-making Throughout his presidential campaign and again as recently as the 2010 State of the Union address, Pres. Barack Obama reinforced his commitment to lift the ban on homosexuals serving openly in the US military.' Although he cannot lift the ban on his own-only the legislative branch has that authority-the president's clear stance and the Democratic Party's majority in Congress point to a repeal of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" (DADT) policy in the nearer term.* In fact, bills have already been introduced, and some Democrats in Congress are posturing to include a repeal in their versions of the defense authorization bill this year.

The US military, with its ban on the open display of homosexuality, stands with 11 other countries, but this list does not include countries where homosexuality is "banned outright, such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and several other nations in the Middle East."
