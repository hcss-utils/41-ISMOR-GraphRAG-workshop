Russian military reforms and a 2010-2020 State Armament Program, set into motion after the Russia-Georgia war in 2008, sought to enact far-reaching changes to the Russian military.
These reforms, which Defense Minister Sergey Shoigu anticipated would contribute to "a new qualitative level" for the Russian military, included replacing or modernizing 70 percent of Russian military equipment by 2020, revitalizing Russia's defense industrial base, and bolstering the number of professional personnel in the Russian military.
1 By 2021, this investment and reforms initiated by these programs collectively yielded a significantly more capable and ready force available to Russian political leaders.
