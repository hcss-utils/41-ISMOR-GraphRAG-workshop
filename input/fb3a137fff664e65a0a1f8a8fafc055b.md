More than half of all wars since 1816 have taken place among enduring strategic rivals, while less than a fifth have been between states without any established rivalry. Surprisingly, given such a remarkable correlation, there are very few studies on the topic of enduring strategic rivalries. Though they have dug deep into the histories of particular rivalries, historians have not approached the topic in a thematic way to create a body of historiographical literature that allows one to compare and contrast rivalries across the ages. Political scientists have done little better. Until the late 1980s, they had not addressed the topic at all. 1 But from the mid-1990s until approximately 2002, a small group of political scientists did conduct mostly statistical-based examinations of "intra-state enduring rivalries." Then they went silent. For more than a decade now, the field of political science has offered little on the topic of enduring strategic rivalries.
If one were to surmise a reason for the rapid passing of what at first appeared a fruitful field of research, the only apparent reason was that political scientists had exploited all of the available data. Given their approach, which mostly amounted to counting conflicts and determining the dates between them, there were only a limited number of variables to explore and a relatively small data set with which to work. Political scientists quite literally ran out of inferences that they could make, based on the data available to them. In short, they had exhausted all the possibilities for further research, at least with quantitative data capable of being gamed and modeled.
Thankfully, those political scientists addressing this issue did not quit the field without first leaving us with a number of observations that clearly make a case for the central importance of enduring rivalries in international affairs, particularly those among great powers. 2 Such observations provide an essential stepping-stone for a deeper, historically based analysis of enduring rivalries, aimed at drawing out commonalties and possible lessons that endure across the centuries.
Enduring rivalries do not suddenly appear. Rather, they are the result of a series of previous interactions that appear to lock in future behavior.
1. As states interact and crises develop, one side invariably retreats.
1-1 * Proto-rivalries have all the characteristics of an enduring rivalry, but have not been going on long enough to warrant the "enduring" label. The developing US-China rivalry would fall into the "proto" category.
The Cold War's ending did not lead to a hoped-for "end of history," nor did it see the last of history's great power rivalries. Soon after the demise of the Soviet Union in 1991, another power began a seemingly inexorable rise to challenge the United States for global dominance-China. How this new strategic rivalry will play out remains uncertain. History, however, tells us that such enduring strategic rivalries typically end in one of three ways: (1) a series of exhausting conflicts in which one side is the victor, e.g., Rome vs. Carthage; (2) a peaceful and somewhat orderly transition, e.g., Great Britain vs. the United States at the turn of the century; or (3) one side collapsing, e.g., the Soviet Union in 1991.
For the Office of Net Assessment (ONA), the future of the emerging Sino-U.S. strategic competition remains a matter of predictive guesses based on unreliable trend lines. (Unfortunately, there are currently few guideposts to assist policymakers in understanding the dynamics of strategic rivalries.) To help fill this intellectual void, ONA asked the Institute for Defense Analyses (IDA) to produce an historical review of the most important and enduring strategic rivalries among major states, from antiquity to the late twentieth century.
For the review, the IDA project leader selected a relatively small group of historians and political scientists, all outstanding in their fields, to write a series of essays. The project leader devised a different approach, the use of specifications, to help ensure a series of high-quality essays would be produced. These specifications pushed each author to focus on areas of commonality from which policymakers could determine pitfalls and opportunities of use in present-day planning. The authors completed their research on an independent basis, with the essays focusing on a particular inter-state relationship in history. Sixteen historical rivalries made the cut. An introduction written by the editor, Dr.
The group selected the major findings and conclusions for ONA to consider presenting to senior-level policymakers and decision-makers for use in present-day planning:
• Eighty percent of all wars since 1815 (post-Treaty of Versailles) have been between enduring rivals, making these relations a primary concern of policymakers.
• Shifts toward parity are much more dangerous to international stability than power increases that do not seek to overturn current paradigms. For instance, a large increase in China's naval power will threaten stability more than a similar magnitude increase in its land power.
• Each confrontation within a rivalry has a profound effect on the course of future confrontations.
• Only in modern history did the financial costs of a rivalry start to burden the entire state. Prior to that, only governments went bankrupt, while the underlying economy grew as a result of the rivalry. Nowadays the governments run the great risk of bankrupting all the sectors-private and public-of their countries.
• Thucydides' explanation for the root cause of the Peloponnesian War-"Fear, Honor, Interest"-remains the best explanation for the start of and longevity of every rivalry recorded in the past 2,500 years. At times, the word prestige has been interchanged for honor. The classical scholar Donald Kagan has noted where one nation seeking to improve its honor or prestige tramples on another state's interests, conflict becomes nearly inevitable.
• Rivalries only start and end as a result of a major shock to the established international system. The world has recently endured a series of such shocks:
-The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, ending the Cold War, and assumedly ending the US-Russian rivalry (though recent events leave this conclusion open to question).
-The rise of another great power (China) within the global system.
-The impending collapse of Arab civilization.
-An ongoing remaking of the global economy in ways that will rival the impact of the Industrial Revolution (1760-1840).
• In virtually every case, particularly in the modern era, this ongoing "peacetime" competition is fought out primarily in the communications and commercial/economic sphere
• After a loss, the need to redress the humiliation of defeat, and to gain an acceptable long-term status quo means that the defeated and "temporarily" weaker rival almost always undertakes actions designed to weaken its foe, as it prepares for the next major effort.
v Executive Summary
• The winner of a confrontation almost always vacates the "space-between" that confrontation and the next, typically to its later detriment.
• The nature of a rivalry is that it is a contest. If one side retreats the other will fill the void, either on its own or through proxies.
• The crucial lesson to draw from this rivalry, one that is on display in every rivalry in the past 300 years, is that the size of an economy is not nearly as important as the capacity of a state to draw resources from that economy.
• States will typically continue a rivalry long past where there is any reasonable chance of a victory, often in "confidant hope of a miracle."
• Ideology often plays a major role in state governance that may have a profound impact on the capacity of a state to sustain a rivalry. Still, when a state is against the wall, geopolitics always trumps ideology.
• Remarkably, for 2,500 years, great powers, though capable of huge surges of power, have found it nearly impossible to maintain more than 50,000 combat troops at the margin of empire or their zone of interest for extended periods.
• The historical record is clear, if the dominant nation is unwilling to place its ground troops in harm's way, it is difficult to convince allies of the seriousness of its intent.
• Rivalries almost always cause policymakers to overly focus on minor issues and problems; and, to examine every international event through the prism of the ongoing rivalry.
The inability to explain events has always haunted political scientists. Though their data demonstrate that the militarized disputes are twice as likely to lead to war if there had been two previous such disputes, that fact alone does little to explain how such disputes got started, how they remain alive, or how a state and its leaders might avoid them. Explanations such as "Each dispute caused both parties to harden their positions so that war remained the only viable option" remain merely suppositions as data sets contain no evidence of actual hardening. Grasping all of this contextual messiness requires one to go far beyond a reliance on data sets and to delve deeply into all of the factors and conditions that propelled history's various enduring strategic rivalries forward. Only by doing this can one draw out vital lessons on rivalry management that will assist policymakers in navigating the dangerous shoals of new or re-emerging rivalries already becoming visible on the global horizon. These essays used to underpin the group's observations are not meant to replace the work of political scientists. Rather, they are the next logical step in developing a deeper understanding of the character and nature of enduring strategic rivalries, a step that 2. Typically (that is, almost never), states do not learn how to avoid future crises or methods of peacefully edging away from calamity. Rather, after each successive encounter both parties tend to become more belligerent.

Pushing these data further demonstrates the profound effect bullying has on future relations. In every data set examined for this report, save one, the third instance of bullying (threatening military conflict) led to war. Probably for reasons of "reputation," a major power could not allow itself to be seen as repeatedly backing down in the face of threats. The only example of states avoiding war in this situation was the Cuban missile crisis, where the threat of an impending nuclear holocaust hung over the proceedings. There are insufficient data to determine the overall effect of nuclear weapons on enduring state rivalries: it is impossible to build patterns out of a single data set containing a single example (the Cold War). Despite a few instances where one side replaced its strategic assessment with "hope" (e.g., Japan vs. United States), it is worth noting that the crises under study almost always occurred when both sides viewed the net balance of power between them as roughly equal, giving each a perceived chance of winning a conflict. The assumption is that a weaker state is unlikely to provoke a crisis with a more powerful one.
The historical record is likely more mixed then the data sets allow, particularly in the modern era. For instance, the data do not adequately capture the effect of a superpower standoff. During the Cold War, Cuba was capable of provoking any number of crises situations with the far more powerful United States, on the assumption that American policymakers would draw back rather than allow a localized crisis create a wider dispute with the Soviet Union. Moreover, the data fail to capture the effects of the "edge of empire" or the "edge of power." For instance, during World War II, Japan, with only 10 percent of America's industrial capacity, was able to withstand four years of total war before its collapse. The length of this struggle reflects the fact that as the war grew closer to Japan, its relative strength grew, as the United States was forced to project forces of greater distances. Similarly, 2,500 years ago, tiny Athens was able to resist the might of Persia because the Persians were capable of projecting only a fraction of their total power 1-2 at the edges of their vast empire. In the future, even if the United States remains vastly superior to any other state in total military power, it may find it progressively more difficult to win in the immediate vicinity of a near-peer competitor.
Further revelations from the study of the data sets:
• Most enduring rivalries do not start out as long-term "hate affairs." States often do not even perceive themselves as involved in an enduring rivalry for many years after its initiation or after multiple militarized disputes.
• In the early years of a developing rivalry, the single most crucial factor in its continuance and militarization is domestic politics. In almost every case, hardening attitudes and increased belligerence correlate very closely to a rapid rise in the level of agitation not to retreat from a perceived provocation.
• Power shifts (real or perceived) double the chance of war. In this regard, shifts toward parity are most likely to start wars. For instance, a doubling of the US nuclear arsenal is unlikely (according to the data) to inflame the US-Sino protorivalry, as increasing an already overwhelming US nuclear preponderance does little to affect the current strategic calculus. On the other hand, a dramatic rise in Chinese nuclear weaponry, aimed at achieving parity with the United States, would radically alter each side's strategic calculus and would have a much higher probability of leading to conflict. A clear historical example of this effect was Germany's drive to build a fleet the equal to Great Britain's at the start of the twentieth century.
• The course and consequences of each successive conflict within an enduring rivalry profoundly affect subsequent conflicts. For instance, the reasons for the French military defeat in the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) directly affected its military approach in World War I, while the consequences of that earlier war provided the rationale for France's later war aims.
• All enduring rivalries appear to have certain strategic commonalities:
-an outstanding set of unresolved issues, -strategic interdependence, -a psychological manifestation of enmity, and -repeated militarized conflicts (not necessarily war).
• Changes in preference and perception often affect the course of rivalries. For instance, when the United States no longer appeared interested in absorbing Canada, coupled with American perception that it faced greater threats than those posed by Great Britain, it became much easier to manage both nations' commercial competition without militarizing disputes.

• Major shocks to the global system are a necessary catalyst and a key ingredient in the development of an enduring strategic rivalry. For instance, there was little room for a new strategic-level rivalry to take hold during the Cold War. Only after the demise of the Soviet Union was it possible for new rivalries to emerge. And just as it was the collapse of German power, as well as the fall of two other empires (Russian and Austro-Hungarian) in the wake of World War I, that opened the door for the emergence of new rivalries.
• Disputes among recognized enduring rivalries are two times more likely to end in war than isolated, one-time disputes. Moreover, in the modern era (post-1815, or the Treaty of Versailles), 45 percent of all wars have been between enduring rivals. If one includes proto-rivalries, that total rises above 80 percent. * Moreover, 90 percent of all enduring rivalries end with a shock to the global system. For instance, the Persian-Roman rivalry in the east abruptly ended with the rise of Islam, as both powers were eventually subsumed by the rising power.
The data collected and utilized by political scientists provides a number of crucial points for consideration. However, from the point of view of policymakers, there are several major problems with this approach to examining enduring rivalries. This first becomes obvious in the widely accepted definition that political scientists have given to rivalries, which in their conception must always be militarized. Moreover, to be considered a rivalry, a certain number of disputes must be concentrated within a specific time span. Typically, if two rivals go twenty years without a militarized dispute (not necessarily a war), political scientists deem the rivalry at an end. The historical record, however, demonstrates that disputes can lie dormant for many decades before erupting once again into major intra-state conflict. Therefore, one must question the appropriateness of such an arbitrary number of "twenty years." What is lost by applying such an artificial is that all analysis of the decisions and events that keep the rivalry simmering go unexamined.
Further, political scientists in simplifying the data do not make room for enduring rivalries that do not end up in a series of violent conflicts. In this formulation, competition is not rivalry. For the policymaker, the analytical exclusion of competitions that fall short of war presents a clear problem: how does one examine methods from keeping a competition-let us say a hard-fought global commercial rivalry-from turning into a shooting war? As a number of violent enduring rivalries arose only after a prolonged period of commercial (that is, economic) competition, the political science approach neglects any examination of how to keep competitive interactions from creating the conditions for militarized hostility. Such disregard of enduring commercial rivalries that never become violent conflicts deprives policymakers of evidence-based guidance on how one might compete for economic predominance without causing a war.
In establishing a complete set of guideposts for strategists and policymakers, it is, therefore, essential to scrutinize both (1) commercial rivalries that have turned violent and (2) those that remain peaceful. The first may illuminate untaken opportunities that could have avoided war, while the second may present lessons on the accommodations necessary for extending peace during period of intense competition. Unfortunately, in this regard, the data underpinning political science research have little to offer. For commercial rivalries turned violent, the data tell us a lot about the number of disputes and their intervals, but present little in the way of explanation. In the latter-a non-violent competition-the data are silent, as these conditions are not included in their data collections.
The inability to explain events has always haunted political scientists. Though their data demonstrate that the militarized disputes are twice as likely to lead to war if there had been two previous such disputes, that finding alone does little to explain how such disputes got started, how they remain alive, or how one might avoid them. Explanations such as "Each dispute caused both parties to harden their positions so that war remained the only viable option" remain merely suppositions as data sets contain no evidence of actual hardening. To make sense of the volumes of data typically employed by political scientists, they have developed techniques that tend in many ways to distort actual events. This is most often done by selecting one or two variables to test, while either ignoring or "controlling" for all of the other variables affecting a solution. In short, the political scientists remove both the context and messiness. Policymakers and strategists, on the other hand, always work in a world filled with context and where messiness prevails. And, in reality, extraneous variables are rarely controlled, as they wreak havoc on the best-laid plans.
Grasping all of this contextual messiness requires one to go far beyond a reliance on data sets and to delve deeply into all of the factors and conditions that propelled history's various enduring strategic rivalries forward. Only by doing this can one draw out vital lessons on rivalry management that will assist policymakers in navigating the dangerous shoals of new or re-emerging rivalries already becoming visible on the global horizon. The essays used to underpin the observations presented here are not meant to replace the work of political scientists. Rather, they are the next logical step in developing a deep understanding of the character and nature of enduring strategic rivalries, a step that explains not only what happened but why.
The existing literature on enduring strategic rivalries commonly breaks such rivalries into three main types. (Unfortunately, the strategic pairs of rivalries examined for this project fail to bear out the existence of these simple categories.)
• Spatial -Where rivals contest exclusive control of a region.
• Ideological -Rivals contest the superiority of their particular belief systems, whether they are religious, economic, or political.
• Positional -A contest over relative influence and prestige within a system. 
5
Similarly, the evidence that enduring rivalries are maintained by deep ideological difference is, at best, not proven. Though ideological differences are often present in some of the rivalries, particularly in the modern era, in every case where a choice is required between ideology or advancing geopolitical interests, ideology is thrown away. Though ideology colors attitudes and, as a result, becomes a prism through which rivals evaluate each other's actions, it rarely, if ever, plays a dominant role in determining state actions. Prestige and garnering influence, on the other hand, come with a specific problem: it is a part of the reason behind every action of every state in existence, making it impossible to separate out the positional concerns of strategic rivals from the concerns they would have if the state had no rival. The evidence demonstrates that positional concerns mount once a rivalry is underway, with each party casting around for allies and other support from within the current state system. In fact, once a rivalry is underway Prestige becomes the dominant factor in pushing diplomatic crises toward war.
Dismissing the current explanatory paradigm for strategic rivalries begs the question: What will replace it? As one reviews the historical examples, however, it becomes clear that there was no need to establish a new paradigm, as one already exists. What Thucydides wrote 2,500 years ago, as he elucidated the reasons for the Athenian-Spartan rivalry, still suffices to explain state motivations and actions in every rivalry under consideration in this work.
And the nature of the case first compelled us to advance our empire to its present height; fear being our principal motive, though honor and interest afterwards came in… And no one can quarrel with a people for making in matters of tremendous risk, the best provision that it can for its interest… It 1-6 follows that it was not very remarkable action or contrary to the common practice of mankind, if we did not accept an empire that was offered to us, and refused to give it up under the pressure of the three strongest motives, fear, honor, and interest.

In this collection of essays, both Geoffrey Wawro and Williamson Murray illustrate that many of Germany's pre-World War I actions were motivated by its desire to gain prestige in a European environment where it was viewed as the new kid on the block, having only become a unified nation in 1870. One would have to peer deep indeed to see any motivation besides attempting to increase its prestige (honor) for Germany to be provoking successive crises in Bosnia and Morocco between 1906 and 1911. Moreover, it is easy to see how the "fear" engendered by Germany's actions propelled the spate of Alliance making that aligned the great powers-England, France, Russia-against the German state. In defending this alignment, David Lloyd George in his famous Mansion House Speech stated, I believe it is essential that Britain should at all hazards maintain her prestige among the great world powers… I say emphatically that peace at that price [abandoning France] would be a humiliation intolerable for a great country like ours to endure.

Britain could clearly see the risks to the standing national order presented by an aggressive German state, but it still felt the need to clothe the decisions that led it into war as acts of honor without ever spending much time making a case for war based on its own interests. How much different it was two decades later when Sir Neville Chamberlin defended his dooming Czechoslovakia, by appeasing Hitler at Munich, by explaining the lack of British interests in the region. Demonstrating, however that honor remained a crucial ingredient in geopolitics, Churchill said of the Munich agreement, "The government had to choose between war and shame. They chose shame. They will get war." Despite having as few practical interests in Poland as they had in Czechoslovakia, both Britain and France, after the humiliation of Munich, felt honor bound to go to war when Poland's sovereignty was threatened.
It did not have to be this way. After the unification of the German state, Chancellor Bismarck clearly saw that both Russia and France perceived a unified Germany as a threat. To counter this, Bismarck undertook a charm offensive aimed at keeping France isolated from any power that could help it gain revenge for its defeat in the Franco-Prussian war (1870). During his travels, Bismarck constantly repeated the phrase "Wir sind satt!" ("We are full!"), trying to convince Russia and others that Germany was now a satisfied power, with no further territorial ambitions. Such protestations came with reminders of the long friendship between Russia and Prussia, which were part of the coalition to defeat Napoleon and maintain the "Concert of Europe" for the better part of a century. But as Henry Kissinger points out, honeyed words about conservative solidarity and the traditional friendship between Prussia and Russia meant nothing in the face of national self-interest.

Similarly, we will see at the nexus of honor and interest is war. By any measure, the German decision at the beginning of the twentieth century to build a fleet capable of challenging Britain on the high seas was a foolish measure. In practical strategic terms, the effort consumed vast resources that Germany desperately missed when war erupted in 1914. Moreover, it did so with almost no practical gain, as the bulk of the German High Seas Fleet spent almost the entire war in port, taking no part in disrupting British commerce or even attempting to break the blockade that was strangling the German economy. Except for one brief foray out to Jutland, which ended in ignominious retreat as the British fleet approached, the German navy was not heard from for the remainder of the war. What is remarkable in this entire episode is that with France and Russia already allied against her, Germany undertook the one measure that was sure to alarm Britain. By deciding to build a fleet that could contest the British Royal Navy on the high seas, Germany, in a single stroke, ended hundreds of years of Anglo-French hostility, as both former historic rivals found more to "fear" from the growth of German economic and military power then they did from each other. For the Germans, the building of a great fleet 1-8 was a matter of honor, but for the British, the German fleet was a sword pointed at its heart.
The German example of the relevance of "fear, honor, and interest" in creating and propelling a strategic rivalry is not a standalone instance. Similar concerns and motivations can be extrapolated from every enduring rivalry covered in this work. For instance, the competition between Rome and Carthage was about security [fear], greed [interest], and ambition [honor]. Rome intervened in Sicily against Carthage because it feared the Carthaginian threat to the trading interests of its southern Italian allies, because it coveted Sicilian wealth, and also because ambitious Romans sought a new arena for winning glory. On the other side of the rivalry ledger, Hannibal invaded Italy because he inherited a fear and hatred of Rome from the First Punic War, while also considering Rome a threat to his country's-and his family's-empire in Spain.
Later, led by Cato, Rome attacked Carthage in the Third Punic War because it feared a Carthaginian military revival, disliked Carthaginian commercial competition in the western Mediterranean, and coveted Carthage's wealth. Because of this combination of concerns, we have Cato picking up some figs that had just arrived from Carthage to remind his fellow citizens that their most feared foe was growing stronger daily, and were only three sailing days from their shores. In every speech after that staged event, Cato played on Roman fears and their interest in their own expansion by ending with the statement, "ceterum censeo Carthaginem esse delendam" ("Furthermore I consider that Carthage must be destroyed.") Eventually, the combination of fear (Roman mothers still used Hannibal as the bogeyman in children's dreams), honor (supporting their Numidian Allies then under attack by Carthage), and interest (Rome needed the highly productive Carthaginian agricultural system to feed its burgeoning population) led to war and Carthage's utter destruction. 
10
A similar tale is found in every enduring strategic rivalry from antiquity to the late twentieth century. Such concerns are so common that political scientists have coined the term "Thucydidean Trap" as a way of describing current international tensions that might lead to war. 
11
One of the observations political scientists drew from their data is that that rivalry ignitions require a major shock to the established global system or order. Historical analysis bears this out. Moreover, it appears that it requires a similar huge international 1-9 disruption to end a rivalry, though the traumatic end of the rivalry could be the shock that both ends one rivalry and opens the door for the next e.g., Rome vs. Carthage.
Paul Rahe concludes that while the Spartan-Athenian alliance against Persia was often uneasy, as alliances nearly always are, it was a genuine alliance. It had been summoned into existence by the Persian threat, and it was not apt to dissolve as long as it seemed possible that Persia might attempt to conquer Greece. Only after the battles of Marathon, Salamis, and Plataea, coupled with the Athenian-led counterattack across the Aegean, did the Persian menace retreat-but opening the door to a split in the alliance and a growing rivalry.
It was perhaps inevitable that two such polities would come to blows. The difference in their respective ethos inevitably gave rise to misunderstandings and a measure of mutual dislike. Moreover, despite the best efforts of leaders in each city-state who were sympathetic to the concerns of the other, there were citizens in both Athens and Sparta who were suspicious of or resentful toward the other polity. In Sparta, those who found the growth in Athenian power daunting and, as a result, argued that Athens was the new Persia; and those at Athens who feared that sooner or later the Spartans would intervene in their affairs, as they had done in the past.
Still those propensities were held in check as long as a Persian resurgence was expected. Persia, until the advent of the Roman Empire, was the greatest empire in antiquity. Held together for 200 years by a huge and efficient military force, it had for most of that time been an overawing threat to Greece. The sudden removal of that threat was, by any measure, a tectonic shift in power arrangements that had dominated the eastern Mediterranean for centuries. Were it not for the demise of Persian power and influence in the region, neither Sparta nor Athens, the bulwarks of the anti-Persian coalition, would have dared allow their mutual antagonisms to dominate their relations. Similar shocks are found both at the start and end of the enduring strategic rivalries studied (see the table below on international shocks). Table 
1
• The two powers apparently tamp down the formation of other potential rivalries, though the evidence as to why or how is sparse. The leading explanations include the following:
-Other states do not possess the power to undertake a rivalry that may become militarized.
-Other states are able to conduct their own rivalries within the structure of the enduring strategic rivalry by choosing to join with opposing sides of the dominant rivalry.
Industrial Revolution, has expanded the interests of great states. In short, early rivalries, limited by the inability to overcome geography, could only be against states in relatively close proximity. In the modern era, states are not nearly as bound by such restrictions.
Systemic shocks not only provide the conditions for starting a rivalry, they are also required for ending one. In some cases, the required systemic shocks are a result of the climatic ending of a prior rivalry. For instance, the Carthage-Rome rivalry ended when one power (Rome) annihilated the other in 146 BC. Similarly, the German-European powers set of rivalries terminated when the other European powers (assisted by the United States) overran, occupied, and remade the German political system. Other rivalries ended because a new and more lethal danger arose. This is clearly visible in the ending of the Roman (Byzantine)-Persian rivalry, which was brought about by Arab raiders, propelled by the driving force of Islam, and threatening the destruction of both empires. The same is true of the Anglo-British rivalry, which was put aside when both sides began to perceive Germany as the greater threat.
What is the importance of this observation in today's world? In recent decades, the globe has undergone a series of systemic shocks to the global order, any one of which could establish the conditions for the emergence of a new rivalry, or possibly (in the case of a revived Russia) the extension of a previous one. These shocks include but unfortunately may not be limited to the following:
• The collapse of the Soviet Union, ending the Cold War and assumedly ending the US-Russian rivalry (though recent events leave this conclusion open to question).
• The rise of another great power (China) within the global system.
• The impending collapse of Arab civilization.
• An ongoing remaking of the global economy, in ways that will rival the effects of the Industrial Revolution.
Many researchers assume that if a new enduring rivalry is going to develop, it is likely to be between the United States and China. But a word of caution is in order. The globe is in a period of uncertainty, with the current international order facing a number of threats to its stability. Such periods have occurred before in history, and those experiences cast doubt upon our ability to forecast what the political order will look like in a few decades. It is possible that the United States is on the cusp of a new enduring rivalry with China, but that is far from preordained. Moreover, even if a rivalry does develop, it remains possible to keep it from becoming overly militarized or marked by periods of direct military conflict.
In more than 2,500 years of recorded history, the international system has rarely been 1-13   Introduction to Enduring Strategic Rivalries without a pair of rival states contending for power and influence. The exceptions are marked by one of three phenomena:
• A hegemon that no other power can contest, such as China for most of its history prior to the great European commercial empires establishing themselves in Asia.
• A stark period of widespread disorder (consider the Dark Ages in Western Europe).
• A number of smaller but just as intense regional rivalries develop, as there is no overarching rivalry to tamp down or subsume them. This may arguably have been the case in the post-Napoleonic world, where simultaneous rivalries were starting or ongoing (Anglo-American, Japan-China, Japan-Russia, and various German rivalries with its neighbors).
Given these choices, what is the most likely? Looking at the current global environment, one is tempted to say "all of them." Still, even as we witness increasing chaos in huge swaths of the world (the so-called "Arch of Crisis"), there remains a strong likelihood that the major powers can contain the spread of disorder within their current region(s). If one accepts that geopolitics is remerging after a temporary post-Cold War hiatus, coupling this with the observed pattern of rising regional powers (often multiple powers in a single region), then we have the making of a powerful, and in many ways, unique futurea system of rivalries.
Consider for a moment the strategic implications of a world in which the United States remains the predominate economic and military power, but is locked in multiple enduring rivalries with near-peer competitors-China, a resurgent Russia (assuming it overcomes its crippling economic and demographic challenges), and possibly even the European Union (particularly on the commercial level). Simultaneously, a number of regional rivalries may be able to sustain themselves as the rivalries between those powers with global reach never would achieve the red-hot intensity that would force the rest of the world to pick a side. Or conditions do not form where every act of other states is seen through the prism of the overarching "great rivalry." Such a world would be prone to periodic dangerous flare-ups in widely disseminated locations. Sustaining order in this world would require the United States (as the remaining dominate power) to undertake a very delicate balancing game between multiple powers. Unfortunately, within such a global order the United States may be unable to dictate every solution. Still, it may be one where the United States can still have a strong influence in most affairs-something similar to the United Kingdom from 1815 to at least 1914.
The other alternative is a US retreat from hegemonic power (no longer accepting the role of global policeman), perhaps with the specific intent of avoiding a possibly draining rivalry-assuming that avoiding a rivalry is even possible, as rivalries have an internal 1-14 dynamic that makes them difficult, if not impossible, to avoid. In this case, a US retreat opens the door to a selection of not mutually exclusive options:
• Another hegemon will step into the vacuum, inserting a new paradigm in place of the current liberal global order-one that may be inimical to the interests of the United States and the West.
• Multiple rivalries will co-exist without a powerful balancing force to tamp down their excesses (e.g., a situation similar to what existed during the rise of Germany and Japan in the 1930s).
• No rivalries take hold as global disorder increases in a world where less powerful states (the regional powers), with a limited perception of their stake in an established world order, are incapable of containing violent excesses.
An American retreat from hegemony is extremely unlikely to lead to a universal utopia. As the alternatives to American engagement all imperil the liberal world order from which the United States has benefitted, one is forced to accept continuing American engagement as the one remaining viable action. Such a choice not only risks the formation (or continuation) of a strategic enduring rivalry, it is, historically speaking, a foregone conclusion. This leads to several important questions that are addressed later in the essays:
• How have enduring rivalries maintained themselves over time?
• Can the competitions between rivals be carried out without turning into an enduring series of wars?
• Do enduring rivalries always enervate, i.e., weaken, the participating powers? If not, how does a nation avoid the inevitable exhaustion?
Systemic shocks and "fear, honor, interest" can go far toward explaining the macro conditions for the start of a rivalry. But one can also examine the historical record to determine if there are any specific circumstances common to the start of an enduring rivalry. Here the record appears mixed (see Table 
2
In some cases, the rivalry gets underway immediately after the shock that preceded it (the Franco-German rivalry began immediately upon German unification in 1870). In these cases, however, the groundwork for the rivalry (national or ethnic animosity, previous periods of rivalry) was established decades or even centuries before. In most historical cases, however, there was a substantial period-in some cases stretching decades-from when the preconditions for a rivalry were established and when the rivalry actually began.
Furthermore, many rivalries are well underway long before both sides elevate their competition to war, though, particularly in the modern era, there tends to be a number of 1-15 militarized conflicts prior to the outbreak of hostilities (e.g., the successive international crises prior to August 1914). Interestingly, the event that starts a major period of armed hostility is, more often than not, located some distance from where the rivals are geographically adjacent, and typically remains far removed from the central theater(s) of conflict once war erupts. intermittent violent conflict in which each successive round of fighting increases the intensity of the conflict. Between these wars, passions rarely subside and the competition continues. In virtually every case, particularly in the modern era, this ongoing "peacetime" competition is fought out primarily in the communications and commercialeconomic sphere. Moreover, even during periods of peace, rival states often employ proxies to continue armed conflicts. It is in this period, recently referred to by Dr. Nadia Shadlow as the "space between," that both sides continue the struggle through other means to set the conditions for the next round of direct warfare. 
12
More recently, we can see the difference in the level of preparations each side took prior to World War I, in contrast to the interwar years (1919-1939), where the Allied powers only began their mobilization process at the eleventh hour. Similarly, the Western nations, included the United States, tend to pull back from risky engagements in the wake of Cold War conflicts, vacating a space that our previous foes were quick to fill. Where this happened (South Vietnam), the results were often negative for the nation or region previously under our protection. Where the United States remained involved (South Korea), a political and military standoff was the most likely result. In the Cold War's big picture, the containment policy was just barely sufficient to maintain an expensive global competition, despite many setbacks, until the Soviet Union imploded because of its wasteful economic system.
Conflicts that end short of the total defeat of one side or the other rarely affect the underlying causes of a strategic rivalry; hence, it is difficult to fathom why one side of a rivalry all but vacates the "space between" even after it is clear that the other side is remaining active. The most likely answer is that, as this is typically the course taken by the winner of the previous conflict, that power is now "satisfied." The loser of that conflict, however, is far from satisfied, and through the prism with which its policymakers view the world, the post-conflict status quo has turned against their interests. Victory is, therefore, seen by one side as an opportunity to demobilize, return to peaceful pursuits, and either reduce or redirect government expenditures.
For the loser, however, the advent of peace is a period in which to recoup lost strength, rebuild its finances, and otherwise prepare for a future opportunity to overturn the status quo (e.g., Germany in the post-Versailles era). Circumstances may dictate that the losing side of conflict will have to eschew another war, or an overly militarized direct confrontation, for a possibly prolonged period. Still, the need to redress the humiliation of 1-17 defeat and to gain an acceptable long-term status quo means that the defeated and "temporarily" weaker rival almost always undertakes actions designed to weaken its foe, as it prepares for the next major effort. The "space between" can easily become a period of military, diplomatic, and economic contests designed to both weaken and test the resolve of a rival even as it works to avoid a direct confrontation. As Geoffrey Wawro indicates, The timeless lesson is clear. A power eclipsed by another is not disarmed; on the contrary, it can use military deterrents, alliances, finances, trade, and levers of the media and public opinion (soft power) to improve its relative situation and thwart the "winner."
All of this is done for one purpose: to improve the weaker rival's position relative to the stronger, for the next great contest (i.e., war).
James Anderson details the many examples of how rivals can and do contest the "space between," short of taking each other on in a direct confrontation. In his essay on the long Cold War rivalry, Anderson outlines how the US-USSR enmity was undertaken across the full spectrum of state interactions, e.g., proxy wars, terror, diplomacy, economics, trade, intelligence, and communications. Where the Cold War differs from many previous historic examples is that both sides strongly contested the "space between." Typically, one side (the stronger) vacates much of this space to its later detriment. More typically, only when one side of the rivalry overreaches does it become possible for the other side to mobilize its population and expand its military resources to counter the moves of the other. By this time, the crisis is usually so far advanced that another war is already on the immediate horizon. Examples in the modern era include the following:
• The Japanese advances in East Asia are going mostly uncontested by the United States until midway into 1941 when an oil embargo was established.
• During the inter-war years, Germany's military, diplomatic, and economic moves went un-countered until after the Munich crisis.
• At the beginning of the twentieth century, Germany was not perceived as overreaching by the United Kingdom until after Kaiser Wilhelm II began to build a high seas fleet. And the French did not begin to counter Germany's increasing aggressiveness until after the 1908 Moroccan crisis.
More recently, as Nadia Schadlow points out, our current difficulties with the Islamic State reflect the dangers of declaring victory (Iraq) and then mostly vacating the "space between."
Why rivalries start is often easier to grasp than the reasons for why they continue often for decades or centuries. The historical examples examined in this report reveal a simple answer: throughout the period of the rivalry, the two rivals remain dominant powers, are 1-18 still in close proximity, and concerns about "fear, honor, and interest" rarely abate. Moreover, each collision, whether militarized or not, hardens attitudes not only among a state's elite but also, and more dangerously, among the vast majority of the general population. At times such attitudes can be overcome by a state leader willing to take the political risk necessary to break the paradigm. But that takes a statesman of unusual ability who is also previously identified as a foe of the rival. For instance, only Churchill, a wellknown staunch enemy of the Soviet Union, could have welcomed the USSR into the Allied coalition in June 1941 ("If Hitler invaded hell I would at least make a favorable reference to the devil in the House of Commons"). Similarly, "Only Nixon could have gone to China." Both of these budding enduring rivalries were halted because each side recognized they faced a larger threat, one whose defeat required the cooperation of the other.
Despite the ongoing underlying reasons for the continuance of rivalries, at some point, one would assume the rival states would take note of the costs. The standard assumption is that each conflict between rival states becomes progressively more ruinous, particularly in financial terms. The problem is that, in most cases, the standard assumption is wrong. Take the multiple Anglo-French rivalries. With the exception of the years of the Black Death and the English Civil War, British GDP rose, including substantial increases during periods of military conflict and in the decades thereafter.

The reality was that wars were, at least until the modern era, ruinous for a government's finances, with many governments going bankrupt because of extended conflicts. But as these governments were rarely able to tax away much more than a few percentages of the wealth of a state, one could see what would be a paradox in the modern world: bankrupt governments sitting on top of a burgeoning economy. If we were to examine Angus Madison's statistics for the period after the Industrial Revolution, major rivalries are clearly good for economic growth.

Introduction to Enduring Strategic Rivalries Source: Maddison (2001)   
What does this mean? In the years prior to the Industrial Revolution and its coinciding financial revolution, the financial damage of a rivalry was mostly inflicted on state finances. The bankruptcy of the central government could slow a state's economic growth for a time: for example, the Bardi-Peruzzi collapse when England's default on debts incurred in the Hundred Years' War plunged Europe into an economic depression. But it was rarely sufficient to damage the underlying economy or even hold it back for long.
This phenomena puts a new twist on what Paul Kennedy termed "imperial overstretch." Government finances might, and often did, become overstretched, but such an event appears to have had only a temporary effect on the broader economy. This changed when governments gained the capability to access huge portions of a state's income and wealth to support a rivalry or conflict. This had two results:
• First, there was typically a huge upsurge in economic performance, as the economy reacted to what amounted to a sustained bout of Keynesian spending.
• Second, as this spending typically went toward sectors incapable of generating a self-sustaining virtuous cycle of economic growth, it inevitably began damaging the real economy. In time, such damage made it impossible to maintain spending aimed at winning an enduring rivalry (one example is the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991).
Such spending in a concentrated period (war) could fundamentally wreck a nation's economy and finances in a relatively short time. Great Britain, for instance, was close to financial ruin before the United States tipped World War II's financial scales for the better. Despite the US financial aid, the war's cost so damaged the British economy that post-war ruin was only averted through a huge low-interest loan from America. In contrast, when such spending ended with military defeat, as it did for Germany and Japan at the end of World War II, the economic damage was devastating. It took large amounts of American post-war financial assistance, coupled with American spending for its next rivalry, now with the Soviet Union, made the recovery of these vanquished nations possible.
For future rivalries, the implications of these economic and financial changes are possibly enormous. First, the cost of sustaining a prolonged militarized rivalry is going to absorb vastly larger sums as a percentage of a state's GDP than historically has been the case. As such, the effect on the underlying economy of both rivals will be much broader, putting at risk the broad public support the states had previously enjoyed in historic rivalries. The question remains: If a rivalry is going to be sustained over decades, what percentage of GDP can be employed without damaging the host economy and thus removing public support. Here, the jury remains out. The United States was able to sustain military spending in excess of 6 percent of GDP during much of the Cold War, while we know that spending in the vicinity of 17 percent, during the same period, wrecked the Soviet Union's economy. As S. C. M. Paine states, Leonid Brezhnev overextended Russia financially and territorially by failing to fix the economy, whose growth had stagnated, while still funding an expanding list of expensive adventures in the Third World and missile deployments in Europe. The [Soviet Union's] assisted suicide included the militarization of the Russo-Chinese frontier, which was far more expensive for Russia than for China, whose population density formed a powerful defense. Russia, whose eastern periphery had hardly any Russian population, relied on expensive mechanized forces. These expenses in combination of Russian military expenses garrisoning Eastern Europe and defending against NATO constituted an enormous financial burden on a not particularly productive economy.
Though the United States committed only a third as much of its economy, as a percentage of GDP, to winning the Cold War, it did not escape economic strain, particularly when the nation later launched its simultaneous "great society" initiatives. As James Anderson reminds us, Over time, the costs of maintaining such large forces at home and overseas-though never as crippling as what the Soviets endured-left a deep imprint on the U.S. economy. The military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned America about in his Farewell Address (January 17,  1961) came into existence and continued growing. Large, and by U.S. historical standards, unprecedented peacetime military spending distorted 1-22 the economy: the government soaked up research dollars at the expense of the private sector, and the practice of spreading procurement dollars across a large number of congressional districts made defense spending more to responsive political interests than to strategic ones.
In the immediate future though, there may be complications that are worth contemplating. For instance. the historical evidence appears to show that sustaining support for even a modest expenditure of GDP on a state's military often requires a rapidly growing economy. Support for such expenditures rapidly ebbs as an economy stagnates or enters a period of slow growth.
Further, while the evidence for this is not as clear, as states undertake large social commitments, there appears to be a pronounced tendency to forgo military spending in favor of entitlement spending. In the past, rivalries ended or more often went into hibernation when its costs were sufficient to bring about "Kennedy's "imperial overstretch." In the future, rivalries may end because of "entitlement overstretch." At the moment, this is speculative, but it is worth noting that the rivalries that ended with World War II required the victors to incur debt loads in excess of 100 percent of GDP. Historically, nations have been able to sustain, for a short period, debts in excess of 200 percent (e.g., Great Britain in 1815, and Japan in the present day). However, it is worth asking this: Can a nation sustain a rivalry if its debt load is already in excess of 100 percent of GDP before said rivalry even begins? Moreover, can it finance a conflict if its debt exceeds 200 percent before the conflict is nearly over?
No one knows if a modern nation, particularly one that can finance its debt in its own currency, will break at debt loads of 250 percent or 300 percent of GDP. What is certain is that it there is a number where financial collapse becomes inevitable. At the moment, this is unchartered territory but the answer will have large implications for the establishing and sustaining any future rivalry.
Still, nationalism and other factors can still motivate populations and rekindle even a waning rivalry. While the underlying economics may dictate how long a strategic rivalry can continue, such planning is often overrun by flashes of national passions, particularly if they are being stoked by internal politics. Often a rivalry is continued purely because it is fed by the internal posturing of one state or another. For instance, as Geoffrey Wawro points out, by 1911 the Franco-German rivalry had been brought down to a lower temperature. L'affaire Dreyfus has caused French politicians to look inward for explanations of who and what were undermining the Republic. Moreover, most Frenchmen had come to terms with the loss of Alsace-Lorraine after their annexation in 1871 by Germany, which they did not see as worthy of risking a major industrial war. Besides, French politicians were able to point to their rapidly expanding colonial empire as more than sufficient recompense for the loss of a province or two. But as suddenly as the rivalry had waned, it sparked to life again in 1911. The lost provinces again became an unhealthy 1-23 obsession, not for strategic reasons-the lost frontier had been sealed with a belt of new fortresses from Verdun to Belfort in the 1870s-but for opportunistic political ones. French politicians intoxicated voters with fairy tales about resurgent French pride and power. From that point forward, the French Army entered a period of rapid expansion that soon caught the attention of the Germans. Hence, a rivalry that had been tamped down in favor of pursuing other interest roared back to life as a result of a political enthusiasm of the moment. Geoffrey Parker posits another theory for the longevity of enduring rivalries long past the time when it was in the interest of one or both states to conclude them. In Parker's example, the Spanish King Philip IV's ministers constructed an elaborate "domino theory" to justify the fighting. In 1624, they warned that "once the Netherlands are lost, America and other kingdoms of Your Majesty will also immediately be lost with no hope of recovering them." Four years later, a Spanish official in Brussels repeated the point: "If we lose the Netherlands, we will not be able to defend America, Spain, or Italy." A few years later a veteran diplomat extended the argument yet further: "We cannot defend the Netherlands if we lose Germany." Like the Spanish Hapsburgs, political leaders, always seem more disposed to take risks in order to avoid losses than to make gains.
Obviously, this is not a stance limited to a particular era. It is a recurring theme in many historical rivalries; most famously, it was used as a justification for American involvement in Southeast Asia during the Cold War. While the domino theory of risk avoidance has been discredited in the popular imagination, it still has much of its historic credibility. Events acquire momentum: one defeat or withdrawal has historically led to a series of such incidents.
Within the United States, Vietnam may have created a backlash against using the domino theory to support intervention, but that does not negate its practical reality. The nature of a rivalry is that it is a contest. If one side retreats the other will fill the void, either on its own or through proxies. Without commenting on the rights or wrongs of America's withdrawal from Iraq, we are likely witnessing this process now as the Islamic State projects itself to wherever it detects a vacuum of power. Historically, this process continues until the expansion is checked by military force or until the expanding power pauses to consolidate its gains. generate wealth often became a rival's primary target. In this regard, Michael Leggiere notes the following:
Acknowledging that British gold had financed the three previous coalition wars, Napoleon targeted the heart of Britain's power: its maritime economy. Lacking the resources either to invade Britain or decisively defeat the Royal Navy at sea and unable to compete with Britain's maritime policy in a conventional manner, Napoleon developed an alternate maritime economic strategy: the Continental System. As a result of the Industrial Revolution, Britain emerged as Europe's manufacturing and industrial center. To ruin its economy by causing inflation and debt, Napoleon implemented an embargo against British trade with the European nations under his control. Without having the European market to buy its manufactured goods and the reexport of colonial goods, he expected Britain to experience a severe depression, hurting the nation's economy and ability to maintain its global colonial empire. Knowing that public opinion could unseat a British Cabinet, he hoped a depression would usher in a new government that would be willing to accept French dominance of the Continent. Moreover, Napoleon believed his new System would not only cause the British grave problems, but would open the door to a tremendous expansion of French trade, that would rush in to fill the void. His hope was the France would soon replace Britain as the economic engine of Europe. But Napoleon miscalculated. Britain found new markets and the Continental system leaked like a sieve. Rather than weaken Britain, Napoleon's blockade actually strengthened the British economy. Worse, the blockade had a crippling effect on the rest of Europe, which was thrown into an economic depression when the Royal Navy brought overseas European trade to a near stand-still. Napoleon had discovered the one strategy that made his enemy stronger while increasingly weakening the French economy, which was progressively undermined by his economic warfare aimed at Britain. Leggiere continues:
As a result of the crippling effects of the Continental System, Czar Alexander issued a decree on 31 December 1810 to tax luxury goods and wines, some of France's largest exports. Moreover, the decree opened Russian ports to neutral ships carrying British exports. British goods soon flooded the markets of Eastern and Central Europe. Napoleon had few choices other than to force Alexander's continued participation in the Continental System. Thus, in 1811, both emperors started preparing for war.
In other words, rather than suspend execution of a strategy that was damaging his own interests and helping his rival, Napoleon doubled down. The result was the annihilation of French army in the Russian snows, setting Napoleon on the path of irreversible ruin. Napoleon had picked the right target-he just applied the wrong strategy. He may have been better off emulating Britain's internal economic policies, which allowed a state with only a third of France's population and land mass to punch far above its apparent weight.
Geoffrey Parker presents us with an example of the results of extending rivalry commitments beyond the state's capacity to meet the financial obligations required by its strategy:
The central government ran up a sovereign debt far beyond Spain's capacity to service: 85 million ducats by 1598, over 112 million by 1623, almost 182 million by 1667, and almost 223 million by 1687. Public Sector Borrowing on this scale-ten times total revenues, if not more-drained capital and raw materials from Spain, undercut local manufactures, and encouraged a "rentier" mentality among those sectors of the population with the potential to be entrepreneurs; while the need to create and increase taxes to repay lenders led to onerous fiscal expedients (especially duties on sales and on manufactures) with high social and economic costs. Worst of all, most tax revenues were remitted abroad, to fund armies and navies fighting to achieve international goals that mattered to the dynasty but not to most Spaniards. The government of Philip IV exported at least 150 million ducats to fund his foreign wars.
As a result, Spain became a serial defaulter, which had vast negative consequences for its capacity to sustain a rivalry as well as the economy that underpinned it. This is one of the few cases where the economic effects of a rivalry (or in Spain's case, rivalries) did substantial damage to the underlying economy. As a result, it eventually undermined public support for continuing the rivalry (particularly among the elites who became liable for taxes they had been previously excused from paying). Why this happened is probably a result of circumstances particular to Spain and its Hapsburgs. While other rivalries were marked by long periods of peace between periodic wars, Spain and the Hapsburgs were usually at war on multiple fronts. Just one conflict, the Eighty Years' War against the Netherlands, cost more silver than was being shipped from the lucrative mines of the New World. Add this to Spain's inability or refusal to modernize its financial and administrative system, and collapse was unavoidable. The miracle was that it endured for as long as it did.
France, under the influence of a reforming Cardinal Richelieu and the modernizing minister Jean-Batiste Colbert, had learned the lessons the Spanish refused to heed. Their remaking of French financial institutions financed a vast expansion of French military power in the eighteenth century. According to Matthew Schumann, this transformation consisted of high tariffs and regulated industry making it one of the richest countries in Europe. Subsequent military expansion and reforms under Michel le Tellier and his son the Marquis de Louvois enabled France to field over 400,000 troops by the early 1690s. William and Leopold formed the League of Augsburg-titled the Grand Alliance as Spain and Britain joined at the end of the 1680s-in order to contain this power, and they gained enormously from turns of fate far away from the battlefield. Louvois' unexpected death in 1691 and a major crop failure in 1693 harmed Louis' finances, forcing 1-27 him to choose by 1695 between army and naval priorities. Unable to keep up the arms race with England, France maintained a respectable fleet but largely abandoned the guerre d'escadre philosophy of fleet-to-fleet combat. Seeking to save money from his naval budget, Louis turned instead to guerre de course, or commerce raiding, based largely on privateers.
In sum, although dynastic and religious issues were clearly at play, the Anglo-French rivalry ultimately hinged on land claims and state finances. Nationalized industry and trade enabled Louis XIV to seek dynastic glory with an oversized military-and to keep Europe in awe-through most of his long reign. Though allied with the Stuart kings, Louis' dominance in European affairs put the English people on edge, sparking the Glorious Revolution. With substantial Dutch help, Britain soon emerged as a major financier for France's enemies, and set France on the defensive in the colonies, at sea, on land and at the negotiating table . 

Britain was able to finance its rivalry against France and subsidize numerous European allies because it undertook a financial revolution to coincide with its 1688 political revolution. Schumann continues: Built up initially by Dutch investments and financial know-how, England turned itself into a worthy rival for a France whose internal wealth had grown considerably under Cardinal Richelieu, Cardinal Mazarin, Colbert, and Louvois. Despite having only one-third of the population, far fewer resources, and less-well-developed internal communications than France, Britain greatly benefited from much more sophisticated financial systems, supporting a huge fleet and large subsidies for Continental allies. By 1748, British superiority was clear enough to prompt a major shift in French strategic thinking, marked by the rise of the Gournay circle and ambitious projects in several colonial theatres. The pace of these reforms was too slow to be effective, yet fast enough to pique British ire and lead to catastrophic French defeat in the Seven Years' War. After 1763, political turmoil in London made peace a vital interest for the British, while Choiseul turned France away from its former dynastic concerns on the continent to concentrate more fully on its major financial and strategic rival.
The crucial lesson to draw from this rivalry, one that is on display in every rivalry in the past 300 years is that the size of an economy is not near as important as is a state's capacity to draw resources from that economy. This reverses Paul Kennedy's famous observation "Victory has always gone to the side with the more flourishing production base."

Our historical survey has drawn mixed conclusions on the importance of ideology for starting and sustaining a rivalry. For most of recorded history, religion provided the ideological underpinning for state actions. Just as Pope Urban II's blessing of "God wills it" (Deus volt) sent tens of thousands of Crusaders into the Levant, religion was always able to motivate the masses to action. In the modern era, religion as a motivating force was largely replaced by the ideology of the "-isms-communism, fascism, Nazism. If, as is clearly visible in the historical record, ideology plays a crucial rule in strategic rivalries, what makes this conclusion uncertain? Doubt prevails mostly as a result of the observation that religion is often a mask for what rulers were already inclined to do. This does not negate the considerable influence of religion as a motivating factor, but our historical analyses have found that removing religion as a consideration for starting and sustaining a rivalry does not change how states conducted their affairs. Geoffrey Parker directs attention to "As early as 1574, an English observer in the Netherlands discerned two motives for Philip II's refusal to negotiate with his enemies, 'The pride of the Spanish government and the cause of religion' "-a combination that the Habsburgs called "religion and reputation." Perhaps there is little difference between the concept of "religion and reputation" and the Thucydidean idea of "honor." But faith in an ideology (religion or an "ism") often has a tendency to replace reason and calculation with faith, the outcome being a negative effect that is rarely seen in state actions grounded in concerns of "fear, honor, interest." So we see Philip II sending the Spanish Armada to England despite numerous warnings that it would fail. As one Spanish captain warned, Unless God helps us by a miracle the English, who have faster and hardier ships than ours, and many more long range guns, and know their advantages as well as we do, will never close with us at all, but stand aloof and knock us to pieces with their culverins, without our being able to do them any serious harm.

In many cases, ideology infringes on a state's ability to conduct an accurate net assessment of its rival. Worse, even when an accurate assessment is made, ideology allows a state to ignore the math so it can undertake policies that by any reasonable calculation will lead to disaster. William Morgan shows how this worked in the US-Japan rivalry starting in 1897:
The two nations made accurate net assessments of material factors. They understood each other's resource base, trade flows, productive capability, and existing and planned force structure. Virtually all American and most 1-29 For instance, in what is increasingly looking like a "long war" with Islamists, one fails to see how their ideology can implement an economic program that has any hope of creating wealth in the modern world. Even if a group like the Islamic State occupied all twenty-two Arab nations, they would start with an economic base (including oil) not quite equal to Spain's. Given their ideological antagonisms toward everyone, they are unlikely to attract much needed foreign investment or integrate a collapsing economic system into a globalized world. In short, the Islamic State is following an ideology that should lead to an economic collapse much the way the Soviet Union's did (this does not mean that they are incapable of creating widespread destruction and misery before their ultimate collapse).
China has adopted a capitalist based economic system within an otherwise stifling political system, which has created huge amounts of wealth over the past two decades. The question remains, however, as to whether a capitalist economic model can survive within a communist political system, but history demonstrates that states forced to make a final choice between political ideology and economics typically favor their political system. Though China may be able to generate sufficient wealth to sustain an enduring rivalry, the case is unproven. architect of containment, in his famous long telegram to George C. Marshall, then secretary of state in 1946.

Obviously, geopolitics trumped ideology during World War II, as Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin made common cause despite two previous decades of ideological antipathy. As long as both sides were locked in a desperate struggle for survival, ideological tensions remained muted. Unfortunately, goodwill engendered by wartime cooperation soon dissipated. By the time of the Potsdam Conference (1945), if not earlier, ideological differences were reasserting themselves. Still, Soviet demands in the years after World War II were rarely based in ideology. Rather, they took the form of securing itself from another invasion from the West, which would have been the third in as many decades.
In the past, the extent of a state or empire not only determined much of its power, it also placed severe limits as to how much power could be expanded at the edges of its domains or any great distance from that state's center of power. This was first recognized by the Romans who found it increasingly difficult to project sufficient power from the political and economic center (Rome) to contest Parthian and later Sassanid (Persians) encroachments. Rome's solution was both novel and quite possibly unrepeatable by any other state (though Charles V tried something similar with the Habsburg state): they created a second center of power in Constantinople on the very edge of Parthian domains. The Roman Empire's new Eastern capital became so powerful that it outlasted the fall of Rome by almost a thousand years. But the creation of a new power center and the eventual defeat of the Parthians had unforeseen consequences. As Kenneth Harl points tell us: Rome defeated Parthia (even if diplomacy rather than Roman arms avenged Carrhae), but the result was the creation of a far more formidable rival. Sassanid Persia forced Rome to reorganize army and bureaucracy to defend the vital provinces of the eastern Mediterranean. This unseen consequence of victory over Persia in the third century was to transform Rome into a significantly a weaker power in the fourth century. The defeat of Julian in 363 put Rome and the imperial army on the defensive. The court of Constantinople thus could not lend significant aid to prevent the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century.
Geoffrey Parker reminds us that the extensive Hapsburg Empire faced a number of the same challenges as Rome. Many of the Hapsburg territories were far from the center of 1-32 government and therefore proved difficult to defend, leading to prolonged wars that exacted a high economic and human toll from the empire as a whole. The "empire on which the sun never set" became in the seventeenth century the "target" on which the sun never set. Beset by enemies on every border, Charles V blamed his inability to deal with them on "the distance that separates one state from another." As he viewed it, the central issue, was the slow speed at which information traveled that doomed him. Small problems at the edge of empire would turn into a crisis before he was even aware of trouble. His courtiers joked, "If we have to wait for death, let us hope that it comes from Spain, for then it would never arrive."
To counter this danger, powerful states have spent enormous portions of their revenues improving their communications systems. The early Persian Empire, for example, built the Royal Road System, where special couriers, whose motto was adopted by the US Postal Service, linked the crucial centers of the Empire. Unfortunately, this same road system proved of inestimable value as an invasion corridor for Alexander the Great. In another example, the Roman Empire put so much effort into its transportation networks that much of the system survives today. For those that doubt these roads were arteries for information and military forces rather than trade, it is worth noting that no Roman road was ever large enough for two carts to pass side by side. Similarly, and centuries later, the British expanded huge sums maintaining and defending the sea lanes that linked its vast global empire.
Historically, great powers with extensive interests have had to contend with two crucial problems:
• They offer many points for foes to threaten and attack.
• Their capacity to project power to the edges of their empire (or zone of interest) is greatly diminished the further the contested area is from the core of a state's power, though local allies can hugely alleviate this problem.
other side of the Rhine or Danube rivers. Only when rival states are close to each other's core can they sustain huge forces over a prolonged period.
Even now in the , it is interesting to see how difficult it is for even a modern state to sustain forces far from its core.
• The Germans, for instance were capable of sustaining only a small fraction of their army at Stalingrad, or in North Africa.
• During the Second World era, even mighty America was straining every logistical sinew to sustain just a few tens of thousands of infantrymen on Okinawa. Of course, America was surging 4millions of military personnel overseas during this war, but such a tremendous effort could not be sustained for many more years.
• Also consider that the build-up for the Normandy invasion took well over a year, and the invasion ran out of logistical steam before the assault could reach the Rhine. Toward the end, the Allies were moving forward with just a few divisions at a time, while the rest stalled for lack of fuel.
• The Russians, just a few hundred miles from their borders, required many months to bring up supplies and position forces for the final surge to Berlin.
• Later, throughout the Cold War, both the Russians and Americans kept sizable forces forward deployed but only by drawing support from Allies.
• In the final analysis, one state was unable to bear the cost; while, it is worth noting that soon after the Soviet Union's collapse the United States immediately began reducing its overseas forces
In any event, though exceptions to the above come readily to mind, the general point-that a state can only sustain a fraction of its overall power far from it economic core-is indisputable. Moreover, almost all of the exceptions were sustained for only a brief period, a few years at most. No state can sustain an effort equal (as a percentage of GDP) to what the United States accomplished from 1941 to 1945 for anything approximating the average length of an enduring rivalry. This observation has large implications for the United States.
• If our commercial rivalry with China is permitted to turn into an enduring militarized rivalry, the nation will often have to project substantial power into East Asia. The cost of projecting sufficient power to deter or win a militarized encounter is always going to be massive, while China, who needs only to project power into areas immediately adjacent to its economic core, will always have a tremendous cost advantage.
• Much of the cost of U.S. deployments can be offset by the deployment of power by local allies, or using an Allied infrastructure to support a U.S. deployment. For 1-34 that reason, the United States may expect to see China making serious efforts to disrupt U.S. alliances throughout Asia, as one of the early moves of a budding enduring rivalry (Shadlow's "Space Between" again).
Allies can play a crucial role in lowering the overall cost of sustaining a rivalry as well as providing invaluable assistance when the rivalry turns into a violent confrontation (war). Of course, this is not true in all cases, as some allies can end up costing more than they ever contribute (e.g., Italy as a burden to Germany in World War II).
In some cases, allies can become such a burden that they cripple the dominant state's economy. The Soviet Union, as James Anderson points out, realized this much too late to save itself from financial collapse: Moscow's economic burdens, at this time, were also growing, as the Soviets discovered what previous empires had all endured: at some point clientstates stopped providing net economic gains, and, instead, become a resource drain. As a result, the Soviet Union's efforts to updates its own economy were greatly hampered by the fiscal and resource drain imposed by Moscow's Eastern European clients. For a time, the Soviet Union's abundant natural resources and growing populations could compensate for these disadvantages, but stated GDP growth was masking the system's pervasive structural weaknesses.
Still, most states in a rivalry consider it crucial to have allies whose support can be relied on at crucial moments. Given this, what does historical experience tell us about the role of rivals in an enduring rivalry?
First, we learn that allies require substantial care and feeding, particularly in the years before their aid is actually needed. As Geoffrey Wawro reminds us in his essay: By July 1870, the French were well aware that they were on the verge of a major war with Prussia, yet the French foreign ministry under the Duc de Gramont made no effort to pursue alliance strategies that might have given France an overpowering hand. Gramont merely assumed that the Austrians would intervene in any Franco-Prussian conflict "to erase the memories of 1866." He also assumed that the Italians would join the war to show their gratitude for French assistance in the war of 1859 (and he assumed that the Austrians would permit an Italian army to cross their territory to join the war against Prussia.) Further, he was convinced that the Danes would join the war to take back Schleswig, seized by the Prussians in 1864. 
27
Second, during a rivalry, an assortment of strong, generally self-supporting allies is always important, but during a conflict they are crucial. At times, however, the dominant power is tempted to push too much of the burden onto allies. This is particularly dangerous during a conflict where the leading power is tempted to conserve its strength or more often substitute cash for "boots on the ground." As Michael Leggiere states, Before 1808, the British mainly contributed to the successive coalition wars against France by funding in the form of loans, subsidies, and credits to allies such as Austria and Russia whose armies would shoulder the main burden of fighting the French. Total domination of the seas then allowed the British to conduct limited military operations against secondary targets such as the Netherlands and Naples either unilaterally or in conjunction with the Russians. However, London's 1808 decision to commit the British army to the Iberian Peninsula marked a monumental policy change for the maritime economic power. Yet this was not enough. Although the British distracted Napoleon and tied down vital imperial resources in Iberia and the Mediterranean, they realized that Napoleon's hegemony over the Continent could only be broken in Central Europe. For this reason, the British could not turn their backs on Austria, Prussia, and Russia even after all three counted among Napoleon's allies following the failed Franco-Austrian War of 1809. The British understood that when the time came for Europe to a rise against France, Britain would be expected to support it both with arms and money.
As the United States first discovered in World War I and later in the Second World War, a generous disbursement of cash is important but rarely enough to ensure victory, or to have much influence in the post-conflict order. That this lesson was absorbed by decision-makers is made clear by U.S actions during the Cold War, where sufficient military force was maintained at potential hot-spots to assure allies of America's commitment to join in any fighting from the earliest point in a conflict. The historical record is clear: if the dominant nation is unwilling to place its ground troops in harm's way it is difficult to convince allies of the seriousness of its intent.
Finally, when it comes to allies, the historical record bears out Lord Palmerston's warning: "Nations have no permanent friends, they only have permanent interests." Generally, an alliance structure held together only for as long as the allies shared a common interest. Typically, this meant that one's allies had more to fear from your rival then they did from you.
As rivalries move from one crisis to the next, they are beset with problems of differing complexity and importance. Each of these problems comes with its own flow of 1-36 information that competes for policymakers' attention with huge amounts of informational white noise. Of course, this is true of any major power, whether it is engaged in a strategic rivalry or not. But nations engaged in an enduring rivalry exhibit two common characteristics when dealing with information overload:
(1) a tendency to overly focus on minor issues and problems; and
(2) to examine every international event through the prism of the ongoing rivalry.
Geoffrey Parker identifies this difficulty as a major cause of a Spanish collapse in the sixteenth century:
The Spanish Habsburgs reaction to information overload was to focus on minor problems (menudencias, or "trivia") instead of wrestling with the crucial decisions on which the fate of the Monarchy depended. In 1584, Cardinal Granvelle (Philip II's senior adviser) complained bitterly: "I see in all matters delays, so pernicious and in so many ways prejudicial to our own affairs, including the most important ones, which become lost to view... with so many petty details that no time is left to resolve what matters most."
It has forever been so. Consider the Athenians even as they went forward with their invasion of Sicily-the largest military endeavor the ancient Greeks attempted before the Age of Alexander-they became obsessed with calling back their commander, Alcibiades, to stand trial for what in relation to what was at stake a minor matter. This cost them the services of the one general who could have assured the expeditions' victory, and arguably set Athens on the path to final defeat. Alcibiades sought refuge in Sparta, where he gave the Spartans the key to defeating Athens.
Even Rome, which was far better than most at keeping a firm focus on the main effort, finally succumbed when its leaders failed to recognize the crucial threat was not the one on which they were focused. In the western part of the Empire, Rome was so preoccupied by the Huns that they took little notes of a relatively small force of other barbarians-the Vandals-breaking their tax spine in North Africa. Later, in the Eastern Empire, the Byzantines were so focused on the Persian threat that they took little noticeuntil it was too late-of the Arab raiders flying the flag of Islam.
Interestingly, the capability to accumulate and process large amounts of information, even if your capacity to do so is superior to that of a rival, provides no assurance of ultimate strategic success. Geoffrey Parker again reminds us of the historical fact that the king [Philip II] himself blamed many of the problems he had faced on "the distance that separates one state from another," and in the course of his reign he repeatedly complained about delays in the transmission of important information. So did his ministers-indeed one of them joked that 1-37 "If we have to wait for death, let us hope that it comes from Spain, for then it would never arrive."

According to Parker, Philip thus did not dispute the material evidence of impending disaster-but his faith-based political vision led him to ignore it. Similarly, the Austrian branch of the Hapsburg Empire continued building huge fortresses to ward off Ottoman assaults long after any realistic net assessment would have deemed such a strategy expensive and foolish. The last of these great fortresses (Karlstadt) was not completed until the eve of the American revolution and long after the Ottomans were a viable threat to the empire.
The Hapsburgs were not blind to the strategic threat posed by Prussia and later France, but it was irrelevant. A kind of strategic myopia had set in, where the searing emotional memories of the past dominated planning for a radically different future. This is something that strategic rivals in many historical examples given in this report were prone to at one time or another, often with disastrous results. William Morgan clearly identifies this same myopia on both sides of the US-Japan rivalry:
Knowing that Japan's military and economic strength, though sizable, could not defeat the United States in a long war, American officials reasoned that Japan would not start a war that it was certain to lose. Realism prevented them from imagining that Japan might, if pushed to the limit, go to war for non-Realist ideological and emotional reasons. Hence the primary American misjudgments were assuming that Japan would behave according to an American vision of rationality and that the United States had enough leverage to change Japan's policy.
The Navy and Army leaders never directly and comprehensively analyzed whether Japan could win the war. When they got past the opening stages of the war, they said there were too many variables to make an accurate assessment. More prudent and realistic leaders might have declined to go to war until the variables became clearer. Essentially Japanese leaders rolled the dice. They counted on favorable future political and diplomatic developments, such as a German defeat of Britain. They assumed a bloodied, timid America would negotiate an early peace rather than fight a long war. They hoped a devastating strike at the beginning of the conflict would lead to an early peace, as had happened at the outset of the 1894-95 war against China and the 1904 Russo-Japanese war. They made wildly unrealistic estimates about resource consumption and supply from conquered territories. They blundered ahead, avoiding hard realities and comforting themselves by stringing out pointless negotiations.
In every case of a strategic rival meeting with some debacle, all of the warning signs were present long before disaster became inevitable. In these cases, the problem was not lack of information but always one of miscalculation or even a reluctance for making a calculation. Captured by ideology, past history, or wishful thinking, time and again states make incorrect assessments of their rivals.
Strategic rivals suffer from another kind of myopia that we have mentioned several times previously (e.g., the Vandals attacking Rome or the Arabs versus the Byzantines and the Persians), but it bears careful noting. The state that is the largest and most ostentatious might not be the one the hegemonic state need fear. Rather, what may seem to be a small, frontier state with a small population and economy might be the greater threat. The determination to have a world identity is a strong strategic driving force. Often in a quiet, small-scale, but persistent way this determination, given enough patience, can build a small, frontier state into a large superpower. Historical examples for this are numerous: the 1-39
Introduction to Enduring Strategic Rivalries one side attempts to close a perceived gap in certain asymmetries. Such acts not only threaten the established order, they hugely increase the propensity for the rivals to opt for restarting militarized conflicts. For instance, the great asymmetry between Germany and Britain was that one was a maritime power with a fleet that dominated the high seas, and the other mostly a continental, that is, a land-based power. Only when Germany began building a high-seas fleet that threatened Britain's primacy did Britain find common cause with its long-term strategic rival France to counter growing German power. Similarly, rapid Russian economic growth from 1908 on so threatened Germany's position as the mightiest economic power in Europe that Germany began actively seeking an excuse for war.
This question has been answered substantially in the early pages of this essay in discussing three of the reasons for starting and maintaining a strategic rivalry: "fear, honor, and interest." However, two more points are worth pointing out.
• First, in almost every examined case, these rivalries were, at their base, power contests to determine who would dominate a specific sphere of interest and establish the rule-set that underpinned the global order. Such rule-sets could be based on various factors such as religion (Islam vs. Christian) or economics (communism vs. capitalism).
• Second, with few exceptions one rival is already the dominant power (happy with the status quo), and the other is a rising power (unhappy with the status quo) looking to establish its primacy.

-Rising Power: Germany. 
As stated previously, rivalries were a result of a major systemic shock to the global order that created the conditions for the establishment of a rivalry. As rivalries continue, there is always a strong tendency to escalate its intensity. This is typically a result of a succession of militarized engagements (this, however, does not always mean war). In each of these engagements, there is one winner who learns that it can achieve its objectives by standing firm or through a military victory. There is also a loser who has spent the intervening years preparing itself for a militarized future where it can redress the past defeat and possibly make gains of its own. In each succeeding conflict, national popular attitudes harden, 1-42 limiting the number of alternatives to war available to policymakers. At the same time, each new conflict is typically of greater scope and passion, as wars tend to head toward a Clausewitz absolute.
The rivalries studied in this work that de-escalated over time did so as a result of the rise of a more dangerous threat, exempting, of course, those rivalries where one side was totally defeated or eradicated. It helped if the rivals shared a common outlook as to the nature of the world order and its political order. For instance, it was much easier for Britain to put aside its rivalries with France and the United States as the German threat arose, for all three nations-Britain, France, the United States-shared civilizational bonds dating back to their Greco-Roman heritage, as well as a collective Judeo-Christian outlook. On the other side stood the Hapsburgs. Long after the Ottomans had ceased to be a serious military danger, the Hapsburgs found it difficult to refocus their attention toward the perils in the West, the far more serious threats from Prussia and France. At least some measure of this reluctance must be based in the profound cultural and civilizational differences between the Hapsburgs and the Ottomans.
What assessment methods did the rival strategic states develop to determine where they stood? How did they perceive their performance in the competition? How good was their sense of their relative strengths and weaknesses?
The most profound observation dealing with how rivals assessed each other is that they almost always got it right. Rivals always appeared to have a good understanding of each other's strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, they typically were able to amass significant data on each other, to the point where each rival's capabilities were an open book to the other.
Where they failed was in interpretation and imagination. Rarely was one state able to turn its deep knowledge of a rival's capacity and capabilities into an accurate assessment of its intentions or future strategic actions. Repeatedly, one rival would endure a moment of strategic surprise despite a precise net assessment of its competitor's capacity to undertake such a "surprising" action. Almost as often, a rival who finds itself at a power disadvantage will replace an accurate assessment of its competitor with wishful thinking (Japan vs. United States).
In summary, the problem was rarely with collecting intelligence and assessing it; repeated strategic failure was a result of an inability to fathom how a competitor would employ the power at its disposal.

Dr. Paul A. Rahe   It would be an error to suppose that there was a strategic rivalry between Athens and Sparta before the Hellenic victory at the battle of Salamis. The two polities had clashed in the late sixth century when the Lacedaemonians had intervened at Athens-initially for the purpose of overthrowing the Peisistratid tyranny, and twice again later to install a satellite regime (Hdt. 5.62-66, 70-76, 90-93).

Even then, it would have been a mistake to think of Athens and Sparta as rivals. Their alliance against Persia was uneasy, as alliances nearly always are. But it was a genuine alliance, nonetheless. It had been summoned into existence by the Persian peril, and it was not apt to dissolve as long as it seemed possible that Persia might try again to conquer Greece.
There were, to be sure, Lacedaemonians who dreamed of empire in the wake of the battles of Plataea and Mycale in 479. The regent Pausanias, who led the Spartans to victory in the former battle, appears to have had something of the sort in mind, and he commanded considerable support in Lacedaemon.

If Athens' emergence as a major maritime power was nonetheless unsettling, it was because it was a development sudden, quite recent, and unforeseen. Just a few years before Xerxes' invasion that city's navy had been a negligible force-inferior to the fleet deployed by her local rival the little island of Aegina, situated nearby in the Saronic Gulf. To counter the Aeginetan fleet, Athens had had to buy used triremes from a friendly power willing to sell them for a pittance (6.871-93.1). At this point, the Athenians had been, nearly all of them, landlubbers; and landlubbers they certainly would have remained-given the stupendous cost of building, maintaining, and staffing such ships-had the city not profited from a spectacular silver strike just a few years after her unexpected victory on land over a Persian expeditionary force at the battle of Marathon. 
8
Rowing such a vessel required, as one commander reportedly put it, that one embrace "hardship" and "toil." It, in fact, took extraordinary grit, determination, discernment, and discipline on the part of a great many men for a trireme to be operated in battle to ad-2-3 vantage. The trierarch in command had to be a man of fine judgment-quick to sense danger, and no less quick in recognizing opportunity-and he had to have an intimate knowledge of the capacity of his ship and crew and of their limits. The helmsman [kubernḗtēs] stationed immediately below the trierarch's perch at the stern was in charge in the trierarch's absence and had to possess the same capacities. He also had to be skilled and precise in his use of the vessel's two steering oars. Everything depended on his ability to maneuver the galley into a position from which it could strike and not be struck in return, and an error or even a measure of imprecision on his part could quite easily be fatal to all concerned. When the trireme was in motion, the archers and marines on deck had to remain seated lest they destabilize the vessel. In consequence they had to be able to shoot or hurl projectiles with great accuracy from an uncomfortable, sedentary position. With the help of a flutist [aulḗtēs] located amidships keeping time with his instrument, the exhorter [keleustḗs] situated on the gangway near the stern and his colleague, the bow-master [prōrátēs] stationed near the prow, had to drill the oarsmen in synchronizing their strokes and in rowing forward now at this pace, now at that. These two also had to teach them how to reverse themselves on the benches and back water without missing a beat; they had to instruct them how to partially ship their oars on command when a few seconds delay could result in the oars on one side being sheared off, in some of the oarsmen being killed by whiplash, and in the galley itself being disabled. In time of battle, moreover, these two officers had to convey the helmsman's orders quickly and accurately, and throughout, they had to sustain the morale of men whom they were driving quite hard.
The oarsmen themselves had to learn endurance and close coordination. This was no small thing, as scholars first came fully to appreciate in the late 1980s and early 1990s, when, under the guidance of an intrepid group of British classicists and naval experts, a Greek shipyard built a replica of a trireme, and every other summer volunteers gathered from far and near to take the Olympias, as it was called, to sea and put it through a series of trials. There was, these scholars discovered, a great deal to endure, and everything depended on a precise synchronization of the rowers' strokes. On journeys, for example-when the sea was becalmed, when the wind blew from the wrong quarter or was insufficient-it became clear that the oarsmen of ancient times had to row steadily for hours and hours. When the fleet was arranged for battle in line abreast, they had to row gently forward and then back water and do this again and again to maintain their galley's position in the formation. In the battle itself, when maneuvering for advantage, they had to be able to turn the vessel on a dime; and, when closing in for a kill or fleeing attack, they had to drive the vessel forward at maximum speed. If, at the end of such a sprint, their ship succeeded in ramming at high speed an enemy trireme, they had to back water at a moment's notice to prevent the two vessels from being locked together in such a manner that the infantrymen seated on board the damaged ship could attempt to board and seize their own. Alternatively, if the trierarch's aim was to approach an enemy vessel head-on at full tilt, then narrowly dodge a collision and coast along the enemy boat's starboard or port side with an eye to shearing off half of its oars and rendering it defenseless and incapable of maneuver, the oarsmen on the vulnerable side of his own trireme had to be able to partially ship their oars quickly while their colleagues on the other side of the vessel simultaneously lifted theirs out of the water. For the rowers to be able to do all of this with maximum effectiveness, those who conducted Olympias' sea trials discovered, they had to drill and drill and drill once more. Following orders and close coordination had to become second nature for each and every one of them.

The Spartans who, at Plataea, did the same to the infantrymen brought to Hellas by Xerxes might, of course, be described as professionals. They were rentiers supported by servile labor, and they were graced with leisure in abundance-much of which they devoted to the preparation for war. They put great effort into gymnastic training, and they 2-5 learned how to wield to good effect the heavy hoplite shield and the thrusting spear that served as the Greek infantrymen's chief offensive weapon as well as the sword that each fell back on when that spear had been wrenched from his grasp or shattered. They practiced forming via a phalanx eight-men deep an almost impenetrable wall of shields-and all of this effort gave them a decided edge when thrown into combat with their fellow Hellenes. But it did not alter in any marked way the nature of hoplite warfare, and supporting a force of this sort did not at this time require any particular financial acumen. In fact, Lacedaemon, the only classical Greek city with a quasi-professional infantry force, managed to field a hoplite army without ever having to coin any silver at all. 
14
Even at this time, there were Athenians who regarded Sparta as a threat. What had happened in the late sixth century was not forgotten at Athens; and when, after the battle of Plataea, the Lacedaemonians urged the Athenians not to rebuild their walls (Thuc. 1.90.1-2, Diod. 11.39.1-3, Nep. Them. 6.2-4, Plut. Them. 19.1-2), the latter warily ignored the request, 
15
16
At Athens, however, as one would expect, Panhellenic sentiment was at this time strong. Persia still inspired fear, the desire for revenge was great, and Cimon, son of the Miltiades who defeated the Persians at Marathon, bested Themistocles in the political struggles that took place in the 470s, secured his ostracism for a ten-year term in 471, 
17
Political communities are, however, prickly-and this was especially true in antiquity when commerce for the most part played a marginal role and economic interdependence was not even a dream. Potential rivals who are close trading partners have something to lose from war. Potential rivals operating in a technologically-stagnant world in which war is a far more promising outlet for man's acquisitive instincts than is trade know no such restraints.

Given what the Spartans were then known to have done, Cimon did not have a leg to stand on. In 461, he was ostracized for a term of ten years, 
31
From this time onward until the end of the great Peloponnesian War and the surrender of Athens in 404, there was an enduring strategic rivalry between the Athenians and the Spartans. The contest was, however, an exceedingly awkward one. In 461, when this war began, the rebellious helots in Messenia were holed up on Mt. Ithome, and the Lacedaemonians were unable to dislodge them. As long as this was the case, the Spartans, whose numbers were in any case depleted, could not afford to send an army of any size far afield. Even after 455, when a withdrawal of the Messenians was negotiated (1.103.1, Diod. 11.84.8, Paus. 4.24.7), they were constrained. As long as Athens held Megara and could fortify the passes leading from the Megarid to the Isthmus of Corinth, she could greatly hinder, if not block, egress by land from the Peloponnesus (Thuc. 1.103.4, 107.3); and there was little that Sparta-lacking, as she did, the financial resources needed for the construction of a great fleet-could do to strike at her enemy. The same would be true in some measure even after the Athenians lost control of Megara. For, in 457, the Athenians began, in earnest, building "Long Walls" to link the fortifications at Athens with those surrounding her port-town at Peiraeus (1.107.1, 4, 108.3). Once these were complete, the citizens could, in an emergency, withdraw from the countryside, take refuge behind their walls, and import food by sea.

More than half a century later, a Corinthian leader is said to have summed up Sparta's strategic position by comparing Lacedaemon to a mighty stream. "At their sources," he noted, "rivers are not great and they are easily forded, but the farther on they go, the greater they get-for other rivers empty into them and make the current stronger." So it is with the Spartans, he continued. "There, in the place where they emerge, they are alone; but as they continue and gather cities under their control, they become more numerous and harder to fight." The prudent general, he concluded, would seek battle with the Spartans in or near Lacedaemon where they are few in number and relatively weak (Xen. Hell. 4.2.11-12). This is, of course, precisely what Themistocles had done, and it had very nearly worked. If Athens' aim after 461 was to duplicate his achievement, she would have to sub-2-10 vert Sparta's alliance, rally the Argives, draw a great many of the Arcadians and perhaps the Eleans as well into a league with Argos, and stage a decisive hoplite battle in the vicinity of Laconia or Messenia, as he had done. But this, despite a valiant effort, the Athenians failed in the 450s to accomplish. The moment of opportunity exploited by Themistocles had passed. By the late 460s, Sparta had brought her most recalcitrant allies back into line. In the first few decades that followed, they remained doggedly loyal. In consequence, Lacedaemon was able to compensate for the sudden and dramatic decline in Spartan manpower by marshalling infantry from her allies; in these circumstances, Argos had no allies in the Peloponnesus capable of helping her to field a hoplite force adequate to the task.
The Athenians were hyperactive in this period, as was their wont. The Spartans did next to nothing. 
39
40
Of course-in 446, when those five years had passed, when Cimon had died, when the Athenians had won a great battle on both land and sea at Cypriot Salamis against the Mede and the peace with Persia had been renewed (Thuc. 1.112.2-4, Diod. 12.2-4, Plut. Cim. 18-19)-the Spartans did act. The events seem to have been carefully choreographed. First, the Boeotians rebelled against Athens' dominion. Then, when they had secured their liberty by ambushing and annihilating an Athenian army at Coronea (Thuc. 1.113, Plut. Per. 18.2-3, Diod. 12.6.1-2), the Euboeans followed suit; and, when Pericles left for that island with Athens' remaining hoplites, the Megarians opened their gates to the Corinthians, Sicyonians, and Epidaurians and massacred the Athenian garrison (Thuc. 1.114.1, Plut. Per. 22.1, Diod. 12.5.2). Finally, when Pericles crossed back over to Attica with Athens' hoplites, invaded the Megarid, ravaged the territory of the Megarians, and defeated a Megarian force (ML no. 51 with Diod. 12.5.2), Sparta's Agiad king Pleistoanax son of Pausanias led an army of Peloponnesians through the Megarid into Attica (Thuc. 1.114.2, 2.21.1; Plut. Per. 22.1-2; Diod. 12.6.1).
This turn of events caught the Athenians flat-footed. Eleven years prior, the Athenians had begun building "Long Walls" to link the city of Athens with the Peiraeus, and they are said to have finished them in short order (Thuc. 1.107.1, 108.3). In principle, at the time of Pleistoanax' invasion, the Athenians could have found refuge behind these walls and have imported food by sea, as we have seen. But this, in 446, they did not do-perhaps because their hoplite army was already exposed and in the field.
Had Pleistoanax been intent on Athens' defeat and subjection or even on her destruction, he might well have been able to achieve it on this occasion. But to the surprise and consternation of many of his fellow Spartans, a negotiation, rather than a battle, ensued (1.114.2, Plut. Per. 22.2, Schol. Ar. Nub. 859).

The deep ambivalence on Lacedaemon's part evident in these proceedings was not an aberration. It was there from the beginning, and it was a natural concomitant of her strategic situation. Athens' rise to pre-eminence and her brashness were a source of resentment from the outset, but her contribution in fending off the Mede was deeply appreciated at the same time. Some were furious that, when Pleistoanax had the Athenians at his mercy, he had failed to annihilate Athens' army. Others were relieved that Lacedaemon was spared the responsibility of keeping the Persians at bay as well as the danger to her way of life apt to be attendant on an acceptance of that responsibility. It is no surprise that-six years after the peace of 446 was signed, when the Samians and Byzantines bolted from the Delian League and staged a rebellion (Thuc. 1.115.2-117.3, Diod. 12.27-28, Plut. Per. 24-28)-the authorities at Sparta were once again willing to contemplate war. We can also be confident that many at Lacedaemon were relieved when the Corinthians-who had suffered grievously in the previous war and who, as the only Peloponnesian power with a navy of any size, would have borne the brunt of any struggle aimed to breaking up the Delian Leagueblocked the enterprise (Thuc. 1.40.5, Diod. 12.28.4). 
44
There are some who believe that Pericles, who was now fully in charge, had learned a lesson and that he was now committed to a permanent posture of peaceful coexistence with Sparta similar to the policy that Cimon had once so resolutely pursued. He had certainly learned something. He had learned that, if the Peloponnesians were to invade again, it was essential that the Athenians seek refuge behind the "Long Walls," and he had reached another conclusion as well. When war clouds once again hovered on the horizon, Pericles repeatedly warned his compatriots against adventurism of the sort that they had engaged in when, in the midst of a struggle with Lacedaemon, they had lent support to the Egyptian revolt against the Mede (Thuc. 2.65.6-7). But it would be an error to think that Pericles ever imagined it possible for Athens and Sparta to live in peace and amity for any great length of time. If he ever even entertained such a possibility, the news that the authorities at Lacedaemon had attempted to rally their allies against Athens in 440 at the time of the Samian and Byzantine revolts will have disabused him of the notion.
"War is," as Thucydides (3.82.2) tells us, "a violent teacher." At an exorbitant price, it dispels illusions. Athens had an Achilles heel. So did Sparta. The war that was brought to an end in 446 illuminated both of these. In neither case, as it happens, was this point of vulnerability easy for the other power to approach. To defeat a maritime power such as Athens, one would have to take to the sea and raise up a rebellion in her empire. Once the Athenians had completed the "Long Walls" linking the city with her port and turning Athens into an artificial island virtually impervious to invasion by land, nothing else would do. To defeat Sparta, as we have seen, one would have to master the land and field a hoplite army superior to hers. This one could do, as Themistocles had demonstrated, solely by rallying Argos, subverting the Spartan alliance, and using Lacedaemon's erstwhile allies to bring her down. The requisite manpower was available nowhere else.
As the Athenians had learned in the course of their first war with the Peloponnesians, it would not be easy to duplicate what Themistocles had done. For such an enterprise, circumstances in the 440s and the early 430s were not at all propitious. In 451, when Cimon negotiated a five-year truce between Athens and Sparta, Argos, fearing what Lacedaemon would do in the interim, agreed to a peace of thirty years duration with her ancestral foe. When the limited term stipulated in that agreement came to an end in 421, the Argives might well be willing to make another attempt to bring Sparta's hegemony within the Peloponnesus to an end. Prior to that time, however, they would be highly reluctant to do anything of the sort.
The logic of Athens' situation and everything that the Athenians had learned the hard way in the 450s and the early 440s argued for peace. In the short run, the city had little, if anything, to gain from a major war. Pericles and his compatriots had come to appreciate the virtues of Cimon's Persian policy. One might disagree as to whether there ever had been or ever could be any point in Athens' attempting to extend her empire into the Levant. But it was clear enough to everyone who had witnessed the debacle in Egypt that mounting such a venture while Lacedaemon remained a threat was madness in the extreme. If Pericles and others continued to think Cimon's posture with regard to Sparta unpalatable, they were nonetheless forced to acknowledge that for the time being, as an expedient, it made excellent sense. In the long run, it might well be inevitable that there be a show-down with Lacedaemon. But the only such war worth fighting was a war likely to eventuate in a hoplite battle deep within the Peloponnesus in which Sparta's most important allies were ranged against their hegemon. There are times when a statesman must watch and wait.
In the late 430s, as I have argued in detail elsewhere, an opportunity unexpectedly presented itself, and Pericles moved deliberately with consummate skill to seize it. 
45
In the archaic period, Corinth had been a great colonizer; and, unlike most Greek cities, she maintained exceedingly close relations with these colonies. Most of the maritime cities on the Greek mainland were agricultural in character and eastern in orientation. Corinth was an anomaly. Her farmland was sparse; she was more dependent on trade than any other Greek city; and she looked first and foremost to the west-to and beyond the aptly named Corinthian Gulf. All of her colonies lay in that direction with the single exception of Potideia in the Thracian Chalcidice. Corinth drew sustenance chiefly from the Adriatic, from southern Italy, and from Sicily. 
46
In the aftermath of this war, when Megara was once again a member of the Spartan alliance, the Corinthians, who had been made to suffer for their connection with Lacedaemon, were, naturally enough, intent on preventing a repeat of that bitter experience. To this end, they did everything that they could to shore up their position in the west. Their aim was to build up an empire of sorts with resources sufficient to enable them once again to be the dominant power in the Corinthian Gulf and along the trade route that ran up the Adriatic coast of the Balkans and across the sea to Italy and Sicily. Their goal was to render it impossible for the Athenians ever to impose another blockade. Behind their pursuit of this end, there was a pent-up fury fueled by bitterness and driven by dread.
Corinth faced two obstacles. The Messenians, whom the Athenians had settled at Naupactus on the northern shore of the Corinthian Gulf near its entrance (1.103.1-2, 107.3; Diod. 11.84.7-8), were still there, firmly ensconced-and they were still allied with the Athenians. Should war again erupt between Athens and Sparta, Naupactus would once again function as an Athenian base (Thuc. 2.69.1). This the Corinthians knew. The other obstacle to their aspirations was Corcyra-an island polity in the Adriatic, founded as a colony by Corinth centuries before, which had come into conflict with her mother city and which treated the Corinthians with a measure of contempt. To add injury to insult, Corcyra maintained a fleet second only to that of Athens, and the island was strategically located athwart the trade route to Italy (Hdt. 3.48-53, Thuc. 1.25.3-4, 44.2-3).
In the 430s, opportunity knocked. Epidamnus, a city situated in the Adriatic on the Balkan coast where the Albanian city of Durazzo is now located, was wracked by civil strife. One faction sought Corinth's aid, and the Corinthians leapt at the opportunity to take control of the town-which lay north of Corcyra at the jumping off point for the voyage from the Balkans to Italy and Sicily. Then, when the Corcyraeans, who had founded Epidamnus, objected to Corinth's interference in their sphere of influence and came to the defense of the other Epidamnian faction, war broke out between the two naval powers. Corcyra won the first great battle at sea. But this did not stop the Corinthians, who immediately began building a second and much larger fleet and, in their fury, flatly refused an offer of arbitration on the part of the Corcyraeans that was tantamount to a surrender of their claims. 
47
Pericles handled the situation with a cunning worthy of comparison with that later displayed by Otto von Bismarck. As he and his compatriots recognized, were the Corinthians to conquer Corcyra and pool their ample resources with those of the Corcyraeans, they would become a threat to Athens' maritime hegemony (1.44.2). This the Athenians could not allow. But it was also to their advantage that responsibility for the conflict be pinned on the Corinthians alone-for this might obviate war, and it would certainly produce strains within the Spartan alliance.
To this end, Pericles persuaded his compatriots to form a defensive, rather than an offensive, alliance with the islanders (1.44.1, Plut. Per. 29.1). To this end, he put pressure on the cities within the Peloponnesus which had joined Corinth's first expedition, demanding that they deny her further support. Apart from Megara, all of the communities on the Saronic Gulf complied (cf. Thuc. 1.46 with 1.27.2), and in short order the outlier was made to pay a price.

That was one dimension of the bind that Athens put Sparta in. There was anotherfor everything that Athens did was also brilliantly designed for the purpose of enraging the Corinthians and encouraging them to direct their anger at the Spartans. Being denied their prize in the Adriatic was a painful blow, and it was rendered doubly painful by the fact that, on that fateful day at Sybota, victory had been within Corinth's grasp (1.1.47-54). This was bad enough. But to it was added the embargo the Athenians directed at Megara and the suffering it produced (Ar. Ach. 495-556, 729-64, Pax 246-49, 605-14). Given what the Corinthians had undergone in the earlier war with Athens, Megara was for them a sore point. If the Lacedaemonians were unwilling to go to war to prevent Athens from bullying
Megara, if they were to allow the former to force the latter into submission, the Corinthians could not see the point of the Peloponnesian alliance to which they had so long belonged.
The embassy that the Corinthians sent to Lacedaemon on this occasion to press their grievances pulled no punches. They held the Spartans responsible for their suffering during the previous war, and they blamed them for the predicament in which they now found themselves. The picture they painted of the Athenians and the Lacedaemonians is a lively one:
The Athenians are innovators, keen in forming plans, and quick to accomplish in deed what they have contrived in thought. You Spartans are intent on saving what you now possess; you are always indecisive, and you leave even what is needed undone. They are daring beyond their strength, they are risk-takers against all judgment, and in the midst of terrors they remain of good hope-while you accomplish less than is in your power, mistrust your judgment in matters most firm, and think not how to release yourselves from the terrors you face. In addition, they are unhesitant where you are inclined to delay, and they are always out and about in the larger world while you stay at home. For they think to acquire something by being away while you think that by proceeding abroad you will harm what lies ready to hand. In victory over the enemy, they sally farthest forth; in defeat, they give the least ground. For their city's sake, they use their bodies as if they were not their own; their intelligence they dedicate to political action on her behalf. And if they fail to accomplish what they have resolved to do, they suppose themselves deprived of that which is their own-while what they have accomplished and have now acquired they judge to be little in comparison with what they will do in the time to come. If they trip up in an endeavor, they are soon full of hope with regard to yet another goal. For they alone possess something at the moment at which they come to hope for it: So swiftly do they contrive to attempt what has been resolved. And on all these things they exert themselves in toil and danger through all the days of their lives, enjoying least of all what they already possess because they are ever intent on further acquisition. They look on a holiday as nothing but an opportunity to do what needs doing, and they regard peace and quiet free from political business as a greater misfortune than a laborious want of leisure. So that, if someone were to sum them up by saying that they are by nature capable neither of being at rest nor of allowing other human beings to be so, he would speak the truth (Thuc. 1.70). This depiction, which is borne out by the facts, helps explain why, in their fury, the Corinthians threatened to leave the Peloponnesian League and take others with them (1.71.4-7).
Pericles' gambit had worked. The Spartans were trapped. Arbitration was not an option. They knew that, under the terms of the treaty, they would lose. In the circumstances, therefore, they were faced with only two choices-neither of them palatable. They could 2-17 stand idly by while the Corinthians bolted from their alliance; sidled up to the Argives, the Athenians, or both; and sought to lure away their other allies. Or this exceptionally pious people could go to war, knowing full well that, in doing so, they were incurring the wrath of the gods in breaking their oaths.
As in the past, there were those at Sparta who welcomed the prospect of such a war, and on this occasion they had such strong support from the Corinthians that they had little trouble in winning over the Lacedaemonian assembly. There were others, however, who were appalled-among them Archidamus, Sparta's Eurypontid king. He recognized that Athens would not quickly fold; that the "Long Walls," now complete, rendered invasion by land futile; and that Sparta, which lacked the wherewithal with which to fund a great fleet, had no obvious path to victory-and he predicted that the war might last a generation or more (1.79-85). 
54
55
Statesmanship notwithstanding, international affairs rarely, if ever, escape the vagaries of fortune. The plague was to Athens what the earthquake had been to Sparta-a bolt from the blue that turned everything upside down. Had Athens not been struck early in the war by the plague and had Pericles lived, the intricate scheme that he had devised might well have worked. In the beginning, things went precisely as planned. The Peloponnesian invasion was without consequence. The Athenians withdrew to their fortifications. Certain parts of Attica were ravaged, and the Peloponnesians went home. Then, the Athenians invaded and ravaged the Megarid, and the marines accompanying their fleet wreaked havoc on the coastal communities of the Peloponnesus. In time, they placed a small fleet at Naupactus to harry the traders of the Corinthian Gulf; and, on one occasion, they very nearly stormed the Peloponnesian city Epidaurus. 
56
57
The plague upset Pericles' scheme. There is reason to believe that it killed between one in four and one in three Athenians. 
58
None of this was of much use to the Spartans. Apart from invading Attica once a year, they did little, and nothing that they did was of consequence. With the help of their allies, they could besiege and conquer Plataea, field an ineffective fleet in the Corinthian Gulf, plan an abortive raid on the Peiraeus, and even dispatch a flotilla on a hasty tour through Ionia. 
59
So the war dragged on and on-until an enterprising Athenian general named Demosthenes developed an ingenious scheme to fortify a headland in the natural harbor at Pylos on the west coast of Messenia and post there a handful of triremes and a garrison of Messenians who might make incursions into the heartland of Messenia and threaten the Spartans where it mattered most. The effect of this on the Spartans was electric. Archidamus' son and successor Agis immediately withdrew the Peloponnesian army from Attica, and the Spartans and Peloponnesians gathered at Pylos. The details of the struggle that then ensued need not detain us. 
60
Had Pericles been alive, he might have negotiated an agreement at this time. Prestige is, he knew, a force-multiplier. Quite often, it enables one to work one's will without deploying one's forces at all. By the same token, a dramatic loss of prestige can trigger the collapse of one's position. For the Spartans to make peace on such an occasion would have shattered the confidence of their allies. They had gained immensely in prestige when they had sacrificed the three hundred with Leonidas at Thermopylae (Hdt. 7.201-33). To have made peace over a like number of Spartiates trapped, then captured on the island of Sphacteria in Navarino bay would have cost them dear. 
61
In this instance, the Athenians did choose delay (Thuc. 4. 21-22, 41.4). But they did not profit from their choice. The city was divided. There was no leader with the authority Pericles had possessed, and the Spartans were driven by desperation to allow Brasidas, their most enterprising commander, to mount an audacious attempt to wrest the Greek cities in Thrace from the Athenians. His successes in that strategically vital region of gold and silver mines were sufficient to alarm the Athenians and cause the two sides to negotiate a truce; and the stalemate that he produced eventuated in 421 in the ratification of a peace fully satisfactory to neither, which left the Corinthians enraged. 
62
In pulling together the anti-Spartan coalition deep within the Peloponnesus, Alcibiades performed something like the role of Themistocles. He had the vision, and he had the charisma to make it work. He was also like Themistocles in one other particular. In his fatherland, his conduct did not inspire trust, and he could not carry his compatriots with him. When the crucial battle took place in the plain between Mantineia and Tegea, he was able 2-20 to rally as volunteers willing to fight alongside the Argives, Mantineians, and Eleans only one thousand Athenian hoplites and three hundred cavalrymen. 
63
Had Alcibiades prevailed in the debates that took place at Athens in 418, the Athenians might well have eliminated Sparta as a great power. The fact that he did prevail in 415 opened up a serious possibility that Athens might be eliminated from the fray. Pericles, with an eye on the Egyptian debacle, had repeatedly warned the Athenians that adventurism might be their downfall (2.65.7). But, at the same time, he had encouraged them to think big. Once Lacedaemon was out of the way, he implied, almost anything was possible (2.37-46, 60-64). Alcibiades capitalized on the latter of Pericles' two exhortations when he proposed an expedition to Sicily, and he managed to make his compatriots forget the catastrophe that had taken place four decades before. Moreover, in warning against this enterprise, Nicias magnified the dangers in a fashion that stirred up ambitions and backfired, and the Athenians ended up sending a much larger expedition to Sicily than Alcibiades had intended. Although the defeat of Syracusa, the largest Greek city on the island, was not out of the question, the risks were nonetheless considerable, and the Athenians ended up losing not only the fleet originally sent out but also the rescue force dispatched as a reinforcement (6.1, 6-53, 60-104, 7.1-17, 20.2-87.5). 
64
In consequence, the Spartans lent aid to the Syracusans in their battle against Athens, and they seized on an Athenian breach of the terms of the Peace of Nicias, renewed the war with the Athenians, marched into Attica, and established a permanent fort within sight of the 2-21 city of Athens (6.105, 7.18.-20.1). By this last act, they denied the Athenians access to their silver mines and farms throughout the year. Then, when Athens' principal allies within the Delian League seized on her defeat in Sicily as an opportunity to rebel and sought Spartan assistance and when Tissaphernes and Pharnabazus, the Persian satraps in western Asia Minor, offered financial support, the Lacedaemonians leapt into the fray. 
65
66
The Athenians were undaunted. Against formidable odds, they fought on and on and on, exploiting their long experience in maritime affairs and justifying by their courage, audacity, and determination the portrait of them limned by the Corinthians on the eve of the Peloponnesian War. The Sicilian debacle had sapped Athenian morale, and the city succumbed to severe civil strife in 411. But the Athenians weathered the crisis, their democracy was restored, and in the Aegean they regained much lost ground. Had it not been for resoluteness on the part of the Mede, they would in time have recouped their losses.
Alcibiades, who had run into trouble with the Lacedaemonians, soon found favor with Tissaphernes, and, as the satrap quickly came to recognize, the advice that the renegade Athenian gave-that it was in Persia's interest that neither Greek power emerge triumphant and that the servants of the Great King should play the two off against one another-was sound. Had it been followed, however, the odds are good that the Spartans would have lost heart long before the Athenians did. For the Athenians were almost as one in their commitment to empire, and there were those at Lacedaemon who detested their alliance with the Mede, who feared what Sparta might become should she win, and who looked back on the dual hegemony with a measure of nostalgia.
In the end, however, domestic Persian politics determined the fate of Hellas. Darius II, a bastard son of Artaxerxes, had fought his way to the Persian throne in 423 after his father's death. By 408, it was clear that this usurper's days were numbered; and his wife Parysates, who hated her elder son's wife, favored for the succession her second son Cyrus. The following year, at her instigation, this young man-hardly more than a boy-was dispatched to Anatolia and put in charge of the Greek war. His purpose was to acquire a mercenary army of Greek hoplites. If he could get such a force to work in close coordination with Persian cavalry, he believed that, when his father died, he could oust his older brother from the throne and take it for himself.
In pursuit of this end, Cyrus sought to form a lasting friendship with a leading Spartan, to promote the man's fortunes at Lacedaemon, and to settle the war in Sparta's favorwhich is what he did. The man in question was a Spartiate named Lysander, and Cyrus supported him through thick and thin until he won the war. In the circumstances, the Athenian cause was very nearly hopeless. They could win and win and win again, and each time that they won Cyrus had a new fleet built for the Spartans. His resources were boundless; those of the Athenians were finite. Their only hope was that, before it was too late, Darius II would die and that his older brother would shunt Cyrus aside or that the Lacedaemonians would turn with a vengeance on Cyrus' Spartan favorite. In the end, however, they had no such luck. In 405, Lysander caught the Athenians off guard and annihilated their fleet at Aegospotami. In 404, after a lengthy siege, Athens surrendered. 
67
The Spartans were urged by their allies to destroy Athens. Instead, they installed a narrow oligarchy and made of her a satellite; for a time, that was her status-but not for long. The Athenians cannily exploited the divisions at Sparta, took advantage of the conflict that grew up between Lacedaemon and Achaemenid Persia and of the dissatisfaction of Sparta's allies-and, step by step, they regained their autonomy, then their freedom of action. Alongside Argos, Corinth, and Thebes, Athens labored to rein in the Spartans, and she eventually managed to found a second Athenian confederacy. But the strategic rivalry with Lacedaemon was never revived. The most that Athens and her new allies could do was to engineer a collapse of the Lacedaemonian empire-and this largely accrued to the benefit of the Great King.

Rome versus Carthage *
This is the story of two countries that had long enjoyed peaceable and sometimes friendly relations, that turned on each other and fought the most destructive series of wars of the ancient world (the Punic Wars, 264-146 BC). The end saw such a complete victory that the losing state was wiped out as a political unit. In fact, the Roman destruction of Carthage was the closest to genocide that antiquity got. Before that, however, Carthage inflicted the most humiliating battlefield defeat the Roman republic ever endured (Cannae, 216 BC), and it gave the ancient world one of its most glamorous and tactically brilliant commanders-Hannibal. How and why did this roller coaster ride of a conflict end as it did? Why did it happen in the first place?
Rome and Carthage fought three wars: 264-241 BC, 218-201 BC, and 149-146 BC The three conflicts are generally known by their Latin name, the Punic Wars; if Carthage had won, we might call them the Roman Wars. The name originated from the origins of Carthage, a colony of the Phoenician city Tyre (in today's Lebanon). Carthaginians spoke Phoenician and the Romans sometimes referred to them as Phoenicians. The adjective Phoenician is Punicus in Latin, hence the term Punic.
Not only is the name of the conflict Romano-centric, so are the sources of information. Almost no Carthaginian sources have survived, which leaves us at the mercy of Greco-Roman sources. Fortunately, they include two great historians, Livy (59 BC-AD 17) and Polybius (ca.200-ca.118 BC). Polybius, a Greek living in Rome, wrote the best surviving account of the Punic Wars. Still, discussions of Carthaginian motivation involve an element of guesswork.
In the beginning, geography and military culture kept the two states apart. Although they were both great powers, as a result of Carthage being primarily a sea power, and Rome primarily a land power, their interests rarely overlapped. Founded ca. 750 BC by Phoenicians from Tyre, Carthage acquired a maritime empire by expanding into the islands and coastal harbors of the central and western Mediterranean, from Sicily to Atlantic Spain. Rome, also founded in the eighth century BC, expanded on the Italian peninsula. Between about 509 and 265 BC, Rome became the ruler of all Italy south of a line running from the Arno to the Rubicon Rivers, that is, from the Tyrrhenian Sea at Pisae (modern Pisa) eastward to Ariminium (modern Rimini) on the Adriatic. In the 220s Rome conquered the Po Valley and the Alpine foothills and began their incorporation into the Republic's polity. At the start of the Punic Wars, Roman Italy was a piecemeal collection of Roman territory and colonies, close allies who spoke Latin like the Romans, and other, more diverse cities and territories speaking such languages as Etruscan, Oscan, and Greek.
By the mid-third century BC, Rome and Carthage were both great powers and beginning to bump into each other. A series of treaties between 509 and 279 BC kept each state to its own sphere, but conflict loomed. When Rome conquered southern Italy (265 BC) only a narrow strait separated it from Sicily, then a wealthy and grain-rich prize. Carthage, meanwhile, had failed to conquer eastern Sicily, despite centuries of trying, though their forces remained in western Sicily. When, in 264 BC, Carthage gained a foothold in the eastern Sicilian city of Messana (Messina), Rome decided to intervene.
The competition between Rome and Carthage was primarily a matter of security, although economic motives and personal ambitions played a part. Certainly, there was wealth aplenty in Sicily, for in antiquity it was not an impoverished backwater but, rather, one of the breadbaskets of the Mediterranean. Rome was unwilling to risk having a dynamic and powerful state like Carthage controlling the Straits of Messina, between Sicily and the Italian mainland, where it could block the commerce of the Greek cities of southern Italy, who were Rome's allies. Besides, ambitious Roman generals and large parts of the Roman people were tempted by the prospect of loot and glory in Sicily. For its part, Carthage could not tolerate Rome's presence in Sicily. If it seems surprising that two longtime treatypartners like Rome and Carthage turned on each other, it should not. Before this point, Roman and Carthaginian interests had not clashed; now they did, and as Lord Palmerston observed "nations have no eternal allies or perpetual enemies, only perpetual interests." 
1
Each state had access to a substantial treasury and a large population of potential soldiers. One big difference was that Rome used citizen-soldiers while Carthage did not. If that made Rome more conservative about sending armies abroad, it also made Carthage less invested in the outcome of its foreign expeditions. After an expedition was launched, Carthage typically gave its commanders a free hand but not much support from home. In the First Punic War in particular, Carthage made liberal use of mercenaries, whose loyalty could not be taken for granted. Switching approaches in the Second Punic War, Carthage relied more on allies. But these forces were more diverse and polyglot than Rome's allies, comprising as they did North Africans, Iberians, and Northern Italian Celts as well as a smaller number of Celts from north of the Alps. A Carthaginian commander, therefore, had to be as much a diplomat as a soldier if he hoped to hold his multiethnic force together.
Another big difference was in the treatment of allies. Both countries depended on allies, which, for the most part, both managed well. Still, this became a competitive advantage for Rome as many of its allies were geographically closer to the center of power, and linked by an extensive road network. Moreover, though both Carthage and Rome punished revolts brutally, Rome did a better job of wielding the carrot as well as the stick. By granting such privileges as the right to do business in Rome and to intermarry with Romans, Rome tied much of the population of Italy to it. But the greatest privilege of all, and the most forward-looking Roman policy, was liberal grants of Roman citizenship, a boon it offered to a large part of the conquered elite. By 225 BC, the Roman citizenry comprised one million free people including 300,000 adult males subject to military service. Rome also had access to about 450,000 allied troops, for a total of 750,000 soldiers. This was a huge number by ancient standards. While similar statistics for Carthage do not survive, it is clear that its reliable manpower pool was much smaller.
Rome's core allies, the most loyal and dependable, were in Central Italy. They represented a huge, reliable pool of soldiers. Moreover, Rome's exceptionally good alliance management kept almost all of these cities loyal even at the nadir of Roman fortunes and prestige. Hannibal understood this and made an extraordinary effort to win new allies, but he could only do so by granting them so many concessions that the alliances proved hol-
Enduring Strategic Rivalries:
Rome versus Carthage low. Only Rome seemed to have the "secret sauce" that made the core of its allies love it, fear it, and serve it.
Commitment by the home government was more of a factor for Rome than Carthage. One reason was geography, as most of the Punic Wars were fought far from Carthaginian territory. The First Punic War was waged mostly in Sicily, with an episode in North Africa, and the Second Punic War mostly in Spain, Italy, and Sicily until the final phase in North Africa. At its closest, Sicily is 105 miles from Carthaginian territory while it is just less than two miles from Italy.
Another reason was domestic politics. Although Rome watched its generals warily, Carthage was even more distrustful. The Carthaginian government punished defeated generals with crucifixion. It is difficult to speak with certainty about Carthaginian domestic politics since we depend almost entirely on foreign and largely hostile Greco-Roman sources. If those sources are right, we can detect a conflict of interest between, on the one hand, a landowning nobility whose focus was on domestic agriculture and trade and, on the other, a military elite that looked to war and empire abroad and often turned to the people rather than the Council of Elders for political support. Although a similar dichotomy can be found in Rome, it was possibly more pronounced in Carthage. It might explain both why the Carthaginian government came down so hard on its generals and why it was so stingy with re-enforcements and supplies.
What the Carthaginians lacked in quantity they made up for in quality. They were gifted with brilliant generalship, innovative plans, and a remarkable ability to do more with less. The Romans had no field commanders who could match the tactical élan of Hamilcar Barca or his son Hannibal. But élan works best in short, sharp bursts. The Carthaginian way of war succeeded in a quick campaign; it was not suited for a war of attrition against a politically cohesive republic equipped with enormous manpower resources, a firm alliance system, and sage leadership. In the Second Punic War in particular, the contrast between Hannibal's small but lethal professional and polyglot army encamped in enemy territory with little support from Carthage, and Rome's massive allied forces working near their home base and with all the time and patience in the world couldn't have been greater. It took all of Hannibal's energy and brilliance just to survive a war of attrition, while Rome became progressively stronger. The time frame also gave the adaptable Romans the chance to study Hannibal's tactics and master them. Eventually, a Roman version of Hannibal emerged in Publius Cornelius Scipio (236-183 BC). After nearly being killed in early confrontations with Hannibal, the Roman Scipio studied his bold and brilliant tactics, and when he had mastered them he trained the Romans to turn them back on the enemy. In the final result he was rewarded with the cognomen or nickname of Africanus, "the African," a reference to the site of his final victory over Carthage in North Africa, but in some ways his success in Spain was even more crucial.

Rome versus Carthage
We might compare Carthage to Germany or Japan in the Second World War. Each had tactically brilliant militaries and each won stunning, splendid, and quick victories. Yet each state then ran up against a resource-rich, politically cohesive, and well-led republic-the United States and the Soviet Union-that had little trouble absorbing early defeats and rebounding with devastating force, in some cases copying or even bettering the enemy's tactical innovations. Like the two greatest Axis powers, Carthage faced the frustration of how to turn its tactical genius into success in a war against a republic of massive strength. For all their similarities, neither Romans nor Carthaginians understood the other fully. Since they tended to be organization men themselves, the Romans could not imagine the emergence of a genius like Hannibal. The Romans had already forced the great Greek general Pyrrhus, King of Epirus (319-272 BC) to give up his invasion of Italy (280-275 BC) by making the cost too high, and it did not occur to them that Hannibal could do worse-if he could even reach Italy. (Incidentally, Rome had help against Pyrrhus from its then-ally Carthage.) The issue was not only Hannibal's superiority to Pyrrhus as a general, but the power of the state behind each man. Carthage, like Rome, was a republic, not a monarchy, and an economic giant, and, even if it proved to be relatively stingy in its support of Hannibal, it could, when the need was dire, marshal resources and willpower to a degree that far outstripped the capacity of a small kingdom like Epirus.
As for Carthage, like many a clever and dynamic society, it tended to underestimate the opposition. It was easy for them to caricature the Romans as dull and unimaginative when, in fact, they were pragmatic and ruthless. Beneath a veneer of conservatism, Rome embraced change. Again and again it proved willing to ditch cherished modes of behavior in order to survive. Carthage, at times, evinced a similar propensity but it lacked the staying power or the resources of the Romans.
It would be easy to write victor's history and tote up Rome's advantages and the reasons why it had to win in the end. It would also be wrong. Rome barely squeezed out victory in the First Punic War. It might have lost the Second Punic War had Carthage adjusted its strategy after its initial battlefield successes or if no Roman military genius had arisen to pay back Carthage in its own coin. For centuries after the Punic Wars, even when Carthaginian power was only a distant memory, the Romans frightened their children with the phrase Hannibal ad portas!-Hannibal is coming to the gates! Given the immense and nearly fatal damage that Hannibal did to Rome, the fear is understandable.
When Rome and Carthage began fighting over Sicily, it soon became clear that Rome dominated on land and Carthage on sea. It was a classic case of an elephant versus a whale but with a twist-the elephant learned to swim and the whale learned to walk on land.
Over the space of a generation, Rome turned itself into a competitive sea power. It took the help of its Greek allies in southern Italy and an enormous sacrifice in blood and treasure by the Roman people. Meanwhile, Carthage became a brilliant land power that excelled on seaborne attacks on southern Italy led by a military star, Hamilcar Barca. His arrival in Sicily in 247 BC rejuvenated the Carthaginian war effort.
In the early years of the war, the Romans drove the Carthaginians out of eastern Sicily but they were not able to dislodge them from the western part of the island.
There were indecisive battles on land (near Messina and Agrigentum) and on sea (at Mylae, Ecnomus, and Drepana). Looking for new solutions, in 256 BC Rome invaded North Africa under the general Marcus Atilius Regulus. After initial Roman victories, the Carthaginians regrouped, defeated the Roman army and captured Regulus.
The Romans quickly realized that, Sicily being an island, they could not prevail unless they could defeat Carthage at sea. At great expense, Rome built a series of large fleets. Still, Carthaginian rowers and helmsmen were well trained and capable of dazzling maneuvers the ill-trained Roman seaman could not hope to match. As the Romans could not compete with Carthage in a standard set-piece naval battle, they developed the corvus, literally "raven," a grapnel or, more precisely, a hooked metal gangplank that allowed them to send marines onto the enemy's ships. The result was to turn sea battles into land battles, a realm where Roman soldiers held the advantage. Unfortunately, the heavy corvus put Roman ships at greater risk of sinking in storms. Eventually, Roman sailors mastered maneuver warfare and so the navy was able to dispense with the corvus.
Hamilcar did not fight any set battles but relied, rather, on unconventional land tactics and seaborne raids. By such methods, he kept the Romans on the defensive in western Sicily and inflicted major casualties. Meanwhile, he raided both eastern Sicily and the coast of Italy as far north as Cumae, only about 150 miles from Rome. Worse, from Rome's perspective, he proved stubbornly impervious to all attempts to defeat and dislodge him.
Hamilcar's successes only underscored the need for Rome to expand its war aims: in addition to driving Carthage out of Sicily, they wanted to prevent it from being able to project its power into Italy. Hence the need to destroy Carthage's fleet-physically by crushing it in battle, financially by imposing a crippling indemnity, and geographically by forcing Carthage to leave Sicily and all the other islands of the central Mediterranean. But how was Rome to achieve these goals against Hamilcar Barca?
The answer lies in a debate between the two theorists Admiral Alfred Thayer Mahan  (1840-1914) and Sir Julian Corbett (1854-1922) about the efficacy of sea power. Mahan argued that command of the sea, won via decisive battle, won wars. Corbett disagreed; he argued that sea power was limited in what it could accomplish, that control of the sea lanes mattered more than battle, and that wars were decided on land. In general, ancient history 3-6 tends to favor Corbett. Sea power was of great importance but it rarely won wars. The First Punic War was an exception.
Polybius argues convincingly that the war was won at sea. His Romans learned a hard lesson: they thought they could win the war by their army alone but that turned out to be untrue because they could not beat Hamilcar Barca. Polybius wrote:
For the last five years [247-242 BC] indeed they had entirely abandoned the sea, partly because of the disasters they had sustained there, and partly because they felt confident of deciding the war by means of their land forces; but they now determined for the third time to make trial of their fortune in naval warfare. They saw that their operations were not succeeding according to their calculations, mainly owing to the obstinate gallantry of the Carthaginian general [that is, Hamilcar Barca]. They therefore adopted this resolution from a conviction that by this means alone, if their design were but well directed, would they be able to bring the war to a successful conclusion.

Carthage also had to surrender the islands that lay between Sicily and Italy, that is, the Aeolian and Lipari Islands-which were essential for ancient navigation between North Africa and Italy. As ancient warships were light and vulnerable, they needed to hug the coast when they traveled and to make frequent stops, otherwise they had to travel with heavy supply ships that would slow them down, and risk the dangers of the open sea. Without being able to land in these islands it would be difficult for Carthage to invade Italy. As punitive as this was, Rome soon made things worse.
Unable to pay its mercenaries, Carthage now faced a revolt that found it fighting for its life in North Africa, the so-called "Truceless War" (241-37 BC). Rome took advantage of Carthage's discomfit by annexing the islands of Corsica and Sardinia, treacherously claiming that they lay "between Sicily and Italy" and so were covered by the peace treaty. They certainly were possible way stations on the naval route to Italy from Carthage-now denied the enemy by Rome. Rome also upped the indemnity. By adding insult to injury, Rome stoked Carthaginian bitterness. Sardinia's loss was especially painful, as it was a major Phoenician colony with a strong Carthaginian presence. In some sense it was a foolish move but it represented the Roman propensity for taking the audacious moves when it felt its security threatened. Even if such actions made a future war with Carthage more likely, Rome preferred investing in its long-term safety by cutting the naval route from North Africa to Sicily and Italy.
Carthage also lost its naval edge-permanently, as it turned out. Rome now became the leading naval power of the Mediterranean. Although Carthage eventually built a new fleet, it could not compete with the Roman navy, either in numbers or seamanship.
The First Punic War, like the First World War, sowed the seeds for renewed conflict about a generation later. Twenty-one years separated the two world wars of the twentieth century and twenty-three lay between the First and Second Punic Wars. Rome had reaped huge advantages from its victory in the First Punic War, but the vigorous Carthaginians fought back. Under Hamilcar Barca's leadership, they built a new empire in southern Spain, an area rich in silver and mercenaries. What Hamilcar Barca founded in Spain was continued by his son, Hannibal.
The Punic Wars were born of fear, greed, and self-interest, but honor quickly kicked in. Neither Hamilcar Barca nor Hannibal would stand for submitting to men who had never defeated them in a land battle. Nor could they forgive the treachery and insult of Rome's seizure of Corsica and Sardinia and at the very time when Carthage was fighting for its life against a mercenary revolt. The story goes that when Hannibal was still a boy, his father made him swear an oath of eternal hatred for Rome. Whether the tale is true or not, Hannibal showed that he had no trust for Rome or belief in the possibility of peaceful coexistence.
Hannibal is rightly remembered as one of history's greatest leaders. As Polybius wrote, Hannibal "was by his very nature truly a marvelous man, with a personality suited by its original constitution to carry out anything that lies within human affairs."

Rome versus Carthage master commander, with sufficient boldness to invade a great empire with a small but professional army. Moreover, he was adept at propaganda, diplomacy, and had the unquestioned loyalty of his men who never once mutinied in spite of spending 15 years in difficult conditions in enemy territory.
The stage for war was set in the 220s BC when Rome tried to contain Carthaginian expansion in Spain. The first step was to make a treaty with Carthage in the mid-220s establishing the River Ebro in northeastern Spain as the boundary of Carthaginian territory. Nervous nonetheless about the enemy's dynamism, Rome also engaged in a series of alliances, most notably with the city of Saguntum-a Greek trading city that lay south of the Ebro. Rather than make a formal alliance Rome accepted Saguntum as a friend, which, in effect, made Rome the city's patron. As Saguntum had incited several Spanish tribes to resist Carthage, Rome's new relationship with the city was viewed by the Carthaginians as an indirect attack on themselves. It is likely that Rome saw things the same way. Hannibal, though, refused to be threatened, and laid siege to Saguntum. Nor would he back off when Rome threatened Carthage with war. Rather, with the support of Carthage's home government, he not only accepted war-he brought it to Italy.
Frightened by Carthage's rebound, Rome tried to use surrogates to contain Carthage's Spanish empire but it failed to reckon with Hannibal's brilliance. When war came, Hannibal chose not to sit on the defensive, but lacking a navy, he was forced to take a perilous path of an overland assault, through hostile territory and over the Alps (in late autumn, as it turned out).
It was one of history's most audacious and shocking strategic moves. The Romans paid a heavy price for underestimating Hannibal, a strategic blunder that rivaled Hannibal's brilliant march. At the start of the Second Punic War, Rome never dreamt that Hannibal could bring the war to Italy, so his decent from the alps with an army at his back, in November 218, was a profound shock among the Roman people. Worse was to come because the Romans had, as of yet, no inkling of Hannibal's tactical genius or his ability to exploit Roman mistakes in the field.
Fortunately for the Romans, Hannibal's 900-mile-long trek from his capital of New Carthage to Italy was carried out with a mix of panache and error. Hannibal knew the road would be hard, but he had underestimated the difficulties and should surely have set out earlier in the year, so as to cross the Alps before the snow. As a result of his late march, Hannibal lost most of his army on his miserable overland march. He left Spain with 50,000 infantry and 9,000 cavalry; he reached Italy with only 20,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry. Some of the losses came in combat; some died of exposure, but most probably deserted. Apparently, all of Hannibal's 37 elephants survived.
Despite his depleted force, Hannibal's appearance in Northern Italy shocked Rome. The Senate was planning an invasion of North Africa but immediately canceled it and or-3-9 dered the assembled legions north to defend their homeland. This first, and several subsequent attempts, to stop Hannibal did not go well. In fact, Hannibal set off an even greater series of tremors within the Roman system by smashing several Roman armies over the next few years, culminating in the horrific carnage at Cannae. Soon after crossing the Alps, Hannibal supplemented his meager manpower with allies from the Celtic peoples of the Po Valley. He had previously sent ambassadors to them while still in Spain to gain their support. But now they were balking, having expected something more impressive than Hannibal's small, bedraggled, and exhausted force. But after a well-timed massacre of the Taurini people (in the vicinity of modern Turin), Hannibal cowed the opposition and a bit more surprisingly won their support.
Hannibal was a superb tactician, a brilliant and inspiring leader of men. Moreover, he was cunning, unpredictable, and hard-nosed. His specialty was combined infantry-cavalry attack, which he used to tremendous effect on the battlefield. The Romans, by comparison, were unimaginative and unsurprising. They had little taste for cavalry, which they relied largely on their allies to supply. The Romans, first and foremost, were infantrymen, and they usually deployed their men in a simple, straightforward attack. They won because of their toughness, their manpower and their wise use of reserves. In the long term, Rome's manpower would wear Hannibal down but, in the short term, it was not enough to outdo Hannibal on the battlefield.
Hannibal went on to defeat the Romans three times in 218 and 217: at a cavalry skirmish near the Ticinus River, a set battle in the valley of the Trebia River in which he killed or captured about two-thirds of the Roman army, that is, about 28,000 men while suffering few losses; and a massacre of another Roman army at Lake Trasimene in Central Italy in which the Carthaginians killed 15,000 Roman soldiers and captured another 10,000-15,000, while incurring only meager losses.
At the initiative of their emergency leader or dictator (then only a six-month, temporary position) Fabius Maximus, the Romans now switched to a defensive strategy-hence the origin of the term "Fabian strategy." Their goal was now to harass the enemy and to deny him food and resources without risking another set battle. They scored a measure of success, but Hannibal still outfoxed and humiliated them on several occasions. Never comfortable on the defensive, the Romans went back on the attack in 216 BC. The result was the greatest defeat in the history of the republic; not until the Later Roman Empire and the battle of Adrianople (AD 378) would Rome suffer a comparable battlefield loss.
The Battle of Cannae took place on August 2, 216 BC in Apulia in southern Italy. Hannibal had about 50,000 men, the Romans 86,000, enough of a disparity for the Romans to believe they could win with a simple steamroller tactic. Hannibal, by contrast, orchestrated a sophisticated pincer movement. His cavalry defeated the enemy on his flanks, as his infantry executed a planned retreat. Once the Romans had marched into the trap, the

Carthaginian cavalry returned and cut off the enemy's rear while Hannibal's infantry surrounded the Romans on three sides and butchered them. By the time the battle was over, the Romans had suffered 48,000 deaths and 20,000 men captured. Hannibal had about 6,000-8,000 men killed, most of them from his Celtic allied troops-his least reliable troops. The Romans lost about 75 percent of their army while the Carthaginians lost only about 10-15 percent of theirs. It was one of the most stunning battlefield victories in history.
Hannibal's victories since entering Italy left the Romans fearful "for themselves and for their native soil."

Rome versus Carthage money, and ships to the Carthaginians but fear of Rome held them back, especially after the Romans responded by allying with Philip's enemies in Greece.
The Carthaginians' biggest blunder, however, was their underestimation of Roman resolve. They thought that Rome was a normal state of the era, that is, one that would sue for peace after having suffered major losses on the battlefield. They did not understand that the Romans were playing a different game; the Romans considered their conflict with Carthage no Kabinettskrieg but a struggle for survival. Nor did they understand the cohesiveness of both the Roman polity and the Roman alliance system in central Italy. Perhaps Carthage was thinking in terms of its own allies, who were far less dependable. Hence, they were surprised when Romans demonstrated the will and the wherewithal to forego surrender and to fight until victory, no matter the setback. After Cannae they refused to even discuss Hannibal's offer of peace terms. They even sent a Roman prisoner, used as a go-between., back to Hannibal, bound and tied, as a sign of their determination. To the Carthaginian government the wars were more on the order of Kabinettskrieg. They were never willing to go to the mat to win in the way the Romans were.
Although it is difficult to speak with confidence about the Carthaginian political system, it appears that there was a disjunction between leading generals and the Council of Elders that did not exist in Rome. Rome experienced tension between the Senate and great field commanders such as Fabius Maximus and Scipio Africanus but it was not comparable to the hostility between the Elders and Hannibal. From the point of view of the Carthaginian oligarchy, Hannibal-like Pompey or Caesar two centuries later in Rome-is a dominant figure who threatened to overshadow the political system.
Carthage was now Rome's superior in land battle. Unfortunately, Hannibal's victories were hollow. Rome reacted to its terrible losses with equanimity. It was a tribute to the leadership provided by the Senate and the fortitude of the people.
Rome's position after Cannae might be compared to Britain's position after Dunkirk and the Battle of Britain. Rome and Britain each endured bitter and bloody defeats and suffered humiliation at the hands of a triumphant enemy. Yet each country knew that its position remained strong. The Royal Navy protected the British Isles and represented a successful deterrence to any German invasion. To no one's surprise, the Germans never came close to launching Operation Sea Lion, the naval invasion of England. The Royal Air Force successfully limited the damage that the Luftwaffe could do to British cities and airfields, even if it couldn't stop the enemy entirely. Britain could still undertake limited offensive operations overseas, sometimes with success, as in the destruction of the French fleet or the attack on the Italian fleet in Taranto, both in 1940. Meanwhile, the United States stood in the wings, officially neutral but acting as Britain's ally, supplying arms, confronting German submarines, and readying its military manpower and industry for eventual entry into the war.
Rome likewise knew that in spite of the damage wrought by Hannibal, its main strengths remained untouched. The Romans counted on Hannibal's dislike of sieges. Siegecraft was to Hannibal in the Second Punic War what conventional naval operations were to the Germans in World War II.
No less important, Rome's central Italian alliance proved strong enough to survive battlefield losses, for which it provided plenty of replacements. Although Hannibal spent fifteen long years in Italy, he never made a serious crack in the core of Rome's alliance in Central Italy.
Mahan argued that Roman command of the sea and control of interior lines won the Second Punic War:
To overthrow Rome it was necessary to attack her in Italy at the heart of her power, and shatter the strongly linked confederacy of which she was the head. This was the objective. To reach it, the Carthaginians needed a solid base of operations and a secure line of communications. The former was established in Spain by the genius of the great Barca family; the latter was never achieved. There were two lines possible, the one direct by sea, the other circuitous through Gaul. The first was blocked by the Roman sea power, the second imperiled and finally intercepted through occupation of northern Spain by the Roman army. This occupation was made possible through control of the sea, which the Carthaginians never endangered. With respect to Hannibal and his base, therefore, Rome occupied two central positions, Rome itself and northern Spain, joined by an easy interior line of communications, the sea; by which mutual support was continually given.

After Cannae Hannibal asked for major reinforcements in men, money, and grain from the Carthaginian state. What he got instead was meager. Instead, Carthage sent its resources to new fronts in Sicily and Sardinia. In the end, these efforts frittered away the state's strengths without reaping any rewards, since Rome held on to both islands. It was a coup for Carthage to win the support of the great Sicilian city-state of Syracuse in 215 BC, but Rome retook Syracuse in 212 BC after a long siege and killed its most famous defender, the great mathematician and scientist Archimedes. If Carthage had sent Hannibal more money and manpower and if Hannibal had concentrated on prying away Rome's key allies by picking off states in Central Italy, one by one, he might have been able to crack the heart of the Roman confederacy. By proving to Rome's oldest and most faithful friends that Rome could no

In fact, one could argue that what cost Carthage the war was not too little attention to sea power but too much. It was arguably Carthage's mistaken attempt of focusing on getting back its naval bases in Sardinia and Sicily that cost it the war. Meanwhile, although Carthage did build enough warships to compete with Rome at sea, it lacked admirals bold enough to risk a battle.
Then there was Rome's ability to keep its eyes on the prize. Slowly but methodically, Rome reconquered the Italian and Sicilian states that had joined Hannibal and inflicted brutal punishment in the form of plunder, enslavement and confiscation of land. The great southern Italian city of Capua left the Roman alliance for Hannibal after Cannae but Rome retook it in 211 BC. The Romans then killed, imprisoned or enslaved the inhabitants and annexed most of Capua's territory.
In spite of Hannibal's presence in Italy for a long fifteen years, and the defection of most of southern and northern Italy, Rome still was able to muster sufficient force to send expeditionary forces strong enough to eventually conquer Carthaginian Spain. The leader of this effort was Scipio Africanus. Audacious, charismatic, and adaptive, Scipio learned Hannibal's tactics and brought them to Rome. At the age of only 26 he captured New Carthage (Cartagena), the Carthaginian capital of Spain. He then won two great set battles against Carthaginian armies (Baecula, 209 BC; Ilipa, 206 BC) and drove Carthage from Spain. Unfortunately for Rome, Hannibal's brother Hasdrubal escaped and brought a major army of reinforcements to Italy-finally. Increased by Gallic recruits, Hasdrubal's army had about 30,000 men when the Romans caught it in 207 BC, and forced a battle at the Metaurus River (in the hills of northeastern Italy). The Romans crushed Hasdrubal before he could reach his brother, thereby ending any possibility of Carthaginian victory in Italy. Scipio's next move was diplomatic, and it was a coup-he won over the Numidian prince Massinissa to the side of Rome. Carthage fought back, and it was a difficult struggle but, in the end, Numidia defected to Rome. Numidia had played a crucial role in supplying Carthage with cavalry, so this move was a game-changer. Hannibal had never pried the enemy's key allies in Central Italy away from Rome but, by winning over Numidia, Scipio deprived Carthage of its key ally. It underlines the difference in the two sides' alliances and its importance in deciding the war.
Scipio invaded North Africa in 204 BC, thereby compelling Hannibal to leave Italy the next year and sail to the defense of his homeland. Scipio fought a set battle against Hannibal (Zama 202 BC) where he outdid the master and destroyed Hannibal's army. It was Massinissa's Numidian cavalry tipped the balance and brought Scipio his victory. Carthage now surrendered and agreed to be small state reined in to its North African homeland, weighted down once again by a huge indemnity.
Enduring Strategic Rivalries:
Rome versus Carthage Rome, meanwhile, had become a military giant. Before Hannibal's invasion it typically put 6-8 legions (roughly 30,000 men) in the field; during the Second Punic War it fielded up to 28 legions (roughly 120,000 men) plus allied forces. It had added two million acres of public land to its control, confiscated from rebellious allies. It had acquired a new empire in Spain, a new ally in Numidia, and it was poised to take revenge on Macedon. By guiding the state to victory, the Roman Senate gained a new ability to direct Roman policy, with the aid of impressive new leaders like Scipio Africanus. With Carthage reduced to second-rate status no civilized power challenged Rome's domination of the Central and Western Mediterranean, although primitive tribes in Spain and Gaul still posed a challenge. Rome was now ready to turn eastward, where in only a dozen years to defeated the two greatest powers of the Hellenistic Greek world-Macedon and Syria.
The final conflict between Rome and Carthage was less a duel than a massacre. Carthage had done nothing more offensive than recover as a wealthy and vibrant city-state. Rome considered this intolerable because it feared an enemy revival, so it decided to eliminate Carthage as a political entity. It gave the Carthaginians an ultimatum: either abandon their city and disperse or fight to the death. The Carthaginians chose the latter, and the Romans sacked and destroyed the former queen of North Africa. The wars between Rome and Carthage came to their tragic end.
Five years after the end of the Second Punic War, Hannibal was elected to the position of suffete or chief magistrate of Carthage. During his yearlong term (196 BC), he reformed the Carthaginian government and did away with the problem of massive corruption. As a result, Carthage was quickly able to repay the tribute that Rome had imposed and without raising taxes. In short order, Carthage was prosperous again and an economic powerhouse.
A nervous Rome forced Hannibal into exile a year later, in 195 BC. The old warrior made his way to the kingdom of Antiochus III in Anatolia, another enemy of Rome. There Hannibal served as an advisor in Antiochus's failed war with Rome (192-188 BC). Forced into exile again, he left for Bithynia (in northwestern Turkey). Trapped by the Romans there in 183 BC, Hannibal took poison rather than surrender and face humiliation. He left behind an accusation that the Romans lacked the decency to let an old man die in peace.
Meanwhile, the men who ran Carthage made it a model ally of Rome. They denounced Hannibal and helped Rome in its various wars. Through it all, Carthage prospered. The city was a major port, and remained the commercial center of North Africa. The city grew rich again on its agriculture produce and manufactured goods. It was proof, if any were needed, that even without an overseas empire, Carthage was a virtual gold mine.

Rome versus Carthage
Unfortunately for Carthage, King Massinissa of Numidia stirred the pot. The Romans continued to use Numidia as a client state to pin Carthage down. By the treaty ending the Second Punic War, Massinissa was permitted to expand his territory, but Carthage could not wage even defensive war without Roman permission. The result was that Massinissa continuously expanded his territory at Carthaginian expense. Carthage appealed to Rome to arbitrate, and Roman boundary commissioners visited North Africa to investigate from time to time, but Rome did little to help Carthage. Over time, Massinissa reduced Carthaginian territory to a shadow of its former size.
Finally, in 154 BC, a Roman boundary commission headed by Marcus Porcius Cato visited the city of Carthage. Cato was known for his patriotism, his ambition, his imperialism, and his eye for agricultural and commercial wealth. The riches, dynamism, and military might of the city could not help but impress. Cato declared himself horrified. When he got back to Rome, Cato immediately called for a declaration of war, ending all his speeches with the pronouncement, Delenda est Carthago-Carthage Must Be Destroyed! On the one hand, Cato and his supporters might have imagined a new military threat emerging from Carthage. Such a worry was surely overblown, but it did not help the cause of peace when in 151 BC. Carthage dismissed its pro-Roman government and, the next year, went to war with Massinissa, whose attacks had pushed it over the edge. Not only did Carthage lose the war; it was now guilty of having violated its peace treaty with Rome.
On the other hand, Rome coveted Carthage's wealth. Carthage competed with Rome over commercial markets. Leading senators, including Cato himself, had invested in trade and shipping. For fifty years Carthage had bought off Rome annually by paying the enormous indemnity imposed at the end of the Second Punic War but, in 152 BC, Carthage finished making those payments.
If Sicily had been a rich prize ripe for the picking in 264 BC, now a little over a century later, Carthage was perhaps even richer. And it could hardly take another 23 years to defeat it, as it had taken Rome to conquer Sicily in the First Punic War. Between fear and greed, the temptation for war was overwhelming. In 149 BC, Rome declared war.
Carthage sent ambassadors to Rome to sue for peace. The Romans demanded that Carthage abandon and destroy the city and move inland at least ten miles from the coast. In righteous anger, Carthage prepared for a siege.
The siege lasted three years. Well-defended as it was, Carthage could not be taken easily. In the second year, Scipio Aemilianus (185-129 BC), the adopted grandson of Scipio Africanus, emerged as the hero of the army, and was appointed commander. In April 146 BC, Rome broke through the Carthaginian defenses. After eight days of savage street fighting, Carthage finally fell, for the first time in its long history. Rome subjected the survivors to enslavement or forced migration. Large parts of the city were burned and the territory was declared uninhabitable. The rest of the territory of Carthage (roughly equivalent to today's Tu-3-16 nisia) was declared the Roman province of Africa Proconsularis. The new provincial capital was the city of Utica (near modern Bizerte, Tunisia), a seaport north of Carthage and its frequent rival. Utica had rebelled against Carthage during the Truceless War. In 150 BC, and on the eve of the Third Punic War, Utica had defected to Rome.
Carthaginian territory, with all its agricultural wealth, now belonged to Rome. Carthaginian traders no longer competed with Roman merchants. Carthaginian arms no longer disturbed the sleep of nervous Roman strategists.
Rome destroyed Carthage both as a city and an independent state. Not since the capture and destruction of their nearby rival, the Etruscan city of Veii, in 396 BC, had the Romans inflicted such an annihilation on an enemy. It was one of the most thorough defeats in history.
Since the Romans were willing to let the Carthaginians survive if they would abandon their city, and since the Punic language and Punic culture did in fact outlive the destruction of Carthage-although in attenuated form-we might absolve the Romans of the charge of genocide. But they were certainly guilty of what might be called "civitaticide," the destruction of a state if not of a people.
During the course of their long conflict, Rome and Carthage each adapted to changing conditions but Rome did it better. Carthage made a series of brilliant but empty strategic choices. Rome's strategy was more conservative, less dazzling, more solid, and ultimately successful. As often in history, the tortoise beats the hare. Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East
The Rivals: Rome, Parthia, and Persia For seven hundred years, imperial Rome clashed first with Arsacid Parthia, and then Sassanid Persia for hegemony in the Near East (today misnamed the Middle East). The two powers represented related, but fundamentally different civilizations. Rome, as republic and empire, was a Mediterranean power and based on the civic traditions of the Classical world. Even under the autocracy of later Christian emperors, appeals persisted to the Republican notions of the rule of law for and by citizens. Parthia and Sassanid Persia, each, was a Near Eastern monarchy, and so heir to the royal ideology and institutions stretching back to the first Mesopotamian Empire of Sargon of Akkad. Throughout the rivalry, imperial Rome enjoyed significant advantages in political organization, military power, and wealth over both Parthia and Persia.
Rome entered the Near East as an imperial Republic dominated by an abundance of ambitious aristocrats who as elected magistrates commanded legions or as members of the Senate determined strategy and operations. Throughout the rivalry, Rome fielded the superior army that could win battles and capture cities. Rome also had the political institutions to turn conquered lands into tax paying provinces. The Roman Republic drew its strength from citizens willing to serve and sacrifice (as was characteristic of a citystate), but it enjoyed the military power of great bureaucratic monarchy. By the early first century B.C., the legions were citizens who volunteered for military service in expectation of plunder rather than the draftees who had defeated Carthage. Legionaries saw their prime loyalty to their commander, hailed imperator, who delivered victory and rewards. Hence, after 88 B.C., they turned their swords against fellow citizens as willingly as foreign foes so that the Republic was rocked by successive civil wars. In 31-27 B.C. Augustus ended civil war, and instituted a monarchy, the Principate, which was a military dictatorship cloaked in Republican symbols. Augustus transformed the army into a full time professional one, tied to the ruling Julio-Claudian family, and comprised of two arms, the legions and the auxiliary units (auxilia). The legionaries, heavy infantry, were citizens who fought in close order formations. They opened the attack with volleys of heavy javelins (pilum), and closed with the sword (gladius) for shock action. The legions employed a number of formations, depending on terrain and foe, so that they adopted a phalanx when countering Iranian cavalry. The auxiliaries, provincials who obtained Roman citizenship upon discharge, were also professionals under Roman officers who used Latin as the language of command. The auxiliaries provided light infantry, missile units of archers and slingers, and cavalry. The imperial army, even after the reforms of the early fourth century, remained primarily an infantry army, so that campaigns in the Near East required meticulous logistics. The Roman imperial army was unmatched in its chain of command, discipline, engineering, logistics, and, above all, its professionalism. Legionaries and auxiliaries served in units with distinctive banners and histories, each sanctified by its own religious rites. Officers and men forged intense bonds of comradeship comparable to those of British regiments of the nineteenth century. Emperors promoted and rewarded, and so inspired loyalty to both the imperial family and Rome. Soldiers thus fought out of a mixture of motives, to their units, to the emperor, and to the majesty of the Roman people down to the reign of Diocletian (284-305).

War and diplomacy rested on each power's ability to exact revenues to sustain armies. Imperial Rome had by far greater revenues. The Roman historian Tacitus noted this disparity, commenting on how imperial revenues were collected by "Parthia by means of compulsion; Rome by imperial organization."

In contrast, the Arsacid Kings of Parthia lacked the cities and trade that generated the currency to support a royal bureaucracy and standing army. Instead, vassal rulers and nomadic tribes on the Central Eurasian steppes rendered tribute and answered summons to serve with retainers of cavalry in war. The fiscal arrangements between Arsacid king and the wealthy cities of Babylonia (today lower Iraq) and southwestern Iran are undocumented. These cities, along with taxes collected on the stretch of the Silk Road from Margiane (Merv) to Ecbatana (Hamadan), provided the bulk of the hard cash of the Arsacid treasury. For 250 years, the middle period of the rivalry (113-363), these wealthy cities of Babylonia were exposed to Roman attack so that later Arsacid kings and early 4-3 Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East Sassanid Shahs were at a strategic disadvantage, because they could not afford to lose these cities.
The Persian Shahs have been credited with ruling a far more centralized state, but this view has been seriously called into question. The number of cities in the Sassanid Empire did not significantly increase between the third and seventh centuries. To be sure. fiscal institutions are not well documented (in contrast to the plethora of Roman records), but the Shahs most likely succeeded to an imperial confederacy similar to that of the Parthians. The Sassanid Shahs of the third and fourth century, however, exploited the decline of Kushan power to gain access to the wealth of the fabled caravan cities of Transoxiana and the Indus valley. Rome thus faced a rival in Sassanid Persia that was twice the strength of Arsacid Parthia. In the early fifth century, Sassanid Shahs, just like their Roman contemporaries, suffered major losses of territory and revenues when Hephthalites ("White Huns") overran these eastern lands. Persia too was ravaged by the cycle of pandemics after 542. Hence, both rivals, Rome and Persia, were considerably weaker when they escalated the rivalry after 572. Given the revenues and manpower available, both powers should have sought diplomatic solutions rather than waged wars to overthrow the other power. In short, both powers were fighting beyond their means in the last sixty years of the rivalry.

The Sassanid Shahs too ruled a confederation of vassal kings and cities rather than a bureaucratic empire.

Rome and her Iranian foes, Parthia and Persia, despite their differences in institutions and wealth, based their strategic aims in the Near East on the same conditions of geography and terrain. Furthermore, the rival empires shared the same broad security concerns, even thought they were propelled by different ideologies and possessed very different military capabilities. Throughout this long standing strategic rivalry two regions were crucial to each imperial power's position in the Near East: Armenia (today eastern Turkey), and Mesopotamia (today al-Jazirah or the borderlands divided among Turkey,
Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East Syria, and Iraq and largely inhabited by Kurds).

Armenia is a high plateau of grasslands, bounded to the north by the Caucasus, and to the south by the Anti-Taurus mountains. The average elevation of the Armenian plateau is 3,000 feet above sea level, and the mountain chains rise to over 5,000 feet. Logistics proved daunting to any army accustomed to campaigning in the Mediterranean world. Roman soldiers must have found the terrain harsh and unfamiliar, and the horizon seemingly endless. Even in Antiquity, timber was scarce, and today the manure of animals is the prime fuel. The growing season for grains was short, but the grasslands sustained flocks and herds. In the Mediterranean world, armies could march at the beginning of May when the winter grain was "milk ripe," and well provisioned forces could commence a march in April such as Cyrus the Younger and the Ten Thousand in 401 B.C.

Once Rome crossed the Aegean Sea, and acquired provinces in Western Asia Minor, she was inevitably drawn east beyond the Euphrates into Armenia to control two strategic routes. These west-east routes linked Asia Minor with Iran, with extensions that led north across the Caucasus. The first route was the Roman highway in northern Asia Minor guarded by the legionary fortress at Satala (Sadak). It ran west to east from the Lycus valley (Kelkit Çayı) across the plateau to the Armenian capital of Artaxata (Artashat), which lay just to the east of the Araxes (Aras) River.

The second, southern, highway running due east from the legionary base of Melitene (Malatya) crossed the Euphrates to Tomisa, in the Armenian kingdom of Sophene. Near modern Elazığ (Medieval Kharput),

Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East eastern and southeastern shores of Lake Van-the heartland of Urartu--and then east to Iran via Hoşap, a strategic fortress during the Ottoman-Safavid Wars.
The Armenian plateau was also strategic to the rival imperial powers because of the north-south routes leading across the Caucasus mountains to the Pontic-Caspian steppes of southern Russia The Dariel Pass, often called the Caucasian Gates by Classical authors, was a priority to Rome, because it offered to nomadic invaders easy entrance into northeastern Asia Minor. 
10
11
The second strategic region was called by the Romans Mesopotamia, defined by the Anti-Taurus on its northern frontier, the great bend of the Euphrates River along its western and southern boundaries, and the upper Tigris in the east. At Bitlis is the strategic pass between Mesopotamia and Armenia. Rome had to guard two strategic west-east routes across the Upper Euphrates into Mesopotamia. The first route was the highway that ran from Melitene (Malayta) across the Euphrates to Tomisa, in Sophene, and then branched southeast from Elazığ via the Ergani pass to the cities of the upper Tigris valley, notably Amida (Diyabakır) and Tigranocerta. Roman legions stationed in eastern Asia Minor at Melitene (Malayta) and Samosata defended the crossings over the Euphrates at the western termini of this route. Between the two bases lay the rugged terrain of Commagene that restricted communications and movement.

13
Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East Simply put, Rome and her Iranian rivals preferred to control Armenia through a client king, but each imperial power could annex and administer Mesopotamia. Initially Rome preferred to entrust power to Arab dynasts who ruled the Aramaic-speaking caravan cities and doubled as tribal leaders commanding ethnic regiments. But in 198-200, Septimius Severus (193-211) organized the province of Mesopotamia based on the fortresses of Edessa (Urfa), Carrhae (Harran), Rhesanea (Ra's al'-Ayn), Singara (Singar), and Nisibis (Nusaybin). Amida (modern Diyabakır) on the upper Tigris was added in the early fourth century A.D. In 299, the Caesar Galerius compelled Shah Narses (293-302) to cede five strategic provinces with their fortresses, including Tigranocerta, on the northeastern banks of the upper Tigris.

Pass and Caspian Gates. The nomadic tribes north of the Caucasus were drawn to the grasslands and winter pastures of the delta of the Cyrus River (today Kura) flowing into the Caspian Sea. These lands of Classical Albania (Azerbaijan) were ideal for steppe nomads down to the time of Tamerlane (1370-1405). To the south, the main river of eastern Armenia, the Araxes (today Aras) flows to join the Cyrus, and its tributaries offered routes into Media Atropatene, the northern frontier lands of Iran. Mesopotamia, as defined by the Romans, was valuable to possess and tax, but it was also strategic to the defense of the cities of Babylonia, notably Ctesiphon and Seleucia ad Tigrim, the twin capitals of the Parthian Empire. The legionaries of Marcus Aurelius sacked Seleucia ad Tigrim in 165. This sack, along with changes of the river course, led to the abandonment of the city. In May 363, the emperor Julian found only melancholy ruins. The Sassanid Shah Ardashir I built a successor city Veh Ardashir, the Coche in the account of Ammianus Marcellinus. Neither Arsacid nor Sassanid monarchs could afford to lose these capitals. By the treaty of 363, Shapur II secured the fortresses of eastern Mesopotamia that acted as a strategic shield against further Roman attack against Ctesiphon.
In Armenia, the Parthian kings enjoyed a significant advantage over Rome. Armenian lords, dubbed naxarars in the Middle Ages, were unruly proud warriors driven by blood feud and a keen sense of honor. In martial ethos and customs they shared far more with their counterparts in Iran rather than the aristocrats of the Mediterranean world.

Given the limits of communications in the ancient world, converting this information into effective policy was daunting. Commanders of the Roman Republic were given wide powers to pursue operations in the field, and to conclude wars. The final settlement rested with the Roman Senate which sent a legation of experienced, senior members to conclude a war. Lucullus, the proconsul commanding the war against King Mithridates VI Eupator, twice in 72 and 69 B.C., had to determine strategy because it was impossible to consult with the Senate at Rome. A fast ship from ports in Asia Minor to Rome during optimal sailing conditions between May and September took three to five weeks.

31
Each power must have calculated and assessed its success in the rivalry, even though the precise methods are not reported beyond references of meetings of the Roman Senate, the council of the emperor, or advisors of Iranian monarchs. There is information on how Rome and Sassanid Persia officially represented successes to a wider public. Roman citizens had to be persuaded that success justified the costs of the rivalry. Rome's dissemination of success in war and diplomacy by letters, visual arts, coins, and monumental public inscriptions is without precedent. To be sure, these were official images rather than accurate news, but they were premised on the fact that Senate or emperor had to assess the course of the rivalry accurately however they intended to publicize it. In contrast, the Sassanid Shahs erected inscriptions and reliefs announcing success in the rivalry amid the royal tombs of the early Achaemenid kings. These messages were aimed for a far more limited audience of members of court, Roman envoys or vassal kings. As designate of Ahura-Mazda, the Shah did not have to inform a wider public of success in the rivalry with Rome. 
32
Hence, the strategic rivalry undermined the very self-image of unique greatness of each power.
The First Rivalry: Rome and Parthia, 69 B.C.-66 A.D.
On October 6, 69 B.C., the Roman proconsul L. Licinius Lucullus decisively defeated King Tigranes II, the Great, of Armenia (ca. 95-56 B.C.) before his political capital Tigranocerta, on a tributary of the upper Tigris in Mesopotamia. 
12
13
The Senate and people of the had taken little note of rising Arsacid power, for the Republic was concerned with the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. In 92 B.C., L. Cornelius Sulla, propraetor of Cilicia, received a Parthian envoy Orobazus, sent by King Mithridates II concerned over Roman actions in eastern Asia Minor. 
33
Lucullus invaded Mesopotamia to secure the person of Mithridates VI Eupator, and so end the Republic's third war against the king. L. Licinius Crassus, proconsul of Syria (54-53 B.C.), aimed to match the glory Julius Caesar was winning in Gaul, and so he provoked Rome's first war with Parthia. King Orodes II (57-37 B.C.) was distracted by a civil war against his brother Mithridates. The king entrusted command of his western army to the Suren, the hereditary marcher lord of the eastern frontier in Drangiana and Arachosia. In spring 53 B.C., Crassus crossed the Euphrates at Zeugma with seven legions and 3,000 or 4,000 cavalry. He marched east to Edessa (modern Urfa), capital of King Abgar of Oshroene, and then pressed south to Carrhae (modern Harran). The ultimate strategic aims of Crassus are uncertain, but he threatened either to overrun Mesopotamia between the Khabur and Tigris or to strike southeast along the Euphrates against Ctesiphon. In early June 53 B.C., Crassus accepted battle on unfavorable terrain east of Carrhae against a significantly smaller Parthian cavalry army of cataphracti and horse archers. 
34
The fighting in the two decades after Carrhae ended in a stalemate. The Arsacid kings lacked the means to conquer the Roman East. Instead, the Parthian western invasions had proved costly grand raids that provoked a Roman counter invasion. In turn, Rome lacked the means to invade Iran and overthrow the Arsacid monarchy. Each power learned to respect the military of the other. Romans appreciated the tactical and strategic mobility of Parthian cavalry. They also learned from Crassus' failure to secure water sources and reliable local allies who could furnish cavalry and accurate information. Later Roman commanders deployed more cavalry, light infantry, and archers familiar with the arid conditions of the Near East. They adapted the tactical advantages of legionary infantry to counter Parthian cavalry. 
36
In 31 B.C., Octavian, the adopted son of Julius Caesar, ended nearly three decades of civil war, and secured Rome's eastern provinces. In 27 B.C., Octavian, hailed as the first emperor Augustus (27 B.C.-14 A.D.), secured his supreme position as princeps, a dynast ruling in the guise of a Republican magistrate. Augustus fell heir to an unresolved eastern frontier, and loud demands by the political classes at Rome to conquer Parthia. Augustus understood the limits of Roman power, and he preferred to direct imperial expansion into Northwestern and Central Europe. In 20 B.C., Augustus adroitly exploited a succession crisis in Armenia to restore Rome's position in the Near East. The Armenian nobility overthrew the unpopular Artaxias II and requested a new king from Rome. Augustus obliged and sent Tigranes III (20-10 B.C.), accompanied by Tiberius and a Roman army that crowned the new Armenian king in Artaxata. The action risked a general war with King Phraates IV of Parthia who claimed suzerainty over Armenia. Therefore, Augustus mobilized the legions in Syria under his able general M. Vipsanius Agrippa, and so threatened to attack Ctesiphon and Seleucia ad Tigrim. Phraates IV was persuaded to accept a diplomatic settlement. 
14
37
38
Augustus resolved the rivalry to the satisfaction of Rome, but his settlement depended on a weak Arsacid king. It also rested on a loyal king of Armenia. Rome wanted a dutiful, compliant king in Armenia, but such a king could not maintain the loyalty of regional warlords, naxarars of the Middle Ages, who raided and fought over honor and blood feud. Clashes among Armenian nobles led to raids into Roman and Parthian territory so that the fighting threatened to embroil the two great powers in a greater conflict. The Armenians themselves posed little direct threat to either power. The national levy of Armenia might have numbered 80,000, but few kings could field armies larger than 5,000 cavalry.

41
Nero aimed to place a friendly king on the throne of Armenia, and so to secure the strategic routes rather than to conquer Armenia. From the start, Nero was willing to accept Tiridates if the Arsacid prince requested his crown from Rome. Vologaeses supported his brother Tiridates for the same reason. As king of Armenia Tiridates would secure the strategic route by which Mark Antony had invaded Media Atropatane in 36 B.C. Vologases had no intention of committing the Arsacid state to a great war with Rome. He respected Roman arms and mistrusted the loyalties of Armenian nobles. Three times, they had submitted to Rome when an imperial prince-Tiberius, Gaius Caesar, and Germanicus-had marched Roman legions to Artaxata to put a king on the Armenian throne. 
15
42
Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East compel Vologaeses and Tirdiates to negotiate. In 64, Corbulo threatened to overrun Mesopotamia, and so Vologaeses agreed to accept Nero's original offer. Tiridates was restored to the Armenian throne, but he had to journey to Rome to accept his crown directly from Nero.
The fighting in 54-64 resulted in an adjustment of Augustus' settlement in 20 B.C. Henceforth, an Arsacid prince ruled in Armenia, but Tiridates was mindful of the majesty of Rome for he was awed by the city when he visited in 66. Vologaeses too was respectful of Rome; Corbulo's campaigns could not fail to impress. Hence, Vologaeses made no move to exploit the First Jewish Revolt (67-73) or the Roman civil war of 69-70. Foremost, Rome learned that the army in Syria was inadequate to the task of maintaining Roman hegemony in Armenia. The emperor Vespasian (69-79) increased the number of legions (from four to six) and auxiliaries in the East. 
43
44
The fighting in 54-64 revealed serious weaknesses in Roman command and communications. Cn. Domitius Corbulo clashed with his colleague Ummidius Quadratus, in 54-60, and then with Caesennius Paetius in 60-62. These proud senatorial legates of Cappadocia and Syria viewed each other as rivals for imperial favor, and so they reluctantly cooperated. Nero had to deal with delays in communication with Rome (especially from the commander east of the Euphrates) as well as contradictory reports from his legates. To Nero's credit, he selected Corbulo in 54 and again in 62 to command the offensives in Armenia and Mesopotamia. But future emperors preferred not to risk delays in communication and the problems of divided command so that they marched east to direct personally operations against Parthia. Inevitably the strategic rivalry between Rome and Parthia was bound to escalate, and in so doing not only increased each power's costs and aims, but transformed each power as well.
The diplomatic settlement of 66 A.D. held for nearly fifty years, for two reasons. First, the settlement was a sensible compromise accommodating the strategic interests of each power. Second, Parthia and Rome were also distracted by other priorities during these years. The Arsacid kings were pressed on their northeastern frontier in Areia along the lower Oxus River and to the southeast in Drangiana (today Sistan and the Helmand valley). They faced a new powerful foe, the kings of the Kushans, descendants of Tocharianspeaking nomads, who forged a great empire in Transoxiana and northern India and taxed 4-17 the lucrative trade along the Silk Road. Meanwhile, Roman legions conducted major conquests in northern Europe, in Britain, Germania, and Dacia. In 113, another Armenian crisis erupted, when, King Osroes I (109-129) crowned his nephew Parthamasiris King of Armenia in violation of the settlement of 66. In part, Oroses might have acted to gain direct control of passes over the Caucasus through which the nomadic Alans had invaded Parthian domains in 72. 
45
46
47
It is doubtful that the Arsacid monarchy would have survived if Trajan's victory had stood, and the history of the Classical world might have taken a very different turn. On August 9, 117, Trajan's death was announced at Selinus, on the southeastern Anatolian littoral. His adopted son Hadrian (117-138) was proclaimed emperor. Within a year, Hadrian withdrew all Roman forces to the west bank of the Euphrates, entrusting Armenia and Osrhoene to Arsacid client kings. Hadrian, in effect, restored the settlement of 66 A.D. 
48
49
50
In the fifty years after Hadrian's withdrawal, the Parthian kings must have resented Roman arrogance and interference. In 161, Vologaeses IV (147-191) sought to undo Hadrian's arrangements. He hoped to benefit from perceived Roman weakness with the accession of two new, untested emperors, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. The Parthian army expelled the philo-Roman kings Sohaemus of Armenia. M. Sedatius Severianus, legate of Cappadocia intervened, but he, and the IX Hispania (based at Satala), were encircled and destroyed near Elegia. The new emperors had no choice but wage a new Parthian War (161-166). 
51
52
53
Meanwhile, in 163, the Parthian army overran Osrhoene and imposed in Edessa a client king Vaël (163-165). Vologaeses thus restored the Euphrates as Parthia's western boundary, and he threatened to invade Syria. In response, Statius Priscus, legate of Cappadocia, overran Armenia in a two year campaign (163-164). 
54
55
56
57
58
The war had proved a disaster for Vologaeses IV, who was compelled to accept the terms dictated by Rome. Yet, Marcus Aurelius annexed no territory. He was content that Osrhoene and Armenia were once again ruled by dutiful friends of Rome, who protected the eastern limes. So the frontier stood until 198. 
59
60
Twice, in fifty years, Roman legions had sacked the Arsacid capital Ctesiphon; Seleucia ad Tigrim never recovered from its second sack. Vologaeses IV and his successors learned not to challenge Rome over Armenia or Osrhoene. For Rome, the fighting revealed the value of controlling the highways across Mesopotamia from the Euphrates to the Tigris. Roman control denied Parthian armies the Bitlis pass, and so the southern route into Armenia. The fortress cities of Mesopotamia acted as a shield against Parthian attacks, and bases for future strikes against Ctesiphon. These strategic considerations were behind the decision of Septimius Severus (193-211) to wage a new Parthian War in 197-199.
Septimius Severus was the candidate of the legions of the Danube in the civil war (193-197) following the assassination of Commodus, son of Marcus Aurelius. Cassius Dio censures Septimius Severus for waging a Parthian War for glory. The historian also criticizes the emperor's organization of a new province Mesopotamia as a costly commitment because the populations were linked by blood and customs to Parthia so that new wars were bound to come. 
61
Therefore, Septimius Severus raised three new legions, I-III Parthicae, from colonies on the Danube frontier, and many new auxiliary units. Septimius Severus increased the imperial army from perhaps 375,000 to 450,000 men. With these additional forces, he fielded two columns in his offensive against Parthia. Two of the three new legions I Parthica and III Parthia, were stationed at Singara and Rhesaena, respectively, in the new province. Septimius Severus committed the money and additional manpower to construct legionary bases and highways, and to fortify cities. 
62
Victory over Parthia also gained Septimius Severus legitimacy as the worthy heir of Marcus Aurelius, because Severus had retroactively adopted himself into the Antonine family. His elder son Caracalla (198-217), officially renamed M. Aurelius Antoninus, waged the last Parthian War (214-217). Caracalla had seized and imprisoned the Armenian royal family, and then marched east in 214, even though the Parthians had not challenged Roman control over Armenia. Caracalla acted out of impulse rather than strategic reasons. Classical sources agree that Caracalla was unbalanced, and longed for an eastern war to emulate Alexander the Great.

Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East fighting near Nisibis ended in a negotiated settlement between Macrinus and Artabanus V that confirmed the status quo ante bellum.

18
Rome emerged the uncontested victor of her wars with Parthia, sacking the Arsacid capital Ctesiphon three times in ninety years. In 166, Marcus Aurelius assured uncontested Roman hegemony in Armenia, while Septimius Severus turned Mesopotamia into a bastion of Roman power in the Near East. Yet, victory came a high price for Rome. Emperors had to concentrate ever more military forces against Parthia. To pay for the rising military costs, emperors were driven to debase the silver currency. The unintended consequences of these wars proved the most significant. In repeatedly humbling the Parthian foe, Rome had assured the demise of her rival, but in Parthia's place arose Sassanid Persia. Rome had not won the strategic rivalry, but instead substituted a weak opponent with a far more powerful rival.
In 224-227, Rome had, in effect,won the strategic rivalry over Parthia, because the Arsacid monarchy was so weakened that it was overthrown by Ardashir I (227-240) who established a new Sassanid or Neo-Persian Empire. 
63
64
First, the Roman fortresses of Mesopotamia proved their value. Since they controlled water sources and nexus of strategic routes, the Sassanid army either had to take the fortresses by lengthy siege or run risks of by-passing them as in 253. The fortifications limited the extent of Sassanid success.

With his third campaign against Rome, Shapur ceased to report on his activities, and with good cause, because the war turned against him after 261. Odenathus reorganized the defenses of Syria to the benefit of his native caravan city Palmyra. In 262, Odenathus launched an invasion into Babylonia.

115
In 299 (or 300), Narses agreed to an unfavorable treaty that ended over forty-five years of hostilities with Rome. Tiridates III was confirmed as king, and so Armenia was henceforth designated Roman. Five strategic provinces east of the northern Tigris were surrendered by Narses; Ingilene, Sophanene, Arzanene, Corduene, and Zabdaicene (the last modern Hakkari, Turkey). These provinces controlled routes between northern Mesopotamia and Armenia, and gave Roman armies easy access into Adiabene and Media Atropatene. 
116
In 299, Diocletian and Galerius imposed a treaty on the Shah Narses that marked a great Roman victory over the Sassanids. Although the defeats suffered at the hands of Shapur I had been avenged, Rome had not destroyed the capacity of Sassanid Persia to renew the strategic rivalry. In 363, nearly sixty-five years later, the emperor Jovian (363-364) concluded a new treaty ceding the Mesopotamian fortresses to Shah Shapur II (309-379). Rome was on the defensive in the Near East for the next 265 years. This change in fortune resulted from the personal failure of the emperor Julian commanding an expedition against Ctesiphon, but Julian's defeat also rested in the decline of the professional Roman army.
Rome entered the final phases of the rivalry with Persia with a considerably different army in its professionalism and chain of command. The eastern army had to be rebuilt and reorganized after successive defeats in 253-260, and a veritable civil war in 270-273. In the course of this fighting, at least seven, perhaps ten, more legions had been raised.

In 330, Constantine founded a Christian capital at New Rome, Constantinople and so shifted the locus of imperial power to the Bosporus, and so closer to Ctesiphon. King Tirdiates III of Armenia (ca. 287-330) either anticipated or followed Constantine by embracing the new faith. 
124
In 309, Shapur II (309-373) succeeded to the Sassanid throne. As a minor, he was long in no position to challenge Rome. Shapur, mindful of his legacy and the need to impress his nobles, was determined the renew the strategic rivalry.

Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East Constantius II lacked the money and forces to win decisively in Mesopotamia or to launch an offensive against Ctesiphon. His jealous brothers refused to release forces from the Rhine and Danube frontiers. Twice, he faced revolts by the Western army, which proclaimed as rival emperors first Magnentius (350-353) and then his own cousin Julian (360-363). Western soldiers resented transfers to service in the East and objected to laws banning pagan sacrifices. Constantius died en route to oppose Julian, the candidate of the Western army, on May 22, 361. The new emperor Julian, who declared his adherence to the old gods of Rome, inherited the war with Shapur in Mesopotamia.
Julian II, the Apostate, with a united the Roman Empire, had the means to end the Persian War. He followed the traditional Roman strategy of invading Babylonia to threaten Ctesiphon. Shapur II would then have to fight a decisive battle or to negotiate. Julian also needed a clear victory to uphold the legitimacy of the ancestral gods of Rome. Julian immediately restored the worship of the gods and withdrew imperial support for Christianity. For the Roman world, the Persian campaign of 362-363 represented a test in divine power. On June 26, 363, Julian died from a mortal wound on his retreat from Ctesiphon. His expedition, conducted in accordance with traditional Roman strategy, had gone awry. Julian's defeat and death proved a turning point not only for strategic rivalry over the Near East, but also the religious allegiances of the Mediterranean world.
When he departed Constantinople in spring 362, Julian did not plan to engage in a war of maneuver in Mesopotamia, but rather to march against Ctesiphon in the classic offensive that would compel Shapur to fight or negotiate.

Ammianus Marcellinus, who participated on the campaign, considered the expedition doomed from the start, but he was a pagan historian writing with the advantage of retrospect under Christian emperors. Julian, impatient to demonstrate the favor of the gods, departed Antioch in haste. He committed a strategic error by invading too early in the season. His army marched into the heat of summer rather than through it as was the case with previous Roman armies. Julian achieved strategic surprise, but he could neither take Ctesiphon nor compel Shapur to commit to decisive battle, while the Roman army languished in the flooded fields of Babylonia. Julian failed as a commander, but he commanded a Roman army divided in its loyalties and lacking in the discipline of the legions of Trajan.

Under the treaty of 363, Shapur II obtained the first significant territorial gains at Rome's expense. Jovian surrendered Mesopotamia east of the Khabur, including the fortresses of Nisibis and Singara, and the five strategic provinces gained in 299. Shapur took over a superb highway system and fortress cities which he could use to threaten Roman Syria, and Antioch. His own capital cities were no longer in danger from Roman attack. With the control of the Bitlis Pass, Sassanid armies could invade Armenia from two directions. In 379 or 382, Shah Ardashir III (379-383) negotiated a most favorable partition of Armenia.

134
In the fifth century, emperor and Shah put aside their strategic rivalry because each had to cope with new threats posed by Huns and Hephthalites, dreaded horse archers from the Eurasian steppes. 
135

In 395-396, the Huns first invaded the Near East via the Dariel and Derbent Passes, and ravaged the northwestern provinces of the Sassanid Empire. At the same time, the Shah faced an even more deadly foe, the Hephthalites or "White Huns," who ended Sassanid hegemony over Transoxiana and northern India in ca. 425-435. The Shahs appreciated their new warlike rivals; twice Shahs hired Hephthalites. Shah Peroz (459-484) employed Hephthalites to oust his brother and usurper Hormizd III (457-459), but Peroz soon had to battle his former allies. In 476, Shah Peroz was captured by the Hephthalites; he was released on promise of a ransom. 
136
Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East
In 484 Peroz was slain in battle against the Hephthalites who then ravaged eastern Iran. Shah Kavad I (488-531) who had spent time as a hostage among the Hephthalites, enrolled them as allies to crush rebels who backed Zamasp (496-498). In 557 Shah Khusrau I (531-579) entered into alliance with Ishtemi, the yabgu and vassal of Kaghan Muqan of the Gök Turks (559-572), who had overthrown their masters the Juan-Juan and rapidly expanded across the Eurasian steppes. 
23
Between 379 and 502, the emperors in Constantinople and Sassanid Shahs avoided major conflicts with each other. On several occasions they entered into cordial diplomatic relations based on mutual recognition of each other as equals. The emperor Arcadius (395-408) concluded an alliance with Shah Yazdegard I (399-420) and named the shah as guardian of his youthful heir Theodosius II (408-450).

These instances of cooperation seem promising at first glance. Frequent exchange of envoys led to a common diplomatic etiquette and cultural exchange between the courts. 
138
The settlements of 363 and 379/382 ended the fighting but not the hostility. Rome resented her territorial losses and obviously defensive position in the Near East. The Shahs would press their advantageous position whenever an opportunity arose. In the fifth
Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East century, the same borderlands emerged as cockpits for local or regional clashes that could escalate into new wars between Rome and Persia.
First, by the acquisition of the Armenian plateau, later Shahs acquired three costly commitments. The Shah engaged in an expensive diplomacy to court allies in the Caucasus to guard the Dariel and Derbent passes against nomadic invaders on the Pontic-Caspian steppes: Huns in the fifth century, and Turks in the sixth and seventh centuries. Fortifications were constructed south of the Derbent pass, and Persian military colonies were founded in Albania (Azerbaijan) and Armenia. The cost of defense strained Sassanid finances. Shahs in the fifth and sixth century postured, whenever they demanded subsidies of gold from Rome, that they needed the money to pay for the common defense against the nomadic foe. 
139
26
The Shah, unlike Parthian kings, was hated by the Christian Armenians, who looked to Constantinople for aid. Shah Yazdegerd I ruled as a distant overlord and vested real power in the naxarars of Armenia. Vahram V (399-420) and Yazdegerd II (420-457) persecuted Christians and constructed fire altars in a concerted effort to convert the Armenians to Zoroastrianism. In 421-422, the virgin empress Aelia Pulcheria, who dominated the court at Constantinople, ordered a Roman army under the sign of the cross to invade Persian Mesopotamia. The fighting quickly ended in a treaty. Shah Yazdegerd II promised to halt persecutions of Christians. In 428, Yazdegerd abolished the Arsacid monarchy and imposed Persian governors, but thereafter he faced repeated Armenian uprisings. The emperors Theodosius II and Marcian (450-457), who faced Attila and the Vandals, could lend little assistance to the Armenians. In 450, Marcian rejected an appeal by the Armenian rebels under Prince Vardan Mamikonian. On June 2, 451, Vardan and reportedly 60,000 Armenians fell as martyrs against the superior Sassanid army at Avarir. 
27
A second cockpit emerged in the later fourth century: the desert frontiers along the rim of the Fertile Crescent. Emperor and Shah had long concluded alliances with Arab sheiks, styled phylarchs in Byzantine sources, who policed the frontiers and protected caravans. In the fourth century, Rome and Persia promoted and incited their rival Arab allies to attack each other, but they also agreed to keep the conflicts localized. 
28
In 502, war erupted between Rome and Persia over Lazica when a local clash escalated into a major conflict. The ensuing Persian War (502-507) was the first of five wars that raged down to 628. For half this time between 502 and 628, Rome and Persia were again at war. The fighting climaxed in the destructive war of 602-628. In 502, Shah Kavad (488-531) declared war in response to objections over interference by Anastasius I (491-512) in Iberia, which was regarded as a Persian vassal. It is remarkable that Kavad initiated the war, because he confronted the Hephthalites on his northeastern frontier whereas, for Anastasius, the Huns had long passed. The Romans were taken by surprise. The Persians captured Theodosiopolis, Martryopolis, and Amida. By 505 Anastasius' generals had driven back the Persians and stabilized the frontier so that in 507 the war concluded in a seven year truce that lasted for nearly twenty years. Anastasius ordered the construction of the fortress at Daras, the new base for the field army of the dux of Mesopotamia who could threaten Nisibis, which guarded the highway into Persian Mesopotamia. Kavad and later Shahs objected repeatedly, claiming that the construction of Daras violated earlier conventions prohibiting the construction of new fortresses. Even more significant was the issue of money. Anastasius bought back Amida at the price of 500 (or 550) pounds of gold paid in seven installments. Kavad claimed that this money represented arrears in tribute owed by Rome for the Persian defense of the Dariel and Derbent passes. Anastasius rejected any claim to annual payments, which could be construed as tribute to the Shah. The imperial court countered with a claim that Nisibis was 4-36 due to be returned to Rome after 120 years of Persian occupation under the treaty of 363 or in the year 483/4. Shah and emperor each manufactured grievances to justify war over the same strategic objectives since the first century B.C.: the fortresses of Mesopotamia and Armenia.

Khusrau pursued war and diplomacy as a means to gain glory in the eyes of his nobles and to extort money out of Justinian. In aims he differed little from his ancestor Shapur I. In 540 Khusrau deported the 60,0000 captives from Antioch who built in Babylonia a new city Veh Antiok Khusrau to celebrate his victory. 
142
143
144
In 561/2, Justinian and Khusrau agreed to a general Fifty Years Peace that reaffirmed the borders in Lazica, Armenia, and Mesopotamia as they had stood in 502. Justinian agreed to annual payments of 30,000 solidi, but he paid the first seven years in a lump sum (210,000 solidi), and promised in year eight (569/70), a payment of three years (90,000 solidi). 
145
In 572, the emperor Justin II (565-578) and his wife the empress Sophia refused to pay to Khursau an annual tribute under the terms of the Fifty Years Peace. Byzantine sources, hostile to the emperor, blame Justin's willful pride and then delight in describing his mental collapse and illness the next year. Yet, Justin and Sophia had little choice but to refuse, preferring war over abject humiliation. Khusrau had the pretext to declare war again. This new Persian War (572-590) differed little from the previous three wars. It was waged on the familiar battlefields of Mesopotamia by three successive emperors-Justin II, Tiberius II (578-582), and Maurice Tiberius (582-602)-and two successive Shahs Khursau I and Hormizd IV (579-590). The belligerents repeatedly agreed to truces, but fighting resumed because neither power was willing to compromise in the interests of peace. Yet, each belligerent lacked the capacity to defeat the other. The situation dramatically changed in 590. 
146
147
In return for imperial aid, Khusrau II returned captured Roman fortresses, notably Daras, Amida, and Martyropolis (modern Silvan). Maurice regained the strategic fortresses and lands north of the Upper Tigris that guarded the Bitlis pass as well as hegemony over Armenia. Khusrau retained Mesopotamia east of the Khabur, but he renounced all the lands and fortresses acquired by the partition of 379/382 as well as claims to tribute or subsidies from Rome. At a single stroke, Maurice Tiberius ended a costly border war and regained the territorial position Rome had enjoyed in 63 B.C., when Pompey had settled the Third Mithridatic War. It was a stunning diplomatic success. With peace on the eastern frontier, Maurice Tiberius transferred field armies to the Balkans and scored victories over the Avars and reestablished imperial frontiers on the lower Danube. 
148
On November 27, 602, the centurion Phocas (602-610), at the head of the mutinous imperial army, entered Constantinople and was crowned emperor. The legitimate emperor Maurice Tiberius, along with his six sons, had been seized and beheaded at Chalcedon while in flight to the east. Maurice Tiberius was a tireless and conscientious ruler, but he had inherited a fiscal crisis and an army battered by decades of fighting. Maurice Tiberius had erred in issuing the order which his army refused to obey. The soldiers had been ordered to winter north of the Danube, in Avar territory rather than in comfortable billets in provincial cities. The soldiers, resentful of arrears in pay and harsh campaigning, mutinied for a fourth time, but this time they deposed the imperial family and so ended the dynasty of Justinian.

In spring 624, Heraclius rejoined the imperial army at Caesarea (Kayseri), and then marched northeast to Theodosiopolis and across the Armenian plateau, capturing the capitals Vagharshapat and Dvin. He pressed down the Araxes (Aras) River and invaded Media Atropatene. Near Ganzak (Takht-i-Suleiman) he put to flight a superior Persian army, reckoned at 40,000 and commanded by Khusrau II himself. Then, Heraclius ravaged northern Iran, destroyed Zoroastrian fire altars, and withdrew to winter in Iberia and Albania (today Azerbijan) where he entered into alliance with the Western Turks. The campaign was stunning. Heraclius, in effect, combined the strategic march across Armenia conducted by Corbulo in 58 with the invasion of Media led by Mark Antony in 36 B.C. In the winter of 624-625, Khusrau ordered three armies to move against Heraclius, but the emperor outmaneuvered and the defeated each in detail. In the spring 625, Heraclius rapidly marched southwest, circled north of Lake Van, and crossed the Bitlis pass. Heraclius then retired along the Upper Tigris and crossed the Euphrates at Samosata into Asia Minor. A Persian army commanded by Shahrbaraz pursued but failed to bring Heraclius to decisive battle. Heraclius wintered at Trapezus (Trabzon), and sent embassies to the kaghan of the Western Turks.
In 626, Heraclius negotiated an alliance with the yabgu Zeibel of the Western Turks whose 40,000 horse archers crossed the Derbent pass to descend on northwestern Iran. Khusrau ordered Shabin with the main army, perhaps 50,000 men, to bring Heraclius to battle in northeastern Asia Minor. In the Lycus valley, Shabin suffered a crushing defeat, and fell in the rout. Meanwhile, Shahrbaraz led an expeditionary army of 30,000 men across Asia Minor to Chalcedon where he pitched camp and contacted the Kaghan of Avars who had blockaded Constantinople. Between July 29 and August 7, 626, Avars and Slavs, reckoned at 80,000, failed to storm the Theodosian Walls. The defenders were inspired by Patriarch Sergius, and the procession of the icon of Mary Theotokos (Hodegetria) around the city walls. On August 7, the imperial navy intercepted and sank Shahrbaraz's improvised transports conveying Persian reinforcements to the European side of the Bosporus. The next day, the Kaghan raised the siege. Shahrbaraz after wintering at Chalcedon, withdrew in the spring 627. Thereafter, he assumed a neutral position in northern Syria, and, with aims for the Persian throne, corresponded with Heraclius for a possible alliance. 
152
Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East hastily assembled Persian field army under Rhahzadh (Iranian Roch Vehan) on the plains just to the northeast of Nineveh. The victory ended the war. Heraclius pressed south, capturing the Persian palace at Dastagard, and penetrating to the Nahrawan Canal northeast of Ctesiphon in January 628. Heraclius lacked the manpower and siege train to capture the Persian capital, but the mere threat of a Roman army before Ctesiphon lost Khusrau his throne. Khusrau was deposed on February 25, 628, and his son Kavad II was proclaimed Shah by the nobility and army in Ctesiphon. Kavad immediately concluded a peace. 
153
Rome's clash first with Parthia, and then Sassanid Persia for domination of the Near East, offers insight to similar conflicts between two great powers. The geopolitical factors of this region have not changed, although the deposits of petroleum and natural gas has increased the significance of the Middle East. These same geopolitical factors will dictate any future conflict between the current Western power, the United States, and Iran. The United States has fallen heir to not just to the position of Great Britain, but also to that of imperial Rome.
Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East U.S. success in the Middle East will depend directly on assessing the power and aims of the Iran, and the U.S. ability to appreciate and respond to these Iranian aims. Today many of the same borderlands are at stake. The civil war in Syria (should the opposition forces overthrow Bashar Hafez al-Assad and partition Syria or create a jihadist Sunni state), and the success of the policies of the regime of the AKP in Turkey (should it return the Turkish Republic to an Islamic, Middle Eastern nation) threaten instability that could escalate into a major conflict. These two developments could result in the secession of the Kurds in southeastern Turkey, and their union with Iraqi and Syrian Kurds into a new nation state of Kurdistan. This new state would embrace Classical Armenia and Mesopotamia over which Rome and her Iranian foes had fought. This state, besides its strategic position in the Middle East, would control significant energy resources.
Several more general lessons can be drawn. Rome, a power based in the Mediterranean world, was strained to maintain her position in the Near East. Rome defeated Parthia (even if diplomacy rather than Roman arms avenged Carrhae), but the result was the creation of a far more formidable rival. Sassanid Persia forced Rome to reorganize army and bureaucracy to defend the vital provinces of the eastern Mediterranean. This unseen consequence of victory over Persia in the third century was to transform Rome into a significantly weaker power in the fourth century. The defeat of Julian in 363 put Rome and the imperial army on the defensive. The court of Constantinople thus could not lend significant aid to prevent the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century. New Rome, or Constantinople, eventually triumphed but at such a high price, for the final war (602-628) led to the collapse of the entire political order in the Near East of the previous seven hundred years.
Throughout the rivalry, Rome ultimately resolved issues by war as she had always done in previous strategic rivalries, notably in the struggle with the Samnites for domination of Italy or the clash with Carthage and then the Macedonian kings over the Mediterranean world. Even under Christian emperors, Rome held to a patriotic notion of victory best captured in the pages of Livy narrating the Second Punic War (218-201 B.C.). Rome never negotiated except in the wake of victory; victory was the destruction of the foe's ability to wage war; and Rome never waged an unjust war. Yet, even the Republic had to modify its view of Parthia in the wake of the defeat at Carrhae in 53 B.C. Augustus realized that expansion based on victory and unconditional surrender was impossible against Parthia so that Augustus came to a cost effective solution in 20 B.C. He recognized Arsacid Parthia as a significant, if lesser, power. This arrangement sufficed to secure Rome's interests in the Near East until it was repudiated by Vologaeses I. The limited fighting in 54-66 established a compromise, a new version of the Augustan settlement.
When Oroses I challenged this arrangement, Trajan responded with a strategy of overthrow, and a return to traditional Roman policies of decisive victory. Trajan aimed for the annexation of Armenia and Mesopotamia, and the imposition of a pro-Roman king over a rump Parthian Empire in lower Iraq and east of the Zagros. But the Parthians rallied, and rebellions in the new conquests, along with the untimely death of Trajan, led Hadrian to declare victory and withdraw. Subsequent wars, in 161-166 and 197-199, proved Trajan was correct, and Hadrian wrong about the precise eastern boundary. With bases in Mesopotamia, Rome assured the security of her eastern provinces and held the Parthian capitals hostage. Hence, these two Roman into invasions of Babylonia destroyed the fiscal basis and legitimacy of the Arsacid kings. Whatever the motives of Caracalla in provoking an unnecessary war, he threatened to conduct another devastating invasion, and this sufficed to undermine the Arsacid monarchy.
The rivalry between Rome and Persia represented a significant escalation over the previous one. Between 229 and 363, each power had to expand its military, fiscal institutions, and the powers of its monarchy if it were to compete. The shifting fortunes of war ended in Sassanid victory. The treaties of 363, and 379 (or 382) forced Rome to admit that she had lost, and was henceforth on the defensive. Rome also conceded parity to Persia. But the ensuing peaceful coexistence during the long fifth century (379-502) resulted, in large part, from each power recognizing greater new threats posed by the nomadic invaders, the Huns and the Hephthalites. The long fifth century witnessed frequent exchanges of envoys and several diplomatic solutions, but it produced no fundamental changes in the ways or resolving conflicts. In was the mutual respect grudgingly admitted by rival powers as a result of strategic stalemate. It never led to a change of doing business internationally. When the balance shifted in favor of one power, war was resumed. But each power understood the rules. War was honorable; victory desirable (for it conferred legitimacy and profit), and peace (even for Christian emperors) was the gift of victory. There were no appeals to appeasement or other policies promoting peace as the norm, and war as an aberration. The much vaunted pax Romana rested on victorious legions. Above all, neither rival ever really appreciated the aims and interests of the other for all the diplomatic and cultural exchange in the fifth century.
While war remained the inevitable means to resolve a rivalry, war did not need to have escalated in the seventh century to such a level that both powers were ruined and so weakened that they fell before Arab tribal armies. This outcome resulted from several factors beyond the control of either empire.
First, the threat of the northern barbarians reduced the power of each rival empire. Germanic tribes and Huns in Central and Eastern Europe threatened Rome, and led to the collapse of the Western Empire. Huns and Hephthalites, and then Turks, disrupted the northeastern frontiers of Sassanid Empire.
Second, the wars and plague of Justinian, weakened East Rome, militarily and fiscally, and so the renewal of war with Persia from 540 on taxed Roman resources. The
Rome, Parthia, and Sassanid Persia: Strategic Rivalries in the Classical Near East impact of the plague on the Sassanid Empire is still to be studied, but both rivals were significantly weakened at the outbreak of the final war in 602.
Third, the escalating ideologies of the rival monarchies from the third century on contributed to repeated outbreaks of wars. The Roman outlook can be traced in detail by how these wars were presented to Roman public since late second century. State Zoroastrianism and Christianity (even though most residents did not adhere to either orthodox faith) committed Shah and emperor to ideological aims and positions that led to war. They also hindered Shah and emperor from appreciating the other's position and so developing means of assessing the best policy and its costs in the strategic rivalry. The ruinous war of 602-628 was the result of this ideological clash, and the acceptance of war as the means to resolve a conflict decisively in favor of the victor. The surprise was that Heraclius, not Khusrau, turned out to be victor in this war even if Heraclius won a pyrrhic victory.
Fourth, timing proved crucial in the collapse of the Persian and Roman Empires in the seventh century. Muhammad and Heraclius turned out to be contemporaries, and so the Arabic attacks were timed when the two powers were most vulnerable. Heraclius personally was spent, and plunged into a deep depression after 636. He had won his victory by loans from the church. He faced ravaged imperial heartlands in Asia Minor and the Balkans, and an indifferent or hostile population in Syria and Egypt where he needed to resolve divisions within the imperial church. Given time, he and his successors might have restored imperial power, especially in light of the initial reception of the Ecthesis to unite Christendom in 638. But it was not to be. Timing, put down to divine favor (or disfavor) by the ancients or just bad luck by the moderns. proved decisive. The Arab success was as fortuitous as it was unexpected, and decisive.   Medieval England's unlikely prominence came about because of its strategic decisions, in particular those concerning France from 1066 to 1453. These were based on three criteria. The first was politics, or, what is now a rather outdated term, feudalism, that is, obligation to one's lord. 
1
Medieval France, in contrast, seems to have regarded England for much of the Middle Ages as an strategic irritant, but little more. France's more important strategic priorities were with the Holy Roman Empire, Italy, various Low Countries states and the papacy. Before the Hundred Years War, the French put forth very little strategic effort towards England, with most focused on forcing English royalty and nobility to abandon their lands within France (almost always to the personal profit of the French king). Outside of the county of Flanders, French economic connections with England were few, with even less military interest, except in procuring those lands mentioned above. This changed considerably during the Hundred Years War, but not entirely. Initially Edward III's (r. 1327-77) claim to the French throne was ignored, but when he proved successful at the battles of Sluys (1340), Crécy (1346), Poitiers (1356-led by Edward's son, the Black Prince), and the siege of Calais (1346-47), France began to focus more strategic interest on England. Although that interest declined following Edward III's death, it intensified following Henry V's (r. 1413-22) lopsided victory at the 5-1 "1066 and All That": English and French Strategic Rivalry During the Middle Ages battle of Agincourt (1415) and his conquest of Normandy and Maine (1417-22). Even then, the French civil war, fought from 1405 to 1435 between the Burgundians and Armagnacs, seemed to be a proxy extension of the conflict with England. After that ended, England once more slipped as a strategic priority, virtually disappearing from French concern following the losses of Normandy in 1450 and Guyenne in 1453. Calais hung on, until 1558, but only barely, and only because the French saw a need in having it as the port for English wool trade.
In 1930, W. C. Sellar and R. J. Yeatman wrote a witty book about English History, 1066 and All That. Its chronological range was from Roman times to World War I, 2 even though its title focused on the single date in the history of the British Isles that not only everyone could remember no matter what their class or education, but also could identify as one when things changed-where, in popular perception, the "good" English Anglo-Saxons lost to those "bad" French Normans. That the Anglo-Saxons were themselves continental conquerors of earlier English Celts and that the Normans were pretty far from being Frenchmen, having only settled in Normandy from Scandinavia for little more than a century and retaining much of their "Viking" culture-or that the English and French had stood side by side as allies in the Great War that had just been fought-mattered little to 1930s English perception. England was changed by William the Conqueror's victory at the battle of Hastings, fought 14 October 1066, an all-day slog. 
3
In fact, despite the number of errors in such a national historical image, that the invasion of William the Conqueror forced the English to deal with France substantially for the first time, was accurate. In the millennium before 1066, France and England had traveled in completely different orbits. Julius Caesar in 55 and 54 BCE and Claudius in 43 CE had launched their invasions from France, but these included very few, if any Gauls and were seen then, and ever since, as nothing other than Roman invasions. Nor, as far as the relatively extensive records reveal, did few Gauls serve on Hadrian's Wall or anywhere else in Britannia during Rome's tenure there. The Empire was perhaps concerned that too much contact between similar Celtic peoples tempted rebellion-which in fact it did when Carausius united Britannia and Northern Gaul, naming himself Emperor of at least this piece of the Roman Empire in the decade 286-296, and when Constantine III did the same in the early years of the fifth century. 
4
The Romans may have been gone from Britannia, but they were quickly replaced by the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, whose conquests began in the latter half of the fifth century, and then by the Vikings, whose raids and conquests were frequent between 793 and 1016.

Stephen is generally acknowledged as the victor, but when he died, in 1154, the throne was once more empty.

But by the time the French and English army met again, in Sicily, bickering between the two armies had begun. Done initially by the soldiers, it quickly grew to include their royal leaders. Both allied again to capture Acre, in summer 1191. But that was to be the end of their cooperation. Before the month was out, Philip, ill and fatigued by crusading, retreated to France, his army following in the next few months. Richard remained in the Holy Land for another year, but was unable to recapture Jerusalem against such a formidable general as Saladin. He returned to Europe in September 1192. In the meantime, Philip had taken advantage of the English king's distance by attacking Normandy. These continued after Richard was captured in Austria on his return journey to England and held in captivity until 4 February 1194. Richard would be slain in 1199 at the siege of Châlus in Aquitaine-killed by a crossbow-shooting cook.

"1066 and All That": English and French Strategic Rivalry During the Middle Ages While Henry II had fought to a draw with Philip and Richard had been able to regain at least some of the lands captured during his Crusade and imprisonment absences, John did nothing but lose to Philip, resulting in large losses of land. Between 1202 and 1204, John lost all of his northern French lands. Then, in 1214, John attempted to recoup those losses by joining the Holy Roman Emperor, the dukes of Lorraine and Brabant, and other rebellious French counts in an alliance against the French king. The result was the battle of Bouvines, which was such a complete French victory, that Otto lost his emperorship and the counts of Flanders and Boulogne were captured and imprisoned for more than a decade. John lost Touraine, Anjou and all other French lands of his inheritance, save Gascony. The next year he was forced to sign the Magna Carta, acknowledging to his barons his ineptitude as a ruler and military leader. He died in 1216; he had proven so inept as a political and military leader that there will never be a King John II in England.

It would not be until 1337, however, that what became known as the Hundred Years War began. The earliest combat resulted in stalemate-the English campaigns of 1337 and 1339 gained nothing, and in 1340, the English won the battle of Sluys, but lost the siege of Tournai. From then on, things went mostly for the English: the battle of Crécy (1346); the siege of Calais (1346-47); the battle of Les Espagnols sur Mer/Winchelsea (1350); the Black Prince's raid of Languedoc (1355); the battle of Poitiers, with the capture of King Jean II (1356); the battle of Auray (1364); and victory in the Breton civil war by the Englishsupported House of Montfort (1341-64). The Treaty of Brétigny, signed between Edward III and Jean II in 1360, validated English land acquisitions since 1339, with Edward agreeing to denounce his claims to the French royal title. 
16
This domination began to change in 1430, however, when the siege of Orléans was raised by the French army, with the anomalous presence of Joan of Arc, who followed this up with further victories and the crowning of the dauphin as Charles VII, before being captured outside of Compiègne in 1430 and burned for heresy in 1431.

There were three strategic concerns that determined English royal policy towards France during the Middle Ages: politics, economics, and geopolitics.
Political concerns started when William, the Duke of Normandy, launch ships against Anglo-Saxon England. The course of history sometimes turns on the most lucky of events (or most unlucky, depending on the results). William the Conqueror might not have earned that cognomen and the kingship of England had the winds not prevented his sailing across the English Channel when he had planned. Haraldr Hárðárði (anglicized to Harald Hardrada), the king of Norway, and another claimant to the throne, was already on his way to England with an army when William was set to sail. But bad weather on the Channel delayed the Norman fleet until the Norwegians had time to land first in northern England. The Norwegians and not the Normans were the first enemy faced by Harold Godwinson, king of England, having force-marched his army from the southern coast of England, where they were awaiting William's invasion. They were easily defeated at the battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September.

As Duke of Normandy, William was obligated by fealty to do homage to King Philip I of France. During the Middle Ages there was no uniformity in the obligatory fealty of a lord and vassal at any level of medieval society. In France, legally-although laws regarding the relationship between a king and baron were more traditional than written-a vassal with the status of the duke of Normandy or, later, the count of Anjou or duke of Aquitaine, was required to recognize his lord as king and to provide him military leadership and troops during times of war. When a strong king was on the throne, this simple fealty worked; with a weak king, the more powerful and wealthy nobles often complicated the relationship.
For example, in 1101 the powerful and wealthy Robert II, count of Flanders, agreed to help Henry I, king of England and duke of Normandy, against Philip I, the weak king of France, but Robert's legal lord. (He was Henry's too, as duke of Normandy, but no homage had been done.) To accommodate this fealty, should Philip attack Henry without summoning Robert, the count of Flanders personally led an army of 1,000 heavy cavalry to Henry's aid. However, should Robert be summoned to assist Philip, he answered the demand for fealty, but only with a force of 20 cavalry, the other 980 assisting Henry against Philip. 
21
The English kings always made their fealty to the French king complicated. William the Conqueror recognized his fealty as duke of Normandy and did homage to the French king as duke before his conquest of England; he did not recognize the need for fealty as English king.

There is little way not to see the Treaty of Paris as a victory for Louis and defeat for Henry. At a time when his English throne was beset by baronial rebellions, Henry III must have thought his securing peace with France would enable him to fight the rebellions and then return, stronger, to reconsider the concessions he made at Paris. If so, his plan failed: he eventually put down the rebellions, but he never managed to reassert English claims in France.
The Treaty carried repercussions for the next three English kings as well. Henry's son, Edward I, not lacking in confidence as a ruler, nevertheless did homage to Philip IV in 1286, but with the provision that it was only for the "terms of peace made between our ancestors." 
27
It was that marriage, and the child it produced in Edward III, that set in motion what marked the end of the peace brought by the Treaty of Paris and the beginning of more than a century of war between England and France. Edward III became king of England in 1327 and the next year he saw Charles IV, his cousin and last patrilineal male heir of Philip IV, die. Edward was the closest male heir, but he had no patrilineal descent as his inheritance claim to the French crown was through his mother, even though the daughter of Philip IV. As such, this violated the Salian Frankish law, which seems to have been "dusted off" and applied to this situation. There had been no need to apply the Salic Law before, and there is some controversy as to whether it should have been applied at all. But the only complainant against such, Edward III, was in Westminster and not in Paris. The kingship went to a cousin, Philip VI, the count of Valois, who was a nephew of Philip IV through his younger brother, Charles of Valois, and thus patrilineal. 
28
"1066 and All That": English and French Strategic Rivalry During the Middle Ages
From then until 1356, four major conflicts were won by the English, the final-at Poitiers-netting the French king, Jean II (r. date range), among the prisoners. This imprisonment presented a problem for Edward III, however. Similar to how he dealt with his father, Edward had not recognized Jean as French king. But now, if he was interested in acquiring a ransom for Jean, he would have to decide whether he was count of Valois or king of France-a significant difference in price. The latter would require Edward to recognize Jean as king instead of himself. In the resulting Treaty of Brétigny, a ransom of 3 million écus was negotiated, with the added recognition of Edward's ownership of Gascony, Ponthieu, and all the lands he had conquered in the first 23 years of the war. In return, Edward recognized, as stated in the first line of the Treaty, that Jehan [était] par la grace de Dieu, Roy de France-Jean [was], by the grace of God, king of France. 
29
What Edward III agreed to the Treaty of Brétigny shows, it seems decisively, that fealty was not the greatest strategic concern England had with France during the Middle Ages. Rather, there is no doubt that it was the ownership of lands in France that held the highest strategic priority. This was more important than the economic produce gained from these lands. English kings who successfully retained their French lands-Henry I, Henry II, and Edward IIIalso had fewer problems with their lords. All other English kings faced several rebellions. Most of these failed, but putting them down cost money; funds that could have been allocated to other political and strategic concerns. Noble rebellions depicted English kings as weak, which French kings, if stronger, exploited.
No French king did this better than Philip Augustus. Philip's initial alliance with Richard the Lionheart's rebellion against his father, Henry II, gained few lands, but built a trust between himself and the soon-to-be English king that he willingly broke during Richard's longer participation in the Third Crusade, followed by Richard's imprisonment the next year. The result was French attacks on all English lands in France. Released in 1194, Richard attempted to defend these lands, with some able generalship, but his death five years later thrust a much less able general with much more noble dissatisfaction, John, against Philip, resulting in all but Gascony falling to the French king. 
30
"1066 and All That": English and French Strategic Rivalry During the Middle Ages
Of all their lands in France, Gascony remained most central to English strategic plans and decision-making. Brought to the kingdom in 1152 by Eleanor of Aquitaine's marriage to Henry II, it remained in English hands until 1453. During that time, Gascony is mentioned as an object of concern in every treaty between England and France, and concessions were frequently made to protect its ownership. It was also a special favorite for two royals, Richard the Lionheart and Edward the Black Prince who spent more time there-especially at the capital city, Bordeaux-than they did in England.
Even before he became king, Richard took a special interest in Gascony. His mother certainly encouraged this, but so too did the difficult relationship he had with his fatherin concert with his mother and brothers, Henry and Geoffrey, he had revolted without success against his father in 1173-74. Henry forgave his sons, but it remained a difficult situation. Though, as long as Henry II stayed in London, Richard stayed in Gascony. As such, Richard was on-hand to crush a number of local revolts that might have otherwise developed into larger threats to British control of the region. 
31
It was also from Gascony that the Black Prince, in support of Pedro of Castile, invaded Spain and fought the battle of Nájera against the French, who fought for Enrique of Trastámara.

Another border that saw constant warfare throughout most of the Middle Ages was that of England and Scotland. Scotland remained a constant strategic concern to England. Generally, however, the English regarded Scotland with little priority and respected the kingdom's sovereignty, although with a military presence in several northern English and even a few Scottish fortifications. The English also tried to manipulate Scottish political decisions by buying off several Scottish noblemen with English lands, titles, and sinecures.
Even this small amount of military and political interference was often seen as a threat by some Scots. When this occurred, for example with William Wallace at the end of the thirteenth century or Robert Bruce at the beginning of the fourteenth century, or when Scottish raids threatened security or economics, the English military force in Scotland and on the borders increased. Large armies were marched into Scotland, often with the king in the lead. The battles of Bannockburn (1314) and Otterburn (1388) are justly celebrated for being commanding Scottish victories against these armies, but such victories were rare, with English victories at Falkirk (1298), Neville's Cross (1346), Homildon Hill (1402) and Flodden (1513) far outweighing the defeats in determining long-term results.

In the fourteenth century, Scottish assistance to France was largely harassment of the English along the border. It was effective, too. Although, claiming the French throne in 1328, Edward III judged that the Scots posed too much of a threat to England for him to immediately go to France. Even after soundly defeating the Scots at the battle of Halidon Hill in 1333, it took Edward another four years to make it to the continent, suggesting that he was still not confident enough to leave his border open to yet another potential Scottish attack.
Despite the Auld Alliance, the French had assisted the Scots very little during Edward's campaigns against them. However, in 1346 when the French asked for Scottish assistance, it was delivered. Victory at the battle of Crécy gave Edward III the impetus to besiege Calais, while defeat meant that Philip VI could not effectively relieve it. He needed something to distract the English or Calais would be lost, and the Scottish king, David II Bruce, provided this by taking an army into England.
David II probably expected to face only token resistance, because Edward had taken much of the English Army-more than 30,000 men-to Calais. Instead, he ran into a formidable army led by wealthy northern English barons.

In 1973, an archaeologist, Robin Birley, found a cache of 752 letters written by Roman officials and their spouses living on Hadrian's Wall in the first and second centuries CE. Called the Vindolanda Tablets from the Roman fortress where they were discovered, these hand-written sources have revealed the previously unknown lives of lower-level Roman military and political officials residing a long distance from the Imperial capital. It was not an easy existence-one of the letters has an early second-century woman writing her Roman relatives to simply "send more socks"-but a necessary one for the man (and his family) who was hoping to move on to a much better (and, in the case of Britannia, warmer) position. 
43
44
This is essentially how it remained throughout the six centuries between the Romans leaving and the Normans arriving: subsistence farming and cottage industry. Essentially nothing was made or produced that had value beyond the kingdom William conquered. The Domesday Book, William's census of all peoples and goods in his newly conquered lands, is a spectacular document. Among what it reveals is that the kingdom was on the whole quite poor. It could do for its needs, but was highly unlikely to make any ruler or his barons rich. 
45
Sheep could be produced anywhere in Europe. All they need is grasslands to thrive. And all sheep will grow coats of wool that can be harvested at least once a year, and that harvesting can take place from the year after the sheep is born until its death. Because the costs of production are minimal, but the production large and consistent, wool can be a profitable item of trade. The only significant problem is that a sheep will only grow the thickness of wool it needs to stay warm, so sheep raised in more temperate climates produce only thin, short wool. English sheep-for the same reason that the Roman woman on Hadrian's Wall asked for more socks from her relatives back home-grew long, thick coats, which made their wool excellent for medieval cloth.
By whom, why, and when it was discerned that wool would become England's primary commodity to be produced and traded is not known, nor can it be narrowed to a specific region where or time when the decision was made. But because it coincided with the wool-based economic prosperity of the Low Countries and Northern Italian towns, there is likely a connection. It was during the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that these towns grew the most, and it was during those same centuries when English wool production began to develop and flourish. By the end of the twelfth century, it was substantial, with Richard I's ransom paid for by wool subsidies; by 1297, half of all English wealth was underpinned by wool production. 
46
"1066 and All That": English and French Strategic Rivalry During the Middle Ages By this time, too, a certain number of land-holders, churches, monasteries, and nobles with lands and foresight enough to produce major flocks began to control English wool production and trade: 5,500 sheep are reported on one Derbyshire estate. Selective breeding also benefitted production. Sheep cost the same to feed and maintain, so the goal became breeding for the highest quality wool. 
47
The English wool trade could only thrive if there was a consumer. Although there were other markets for English wool, the most consistently profitable ones were in the larger towns of the Low Countries. Southern Low Countries' cloth-makers excelled in producing large quantities of thick, warm, and full cloth that English wool was perfect for. English wool also had a natural color that allowed dying with the most lustrous, deep, and bright colors, also specialties of Low Countries' cloth-makers.
Low Countries' cloth-makers were divided into several different guilds, representing each of the various cloth-making processes-weaving, fulling (cleaning the wool to eliminate oil, dirt, and other impurities, thereby making it thicker), dying, tailoring-and sometimes specialties including tapestries and lace. The guilds were well-organized and powerful, able to quell competition and set prices. But they also instituted a training program for education and establishing quality standards. This ensured that Low Countries' cloth-makers were the rival of any in Europe, which in turn ensured that English wool producers always had a market for their wool. 
48

As English kings began to discover how profitable the wool trade was, they realized that controlling taxation of this trade could benefit their treasuries. Collecting export taxes was not difficult, especially once, starting in 1275, Edward I imposed the "Great and Ancient Custom," a small tax placed on any sack of wool shipped through English ports. The merchants accepted this in return for the royal promise of greater protection against piracy.
In times of even greater threats to their ships, during the Hundred Years War, the merchants even agreed to increase this "Custom." 
53
54
It is only in understanding Edward III's economic strategy to protect and profit from the English wool trade, that the question about why he did not march on Paris after his victory at the battle of Crécy in 1346 can be answered. 
55
56
While the wool trade was England's most important economic strategic concern from the twelfth century through the end of the Middle Ages, exports from Gascony to England were also important: woad, dyes, and especially wine. Wine was "the beverage of choice" for the noble and wealthy classes throughout Europe, especially in England. 
57
By the time of the Hundred Years War, the wine trade was integral to England's economy. Ecological fluctuations-drought or disease-decreased the amount of trade (the severe winter of 1437-38 dropped English tunage to 5,400), but nothing affected it so much as warfare, which threatened the grape growing regions, ports and sea lanes (in 1438 wine exports dropped to 4,000 tuns). Gascony was the final loss of the Hundred Years War for the English. The year before it fell, 1452-53, 8,700 tuns of wine were imported to England; the year after imports were negligible. 
58
Ships were necessary to conquer the island nation of England. The Romans, Angles, Saxons, Jutes, Vikings, and Normans all had fleets . The English Channel and North Sea, which so often protected that island kingdom, could also serve as a road for its enemies with strong naval capabilities and determination.
But the contrary was also true: England needed a strong navy before it could participate in European affairs. Before 1066, various English kingdoms built insignificant navies but did not unite in defensive efforts against Scandinavian incursions. Only Alfred the Great built a strong fleet, with which he successfully curtailed Viking activities against his kingdom of Wessex, but his successors did not continue with his strategic naval policies. 
59
The core of medieval Europe, identified as such at least since the time of Charlemagne, was the Holy Roman Empire, France, the Low Countries and Italy. It was there that could be found the greatest population, the most focused Catholic Church ties, the strongest economies, the greatest opportunity for education, and the largest amount of artistic, scientific, and technological innovation. The Iberian peninsula and the Byzantine Empire lacked religious connections with the rest of Europe throughout most of the Middle Ages, while Scandinavia and Eastern Europe simply did not have the population or wealth to be a part of that "Europe." Had England continued along the historical path of the Anglo-Saxon period, it is likely that it would have had a similar non-European identity. But the kings of England, starting with William the Conqueror, were determined to be noticed and accepted.
William tried to do it with his conquest itself. Before undertaking his campaign, he recruited troops from Brittany, Flanders, and Boulogne. Among the latter was Eustace II, count of Boulogne, who, despite being more than 50 years old at the time of the battle of Hastings, served valiantly. William also sought the favor of the papacy and received Pope Alexander II's vexillum (standard) to carry with him into England. 
61
62
63
But it was the Hundred Years War that forever changed England's image with the rest of Europe. Edward III's defaulting in 1342 on loans from the Bardi and Peruzzi banks, which he had used to fund his 1340 campaign, did not help; it seemed to confirm that the kingdom was untrustworthy. While the English might win a battle, like that at Sluys, their setback at Tournai also seemed to confirm a pattern of defeat in military conflicts against larger, more stable states.
That changed with the 1346 campaign. Contemporary Florentine chronicler Giovanni Villani commented that Edward III's victory at Crécy brought England into Europe. Moreover, Villani was not the only Italian interested in what occurred at the battle of Crécy: ten different and unique chronicles from throughout Italy written before 1370 record details of the battle. 
64
Victories at Crécy and Poitiers during the Hundred Years War certainly made France notice England. Before then, French kings never appeared to have the same strategic interest in England as English kings did in France. They fought with great military efforts to acquire English lands in France; Philip Augustus especially showing his generalship by defeating Henry II, Richard I, and John in campaigns, at sieges and on the battlefield. But, even delivering these numerous defeats, he did not attack England itself. Indeed, concerted French attacks of England were few and half-hearted-for example, Louis VIII's 1215 and 1217 sieges of Dover, and the expedition of 1405-06 in support of Owain Glyn Dŵr's 5-20 "1066 and All That": English and French Strategic Rivalry During the Middle Ages rebellion. Raids were more frequent, but generally resulted in looting and pillage-for example, in 1338 at Southampton-rather than what could be defined as invasion.
The French also turned a blind eye to Channel piracy. Some of it was certainly statesponsored piracy-for example, Philip VI's hiring of Genoese galleys under Aitone Doria and Carlo Grimaldi to pirate English vessels in the Channel and along the Atlantic during the 1340s and 1350s. 
65
66
A large number of southern and southeastern French nobles and soldiers took little to no part in Hundred Years War fighting. Some even continued their economic dealings with the English throughout the war, using Gascony or the Low Countries as conduits for trade. An example of these is René of Anjou, who was at times during his 71 years (1409-80) duke of Anjou, count of Provence, count of Piedmont, duke of Bar, duke of Lorraine, king of Naples, and titular king of Jerusalem. Despite being tied to all of those fighting in the Hundred Years War, by fealty, family or proximity, he stayed largely out of the fighting (except in 1431 at the battle of Bulgnéville, where he fought the Burgundians over the inheritance of the county of Lorraine with the Burgundians). He was involved in many diplomatic affairs and intrigues, including giving final approval in 1429 to Joan of Arc's meeting with the future French king, Charles VII, his brother-in-law, and negotiating the marriage of his daughter, Margaret of Anjou, to the King of England, Henry VI, this marriage taking place in 1444. Yet, never was he required to send troops to fight alongside the French, English or Burgundians; nor was his economy disrupted in any way by financial demands from those sides. By the end of the Hundred Years War, his lands were among the most prosperous in France and he was among the most wealthy of lords. 68
The history of medieval England and France from 1066 to 1453 teaches several lessons on dealing with long-term strategic rivalries.
"1066 and All That": English and French Strategic Rivalry During the Middle Ages
The first of these concerns political strategies. This long-term strategic rivalry began in 1066 when England was "founded" with an obligation to France. William, the conqueror, and thus the new king of England, had been duke of Normandy, and as such had a fealty to the French king. It was a rare occurrence, unique at that level of political status during the Middle Ages. Thus, it is highly unlikely that modern states would ever find themselves in the same relationship; however, obligatory fealties have been defined in many ways and have taken many different forms during history. Despite its rarity, this medieval case shows that obligatory fealty is often a complicated relationship: the historical memory, if not the reality, of William's, and later Henry II's or Richard's, obligations to the French crown was strong. Even though the fealty itself entered stasis at times, when England had stronger royal and military leadership than France, it was revived once that leadership advantage was removed. This meant in the strategic rivalry of medieval England and France that all diplomatic and treaty negotiations were conducted with the obligatory relationship clearly delineated-another lesson taught. The king of England was reminded in all negotiations with the French that he was obligated to the king of France. Even during what seemed to both parties small diplomatic negotiations, the French included the fealty owed them, and whether it was due on that occasion or not. In the most lopsided of these, the Treaty of Paris of 1259, French success was garnered when they demanded, and received, homage from the English. However, the French king, Louis IX at the time, took advantage of a weak English king, Henry III. Stronger English kings were not so easily defeated in diplomatic negotiations. Repercussions from one success, if taken too far, as the Treaty of Paris may have set England on a future course of more bellicose engagements that could have been avoided by a more restrained diplomatic offensive.
What complicates obligatory relationships further is when one state possesses property (loosely defined) that another state claims. From 1066 to 1453, England always occupied lands the French felt were theirs. These had all been brought to the English throne by inheritance and not conquest, but English kings certainly used military force to protect and retain them. The two nations constantly fought over these patrimonial lands. Gascony was especially prized by English kings, who expended great military and diplomatic efforts to keep it. Once more, in a modern context it is not likely that the lands of one strategic rival would lie within the boundaries of another-although examples exist. However, one state might feel territorial about what it sees as its property or influence. If a rival also claims this property or influence, peace might be threatened.
A final political lesson from the long-term strategic rivalry of medieval England and France is that when there is a common rival held by two states who are not rivals themselves, an alliance between those states can prove beneficial. France used Scotland especially against England during the Middle Ages; the medieval Scots had such a political vehemence against the English that they required little from the French in their alliance-5-22 "1066 and All That": English and French Strategic Rivalry During the Middle Ages gladly taking funds, but not requiring French military intervention-and readily gave military assistance whenever required, either via military distractions or soldiers to fight in France.
However important political strategy might be to long-term rivals, as the rivalry between medieval France and England shows, economic strategic concerns are either on par with or superior to political strategies. Trade, then as now, was the most important of these. England's economy had a single profitable product to trade: wool. No doubt economists would suggest that relying on a single product for a country's economic prosperity is risky at any time. The risk was certainly there for medieval England; and yet, perhaps relying on the wool trade focused English strategic decisions in a way that having several trade items might not have. Because of wool, English kings formed a relationship with their consumer states and towns, principally in the Low Countries, that determined their diplomatic and military efforts. They needed these consumers; but, maybe more importantly, these consumers relied reliant on them for the products. Especially during the Hundred Years War, the English could count on the economic, and therefore political, allegiance of the consumer states-sometimes to the point of rebellion against lords and governors allied with the French. This medieval English economic strategy may have determined more military decisions than any political concern. Edward I recognized the funds that could be acquired from the taxation of wool exports-and that they would more than pay for the increased military and naval efforts to guarantee the safe transportation of the merchandise. Edward II recognized that funds could also be derived from directing wool imports to a single location, the Wool Staple, thereby negotiating for lower duties-with, of course, the royal treasury receiving a portion of the money saved by the merchants. Finally, Edward III recognized that he could take advantage of his victory at Crécy to acquire his own continental port, Calais, where he could permanently place the Staple-thereby gaining all import and export duties for the treasury.
Other long-term strategic rivalries exist because both need the single product that a third state supplies. In that case, diplomatic and military decisions need to be made by a state to ensure a continued supply of the product from that third state, either provided at the same or higher level than their strategic rival.
A final lesson learned from the long-term strategic rivalry between England and France during the Middle Ages is that geopolitics matters, especially to the state that has a geopolitical disadvantage. England's location made it difficult to be included in the European identity. Before 1066, little of Europe cared much about England. William's conquest initially did nothing to change that. But he and his successors strove to be part of the European identity. They built strong fleets of cargo and warships. They called themselves rex. They went on Crusade. They even assassinated archbishops (although, in fact, this was not done more than once). Above all, they developed an image by warring 5-23 
The strategic rivalry between the maritime republics of Genoa and Venice played a significant role in shaping the politics and economies of the eastern Mediterranean for more than two centuries in the later Middle Ages. Co-operation between them was possible, but competition, mostly of the commercial variety, easily generated hostility and suspicion, and gave rise to four major wars. One of these wars turned into arguably the greatest crisis the Venetian republic ever faced in its long history. Only rarely were the two nations directly contending for the same territory, although, their commercial rivalry extended to wherever the merchants of both republics were active, from Flanders to Egypt. It became a strategic rivalry only in the eastern Mediterranean, where it was principally restricted to the lands of the Byzantine Empire, or what had been Byzantine lands, and to the crusader states of the Holy Land. In these comparatively weak states, princes would grant preferential trading privileges in exchange for military-essentially naval-support. The Venetians and Genoese, with the strongest fleets in the Mediterranean, readily entered into such arrangements, always with an eye to outdoing what privileges their rivals might enjoy.
In many ways, Venice and Genoa were evenly matched. Venice was probably the more populous; it was one of the largest cities in medieval Europe. Estimates of population for medieval cities are always hazardous, but those for Venice (based on military enrollments) are better founded than most: around 80,000 in 1200, double that for the city and lagoon by 1300, but dropping dramatically-perhaps by more than half-during the Black Death of 1347-49.

Both were turned towards the sea; Venice had no territory on the Italian mainland beyond the lagoon until the fourteenth century; Genoa was struggling for control over Liguria. Their frontiers were far apart; they were never territorial rivals in Italy. Moreover, they had little trade with each other. Venice aimed to exploit her position at the head of the Adriatic, seeking to dominate the whole of that sea; Genoa aspired to dominate the Tyrrhenian, but always had to contend with powerful rivals, notably the Pisans and the Catalans and Aragonese. These were territorial as well as commercial rivals of the Genoese, contending for control of the major islands of the Tyrrhenian, Corsica, and Sardinia. Venice was not a party to that contest.
Both cities derived their wealth in large part from long-distance trade, because they aimed to become a hub for trade between Mediterranean lands (including Muslim lands) and western Europe. Each strove to gain commercial privileges that would give them a decisive advantage over their rivals, ideally excluding them from specific markets altogether. They did not often achieve that ideal, and then not for very long. It was not in the interests of even the weakest Byzantine emperors or other princes to give exclusive privileges to merchants from any one state.
Nor was it necessarily in their interests to abide by grants of privileges once made. Byzantine emperors and the princes of crusader states often tried to evade implementing them in full, and there would have to be follow-up agreements, confirming or modifying the original terms. Yet the fundamental superiority of the terms granted to Italian merchants over those that applied to other merchants, including the emperors' own subjects (known generically as "Greeks") persisted. Such commercial advantages, particularly those enjoyed over local merchants bred resentment and hostility, increasing the unpopularity of Venetian and Genoese traders. One potent cause of resentment was that they became involved in internal trade within the Byzantine Empire. Greek merchants were discouraged from travelling far afield-the Imperial authorities did not want them engaging in political intrigue or picking up heterodox religious ideas-but they were active in local and regional trade, and had to pay the standard ten per cent excise on their merchandise, while the privileged Italian competitors paid lower rates or were exempted.
Venetian and Genoese merchants also played a pivotal role in the crucial Egyptian trade, especially with Alexandria, bringing slaves and forest products from the Black Sea, buying spices that had come to Egypt via the Indian Ocean route, and other goods such as linen and cotton. Neither the Venetians nor the Genoese had any scruples about supplying war materials-wood, iron, and pitch-to Muslim Egypt. Despite this, they were never able to extract such advantageous terms from the sultans of Egypt as they did from Byzantine emperors. It was only from the late twelfth century that Venetians and Genoese (and Pisan) merchants were permitted to have their own separate compounds; before then they all had to use one in common. The Italian merchants also had to pay taxes and were not 6-2 permitted to penetrate the internal Egyptian market. As a result, Genoese and Venetians could not vie with each other for superior privileges let alone try to exclude each other.
In their relations with the sultan, they lacked the leverage which enabled them to drive such hard bargains with the Byzantine emperors and the princes of crusader statesthe sultan had no need of their fleets; the emperors and crusader princes did. The crusading states of the Holy Land had no naval forces of their own; and the Byzantine emperors became increasingly unable or unwilling to maintain a sufficiently large fleet to contain the piracy endemic in their seas, let alone to adequately support their armies in war. The Venetians and Genoese made up these deficits, but they generally expected payment for the ships and crews they provided, as well as enhanced trading privileges. Crusading princes and Byzantine emperors wanted naval support, and the trading concessions they granted became political instruments, not the means to secure economic benefits to their states. Indeed, they were aware that the advantageous terms granted to the Venetians and Genoese might be detrimental to their own interests-certainly to the detriment of their own revenues from taxes on trade.
The Genoese and Venetian fleets were the key to their power, and the underpinning of their influence in the eastern Mediterranean. There was no question of either being able to deny the seas to the other. The nearest any medieval naval power could get to controlling the seas was to protect their own merchant shipping and territory and to raid those of their rivals. Still, to secure their positions, both cities kept ships and galleys well-armed, and seamen were expected to be combatants. In dangerous times or waters, these vessels also carried complements of soldiers. Larger merchant ships were less manoeuvrable than the galleys, but could be effective in battle, serving as platforms to deploy missile weapons. The Genoese tended to make more use of the round ships, suitable for carrying bulk goods as well as larger amounts of valuable cargo, while the Venetians continued to use merchant galleys to a greater extent. One major difference between the fleets of the two cities was that Venice built and maintained state-owned galleys to protect merchant convoys and patrol the Adriatic, while Genoa usually relied on hiring private vessels or privately-financed fleets to fight its wars. Still, it was easy enough to convert merchant galleys from trade to war, or, in the case of the Genoese, piracy. The Venetian government did not permit Venetians to become pirates; the Genoese government could not stop its citizens turning to piracy.
The Venetian government was also much more active than the Genoese in directing overseas trade. While much Venetian trade was in the hands of merchants and their agents acting as individuals, travelling where and when they judged best, the distinctive feature of Venetian overseas trading was the system of convoys of galleys provided by the state, protected by escorts. Details of their organization, from their routes to their sailing dates, down to the responsibility of the shipmasters to ensure all the cargo paid due freight charges, and the wages of the oarsmen and armed guards, were decided by the government. The system matured in the early fourteenth century into the mude, with voyages of convoys of 6-3 state-owned galleys leased to private shipmasters organized on a regular basis on major routes.

The Venetians, who had maintained close contacts with the Byzantine Empire, preceded the Genoese in exploiting the commercial opportunities in the eastern Mediterranean. In 1082, Emperor Alexius I granted them favorable commercial privileges with total exemptions from customs and harbor taxes, as well as an area of Constantinople, handily situated on the inlet of the Bosphorus (known as the Golden Horn), where they could settle and conduct their business. Previously foreign merchants had been forbidden to stay in Constantinople for more than three months at a time, and had all been obliged to trade through government warehouses. This was the first time that the emperor had renounced surveillance over any group of alien merchants. These privileges were a reward for aid from the Venetian fleet against the Normans, who, having established a kingdom in Sicily and Naples, were seizing Byzantine territory in the Balkans, aiming to hold both coasts of the Adriatic.
By the end of the eleventh century, Genoese merchants were active in the eastern Mediterranean as well, but Genoa did not become a power in the region until the Crusades. When the First Crusade was launched at the end of the century, Genoese vessels transported the crusaders and joined in the conquest of the Holy Land. Distinguishing public from private initiative in Genoese participation in the early years of the crusades is problematic. The communal government was only coming into being at that time, as a series of temporary sworn associations for fixed periods of a few years. Men from the same landholding families who had been prominent in the court of the bishop when he governed Genoa, were among the leaders of the early commune and financed and organized the Genoese crusading expeditions. A handful of these families dominated Genoese trade in the Levant until the mid-twelfth century. Only one family, however, the Embriaci, had members migrate to the Holy Land, renting lands and urban quarters that had been granted to the Genoese commune there.

Of most interest to the Italians were the coastal cities, with their harbours and their connections to caravan routes along which the precious goods from Asia were brought. Only in such cities were the urban quarters they were granted really used.

The Pisans benefited from this policy before the Genoese did, being granted commercial privileges in 1111, which were renewed in 1136.

As part of his policy to find new allies Manuel sent an envoy to Genoa to negotiate an agreement-just when the regime in Genoa was instituting a policy of seeking for trading privileges, in Byzantium and elsewhere.

In the absence of the Venetians from Constantinople, the Genoese there prospered, only to be caught up with the Pisans in the coup that brought the anti-Latin Emperor Andronicus to the throne in 1182. Genoese ships, having defended the defeated regency government was added to a list of grievances Andronicus used to justify slaughtering all the "Latins" the Byzantines could find, or sold them into slavery; few escaped. Finding themselves unable to do without some western merchants and their ships, Andronicus and his successor turned to the Venetians, who began to return to Byzantium in the mid-1180s. Their privileges were confirmed, in return for another promise of naval help against the 6-7
Normans, in 1187.

Again under the personal command of the doge, the Venetian fleet played a crucial role in both the assault on Constantinople and the installation of Alexius IV in 1203, and, after he was deposed and replaced by a leader of the Greek resistance to Latin domination, in the bitter fight for the city that ended in its conquest by the crusaders in 1204. In the election of the Latin emperor, Venetian electors helped to ensure that the leading candidate, Count Boniface of Monferrato, an ally of Genoa, did not succeed. The Genoese made no attempt to challenge the Venetian fleet off Constantinople. Individual Genoese may have been among the thousands of Latins who left the city in 1203 to assist the crusaders, but there was no conspicuous Genoese contingent among the forces that took it in 1204. 
28
Naturally, under the new dispensation all their trading privileges were confirmed, with the significant difference that they could now feel assured that they would be implemented in full. Another difference was that in the document drawn up by the crusaders, as in effect the constitution of the Latin empire, it was stipulated that no one from a state at 6-8 war with Venice should be admitted into the territory of the empire. Only a quarter of that territory was reserved for the Latin emperor; the rest was to be divided evenly between Venice and the crusading barons. The Venetians, therefore, had been given a claim to threeeighths of the territory of the Byzantine empire, including one-third of Constantinople.

Castro (his father-in-law had been granted Malta in fief for helping the Normans). He was successful at first, yet the Venetians were bent on securing the island, so strategically placed at the entrance to the Aegean, and the Genoese had more pressing concerns, being engaged in a war with Pisa. Even after he gave up by 1212, another Genoese, Alamanno Costa, held out until 1217, waging a guerrilla war with the assistance of the native Cretans (who would rebel repeatedly against Venetian rule for more than a century).

By then, the Genoese were only beginning to enjoy the full benefits of the position they had been promised by the Treaty of Nymphaeum twenty years before. During that time, their relations with Michael had been troubled. Apart from his dissatisfaction with the performance of the Genoese fleet-he did not feel that he had got his money's worth-he was angered by the supposed involvement of the chief official of the Genoese in Constantinople in a plot to restore the Latin empire in 1263. As a result, he sent all the Genoese out of the city to Heraklea on the northern coast of the Sea of Marmora. They were not allowed back to Constantinople until 1267, after Michael had tried and failed to come to an understanding with the Venetians; they were given the quarter of Galata (Pera) on the far side of the Golden Horn.
Complicating the situation was Genoa's involvement in the confrontation of Guelfs and Ghibellines in Italy. Originally used to designate supporters of the pope, Guelfs, or the Hohenstaufen emperor, Ghibellines, these terms also became used to designate local factions throughout Italy. At a local level, especially, but also to an increasing extent at the level of regional politics, the original association of the factions with pope or emperor no longer held true, although they could often still carry that significance. With the advent of Charles d'Anjou as the papal champion in Italy, "Guelf" came to equate to "Angevin" in Italian politics. For much of Charles d'Anjou's reign, the Ghibellines were dominant in Genoa, and Michael sought their support against Charles. In 1273, Charles sent an army to attack Genoa. These troops and his Lombard allies were beaten off, but the Genoese were not anxious to renew the war, and Michael was unable to get their commitment to further operations. A peace between Genoa and Charles d'Anjou in 1276 was followed by the emperor's conclusion of a renewed truce with Venice the following year. When the threat from Charles revived, however, and especially after he made the Treaty of Orvieto with Venice, Michael turned again to the Genoese for support.

Byzantine emperors had excluded foreigners from trade in the Black Sea, which was a vital source of supplies for Constantinople, notably for grain from Russian lands, as well as a source of goods carried along the Asian caravan routes. Under the Latin emperors, the Venetians had engaged in limited trade there, being present at Soldaia (Sougdéa) in the 6-12 Crimea as early as 1206.

In the end, neither Genoa nor Venice was allowed to establish any extra-territorial settlement at Tana. And for a brief period, both rivals came together to defend themselves against the khan when, in reprisal for the murder of a Tatar, he expelled them from Tana in 1343. Caffa came under siege, but it was well-fortified, and the Tatars retired in early 1344, only to try again in 1346. The Genoese and Venetian governments signed an alliance against the Tatars in 1344,

Looking for allies, Venice found them in the emperor and King Peter IV of Aragon (whose Catalan subjects were by this time the main rivals of the Genoese in the Tyrrhenian). With the aid of these allies, the Venetians hoped to conquer the Genoese colonies, destroy the Genoese fleets and blockade Genoa itself.

From Caffa, the Genoese gradually extended their control over the Crimean coast, including in 1365 Soldaia, which had been taken from the Venetians by the Tatars in 1343. Reluctant agreement to Genoese domination of the coast was wrested from the weakened khans.

Adriatic fleet off Pola (Istria). Then, after being reinforced, the Genoese galleys blockaded and attacked Venice from the sea, while the king of Hungary and Carrara blocked the land routes to Venice. In August, the Genoese and Paduan forces took Chioggia, a Venetian settlement on the lagoon; the Venetians blockaded Chioggia in turn. Almost simultaneously, Milanese-backed forces threatened the city of Genoa, and the Venetians encouraged the Greeks and the Turks to attack Pera. Both of these assaults were beaten off, and the Genoese stubbornly held out in Chioggia until June 1380. Once Chioggia was recaptured , the Venetians claimed victory. As both sides were exhausted, Venice did not push for harsh terms in the Peace of Turin in 1381.

When Constantinople fell to the Ottomans in 1453, individual Venetians and Genoese were among its last defenders. As the threat to the city grew in the early 1450s, Venice and Genoa alike recognized the danger to their interests. The Venetians organized a fleet, but the captain's primary instructions were to mediate; only if that failed, was it to be used to 6-19 defend Constantinople. In the event, the city fell while the fleet was on its way. A treaty was then negotiated with the sultan Mehmed in 1454, permitting the re-establishment of the Venetian settlement there. 
86
The number of Genoese colonies in the east fell precipitously with just their hold on Chios remaining until 1566. On the other hand, Venetian trade with the Muslim east, particularly with Egypt, flourished, despite Venice fighting a series of wars with the Turks, in an eventually unsuccessful attempt to hold on to her position in the Aegean. In order to keep their colonies and harbours there, the Venetians were ready to pay tribute to the Turks. Had the Turks been content to accept this and to leave Venice in undisturbed possession of the colonies, Venice might well not have become engaged in that new strategic rivalry with the Turks. For their part, the Genoese turned their attention to developing their interests in the western Mediterranean and the Atlantic, exploiting the new opportunities opening up there far more vigorously than did the Venetians.
The strategic rivalry between Venice and Genoa was a commercial rivalry between two, in many ways, similar, evenly-matched maritime republics. Its character as a commercial rivalry meant that the theatres within which it was played out were beyond the control of the contending powers. They could, for example, do nothing to change the routes along which the goods from Asia travelled, nor could they influence the political and military fortunes of the Mongols, the Tatars or the Turks in central Asia and the Near East. They play a small part in the political fortunes of the crusader states and in the Byzantine Empire, but not a decisive one. Their rivalry was fuelled, therefore, by competing in markets where access had to be negotiated and was regulated by agreements with other political powers, who granted or withheld favourable terms as their own interests and concerns suggested.
Comparing the commercial privileges each managed to negotiate was about the only way they could assess their relative performance. There was no way to measure the volume of their rival's trade; assessing their own trade and wealth was problematic enough.
For the Venetians and the Genoese, commercial rivalry was not a proxy or an instrument by which to pursue other strategic aims. In their republics, promoting and protecting trade was one of the state's primary purposes, where merchants formed a substantial part of their political elites. During their contest, both had other strategic rivalries, different in character. Until the end of the thirteenth century, the Pisans represented a greater threat to Genoa than to the Venetians. Not only was Pisa much closer to Genoa, but it was a territorial rivalfor Corsica and Sardinia-as well as a commercial one. In the fourteenth century, the Catalans succeeded the Pisans as the main rivals of the Genoese in their home waters in the Tyr-6-20 rhenian Sea. For the Venetians, the Normans of southern Italy, the kings of Hungary, and most formidably, the Turks-challenging them for dominance over the eastern Adriatic or western Aegean shores-served as rivals. These were primarily territorial rivalries, not commercial. They impinged on the rivalry between the Genoese and the Venetians mostly when they were at war, by occasionally distracting the resources and attention of one or the other, or by offering the opportunity to ally against the mutual enemy It is difficult to discern a conscious, deliberate development of a long-term strategy on either side of the Genoa-Venice rivalry, because it was not a matter of debate or controversy. There was no pro-Venetian party in Genoa, or pro-Genoese party in Venice. Neither attempted to interfere in the politics of the other state. Though Genoese and Venetians did align themselves to different sides in the crusader states, and in Constantinople, this interference was often the work of the local Venetian and Genoese communities, not under the direction of their governments in Italy. In fact, most of the incidents when they confronted one another in the eastern Mediterranean, including those that led to war, were not orchestrated by the home governments. Difficulties of communication, the months it took to travel from Venice or Genoa to Acre, or Constantinople, let alone the Crimea, made such central direction difficult, to say the least. Such logistical difficulties did not prevent the Venetian government from attempting to maintain close control of Venetian colonies and trading-posts and fleets. Any Venetian official or commander who took too consequential an initiative, except in an emergency, without authorization or instructions from the government in Venice risked censure, if not punishment (from fines to execution). This was particularly true if the initiative failed. Genoese governments, on the other hand, were rarely in a position to exercise comparable control. The Genoese had to rely more on private initiatives to advance and protect their economic interests; diplomatic and military backing from the state might not be forthcoming. Private initiative and finance could enable the Genoese to wage wars during internal political turmoil in Genoa. Stronger government and closer state control did not necessarily give the Venetians the advantage. The Genoese colonies' freedom of initiative and command of resources enabled them to respond quickly to threats or opportunities. In the crucial arena of the Black Sea, strategy was essentially devised by the colonists of Pera and Caffa, and not in Genoa.
Neither the Venetians nor the Genoese won any lasting political friends in the eastern Mediterranean. Local people and princes alike saw them as greedy, arrogant, and untrustworthy. It was all too obvious they were concerned with competing for profits, not hearts and minds. Neither Venice nor Genoa was interested in forming lasting alliances that were not associated with commercial treaties, although they sometimes looked for military alliances when they were at war with one another. Their naval power could be used to secure the observance of their commercial privileges when these were being undermined or rescinded. Such power could also obtain and protect access to markets. It could not, however, create markets, or prevent them changing. Using force to try to ensure the observance of
Genoa and Venice privileges could also be counter-productive, in that it made their merchants even more unwelcome and unpopular, and exposed them to reprisals. It also increased the likelihood that the host government would, if possible, turn to their rivals to counterbalance or replace them. Because of the nature of naval warfare in the Mediterranean in the later Middle Ages, when the Venetians and Genoese were at war with each other, victory in battle could not ensure victory in the war. The four wars between Venice and Genoa vented tensions between them, rather than decided disputes.

The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713
Dr. Geoffrey Parker "Empire was a remarkably durable form of state," Jane Burbank and Frederick Cooper remind us in their impressive study, Empires in world history. "By comparison, the nationstate appears as a blip on the historical horizon, a state form that emerged recently from under imperial skies and whose hold on the world's political imagination may well prove partial or transitory." Moreover, "Empires were not all alike; they created, adopted, and transmitted various repertoires of rule."
An imperial repertoire was neither a bag of tricks dipped into at random nor a preset formula for rule. Faced with challenges day by day, empires improvised; they also had their habits. What leaders could imagine and what they could carry off were shaped by past practices and constrained by context-both by other empires with their overlapping goals and by people in places empire-builders coveted. Imperial leaders, at any time or place, could imagine only so many ways to run a state.

Incest, Blind Faith, and Conquest:
The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 cest dramatically reduced the dynastic gene pool: Crown Prince Don Carlos (d. 1568) and King Charles II (d. 1700), each of whom had only six great-grandparents instead of sixteen, boasted much the same "inbreeding coefficient" as the incestuous offspring of siblings, or of a parent and child. The erratic behavior of the former induced his father to place him in prison until he died; the latter-ignorant, incoherent, and impotent-was the last of the dynasty.
Dynastic accident brought four separate inheritances together in the person of Charles of Austria (d. 1558). From his paternal grandfather, Maximilian, he received the ancestral Habsburg lands in central Europe; from his paternal grandmother, Mary, he inherited numerous duchies, counties and lordships in the Low Countries and the Franche-Comté of Burgundy. From his maternal grandmother, Isabella, Charles received Castile and its outposts in North Africa, the Caribbean, and Central America; from his maternal grandfather, Ferdinand, he inherited Aragon, Naples, Sicily, and Sardinia. Charles himself added several more provinces in the Low Countries, some by treaty and others by conquest; he annexed the duchy of Lombardy in Italy when its native dynasty died out; and he led the army that acquired Tunisia in North Africa.
Following the death of Maximilian in 1519, Charles bribed the leading German princes to choose him as "king of the Romans" (emperor-elect), and the pope later crowned him Holy Roman Emperor, which made him suzerain over most of Germany and northern Italy. Meanwhile, in the Americas, Charles's Spanish subjects expanded from their bases in the Caribbean to destroy and colonize first the Aztec empire in Mexico (eight times the size of Castile), and then the Inca empire in Peru. In 1535, just after the acquisition of Tunis and Peru, the city of Messina in Sicily welcomed Charles with the felicitous phrase coined by the Roman poet Vergil for the possessions of the Emperor Augustus, fifteen centuries before: A SOLIS ORTU AD OCCASUM, "From the rising to the setting of the sun"-or, as the spin-doctors of his son and heir, Philip II (d. 1598), would put it, "An empire on which the sun never set."

Incest, Blind Faith, and Conquest:
The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 intermarriage with the House of Avis, which ruled Portugal and its colonies in Africa, Asia, and America, in 1580 Philip inherited them all.
Of course, Philip still faced challenges-the Portuguese settlers on the Azores defied him, supported by Queen Elizabeth of England (Mary's half-sister); while many of his former subjects in the Netherlands formally abjured their obedience and formed an independent state, the "United Provinces" (better known in English as the Dutch Republic)-but in 1582 and 1583, ambitious amphibious expeditions imposed Philip's rule on the Azores, 1,000 miles west of Lisbon; and in 1584 and 1585 the king's troops regained the southern Netherlands, culminating in the blockade and capture of Antwerp, the largest city in northern Europe, 1,000 miles northeast of Lisbon. In July 1588, after three years of preparation, an Armada of 130 ships sailed majestically from the Iberian Peninsula and up the English Channel to rendezvous with 28,000 of the veteran troops who had reconquered the southern Netherlands and now stood poised to conquer England. In Madrid, a foreign ambassador observed with admiration:
At the moment, the Catholic King [Philip] is safe: France cannot threaten him, and the Turks can do little; neither can the king of Scots, who is offended at Queen Elizabeth on account of the death of his mother [Mary Stuart]… At the same time, Spain can be confident that the Swiss cantons will not move against him; nor will they allow others to do so, since they are now his allies.
Nothing, he predicted, could now stop Philip.

Shortly after Philip's death, one of his leading diplomats confided pessimistically to a colleague, Don Baltasar de Zúñiga, "Truly, sir, I believe we are gradually becoming the target at which the whole world wants to shoot its arrows; and you know that no empire, however great, has been able to sustain many wars in different areas for long… Although I may be mistaken I doubt whether we can sustain an empire as scattered as ours." The "empire on which the sun never set" thus became in the seventeenth century the target on which the sun never set. By the time he became principal foreign policy adviser to Philip III (d. 1621), Zúñiga shared this fatalistic outlook. In 1619, he lamented to a colleague that, "When matters reach a certain stage, every decision taken will be for the worst, not 7-3
Incest, Blind Faith, and Conquest:
The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 through lack of good advice, but because the situation is so desperate that it is not capable of remedy; and whatever policy is selected discredits whoever chose it." For another decade, the Spanish Habsburgs held their own, leading the count-duke of Olivares, Zúñiga's nephew and chief minister of Philip IV (d. 1665), to crow "God is Spanish and favors our nation these days"; but the rest of the century saw a succession of losses both at home (thanks to plague and famine) and abroad (thanks to British, French, and Dutch aggression).

For these failures, contemporaries and historians alike have advanced two distinct explanations:
• A problematic inheritance. The Spanish empire became too big to govern or to defend: structural factors-competing strategic agendas, distance, and information overload-therefore explain the failure to preserve it intact.
• Problematic monarchs. The Spanish Habsburgs possessed sufficient resources, but used them inefficiently in the pursuit of impossible goals. Monarchs with superior political skills could have succeeded where Charles V and his descendant failedor, in modern parlance, the fatal flaw lay with agents rather than structures.
Each explanation merits detailed examination.
Each component of an empire-especially an accidental empire-brought with it a poisoned chalice: its past. Each boasted its own institutions and identity; its own economic, defensive, and strategic agendas; and often its own extensive "privileges," permanently guaranteed by the sovereign. Even at the best of times, the priorities of the local elite in Barcelona, Lima, Lisbon, Mexico, Manila, Naples, Palermo, Milan, and Brussels often differed from those of the imperial government in Madrid leading to a sort of "subimperialism," in which Spain's proconsuls followed the maxim, Obedezco pero no cumplo-I obey but do nothing.

When Philip flatly refused to offer bribes in return for compliance, the viceroy and his successors declined to put the Union into effect for more than a decade on the grounds that "[if I] insist on it, the misfortunes that normally arise from new taxes and impositions may result."

The kings of France, for their part, coveted several Habsburg possessions that had once been ruled from Paris: Navarre, Catalonia, Milan, Naples, Burgundy, and the southern Netherlands. Charles's election as Holy Roman Emperor in 1519 meant that his territories now surrounded France to the east as well as to the north and south, creating an unprecedented strategic threat. King Francis I of France "maintains no friendship whatever with the emperor," an ambassador observed in 1520. "They adapt themselves to circumstance, but hate each other very cordially." 
10
Incest, Blind Faith, and Conquest:
The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 Charles and his successors faced two other enduring strategic rivalries, each one ideological as well as political: the Protestants and the Papacy. Emperor Maximilian had failed to silence Dr. Martin Luther, a professor at the University of Wittenberg in Saxony who wrote pamphlets and speeches to mobilize public support for his claims that the papacy was corrupt and required urgent reform. Although on his first visit to Germany Charles outlawed Luther and his followers, when Suleiman advanced into Hungary in 1526, and again when he laid siege to Vienna in 1529, in desperation Charles offered religious toleration to the German Lutherans (soon known as Protestants) in return for their military assistance against the Turks. Although this saved Vienna, Protestant ideas now spread both within Charles's territories (above all Germany and the Netherlands) and beyond (above all, Scandinavia, England, and Scotland.) Protestants everywhere feared that the emperor would revoke his grudging toleration and that Spanish Habsburgs intended to extirpate if an oportunity presented itself, and therefore constantly sought to undermine their projects and their power.
The popes also felt threatened by Charles and his successors because their territories encircled Rome: Sardinia and Spain to the west, Naples and Sicily to the south, Milan and Germany to the north. Rome's commerce by sea and land, including the supply of grain on which the capital depended, therefore lay at the Hasburgs' mercy. Two popes joined France and declared war on the Habsburgs, provoking the sack of Rome in 1527 and a bombardment in 1557: both led to an ignomious peace. Although no pontiff ever engaged in open hostilities after this, papal support for the "crusades" of the Spanish Habsburgs against both Muslims and Protestants, and for the acquisition of new territories, remained muted. As Philip once complained about Pope Gregory XIII's reluctance to fund his efforts to recover the Low Countries for the Catholic Church, "I believe that if the Netherlands belonged to someone else, he would have performed miracles to prevent them being lost by the church; but because they are my states, I believe he is prepared to see this happen because they will be lost by me." Gregory's efforts to prevent the union of Spain and Portugal outraged the king even more:
No one knows better than Your Holiness the love and respect that I have for you; and the setbacks that have afflicted my dominions during your pontificate are also well-known-most of them because I have taken upon my shoulders the defence of the church and extirpation of heresy. And yet the more these setbacks have increased, the more Your Holiness seems to ignore them-something that simply amazes me.

The annexation of Portugal and its empire in 1580-83 added one more "enduring strategic rivalry." Portuguese success in monopolizing the trade in certain key commodities 7-6
Incest, Blind Faith, and Conquest:
The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 (notably spices and horses) throughout the Indian Ocean and Indonesia had earned the enmity of many indigenous rulers, and Philip II had to contend not only with their frequent attempts to expel his new subjects but also with many ambitious proposals for countermeasures. Thus in 1584, an official in Macao asserted that "With fewer than 5000 Spaniards Your Majesty could conquer these lands [China] and become lord of them, or at least of the maritime areas, which are the most important in any part of the world"; while the bishop of Malacca advocated pooling the resources of Spain and Portugal in order first to conquer southeast Asia, and then to annex southern China, so that "His Majesty will be the greatest lord that ever was in the world." In the 1590s, a Portuguese priest long resident in America and Africa forwarded to the king an ambitious global strategy, arguing that the fortification of six widely separated strongpoints-Johore, St Helena, Goeree, Sierra Leone, Bahia and Santa Catalina-would guarantee Iberian commercial supremacy around the globe. 
12
Fernand Braudel was the first historian to devote sustained attention to the role of distance in the failure of the Spanish Habsburgs to preserve their empire. The second section of his masterpiece, The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean world in the age of Philip II, first published in 1949, examined the economic constraints upon early modern empires. It began:
Understanding the importance of distance in the sixteenth centuryunderstanding the obstacles, the difficulties and the delays that it causedleads one to view the administrative problems faced by sixteenth-century empires in a new light. Above all, the enormous Spanish empire: the empire of Philip II involved (for its time) a massive infrastructure of land and sea transport, and required not only the ceaseless movement of troops but also dispatch of hundreds of orders and reports every day-links that were silent but vital… A good half of the actions of Philip II can only be explained by the need to maintain these links, to safeguard his communications, and to effect in each remote corner of his empire the essential transfer of silver.

The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 Nevertheless, as Braudel recognized, the same was true of all empires: "Although much criticized, the Spanish empire was equal or indeed superior to other leading states for transport, transfer and communications." Throughout the sixteenth century, he added, "over equal distances Spanish communications were on the whole a match for anyone's." Contemporaries agreed. In the awed phrase of an observer at the Court of Spain in 1566, writing to his master in the Netherlands: "As Your Lordship knows, nothing happens there that is not immediately known here." Five years later, when the ambassador of the Venetian Republic (which prided itself on the speed and efficiency its communications network) hurried to the royal palace to inform Philip II of the great victory of Lepanto, he found that the king had already received the news from one of his own couriers. The same ambassador later complained ruefully that the information at Philip's disposal "was such that there is nothing he does not know."

Although empires did lay claim to vast stretches of territory, the nature of such claims was tempered by control that was exercised mainly over narrow bands, or corridors, and over enclaves and irregular zones around them. Maritime empires represented this pattern most clearly, with their networks of sea lanes connecting dispersed settlements or trading posts. But territorial expansion in Europe also occurred through the creation and protection of corridors and enclaves.

The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 dispatch each month to their principals, the kings of Spain expected at least one dispatch each week-and sometimes more. In 1557, Philip II ordered his field commander to "send me news by sending three or four messengers here, flying at top speed" every day, and "to this end, to keep post horses ready night and day." Six years later, he informed his envoy at the General Council of the Catholic Church at Trent that "there should be nothing, great or small, that is done or even contemplated in the council without you knowing all about it." In 1580, during the invasion of Portugal, the king informed his field commander that "I want you to let me know every day what is going on"; while eight years later, during the Armada campaign, the king instructed his agents that "now is the time to advise me of everything minute by minute."

The Spanish Habsburgs never seem to have recognized that their striking success in improving information transfer created new obstacles to effective government. In the words of an eminent contemporary strategic analyst:
There is only so much that any human can absorb, digest and act upon in a given period of time. The greater the stress, the more individuals will ignore or misrepresent data, mistake and misconstrue information, and the greater will be the prospects for confusion, disorientation and surprise.
In short, "More information from more sources, made available more quickly than ever before, equals system overload." In the sixteenth as in the twenty-first century, "Processing and transmission technologies far outstrip our ability to assimilate, sort and distribute information."

A decade later, although he bombarded the duke of Alba with extremely detailed instructions on the policies to follow in the Netherlands, he added the vital concession, "I delegate all these matters to you, as the person who will be handling the enterprise and will have a better understanding of the obstacles or advantages that may prevail." 
22
23
The Spanish Habsburgs' second reaction to the information overload they had created was to focus on minor problems (menudencias, or "trivia," in the phrase of his ministers) instead of wrestling with the crucial decisions on which the fate of the monarchy depended. In 1584, Cardinal Granvelle (Philip II's senior advisor) complained bitterly: I see in all matters these delays, so pernicious and in so many ways prejudicial to our own affairs, including the most important ones, which become lost to view with so much delay. And the reason is that His Majesty wants to do and see everything, without trusting anyone else, busying himself with so many petty details that he has no time left to resolve what matters most.
Five years later, Don Juan de Silva, who served Philip as page, soldier, ambassador, and councillor, delivered a more comprehensive indictment of his master's administrative style. "The detailed attention that His Majesty devotes to the most trifling things is a subject for regret," Silva confided to a colleague: Although His Majesty's brain must be the largest in the world, like that of any other human being, it is not capable of organizing the multitude of his affairs without making some division between those that he should deal with himself and those that he cannot avoid delegating to others. His Majesty does not make this distinction….Instead he leaves nothing entirely alone and takes from everyone the material that should be delegated (concerning individuals and details), and so does not concentrate on the general and the important because he finds them too tiring.

The king himself recognized this problem. In 1566, with war in the Mediterranean, a rebellion narrowly averted in Mexico, and trouble brewing in the Netherlands, a royal secretary apologized for troubling his master with "trivia": "When I see Your Majesty with many tasks, I am sometimes afraid to worry you with matters that could be postponed without detriment." The king replied "I gave up on the tasks: although there are plenty of them these days, sometimes a man can relax by doing other things." 
25
This was especially problematic in wartime-and the Spanish empire only enjoyed complete peace for ten years under Charles V, for six months under Philip II, and for three years under Philip III; while Philip IV (1621-65) spent every day of his long reign at war. Each monarch often fought on more than one front simultaneously, and at sea as well as on land. War always places rulers under intense stress. Not only do hostilities require resources that may prove difficult to find, they also divert attention from other problemsjust as those other problems sometimes divert attention from winning the war. Robert McNamara, Secretary of Defense of the United States during the 1960s, eloquently voiced this timeless dilemma in his memoirs:
One reason the Kennedy and Johnson administrations failed to take an orderly, rational approach to the basic questions underlying Vietnam was the staggering variety and complexity of other issues we faced. Simply put, we faced a blizzard of problems: there were only twenty-four hours in the day and we often did not have time to think straight. This predicament is not unique to the administration in which I served or to the United States. It has existed in all times and in most countries…and it ought to be recognized and planned for when organizing a government.

In the 1590s, a decade of adverse weather and plague, Philip therefore received increasingly strident pleas to scale back his commitments. Some came from taxpayers, via their representatives in the Cortes (Congress) of Castile. In 1593, one deputy pleaded that "before anything else, You Majesty should order a reduction in war expenditure, both in the Netherlands and elsewhere"; another stated that "although the wars with the Dutch, England and France are holy and just, we must beg Your Majesty that they cease"; while a third urged "Your Majesty to abandon all these wars, making the best terms that you can." 30 Some ministers made a similar case. Mateo Vázquez, a priest who had served as the king's private secretary for twenty years, begged his master to cease spending the resources of Castile so prodigally on foreign wars. "If God had intended Your Majesty to heal all the cripples who come to you to be cured, He would have given you the power

The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 to do so; and if He had wished to oblige Your Majesty to remedy all the troubles of the world, he would have given you the money and the resources to do so." If the king persevered with the same expensive policies, Vázquez continued relentlessly, "Everything may collapse at once for lack of money." Philip addressed this passionate complaint with remarkable equanimity-although he totally rejected it. "I know you are moved by the great zeal you have for my service to say what you did," he gently chided his minister.
But you must also understand that these are not matters that can be abandoned by a person who is as conscientious about his responsibilities as you know me to be, because they depress me and matter to me more than to anyone. Taken together, they involve far more problems than people think….Moreover, these issues involve religion, which must take precedence over everything. 
31
The king could not ignore the worsening fiscal situation, however. In 1596, the marquis de Poza, president of the council of Finance, sent an alarming message to Philip's most trusted advisor, Don Cristóbal de Moura: His Majesty must see that it is impossible to carry on as we are, because although we have already spent all His Majesty's revenues until the year 1599, his expenses continue and even increase, so that even if his revenues were unencumbered, we could not carry on. To do this, one only needs to know what I know: that His Majesty must either reduce his expenditure voluntarily until things improve, or else find a way to achieve the impossible.
A few days later Poza added despairingly, "Even if we escape from this obstacle, we will inevitably encounter another one tomorrow because each day is more impossible than the last." Moura agreed-"here we are drowning tied back-to-back" he lamented-and on 13 November 1596, "since loans are now so hard to find, and the total that we now owe" to bankers exceeded fourteen million ducats, Philip signed a fourth Decree of Bankruptcy. Castile had become the world's first serial defaulter on sovereign debt, and Philip had become, in the phrase of a recent book, "the borrower from hell." 32
Amid the "blizzard of problems" that confronted the Spanish empire, Moura also perceived a central paradox: success often bred failure-or, in Moura's own words, "however much more we acquire, the more we have to defend and the more our enemies want to take from us." 
33
Incest, Blind Faith, and Conquest:
The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 led the vanquished to seek their revenge by forging alliances with other enemies of the dynasty. This happened for the first time after the battle of Pavia in 1525, when Charles V's troops not only routed the French field army but captured King Francis, who spent more than a year in prison until he gave his word "as a knight" that he would honor a raft of humiliating territorial concessions demanded by the emperor. As soon as he regained his freedom, however, Francis concluded an anti-Habsburg League with representatives from several Italian states, and even sought an alliance with the Ottoman sultan. This news depressed Charles profoundly: "He is full of dumps and solitary musing," reported an English envoy, "sometimes alone three or four hours together. There is no mirth or comfort with him." The emperor had hoped that Pavia and a favorable peace would allow him to travel to Germany to extirpate the followers of Martin Luther, and then to Hungary to lead the forces of Christendom against the Turks. Instead, it alarmed and unified his neighbors. "If it had not been for the conclusion of this new league," wrote the doge of Venice, "one could well assume that His Imperial Majesty would not only have laid down the law to Italy, but would have made himself the monarch of the world."

His son also faced hostile coalitions that could snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. The Ottoman sultan sent not only his fleet to attack Spanish enclaves in the Mediterranean but freedom fighters to assist the rebellion by Philip II's Spanish subjects of Arab descent in 1568-71 (the war of Granada). He also offered assistance to the Dutch rebels after 1572, while the rulers of France and England sent them troops, treasure, and political advisors (the French king's brother and the English queen's Favorite both briefly became head of state of the Dutch Republic). In 1585, Queen Elizabeth signed a formal treaty of alliance with the Dutch, expanded in 1596 into a triple alliance when Henry of Bourbon, king of France, also joined. Philip's enemies now sought to coordinate their attacks on his empire.

The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713   This development, together with a devastating famine in much of Castile, led even the royal confessor, Fray Diego de Yepes, to question his master's faith-based policies:
God has entrusted the conservation of the Catholic faith and the expansion of the Christian religion to Your Majesty, and since they both depend on the sound government, justice and prosperity of these kingdoms of Spain, I hope you will be pleased to arrange matters so that on the Day of Judgment (which is not far off), you can appear in the presence of God confident that you have done everything possible.
When nothing improved, Yepes sent an equally stark warning to Moura that fighting wars and increasing taxes at a time of dearth "will bring down our world."
Your Lordship can see where this leads. The poor cry out, but His Majesty does not hear them, nor does he want to hear me. I simply do not know what to do. May God in His mercy protect Your Lordship, whom the world blames for all this (along with me)….I beg Your Lordship to look into this carefully, and advise His Majesty, because I have had no luck in writing or speaking to him.

The partition of the empire did not last because Albert died childless in 1621, and so Philip IV inherited all his grandfather's possessions. He immediately dissipated any potential advantage by renewing the war against the Dutch Republic, even though he was already fighting enemies of the dynasty in Germany. Shortly afterwards he provoked a war with England and also sent an army to enforce the rights of a relative to the Italian states of Monferrat and Mantua, provoking the French to intervene in support of a rival claimant. Although Spain managed to extricate itself from the wars with France and Britain, war with the former resumed in 1635, and within a decade, French troops controlled all of Spain north of the Ebro, thanks to the revolt of the Catalans who in 1641 placed themselves under French sov-
Incest, Blind Faith, and Conquest:
The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 ereignty. Portugal, too, rebelled, and (with military and naval assistance from France, Great Britain, and the Dutch Republic) in 1668 forced Spain to recognize its independence.
What had Philip IV gained by fighting so many wars? In material terms, nothing: he acquired no new territory and instead lost the vast Portuguese empire, Jamaica, important parts of the Netherlands, and northern Catalonia. Yet even this negative outcome entailed immense sacrifices. Repeatedly, imperial overstretch forced the central government to postpone or to abandon measures aimed at domestic recovery and retrenchment even as it sustained great human and material losses. Between 1640 and 1659, thousands of ordinary Catalans died violently and thousands more fled into exile. By the time Barcelona surrendered in 1652, its population halved by famine and plague, it had run up a debt of more than 20 million ducats; the diocese of Tortosa, which changed hands in 1640 and again in 1648, saw its revenues drop from more than 30,000 ducats annually in the 1630s to virtually nothing. Castilian communities close to the Portuguese border also fell dramatically because the troops of both sides exacted so much money, food, and other local resources. As Henry Kamen has observed, "No other single event in Castilian history of the early modern period, excepting only epidemics, did more to destroy the country" than the 28-year war with Portugal. 
38
Few Grand Strategies are entirely rational. For example, no political leader wants to admit defeat and thereby lose "reputation," and the greater the resources invested in a struggle, the harder it is to walk away. The Spanish empire was no exception: as Philip II observed in 1575: "I have no doubt that, if the cost of the war [in the Netherlands] continues at its present level, we will not be able to sustain it; but it would be a great shame if, having spent so much, we lost any chance that spending a little more might recover everything."

This leads me to understand matters differently [from you] and makes me play down the difficulties and problems that spring up; so that all the things that could either divert or stop me from carrying through this business seem less threatening to me.
Then the king argued that, in any case, logistics were irrelevant:
With a matter as important as this one, it does not seem right to engage in detailed consideration of the problems that would arise if we made mistakes and failed, without counterbalancing it with the benefits and advantages that success would bring-and it cannot be doubted that in terms of religion and politics, as well as of reputation and of all the other goals that I can and must try to achieve, those [benefits and advantages] would be so great and obvious that not only do they make me support and favor the cause, but they oblige and almost compel me to do so.
In short, "although it cannot be denied that we will encounter some obstacles and difficulties, they are outweighed by many other divine and human considerations that oblige us to take these risks and more." Philip subjected the commanders of the Armada to similar spiritual blackmail. When, in September 1587, the marquis of Santa Cruz pointed out the folly of sailing against England in mid-winter, and inquired about a fallback strategy, Philip replied serenely, "We are fully aware of the risk that is incurred by sending a major fleet in winter through the Channel without a safe harbor, but... since it is all for His cause, God will send good weather."

The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 Admittedly the strategic vision of his grandson sometimes took a secular turn.

Fame, after all, cannot be gained without taking personal part in some great enterprise. This one will enhance my reputation, and I gather it should not be too difficult."

Many minor miracles had indeed occurred, reinforcing the Messianic vision of the Spanish Habsburgs (apart from the providential marriages, births, and deaths that created the empire of Charles V and extended it under Philip II.) In 1571, a battle fleet led by Philip's brother don John of Austria defeated the Ottoman fleet at Lepanto; for 36 hours in August 1588, the Spanish Armada ("the largest fleet that has ever been in these seas since the creation of the world") lay at anchor off Calais, only a few miles from the army assembled for the conquest of England and within sight of the designated landing zone; and in 1634 a joint Spanish-Imperial army routed their enemies at the battle of Nördlingen, recovering most of Germany for the Catholic cause.

53
Incest, Blind Faith, and Conquest:
The Spanish Habsburgs and their Enemies, 1516-1713 superior resources available to their monarchs tilted the strategic balance of power in their favor. Louis XIV, Philip II's grandson, therefore made major gains at the expense of Spain at the Peace of the Pyrenees (1659), of Breda (1668), of Nijmegen (1678) and of Rijswik (1697)-and at the peace of Utrecht (1713) his grandson gained universal recognition as ruler of Spain, its American dominions, and the Philippines.
Even if the Spanish Habsburgs had done somewhat better in each round of peace negotiations, they were congenitally incapable of preserving their inheritance intact. The repeated intermarriages that created and expanded their accidental empire inevitably reduced the genetic pool of its rulers, producing heirs with serious defects: not just poor health, physical deformities, and weakness, but also reduced fertility. The degree of inbreeding is stunning. Many of Charles V's ancestors had intermarried-Mary of Burgundy had only six greatgrandparents instead of eight, while her son Philip married his third cousin Joanna, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, themselves the product of numerous intermarriages among the various branches of the House of Trastámara-creating an "inbreeding coefficient" for Charles of 0.037. The marriages of both Charles and his son Philip to their double-cousins dramatically increased the coefficient of Philip's son Don Carlos to 0.211. The marriage of Philip IV (who boasted only eight great-grandparents instead of the normal sixteen) to his niece made him the great-uncle as well as the father of his children, while their mother was also their cousin. This produced an "inbreeding coefficient" for their only child, Charles II, of 0.254-even higher than that of the offspring of siblings (0.25)-and although he lived to be 39, Charles was physically deformed, mentally challenged, and sterile. 
54
The Spanish Habsburgs continued their strategy of matrimonial imperialism despite explicit warnings of the dangers involved. For example, the death of both his only son, Don Carlos, and his second wife in 1568 meant that Philip could not avoid remarrying, and he arranged to wed his niece Anne of Austria. To his surprise, Pope Pius V refused to grant the necessary dispensation. In a holograph letter, the pontiff stated that "although some of our predecessors have granted dispensations in similar cases" of consanguinity, they had erred: according to Pius, no pope had the power to override the biblical prohibition on marriages between uncle and niece. Moreover, the pope added, "we have already seen the unfortunate consequences of these marriages of the first degree"-an unsubtle reference to the mental instability of Don Carlos.

The material cost of the Spanish Habsburgs' policy of conquest, blind faith, and incest was immense. The central government ran up a sovereign debt far beyond Spain's capacity to service: 85 million ducats by 1598, over 112 million by 1623, almost 182 million by 1667, and almost 223 million by 1687. Public Sector Borrowing on this scale-ten times total revenues, if not more-drained capital and raw materials from Spain, undercut local manufactures, and encouraged a "rentier" mentality among those sectors of the population with the potential to be entrepreneurs; while the need to create and increase taxes to repay lenders led to onerous fiscal expedients (especially duties on sales and on manufactures) with high social and economic costs. Worst of all, most tax revenues were remitted abroad, to fund armies and navies fighting to achieve international goals that mattered to the dynasty but not to most Spaniards. The government of Philip IV exported at least 150 million ducats to fund his foreign wars.
Admittedly, some of Spain's misery stemmed from an unparalleled combination of extreme weather and plague in the 1590s and again in the mid-seventeenth century, but the central government intensified these natural disasters with their disastrous policy choices. Philip IV argued that war, not peace, had become the norm in international relations: "With as many kingdoms and lordships as have been linked to this crown it is impossible to be without war in some area, either to defend what we have acquired or to divert our enemies."

In 1650, an English statesman in Madrid marveled at the capacity of Spain's leaders for such self-deception. They were, he wrote, "a wretched, miserable, proud, senseless people and as far from the wise men I expected as can be imagined; and if some miracle do not preserve them, this crown must be speedily destroyed." A generation later, one of Charles II's ministers made the same point: "I fear deeply for Italy; I am very worried about Catalonia; and I never forget about America, where the French already have too many colonies. We cannot govern by miracles forever."

A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783
For centuries after the Norman Conquest, England and France fought intermittent contests for feudal precedence and dynastic honor. As a result of the Reformation in the sixteenth century, Anglo-French antagonisms also incorporated a religious component. Both issues figured alongside nascent ethno-nationalism as the two states resuscitated their rivalry from the late seventeenth century onward, especially in the spheres of commerce and state finance. Their competition extended beyond Europe, from attacks on vital territories and institutions to allies, colonies, markets, and spheres of influence around the globe.
During the eighteenth century, competition for trade and colonies merged with ambitious political experiments. French Absolutism peaked and secured a frontier on the Rhine, while a new balance between Crown and Parliament united Britain as never before. Mercantile competition abroad extended from the Baltic to the Levant, all the way to the coasts of China; the frontiers of trade, influence, and settled colonies at least abutted if they did not overlap in North America and the Caribbean, West Africa, and India. Finally, in the abstract, political economists on both sides of the Channel seem to have held at least three assumptions more-or-less in common, that would bring their states into a series of expensive and disastrous wars:
• that "peaceful" trade was an element of international competition;
• that war was a natural outgrowth of the contest for foreign markets;
• that a gain for one state ipso facto represented a loss for the other.
Peace, in other words, was often merely conceived as a breathing space between armed conflicts. Even in times of notional peace, it was still the normal course of Anglo-French relations to see manipulations of third parties and foreign markets in favor of one state or the other, as well as proxy wars and closing colonial frontiers in far regions of the globe.
The Anglo-French rivalry from about 1658 to 1783 was colored by its predecessors dating back several centuries. Popular memory of older dynastic struggles and religious wars shaped the origins of what became a global competition for trade and empire. It was therefore not merely a "rational" contest for colonies and foreign markets influenced by the 8-1
A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 thinking of the Enlightenment. Memory and mythmaking on both sides also made it into a quasi-nationalist struggle, with propaganda and voluntary societies inspiring popular clamors for a larger historical reckoning.
Dynastic issues formed a key feature of Anglo-French relations for centuries after the Norman conquest. Whereas William I (r.1066-87) overhauled England's succession after his invasion from the French province of Normandy, England's King Henry II ( r. 1154-89) through inheritance (Anjou) and marriage to Eleanor (Aquitaine) claimed large parts of France. The medieval rivalry peaked with the Hundred Years' War (1327-1453), but dynastic meddling continued into the early modern period. As kings in the Stuart line (after 1603) tried to claim more power at home, they received sympathy and some political support from fellow absolutists in France. After 1688, however, Parliament's ascendancy and the effective political balance under the early Hanoverians inspired French as well as British ideas on constitutional monarchy, financial innovation, and popular sovereignty.
In addition to their history of dynastic rivalry, by the end of the sixteenth century, England and France also emerged on opposite sides of the Protestant Reformation. As the inheritors of religious reform under Henry VIII and his daughter Elizabeth, the people and especially the Parliament of England supported the Protestant cause across Western Europe. Henri of Navarre received English support for championing the Huguenot (French Protestant) cause during the French Wars of Religion (1562-98); but as he grasped, in the end, that kingship of France depended on his being Catholic, he converted in 1593. 
1
English popular sentiment, meanwhile-fired not least by the Gunpowder Plot in 1605-was violently anti-Catholic. Notwithstanding the Duke of Buckingham's intrigues, the mass of English opinion favored Huguenot rebels in the 1620s; and as the Popish Plot 2 unfolded in 1679-81, English ire turned toward France as well as Rome. Louis XIV had his own suspicions of Protestant plotting, and instituted a policy of intimidation known as dragonnades, peaking in 1685 with the Edict of Fontainebleau.

Neither dynastic nor religious motives, however, predicted a rivalry between France and England that would be either enduring or strategic. Rather, during a time of relative weakness when both powers struggled through domestic turmoil-the Wars of Religion (1562-98) and later the Wars of the Fronde (1648-53) in France, and the Civil War and Lord Protectorate in England (1642-60)-they played a relatively passive witness to the period's major conflict: the Eighty Years' War (1568-1648). The long struggle for Dutch independence pitted their mercantile fleets and dominance of the international carrying trade 4 against the resources of Spain's vast American empire. Political economists in Lon-
A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 don and Paris soon saw the quest for power and dynastic glory operating in parallel with resource extraction from overseas empires (Spanish) and trade ascendancy in Europe (Dutch). From the latter half of the seventeenth century, Bourbon heirs to Henri IV sought to extend the dynasty's influence, not only eastward to frontiers on the Rhine and in the Netherlands, but also southward-toward family ties and expanded trade with Spain and its American empire. English leaders, meanwhile, saw in the Dutch not only a long-time ally on religious grounds, but also a sometime-competitor for European trade, as well as a model to follow for overseas commerce and government finance.
Spain and the Dutch held dominant international positions for much of the seventeenth century, informing relative peace between France and England. As the latter two countries built their own American empires, however, and as their trade and influence expanded in Europe, their relationship also changed. The expansion of French territory, commerce, military force, and diplomatic prestige all posed threats in the English mindthreats echoed across the Atlantic by French claims on the Mississippi watershed, notionally pinning England's colonies against the Atlantic coast.

The Battle of Fleurus signaled a shift in French operations from the Rhine to the Low Countries. Louis was primarily concerned about dynastic glory for his son, Louis the Grand Dauphin, fighting against the Austrians on the Rhine, but the victory at Fleurus began to shift the main theatre of operations to the Spanish (later Austrian) Netherlands, and the capture of Mons, Huy, Namur, and Charleroi by 1693 not only added territory to France's frontiers but also luster to Louis' crown. The Netherlands campaigns compelled William III as Stadthouter to return from Britain and defend his Dutch territories, losing battles at Steenkirk (1692) and Landen (1693). His military presence in the Netherlands campaigns enhanced his prestige, however, and his involvement of British troops-and especially British money, following Dutch-backed financial reforms-both increased his diplomatic influence and whetted the British appetite for deeper involvement on the continent.
The British part in the Anglo-Dutch union emerges more clearly, however, from naval operations in 1690, in the Irish Sea and especially the Channel. William's invasion in 1688 was "permitted" in a sense by a weak English fleet and James II trying to appear "English" by refusing French help. After a brief exile in France from December 1688 to March 1689, James sought to continue the struggle in Ireland, this time supported by French troops and money. By June 1690, William staged his own Irish campaign with 300 ships and 36,000 troops. His victory at the Boyne, outside Dublin, was not in itself sufficient to win the larger war in Ireland, but it caused James to return to France-this time for good. In England, the public increasingly began to identify James as a French puppet, and to contrast his drive for religious uniformity and dynastic glory with their values-which they shared in common with William's Dutch-of commercial dominance and political liberty.
The next major action in July 1690, at Beachy Head, acted to highlight this difference. Admiral Anne Hilarion Comte de Tourville defeated an Anglo-Dutch 11 fleet and briefly seized command of the Channel, though he was unable to exploit this success. The panic he caused in England, however, prompted not just a lot of pamphlet writing, but also a vast expansion of the Royal Navy. The Bank of England (proposed 1691, est. 1694) was one of many joint-stock ventures that emerged to serve the navy's growing funding needs, and at least a few Dutch investors transferred assets to London.

A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 tempt to restore James II. Though Tourville won another battle off Lagos (Portugal) in 1693, the abortive English raids on Brest and St. Malo in 1694 offer the best insights into the emerging Anglo-French rivalry: (1) that the Royal Navy was no longer merely a defense force for the British Isles, but was emerging instead as the primary means for projecting English power; and (2) that the naval balance between France and England as a whole was undergoing what proved to be a dramatic, long-term shift in favor of the latter.
The shift, however, came on the French side as well as the English. Before his death in 1683, Jean-Baptiste Colbert led a fiscal and economic transformation in France, with high tariffs and regulated industry making it one of the richest countries in Europe. Subsequent military expansion and reforms under Michel le Tellier and his son the Marquis de Louvois enabled France to field over 400,000 troops by the early 1690s. William and Leopold formed the League of Augsburg-titled the Grand Alliance as Spain and Britain joined at the end of the 1680s-in order to contain this power, and they gained enormously from turns of fate far away from the battlefield. Louvois' unexpected death in 1691 and a major crop failure in 1693 harmed Louis' finances, forcing him to choose by 1695 between army and naval priorities. Unable to keep up the arms race with England, France maintained a respectable fleet but largely abandoned the guerre d'escadre philosophy of fleetto-fleet combat. Seeking to save money from his naval budget, Louis turned instead to guerre de course, or commerce raiding, based largely on privateers.
Two other actions in 1690 merit at least a passing mention for their legacy in the Anglo-French rivalry: the French-Canadian raid on Schenectady, New York, and the English colonial raid on New France's capital city, Québec. Both were part of a much larger conflict known in English colonial memory as King William's War. As the first major confrontation between English and French colonists and their respective Amerindian allies, it set a new standard of violence between North American rivals from previous colonial wars. Whereas the Dutch were quick to seize New Sweden in 1655, and the English took New Netherlands (New York) in a single campaign in 1664, the Anglo-French contest around Hudson Bay, in the Hudson-Champlain corridor, and in the waterways around Nova Scotia occurred on a scale as yet unknown in North America. Moreover, native allies on both sides brought their distinctive way of war into the Anglo-French contest, and the long-term costs during the eighteenth century included a proliferation of expensive strategic outposts and thousands of civilians killed or taken captive. 
13
A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 have continued the war beyond 1697, but the English and Dutch commercial publics had also grown tired of financing their allies, and joined France in forcing Europe to peace. The resulting Treaty of Ryswick appeared as a draw between France and the allies, but the onset of peace obscured the larger reality of an emerging Anglo-French rivalry.
That reality became clear only five years later, as Louis XIV entered the last contest of his reign: the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-14). The king and his new Spanish allies-under his grandson, Philip V-sought once again to extend Bourbon hegemony on the Continent. Though Philip managed to keep his throne against the Habsburg claimant, the future Charles VI of Austria, the real war was against Britain, and it was ultimately a losing effort. British and Dutch finances again sustained a larger, mostly Austrian war effort on the Continent, but it was British troops under John Churchill First Duke of Marlborough that most frustrated French ambitions by land. Meanwhile, British operations by sea extended much farther around the European continent and across the Atlantic Ocean, exposing French and Spanish vulnerabilities on a vast geographical scale.
From the start, English colonies joined the mother country in pursuing an extremely aggressive war. As Britain's bulwark in the American South, Charles Town met a Franco-Spanish besieging force in 1706 with well-prepared militia and its own small flotilla. As a center for commerce and diplomacy in the backcountry, however-including a notorious Amerindian slave trade 
14
Meanwhile the Royal Navy extended its sphere of operations far beyond its range in the 1690s. English forces led operations around the Iberian peninsula, taking Gibraltar in 1704 and Barcelona in 1705. British ships also featured in Prince Eugene of Savoy's 1707 campaign against Toulon (southern France), and in the capture of Minorca in 1708. 
15
16
Led by Marlborough and supported not least by a Tory-Whig coalition under Sidney Godolphin First Earl of Godolphin, the British army also began to make its reputation on the continent of Europe. 
18
Marlborough's recall was the product of Tory ascendancy after a landslide election victory in 1710. Benefiting from a domestic freedom-of-speech scandal, but focused mostly on the war's cost to British taxpayers, Robert Harley's Tory government quickly removed roadblocks to peace and negotiated the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht with France and Spain. The British withdrawal from the war forced their Austrian allies to come to peace at Rastatt in 1714. Austria gained the Netherlands (most of modern Belgium), the Milanese, Naples, and Sardinia,

The Treaty of Utrecht and its corollaries were mostly a compromise peace, including the revocation of Habsburg claims to the Spanish throne, and British and French promises to adjust some of their outstanding colonial issues by committee rather than open combat. Nonetheless, Britain emerged as a clear winner, not least as a result of dominance at sea. Emerging trade and influence in the Baltic and Mediterranean entailed their share of naval expenses for Britain, informing at least a temporary policy of peace. At the same time, France needed space after Louis XIV's death for fiscal reform and economic renewal. Both sides also faced dynastic and religious challenges, yet differing norms of peacetime trade and colonization around the globe showcased as well as any military campaign that Britain and France-even in their period of formal alliance (1716-31)-remained strategic rivals.
Dynastic issues came immediately to the fore after Utrecht, with the deaths of Queen Anne in 1714 and Louis XIV in 1715. In Britain, new elections accompanied the accession of the Hanoverian King George I, and the Whigs won a large victory in part because of the 8-7
Tories' financial mismanagement. The Whigs' anti-Catholic and anti-monarchist sentiments, joined with a drive for greater continental engagement, sparked a Jacobite rising in 1715. Meanwhile, the death of Louis XIV-with a five-year-old Louis XV as heir-left France until 1723 under a regency council headed by Philippe II duc d'Orleans. In both countries, therefore, dynastic insecurity seemed to put the rivalry on hold, and prompted a formal reconciliation from 1716 to the mid-1720s.
Financial considerations also played a role, as both sides sought to enlarge public ownership of government debt. In France, liberalization of Louis XIV's tax regime combined with John Law's involvement in the Banque Royale-a French lending institution backed by the Crown-and the emerging Compagnie des Indes, with interests ranging from Louisiana to the Indian Ocean. 
21
Financial speculation occurred in part as British and French governments sought to recover from wartime debts, yet a pacific partnership in Europe did little to obscure their continuing rivalry overseas. About two percent of all French expenditures after 1716 went to the fort of Louisbourg on Île Royale, guarding French claims to the Newfoundland fisheries-a vital nursery for seamen-and approaches to the St. Lawrence waterway. 
22

24
Britain's recovery came primarily in the forms of retrenchment, financial innovation, and a bit of gunboat diplomacy. As Britain remained mostly free of European wars during Robert Walpole's ministry (1721-42), it was able to focus instead on economic growth. 
25
France's equivalent to Walpole was Cardinal Andre-Hercule de Fleury, former tutor to Louis XV, who came to political power in his own right in 1726. Like Walpole, he was a 8-8
A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 noted pacifist, though far more skilled in international relations. 
26
By the 1730s, the contrast between Fleury's energy and Walpole's steady hand led many Britons to question the latter's overall strategy. A resurgent Spain forced the pace of European diplomacy at the time, with its ambitions in Italy and violent guarda costas trying to keep a check on British smuggling. Walpole's early gunboat diplomacy succeeded most notably when he sent 28 warships to Lisbon in 1735 to defuse a diplomatic crisis between Portugal and Spain. It also had failures, however, such as an observation fleet in the Caribbean in 1726 that triggered the war it was intended to prevent (against Spain). Although the navy successfully relieved Gibraltar from a Spanish siege in 1727, the overall trend of Walpole's diplomacy tended against British overuse of the military as an instrument of international influence. At the same time, an emerging opposition party 
27
France also had a role to play in perceptions of British decline: Fleury sought indeed to wean his state from its British ties, starting with clever mediation between Britain and Spain at the Congress of Soissons (1728-29): his foot-dragging in the peace negotiation, and impassiveness as Britain and Prussia had a war scare in 1730, signaled a new direction in French foreign policy. Walpole's withdrawal from the dying alliance-the 1731 Treaty of Vienna-appeared for a moment to isolate France, but in fact it laid grounds for the First Family Compact in 1733. This was to be the first of three Franco-Spanish treaties through the rest of the eighteenth century, largely securing the union of interests between the two Bourbon crowns. The Anglo-Austrian alliance was not nearly so perfect, and it soon took second place behind an Austro-Russo-Prussian union in 1732, targeting the Polish crown. In effect, Fleury left the British tie for a Spanish one. While he sacrificed the ambition of Louis XV's father-in-law, Stanislaus Leszczynski, to regain the crown of Poland, his clever diplomacy and Bourbon arms gained the Crown of Naples for Spain and reversionary rights for Lorraine to France, all while keeping Britain in near-helpless isolation. 
28
By partaking in the flota-Spain's official trade with its American colonies-France was also destined to oppose British privileges under the Assiento-trade concessions granted by Spain through the Treaty of Utrecht. The arrangements were imperfect, however, leaving the British short on their expected profits from trade with Spanish America. While French vessels in the flota were licensed at some cost, peacetime trade enabled them to cross the ocean without fear, and thus bring home the fruits of the Spanish trade. France also profited from a growing commerce in West Indian sugar-especially from Martinique and Guadeloupe-though the scale of operations soon prompted French colonization on the fringes of legality, on the islands of St. Lucia and Dominica.

Proper Anglo-French hostilities soon began in earnest, spreading to North America and the Caribbean in 1744, and to the Indian Ocean by 1745. Britain was notable alongside the Dutch for financial contributions to the allied cause in Europe, and for naval exploits that included the capture of Louisbourg in 1745-46 and victories at Cape Finisterre (1747, 8-10 A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 1748) that effectively ended French trade with the West Indies for the duration of the war. The French effort against Britain, by contrast, peaked with the Jacobite campaign of 1745-46-a near-run affair that caught Hanover-loyalists at a weak moment militarily, but ultimately ended with butchery at Culloden Moor and the effective end of the Jacobite threat. The rising itself inspired a second famous song from the period, "God Save the King," and French aid, though minimal in the event,

The high point of British hostility toward France occurred in the middle decades of the eighteenth century. Following the peace of Aix la Chapelle in 1748, both empires looked to their needs for defense, though British assertiveness also included attempts to build on paper one of the largest coalitions in European diplomatic history. French responses were uneven, weak and often confused, and the major attempt to press their land claims-in the Appalachian backcountry-formed the proximate cause of the Seven Years' War (1754-63). Defeat on an unprecedented scale, forced a revolutionary reassessment of French strategic priorities. At long last, about 75 years after the English public took on the strategic rivalry with France by accepting William III as king, ministers at Versailles led by the Duc de Choiseul realized that the dynastic glory of their traditional arch-rival, Austria, paled in the international arena next to the finance and sea power of their new great adversary, Britain.
After the fall of Robert Walpole in 1742, many of his old allies joined with members of the opposition to form new governments. The result by 1746 was a "broad bottom" coalition led by Thomas Pelham-Holles, First Duke of Newcastle. 
37
A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 a peace and trade agenda, while the younger began to see international relations in terms of strategic rivalry. A compulsive flatterer, Newcastle's obsequiousness often made him appear to foreign diplomats as a champion of peace; but beyond wanting to please people of all parties in domestic politics, his deep suspicions of France-evident as early as the 1720s-made him much easier to manipulate than Walpole had been, in favor of more belligerent policies.
On the other side of the Channel, a cohort of French intellectuals began to glimpse from Fleury's policies the kernel of a new economic policy: laissez-faire. The idea may come from the Dutch notion of "free ships, free goods," 
38
Caution about Britain was evident in the approach toward India, where Governor-General Joseph François Dupleix had enjoyed a modicum of success in the later 1740s. He took the British base at Madras in 1746, and though it was exchanged for Louisbourg at Aix la Chapelle in 1748, the French East India Company still held a strong position. Dupleix used Company forces in 1749 to help a local ally's bid for power, and the extent of his success provoked new hostilities with the British East India Company. 
39
"Peace" as such was equally fragile in North America. Here, British initiatives clearly came first-some of them apparently designed to upset regional power balances. By 1748, a trading post at Pickawillany (near modern Dayton, Ohio) threatened to advance British claims over much of present-day Ohio and Indiana through their Miami and Wyandot allies. Meanwhile, British ministers literally advertised their ambitions on Nova Scotia, using the London Gazette to call for discharged soldiers willing to settle at Chebucto-soon renamed Halifax in honor of the President of the Board of Trade.

43
A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 Allied to these formal French measures were what might be called the commercial intrigues of Canada's Intendant (roughly chief financial officer) François Bigot, the court financiers Jean Paris Montmartel and Joseph Paris Duverney, and Canada merchants from France's western littoral. 
44
British opposition to France is evident from Newcastle's foreign policy almost from the moment peace was signed in 1748. He considered almost immediately an opportunity to steal away Prussia, France's strongest ally in Central Europe, and his diplomacy in the Northern Crisis of 1749-50 forced France to pay peacetime subsidies to retain its standing in Sweden and Denmark. Newcastle also advanced the Imperial Election Plan in 1750-a project using British and Dutch funds to tie German Electors more closely to Austria-and by 1754-55 he was close to uniting all of these with Russian interests in Eastern Europe. Such a result would contain France's allies, Sweden and Prussia, while freeing Austrian and Dutch troops to defend their (or rather, British) interests on France's frontiers. British envoys also worked behind the scenes for the 1752 Treaty of Aranjuez, securing peace in Southern Europe and removing Spain and Sardinia from the French orbit. In short, aggressive British diplomacy on paper all but isolated France by 1754-55, just as French moves in the colonial world piqued British imperial sensitivities.
Through the early 1750s, the "peace" party in Britain subsisted mainly on economic arguments. Henry Pelham-as First Lord of the Treasury, Chancellor of the Exchequer, and Newcastle's brother-opposed the latter's ideas on peacetime subsidies to Britain's allies, and hoped to mediate disputes (Sweden v. Russia in 1749-50, Prussia v. Hanover in 1752-53) rather than go to war. His death in March 1754 removed a major block on Newcastle's natural suspicions of France. Though Newcastle-now First Lord in his own right-still supported peace for financial reasons, he was more willing to let military and imperialist interests shape the British response to reports of French aggression. By 1753, the British diplomatic record is littered with protests about French actions in India, the Caribbean and North America, and with secret missives to British envoys to tarnish France's image in the courts of Europe. Though Newcastle may have wanted to escalate hostilities short of open war, cabinet intrigues in 1754-55 forced his hand:

A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 Byng failing to relieve Minorca in 1756, and French supply ships for Canada and the Caribbean escaped the blockade 1756 and 1757. Thereafter, there were few interruptions to Britain's voyage to global naval dominance. In 1757, amphibious operations on the French coast met indifferent success, but their lessons benefited later operations, including Gorée and St. Louis (West Africa, 1758), Guadeloupe (West Indies, 1759), and Belle Isle off the coast of France in 1761. The navy also acted decisively at Louisbourg in 1758 and Québec in 1759-the latter being notable not just for the iconic battle of the Plains of Abraham, but also for bringing advanced British surveying techniques to the St. Lawrence River. The Royal Navy also beat off an invasion scare in 1759, destroying French combat power at Lagos and Quiberon Bay, and the campaign of 1761-62 saw the captures of Dominica, Martinique, and, once Spain entered the war, Havana and Manila. Quick and regular resupply to East India Company forces also proved decisive after 1757, with Robert Clive and Eyre Coote combining by 1761 to establish British supremacy (vis-à-vis France, at least) in both Bengal and the Carnatic. In sum, the Royal Navy was not just big (peaking around 85,000 sailors on more than 300 ships of all types), but it struck early-setting the French at an initial disadvantage-struck hard, and, often while its enemies were offbalance, learned quickly from mistakes and improved its efficiency at working with the army for amphibious operations.

Following the rhetoric of William Pitt the Elder-Newcastle's partner in leading the British war effort after June 1757-historians have often argued that British victory in the Seven Years' War depended on soaking up French resources in Europe. In fact, French ef-8-14
A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 forts had their share of setbacks, for example retreating across most of Germany in 1757 after the defeat against the Prussians at Rossbach. Worse, their Austrian ally suffered an equally disastrous defeat at Leuthen a month later. In theory, France, Austria and their Russian allies-even smaller allies such as Saxony and Bavaria-could replace their losses in far greater numbers than could Hanover, Prussia, and a small collection of allies in northcentral Germany, but losses at sea and in Canada in particular damaged the French economy to a point where replacing losses became exceedingly difficult. It is unclear whether British leaders recognized North America as a linchpin for all of France's war efforts, but their victories, beyond mere conquests, also throttled the credit on investments in the Canada trade. These same investments supported the overall structure of French wartime finance, so their loss meant severe damage to France's ability to keep their own and their allies' armies in the field. One statistical example is the proportion of the Austrian war budget covered by French finances-34 percent in 1758, but less than 10 percent by 1760. A fair part of the German war, it seems, was won in America.
The high tide of British antagonism and military efficacy against France coincided with peak naval performance and overwhelming commitment to colonial theatres. This was all made possible by the maturation of the financial revolution, which began with the formation of the Bank of England in 1694. As a result of the Bank's lending against a welldeveloped sinking fund and other confidence building measures, interest rates on British government loans remained around 3 to 4% for the duration of the war. By comparison, the French government by 1761 attempted to float a loan on an English bank at 11.5% interest. British patriotism was equally vital, with a lively pamphlet and ballad culture joining with Pitt's rousing speeches and the prominent place of Antigallican social clubs. Overwhelming British success in the Seven Years' War reflected the endeavors of the entire societynot just its sharp military edge.
Catastrophic defeat in the Seven Years' War prompted major reforms in the French regime-even before the opening of peace negotiations. Gournay and his circle were mostly correct in their assessment that a strong economy was the foundation of imperial power and prestige, and that colonial holdings could support a stronger presence in Europe. Free trade and broad public access to banking and stock markets were also important for giving the larger population some sense of ownership in the war effort-something Adam Smith would remark in his Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (London, 1776). The major French error, though, lay in awakening the British giant far too early. When war erupted in 1754-56, France was still in a state of unpreparedness in both Europe and the colonial world, and utterly surprised by the scale of the British response.
France was relatively lucky that Newcastle's diplomatic schemes collapsed in 1756, leaving them allies with whom to try to win in Europe. France's army, navy and finances
A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 were, however, nowhere near being able to support their allies' demands.

The Memoire Raisonné was also a first signal in French foreign policy that something fundamental had shifted-at least at Versailles. The Franco-Austrian alliance of 1756 was a major aberration from French foreign policy norms, as was the Russian tie concluded in 1757. These powers were regarded as France's traditional enemies, and the general populace of France still needed convincing that Britain was the main enemy. Diplomatic documents that "proved" British bullying in the Atlantic world played into that agenda. So too did the Affaire du Canada in 1761 and the Kourou and Malouines expeditions of 1763-64. These were disasters of epic proportions, involving bankruptcy of the French Marine and fifty high-level prosecutions in the former case, and tens of thousands of colonists' deaths in the latter, off the coasts of South America. But they turned the attention of the French public toward the Atlantic, where France only had one major adversary: Britain. British methods of trying to pay down their war debt feature prominently in the background to the American War of Independence. The Stamp Act, Sugar Act, Townshend Acts and many more sought to integrate the British colonies more closely into the tax structures and political life of the United Kingdom, but communications by sea were still too slow to make this a practical possibility. Choiseul opened channels for smuggling French arms into the colonies. His revanchist agenda failed in 1770, as British colonists still refused to rebel on a large scale after the Boston Massacre, and later in the year they more-or-less supported the British government's position in the Falklands crisis with Spain. Avenues of French support remained open, however, at the time of the Gaspée Affair in 1772, the Boston Tea Party in 1773, and the Coercive Acts in 1774.

A Contest for Trade and Empire: England v. France, 1658-1783 tition of Poland (1772), but it was well positioned to continue tarnishing Britain's reputation in Europe, and to prevent Lord North's diplomats from regaining a diplomatic foothold. As the American War of Independence approached, isolation would be anything but pleasant for a Britain that lay at the mercy of France's traditional gifts: a concern with dynastic honor that resonated among many European monarchs, and subtle, rational diplomacy that portrayed a humbled France as a better ally than an overbearing, arrogant, perfidious Albion.
By the late 1770s, Anglo-American nationalism was possibly one of the most dynamic political forces in the Atlantic world, but its French and Spanish complements followed close behind, ironically inspired by the British model. French finance was, if not in brilliant shape, at least substantially reformed from the shambles that declared bankruptcy in 1759. And notwithstanding George Washington's brilliance as a general, keeping the Continental Army intact and ultimately enlarging it during hard campaigns along the eastern seaboard, the largest land campaign of the American War of Independence was the Spanish reconquest of Florida in 1779-82. By 1781, Britain was engaged in a global war against the Americans, French, Spanish and Dutch, isolated in Europe and even threatened in India by the emerging state of Mysore. Changing fortunes by 1782-83 helped to bring the war to a close, but there was little denying the scale of the defeat: in 1783 alone, the London street played host to at least six editions of the bitterly satirical Advice to the Officers of the British Army. In sum, when France and her Spanish ally recognized Britain as their major nemesis and fully engaged in the strategic rivalry, the same British state that had overmatched France and achieved overwhelming victory in the Seven Years' War was humbled in its turn.
In the decades before 1688, England made a revolutionary transition not just from a Dutch rivalry to a French one, but also from a political identity based on its religion and monarchy to one that-while still incorporating these elements-focused much more on the navy and international commerce. Built up initially by Dutch investments and financial knowhow, England turned itself into a worthy rival for a France whose internal wealth had grown considerably under Cardinal Richelieu, Cardinal Mazarin, Colbert, and Louvois. Despite having only one-third of the population, far fewer resources, and less-welldeveloped internal communications than France, Britain greatly benefited from much more sophisticated financial systems, supporting a huge fleet and large subsidies for Continental allies. By 1748, British superiority was clear enough to prompt a major shift in French strategic thinking, marked by the rise of the Gournay circle and ambitious projects in several colonial theatres. The pace of these reforms was too slow to be effective, yet fast enough to pique British ire and lead to catastrophic French defeat in the Seven Years' War. After 1763, political turmoil in London made peace a vital interest for the British, while Choiseul turned France away from its former dynastic concerns on the continent to concentrate more fully on its major financial and strategic rival.

Party was a response to British legislation in favor of the East India Company. Fed up with these petty acts of resistance, Parliament by 1774 simply resolved to force the colonists into a subordinate political position visà-vis the mother country. In Britain these measures were known as the Coercive Acts; the colonists called them the Intolerable Acts.
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815)
Dr. Michael V. Leggiere
The rivalry between France and Great Britain during the French Wars (1792-1815) often has been characterized as the dichotomy of the elephant vs. the whale or the tiger vs. the shark. As it stood, the shark could not defeat the tiger on land and the tiger could not defeat the shark in the water: neither could defeat the other without the extensive assistance of allies. Britain owed its position as a European Great Power to its maritime economic strategy while France emerged as the dominant, predatory military power of Europe. That France achieved this status is the result of many factors released by its post-revolutionary dynamism, but are beyond the scope of this study. However, strategy ranks as one of the crucial elements in France's hegemonic success as well as in Britain's multifaceted efforts to defeat its great rival during this short period.
Starting in the mid-seventeenth century, maritime economic competition gradually eclipsed issues of religion, political systems, and universal monarchy in the Anglo-French rivalry. In their place arose an exponentially increasing competition for markets, colonies, and resources in North America, the Caribbean, and India. As a mercantilist power, Britain's maritime security remained irrevocably intertwined with its national security, as revenue from international trade and commerce determined the state's power both at home and abroad. Thus, Britain's strength depended on its merchants' ability to trade across the world's oceans. A large part of this trade was with Continental markets, making Europe a key component of Britain's maritime economic strategy, because successful British trade depended on a European balance of power. Any challenge to European stability threatened British maritime security and thus Britain's power. London responded to such threats by intervening directly. Specifically, the British considered three areas of Europe vital as interdependent maritime strategic interests: 1) the Low Countries, 2) the Mediterranean, and 3) the Baltic. These three strategic spheres enabled Britain to maintain its Great Power status and influence in Europe. 
1
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) hand to pursue a maritime strategy based on building a global colonial empire without depleting undo resources in grinding land campaigns. From 1793 to 1807, Britain competed with France within the framework of this maritime economic strategy. As such, it pursued a dual policy of 1) committing its own forces to strangle French maritime trade and harass the French in secondary theaters to drain French military strength, and 2) funding allied states to oppose France.
For much of the eighteenth century, France also pursued a maritime economic policy aimed at competing with Britain, while simultaneously pursuing a Continental strategy to likewise maintain its Great Power status and influence in Europe. Yet French interests and commitments as a Continental Power consumed resources on such a vast scale that it limited France's capacity to pursue a maritime strategy competitive with Britain's global reach. Due to its Continental policy, France exerted greater influence in Europe but Britain dominated the seas and thus international trade. By the mid-eighteenth century, the decline of traditional European powers such as Portugal, Spain, the Dutch Republic, and the Holy Roman Empire resulted in the dominance of both Britain and France in their respective spheres. Though both could exert some influence in the other's sphere, neither could dominate the other: Britain could not replace France as the main power on the European Continent and France could not surpass Britain's maritime economic supremacy. Regardless, the competition increased as the British remained active in Continental affairs while the French pursued a dual maritime and Continental strategy. Although one could not be sacrificed for the other, success depended allocating finite resources prudently.
Between 1783 and 1792, London's advantages in taxation, administration, and finance benefitted Britain in its rivalry with the French, whose feudal foundations could not support the needs of the modern state. Throughout their rivalry, British financial systems proved far superior, more rational, and less fragile, thus providing for a more stable government. Although the American Revolutionary War had financially exhausted both states, France's systemic financial weakness led to the government's bankruptcy three years after the Peace of Paris while Britain's finance rapidly recovered. An absolutist political system provided the French one dubious advantage that the British government did not enjoy. Beyond the intrigues of the Bourbon court, French policy makers did not have to manage Parliament, popular opinion, and public diplomacy. Conversely, the British government perpetually faced the loss of agency due to the inability to secure formal and informal domestic support. Parliamentary opposition that combined with public outcry always had the potential to uproot any sitting British ministry. Although the French king was answerable only to God, he bore all responsibility for the success and failure of the state. While this spared the Bourbons from having to answer to parliamentary opposition parties or public opinion, it placed all responsibility for the state's welfare squarely on the king's shoulders.

In terms of economic power and resources, the rivals remained on par despite the drastic reduction of France's colonial empire as a result of the losses sustained from the Seven Years' War. While the British pursued the Industrial Revolution, agriculture continued to reign in France, whose population of twenty-four million trebled Britain's eight million, and whose territorial extent of 675,000 square kilometers doubled Britain's 314,000 square kilometers. The rivals had comparable economic power and resources but growth trends in trade and industry favored the British. In geography, Britain's insular position provided London crucial advantages. Unlike France, Britain did not have to make the difficult choice between pursuing either a maritime or a Continental strategy, as its insular position provided the British greater security from direct attack. This, in turn, translated into far greater freedom of action in foreign affairs. Moreover, Britain's insular position enabled it to isolate its foreign policy from its domestic problems.

William Pitt the Younger took office as British prime minister in December 1783, undertaking the unenviable task of rebuilding Britain's economic, military, and diplomatic fortunes following defeat in the American Revolutionary War. Pitt guided Britain through its post-war economic revival by reestablishing strong commercial ties with the Americans and by concluding an advantageous trade agreement with France. The 1786 Eden Treaty brought the British closer to achieving their goal of establishing free trade between the two rivals. From the viewpoint of national security, the treaty also signaled France's inability to simultaneously continue its maritime rivalry with the British while maintaining its position
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) as a Continental power. Unable to recover from the financial morass created by the American Revolutionary War, France made commercial concessions-despite objections from its merchant and manufacturing lobbies-to its main rival in hope of slowing the financial race that the British were clearly winning. Britain's capacity to outspend France contributed to the collapse of the French state, similar to the fate of the Soviet Union during the Cold War with the United States.
In the last years of the 1780s, the British appeared well on their way to forming a Britishled European alliance system directed at France while the French writhed in the chaos of a revolution that left their dual maritime and Continental strategy in shambles. Essentially, the French withdrew from the international stage during the early years of the Revolution. Fortunately for Paris, the British did not use the opportunity to do more than continue to erode France's standing on the Continent from afar, as Britain, too, resorted to isolationism. With Parliament and popular opinion decidedly opposed to intervention on the Continent, caution and neutrality became the guiding principles of British foreign policy, just as revolutionary France returned to the international stage in response to Austrian saberrattling. Dynastic ties between the monarchs of France and Austria made the safety of the French royal family in the midst of an increasingly volatile revolution a matter of Austrian prestige and honor. The radicalization of the French Revolution inflamed the growing crisis and led to a 20 April 1792 French declaration of war on Austria, which Prussia immediately sided with, thus igniting the War of the First Coalition (1792-97).
For Britain, the security of the Netherlands became its primary foreign policy concern when war erupted. Austro-Prussian retreats in October 1792 resulted in French advances on all fronts, including an invasion of Belgium in November. After a resounding French victory, Austrian forces evacuated Belgium, leaving nothing between the French army and the Dutch border. On 16 November 1792, Paris declared the Scheldt River open to navigation for the first time in more than 200 years and asserted the right of French armies to pursue the Austrians into neutral territory. These claims violated Dutch sovereignty and annulled prior international treaties. A decree of 19 November declaring France's intention to support revolutionaries abroad caused even greater concern in London by posing a direct threat to the British crown and government. Concurrently, French ground forces received orders to pursue the Austrians into Dutch territory and a French warship sailed for the Scheldt. Consequently, French aggression in the Low Countries brought the British into the War of the First Coalition against Revolutionary France in 1793 rather than any ideological motive related to the fate of the French monarchy. Nevertheless, the Tory party that controlled the British government harbored no love for French republicanism. Thus, regime change became a major British objective in the French Wars.
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815)
France declared war against Britain and the Netherlands on 1 February 1793 and soon afterwards against Spain. In the course of 1793, the Holy Roman Empire, Sardinia, Portugal, Naples, and Tuscany declared war against France. Successful combined operations by the British, Austrians, Prussians, and Dutch drove the French from Belgium in 1793 and opened the road to Paris, but an offensive never materialized due to the lack of cooperation between the Allies. Meanwhile, the Royal Navy attacked French colonies in the West Indies. As with previous conflicts, France found itself in the highly disadvantageous position of having to wage war on the high seas against its superior archrival while French armies contended with a formidable alliance on the European continent.
Looking at the situation from the British perspective, London again could allocate almost all of the state's resources to its maritime economic strategy while sending only a token expeditionary force to join its allies fighting the French in Europe. Indeed this was fortunate, for, at the time, the British lacked the manpower to both garrison their global empire and commit a large army to the Continent. For the defense of the Low Countries, the British landed token ground forces to augment the larger Austro-Prussian-Dutch armies. In the Mediterranean theater, London resorted to strong-arm diplomacy to force the Italian and Barbary States not only to end their trade with the French, particularly the export of wheat, but to also provide troops for the First Coalition. The Royal Navy played its part by blockading France's Atlantic and Mediterranean coasts so as to comprehensively strangle French and neutral trade to hasten the war's end.
Although the British garnered mixed results from their diplomatic offensive in the Mediterranean, the Royal Navy crippled France in the first two years of the war. After French royalists opposed to the republican government in Paris gained control of the city of Toulon, which served as home port for the French Mediterranean Fleet, an Anglo-Spanish fleet landed a small multinational occupation force on 28 August 1793. The loss of this port and its twenty-nine ships of the line crippled France's ability to project naval power in the Mediterranean. French ground forces recaptured the port on 18 December 1793, but not before the British sunk fourteen French ships of the line and sailed off with the other fifteen.
A little more than six months later, the first and largest fleet action of the naval conflict between Britain and the French Republic took place on 1 June 1794. Known as the Glorious First of June, the battle was a tactical victory for the British that cost the French Atlantic Fleet seven ships of the line. Coupled with the loss of the Toulon Fleet the year before, the Glorious First of June devastated France's ability to continue its maritime economic rivalry with the British. By default, the British were now free to conduct a campaign of blockade for the remainder of the war. Although single French ships and small squadrons pursued an active war against the British, any attempt to challenge the British control of the seas was impossible

Like previous Anglo-French conflicts extending back to the seventeenth century, Britain's maritime triumph should have led to France's defeat. However, France avoided this fate by temporarily abandoning its dual policy and concentrating on Continental hegemony. France's bloody transformation from a constitutional monarchy to a republic had unleashed nationalistic impulses that allowed the French to turn the tide against the Coalition's land forces. By the end of 1795, French armies controlled the Low Countries and forced the British to withdraw their forces from the Continent; only Austria remained Britain's ally. Despite these setbacks, the British continued their traditional wartime policy of pursuing a maritime strategy while financing an ally to restore the balance of power on the Continent. After the British recalled their Mediterranean fleet in 1796, they only supported the Austrians by granting Vienna a considerable subsidy. While the Austrians fought the French in the Rhineland and northern Italy, the British helped themselves to the Dutch colonies at Ceylon and the Cape of Good Hope, but made minimal progress against France's colonies. Although not broken, the Austrians had had enough of an inconclusive and grinding war, and opted to negotiate with the French. A separate peace was concluded in 1797 that ended the War of the First Coalition.
Despite having no allies, Britain remained at war with France. Fortunately for the British, the French could not exploit an Irish insurrection against British rule in December 1796, nor could they take advantage of a mutiny by the Channel Fleet in April and May 1797. Nevertheless, the War of the First Coalition ended with France not only shattering Europe's balance of power, but with the French in possession of the Low Countries, whose ports they would control, and periodically threaten Britain from, for the next twenty years. As noted, the British considered three areas of Europe vital to their strategic interests: the Low Countries, the Mediterranean, and the Baltic. Of the three, the Low Countries served as Britain's major maritime interest. In them, maritime security and national security were interchangeable as the Dutch ports of Antwerp and Flushing offered the best positions from which a hostile power could launch an invasion of England. At Antwerp, the prevailing winds and currents provided easier access to the English Channel than did the French ports of Boulogne, Cherbourg, and Brest. Thus, a hostile power that controlled Antwerp posed a direct threat to Britain's control of the Channel as well as its North Atlantic trading routes; in short, much of Britain's maritime capability could be challenged from Antwerp. Control of Antwerp and Flushing also provided an enemy direct access to Essex, Kent, and the Thames estuary. Aside from the immediate problem of getting the French out of the Low Countries so as to end the threat to British maritime security, London needed long-term security against any hostile power gaining control of the Low Countries. Consequently, the issue of what political entity would replace France in the Low Countries loomed large in British diplomacy for the duration of the French Wars.
Although strategically less significant than the Low Countries, the British considered the Mediterranean vital for colonial defense. However, Spain allied with France and de-
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) clared war on Britain and Portugal in October 1796, rendering the British position in the Mediterranean untenable. The combined Franco-Spanish fleet of thirty-eight ships of the line outnumbered the British Mediterranean Fleet of fifteen ships of the line, forcing the British to evacuate their positions in first Corsica and then Elba. Thus, the British temporarily withdrew their fleet from the theater for operations around Gibraltar and Iberia. In the aftermath, the British watched the French conquer northern Italy and subjugate the rest of the Italian peninsular in 1797. They returned to the Mediterranean in 1798 too late to prevent the French from invading Egypt, at that time a fiefdom of the Ottoman Empire. Unbeknownst to London, the French planned to attack Britain's maritime supremacy by building a canal across the Isthmus of Suez that would alter world trade routes rather than launch a direct invasion of British-held India. Regardless, the Egyptian operation marked France's return as Britain's maritime economic rival. Although the British defeated a larger and more modern French fleet at the Battle of the Nile on 1 August 1798, the French remained in the Levant until 1801. This forced the British to divert resources from the main military responsibility of the Mediterranean theater: blockading the French port of Toulon. Moreover, maintaining the blockade of France's Mediterranean coast as well as Frenchcontrolled ports in Italy required friendly harbors to resupply and repair the warships on duty. To this end, the British took and retained control of Malta. Malta itself posed the problem of being unable to feed itself. Therefore, to feed Malta, the British secured Sicily, which eventually brought the shark face-to-face with the tiger in southern Italy. 3
Hatred of Revolutionary France along with the desire to pursue traditional foreign policy objectives led to the formation of the Second Coalition in 1798 consisting of Britain, Austria, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, and Naples. The war began with a powerful Austro-Russian surge that swept the French from Italy, while an Anglo-Russian expedition landed in Holland in late August 1799. However, as Russian forces approached the French border via Switzerland, a French army defeated them in the mountains of Zurich in late September 1799. As a result, after initial successes, the Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland stalled. Faced with early winter gales that made provisioning by sea difficult, the Allies agreed to an armistice with the French, which saw all troops re-embarked by 19 November 1799. Earlier that month, General Napoleon Bonaparte overthrew the French government. Before year's end, he outmaneuvered his fellow conspirators to make himself dictator of France under the title of First Consul.
As for the War of the Second Coalition, Russia not only withdrew from the alliance but by virtue of a rapprochement with Napoleon, Tsar Paul I formed the Second League of Armed Neutrality with Denmark, Prussia, and Sweden in 1800. Like the First League of Armed Neutrality during the American Revolutionary War, the Baltic states sought to protect neutral shipping against the Royal Navy's wartime policy of unlimited search for 9-7
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815)
French contraband and military supplies. One of Britain's three vital maritime strategic spheres, the British depended on an open and friendly Baltic to provide vital naval stores.

Forced to consider a war against both France and Russia, the British did the only thing they could. Rather than attempt to curry Russian goodwill, London believed that only a show of force would restore its position in the Baltic. Consequently, the Royal Navy attacked and destroyed part of the Danish fleet at Copenhagen on 2 April 1801. As a result, Denmark withdrew from the League, but the wheels for its demise already were turning. The assassination of Tsar Paul in March 1801 and the accession of the anti-French Alexander I led to a change of Russian policy and the League's collapse.
Britain's failure to defeat France after a nine-year struggle led to war weariness that, when combined with a row over Catholic Emancipation that saw the hawkish Pitt ousted in favor of a more conciliatory Addington administration, led to the March 1802 Anglo-French Treaty of Amiens. After attaining peace with Britain in 1802, Napoleon attempted to revive France's colonial empire in the Western Hemisphere. A bloody uprising on the French colony of Santo Domingo combined with deteriorating relations with Britain soon convinced Napoleon to abandon neo-colonialism; France's sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803 reflected this policy change. For the Anglo-French rivalry, the Louisiana Purchase suggests that Napoleon realized that France still could not pursue its traditional dual maritime and Continental strategy. Although Napoleonic France appeared to relinquish its maritime strategy, the damage done to British national security by Revolutionary France guaranteed the survival of the intense Anglo-French rivalry as long as Paris controlled the Low Countries and Italy. As Napoleon considered the Rhine, Alps, and Pyrenees to be the territorial gains of the Revolution that the French nation bequeathed to him for safe keeping, nothing short of total defeat would force him to yield them. In fact, much
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) like the Soviet Union after the Second World War, he would defend these "natural frontiers" by further expanding his borders.
Lasting only fourteen months, the Treaty of Amiens did not satisfy British concerns over the Low Countries, nor did Napoleon budge on the issue of granting a commercial agreement to restore friendly trading relations between the two states. Britain's refusal to evacuate Malta per the treaty combined with continued French expansionism brought on renewed war in May 1803. Fresh from dropping France's maritime strategy, Bonaparte concentrated all the resources of a much stronger France against a Britain that momentarily lacked Continental allies. To defeat the British, Napoleon planned to invade England and so undertook extensive preparations to build sea-worthy transports for his army. To counter this threat, the British constructed formidable coastal defenses and placed the country on a war footing. As British workers labored on fortifications, London sought allies.
With his navy ill-prepared to challenge the British for control of the English Channel and his plan to build landing barges progressing slowly, Napoleon repeatedly postponed the invasion of Britain. As he waited, he made the fateful decisions to crown himself Emperor of the French in 1804 and King of Italy in 1805. Such precipitate actions challenged the tenuous equilibrium established in Europe following the War of the Second Coalition. Thanks to Bonaparte's hubris, Russia and Austria responded favorably to British alliance overtures and Albion's generous funding offers to form the Third Coalition in 1805. Although Prussia remained neutral, the objectives of the alliance, which included a French withdrawal from the Low Countries, appeared to meet Britain's strategic needs.
To the shock of the British, Napoleon captured Vienna and crushed the Austro-Russian armies in less than four months. Austria again signed a separate peace and the Russians limped home. For all practical purposes, the Third Coalition was over; Prussia's forfeiture of neutrality to join the Coalition came too late. Moreover a British expedition that sailed to the Low Countries in the autumn of 1805 did not disembark after its commander learned of French victories in Central Europe. On the other side of the ledger, however, even while Napoleon was conducting one of the most decisive campaigns in military history, Admiral Horatio Nelson ended any chance of the French challenging British naval superiority by destroying a Franco-Spanish fleet off the coast of Spain at Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. Realizing that Trafalgar severely limited his ability to challenge the British in a fleet action and thus considerably eroded his chances of gaining control of the English Channel, Napoleon sought to exploit his victory on land.
Acknowledging that British gold had financed the three previous coalition wars, Napoleon targeted the heart of Britain's power: its maritime economy. Lacking the resources either to invade Britain or decisively defeat the Royal Navy at sea and unable to compete 9-9 Striking at Britain by closing the French-controlled ports of Europe to British trade dated back to the third Revolutionary government of France, the National Convention (1792-95). During the War of First Coalition, the French forced their conquered "sister republics" to close their ports to the British. At that time, because of holes in the System, the Republic's economic attack produced only marginal success. Napoleon returned to the idea in 1806 with renewed determination; the changes France made to the map of Europe considerably strengthened his ability to wage economic warfare against the British. France now controlled the Low Countries and the Hanseatic cities of North Germany, so by extension Europe's North Sea Coast, most of Italy, the Dalmatian coast of the Balkans, and was allied with Spain and many of the German states. To make his Continental blockade more effective and gain an ally against Great Britain, Napoleon presented the Prussians with the February 1806 Treaty of Paris as punishment for their forfeiture of neutrality during the War of the Third Coalition. The treaty forced the Prussians to close all North German ports to British shipping. As a reward for joining France's war against Britain, Napoleon ordered the Prussians to immediately occupy Hanover, a possession of the British crown. He also hinted that he would support Berlin's long-standing goal of creating a Prussian-dominated confederation in North Germany. Facing a war with either the shark or the tiger, Berlin chose to face the former.
On 1 April 1806, Berlin inaugurated Napoleon's Continental System by issuing a decree that closed the ports of Prussia and Hanover to British shipping. London responded with the Order in Council of 8 April 1806 that declared a blockade of all ports between the Ems and the Elbe Rivers in Germany. A declaration of war was issued to Prussia on 20 April 1806 accompanied by the seizure of over 400 Prussian merchantmen found in British waters as well as the blockade of Prussia's Baltic coast. However, to minimize strife with third parties, the 16 May 1806 Orders in Council opened all ports in northwest Germany and Holland to neutral shipping as long as the vessels did not come from, or were not sailing to, a French-
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) controlled port and as long as the ship did not carry French goods, contraband, or military supplies. Five days later, London declared that the Royal Navy would not stop any neutral ships in the Baltic. On 25 September, the British went as far as to open the German coast between the Ems and the Elbe. Clearly, the two Leagues of Armed Neutrality as well as problems with the Americans taught the British restraint in dealing with neutrals.
After Napoleon forced the Austrians in January 1806 to accept his decision to dissolve the Holy Roman Empire, he created the Confederation of the Rhine in July of that same year. With Prussia and Austria excluded, sixteen German states joined in a military and political union under protection of the French emperor. All member states received full sovereignty over domestic affairs but a national parliament would formulate foreign policy. In return for Napoleon's "protection," member states would pay a "blood tax" by supplying forces for his armies, initially 63,000 men annually. Napoleon succeeded in making the Third Germany a French satellite to better harness its military resources. This did not sit well with the Prussians, who felt betrayed over the issue of a Prussian-led North German confederation.
In his glory, Napoleon began making further changes to the map of Europe. Signaling his intention to never relinquish French control of the Low Countries, he made Holland a kingdom with his younger brother, Louis, its king. In addition, the British suffered another reverse in the Mediterranean theater. In January, British ground forces evacuated the Kingdom of Naples ahead of a French invasion, taking the Neapolitan Bourbons with them to Sicily aboard British warships. Later in the year, Napoleon appointed his older brother, Joseph, to be the new king of Naples.
In Britain, the "Ministry of All the Talents" came to power in early 1806. Willing to grant greater concessions to France than any previous British administration, it favored a negotiated peace with Napoleon that would have left France possessing far more territory than it had at the height of Louis XIV's power. Reversing London's policy of sponsoring plots, typically by French royalists to assassinate Napoleon, the Cabinet initiated a dialogue with France by warning him of an impending attack. Needing to stabilize Joseph's Neapolitan regime in the face of a British counteroffensive in Calabria that resulted in a redcoat victory over the French at Maida on 4 July 1806, Napoleon secretly discussed the return of Hanover to George III, as long as London dropped its support of the Neapolitan Bourbons. Although British forces withdrew to Sicily before the end of July, they continued to support a violent insurgency in Calabria against French rule. All this diplomatic posturing came to naught as Napoleon harbored no sincere interest in peace and only sought to cause dissension between London and St. Petersburg, which was conducted its own concurrent talks with the French emperor. Napoleon's plan partially backfired when the Prussians learned of his offer to return Hanover, Berlin's only compensation for going to war with Britain. Discovering the limits of Napoleon's friendship, the Prussians opted for war against France in August 1806.
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815)
The Fourth Coalition formed after London dropped its grievances with the Prussians, and Tsar Alexander I agreed to send an army to Central Europe. Although somewhat apprehensive about facing the vaunted Prussian army, Napoleon made short work of it at the twin battles of Jena-Auerstedt on 14 October 1806. With the conquest of Prussia, Napoleon strengthened his attack on British trade in the Baltic, as French forces ensured the closure of Prussia's coast. The European-wide implementation of the Continental System began on 21 November 1806 when Napoleon issued the Berlin Decree. Although he lacked a navy, the French emperor placed the British Isles in a state of blockade, prohibiting all commerce and communication with them. More in line with his capabilities, Napoleon declared that no British goods could enter Europe, that any British subject caught on the Continent could be imprisoned and their property or merchandise seized, and that all ships in Frenchcontrolled ports registered to British owners would be seized. No ships from Britain or its colonies could enter the ports of French-controlled Europe. London only moderately escalated this paper contest with the 7 January 1807 Orders in Council that prohibited any ship from carrying commerce between two ports closed to British shipping. Any ship conducting trade between two such ports would be warned to discontinue the voyage and seized if the notice went unheeded. In response, Napoleon's Warsaw Decree of 25 January 1807 ordered the confiscation of all British goods found in the Hanseatic cities of North Germany, thus prompting the British to reclose the German coast between the Ems and the Elbe.
After Napoleon defeated the Russian army in June 1807, Tsar Alexander I signed the Treaty of Tilsit to end the War of the Fourth Coalition. Of the many developments that emerged from this agreement, Alexander's willingness to participate in Napoleon's Continental System by closing his ports to British shipping was a landmark in the Anglo-French rivalry. With the addition of Prussia and Denmark, Tilsit completed the closure of the Baltic to British trade with the exception of Sweden. Maintaining a favorable balance of naval strength in the Baltic had always figured prominently in Britain's maritime strategy, and in an instant it was gone. With Russia's naval assets now aligned with France and rumors that Napoleon planned to seize Denmark's large fleet, the Brits launched a second pre-emptive assault on the Danish fleet at Copenhagen starting on 16 August 1807. Although the Royal Navy retained control of the Baltic Sea, its ports remained closed to British shipping. London's Orders in Council of 11 November 1807 forbade French trade with Britain, its allies, or neutrals, and instructed the Royal Navy to blockade French-controlled ports. Napoleon retaliated with the Milan Decree of 1807, which declared that all neutral shipping using British ports or paying British tariffs would be regarded as British and seized. On 30 November 1807, French forces entered Lisbon just as the Portuguese administration sailed for Brazil with a British escort and most of the state's coin. The French established rule over Portugal, occupying its ports and fortresses and dismantling its armed forces. With the conquest of Portugal, Napoleon moved against Spain. Under the pretext of establishing a line of communication between France and Portugal, the French undertook a massive escalation of forces in Spain. More than 130,000 French troops crossed the Pyrenees between November 1807 and March 1808. Spanish officials learned that 120,000 French troops would occupy Portugal. However, instead of marching to Lisbon, the army appeared at Madrid on 24 March 1808 while other French forces took control of Spain's major fortresses. Disagreement between King Carl IV and Crown Prince Ferdinand over the right to rule brought about an invitation from Napoleon for all concerned parties to meet with him at Bayonne in April 1808. There, the French emperor arrested the king and crown prince, forcing them to forfeit the crown of Spain. Shortly after, the people of Madrid rose up on 2 May 1808 to protest the French presence in Spain. French authorities savagely suppressed the revolt but could not prevent it from spreading to the provinces. Napoleon compounded the problem by making his brother, Joseph, the new king of Spain. With every Spanish province arming against the French, a reluctant Joseph accepted the crown on 15 June 1808.
The establishment of the Continental System in Portugal presented a tremendous setback for the British. After Sweden-Britain's only remaining European ally and trade partner-refused to comply with French demands to close its ports, the Russians invaded in February 1808 and forcibly implemented Napoleon's blockade. Like the Russians, much of the Continent initially rallied behind France in this latest showdown with "Perfidious Albion." Governments across Europe noted that while London paid the Austrians, Prussians, and Russians to fight in the Third and Fourth Coalition Wars, Britain dispatched most of the redcoats stationed on the home isles on expeditions that reflected national self-interest such as garri-
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) soning the recently taken city of Buenos Aires and recapturing the Cape of Good Hope. In the Mediterranean, some 6,000 British troops sailed from Sicily to take Alexandria. This appeared to be a repeat of the colonial campaigns that the British waged in the West and East Indies while their allies fought the French in Europe during the Wars of the First and Second Coalition. Although little actual colonial expansion occurred after 1803 due to the high cost of campaigning in the disease-ridden West Indies, such unilateral actions never pleased Britain's coalition partners, particularly Tsar Alexander. Consequently, just as Napoleon had to devise an alternate maritime economic strategy to compete with Britain, London likewise needed to comprehensively reassess its strategy despite the success it had produced in previous conflicts such as the Seven Years' War. As it stood, Britain's traditional strategy failed in the French Wars to protect either the Low Countries or the Baltic, and British freedom of action in the Mediterranean was considerably restricted due to the exacting costs of blockading the French Empire and the threat now posed by the Russians.
British leaders explored an array of policy options and kept most on the table, but little doubt existed that British maritime security had reached is nadir and that Britain needed to plot a new course to survive the threat posed by Napoleonic France.

As it stood, London decided to establish a strong military presence at either Buenos Aires or Mexico to secure the Portuguese in Brazil, prevent the French from exploiting Spain's colonies, and initiate trade with the major ports of South America. Plans were made to send 8,000 troops from Ireland to Venezuela in the hope of instigating a revolt against Spanish colonial rule. However, before these plans could be put into effect, the 2 May 1808 uprising in Spain altered the dynamic and provided an opportunity for the British to truly implement a new strategy. Rather than allocate its own forces to strangle French maritime trade and merely harass the enemy in tertiary theaters, London decided to commit a field army to the Iberian Peninsula. Although itself a secondary theater throughout much of the latter Napoleonic era, Iberia served as a stage where the British directly challenged the French. The British finally had skin in the game. 
6
News of Bailén and Cintra prompted Napoleon to go to Spain personally. Before departing for Iberia, he held an international congress at the German city of Erfurt in October 1808. Aside from showing the other rulers of Europe his splendor, Napoleon wanted to affirm his partnership with Tsar Alexander. In particular, he sought the Russian leader's assurance that St. Petersburg would defend French interests in Central Europe during his absence. Suspecting Vienna would move against him while he campaigned in Iberia, Napoleon hoped the threat of Russian intervention would keep Austria in check. Much had changed in just one year, however, and the friendship born at Tilsit was already in retreat. Not only did Alexander evasively respond to Napoleon's requests, but he secretly assured the Austrians he would not interfere if they attacked while Napoleon fought in Spain.
Napoleon assumed command of all French forces in Spain on 5 November 1808 and proceeded to smash four Spanish armies. By 4 December 1808, French forces again controlled Madrid. After restoring his brother as king and reorganizing the Spanish government, Napoleon turned his attention to the British expeditionary force in Portugal, which had secretly moved into Spain to attack Napoleon's flank and rear. Learning of this advance, Napoleon changed his plans from invading Portugal to chasing the British, who made a dash to the Spanish coastal city of Coruña. After one week of pursuit, Napoleon turned over command to one of his marshals and returned to France incorrectly assuming that the war in Iberia was over. At Coruña, the Royal Navy evacuated 27,000 redcoats in mid-January 1809 as French forces closed in. The abysmal condition of the army that returned to Britain caused Parliament to seriously debate the feasibility of maintaining forces in Iberia. Regardless, the British remained committed to their new strategy and a larger British army returned to Portugal before the French could capitalize on its absence. To augment the redcoats in Iberia, Parliament also decided to finance the mobilization and training of the Portuguese army under British direction.
The presence of a British army in Portugal did little to remove the French from the Low Countries, the Baltic coast, or Italy. Nevertheless, the Peninsula War, as it is known, served as a sponge that considerably drained French resources. In addition to supporting the guerilla war in Spain, the British presence in Portugal forced the French to allocate an army of more than 300,000 men to Iberia. Two subsequent French invasions of Portugal were turned back by the British-led Anglo-Portuguese army in 1809 and 1810-11 respectively. The British exploited these victories with offensives into Spain that the French likewise parried. Even after 9-15 To the conquered peoples of the French Empire, the struggle in Spain appeared to be a war of liberation. Hawks in the Austrian government agitated for another confrontation with France. After being mauled militarily and diplomatically by Napoleon in the Wars of the First, Second, and Third Coalitions, the Austrians hoped to take advantage of French reverses in Spain and of Napoleon's increasing military commitment in Iberia. As Napoleon feared, war commenced between France and Austria in April 1809, when the Austrian army invaded the French ally of Bavaria. This Franco-Austrian conflict became part of the wider War of the Fifth Coalition after Britain allied with Austria. Russia remained neutral, which in itself should be viewed as a victory for Austria considering Alexander's alliance with Napoleon. Like the previous coalitions, London financed Austria, its only ally, but continued to pursue its new strategy of direct intervention by invading Holland on 30 July. More than 39,000 redcoats, an army larger than that serving in the Iberian Peninsula at that time, landed at Walcheren Island in the Scheldt Estuary; by this time, however, the Austrians had already lost the war.
Little fighting characterized the Walcheren Campaign, but more than 4,000 British troops died from sickness before the remainder returned home in December 1809. As for the Franco-Austrian conflict, Napoleon rebounded after suffering the first defeat of his career at Aspern-Essling on 22 May 1809. During the 5-6 July Battle of Wagram, he inflicted 41,000 casualties on the Austrian army. On 12 July, the Austrians requested and received an armistice. The 14 October 1809 Franco-Austrian Treaty of Schönbrunn ended the War of the Fifth Coalition. Its stipulations stripped Austria of its coastline along the Adriatic Sea, thus landlocking the empire and making it a de facto partner in Napoleon's Continental System.
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815)
Although another victorious war for Napoleon, Britain's new strategy notably impacted the conflict. Much of the crack French army that had fought the Third and Fourth Coalition Wars was stationed in Iberia when the Fifth Coalition War commenced. For the first time during his reign, Napoleon had to deal with manpower problems. To raise an army to confront the Austrians, he not only called up new recruits but was forced to depend on foreign troops supplied mainly by his German vassals. This permanently changed Napoleon's force structure and force capabilities. Never would he have the same army qualitatively as the one that marched to war in 1805. After exhausting that highly trained force, he became increasingly dependent on German, Italian, and Polish manpower that had not received training on par with the original Grande Armée. A marked change in Napoleon's tactics coincided with this qualitative decline. Instead of continuing the progression of his tactical innovations for battlefield problem-solving, he had to depend increasingly on the weight of massed batteries, huge formations, and unimaginative frontal assaults.
Although he smashed another coalition, Napoleon could not end the war that continued to rage in Spain and Portugal. Rather than cross the Pyrenees again, he left the war in Iberia to his marshals and his brother, Joseph. Despite the situation in Iberia, Napoleon's control of Central Europe appeared incontestable after 1809. Allied with Russia and tightly controlling Prussia, Napoleon also hoped he had permanently settled his differences with Austria by marrying into the Habsburg family. Yet, one year later, everything began unraveling as Russia ended its French alliance. The events between 1808 and 1811 that culminated in Napoleon's 1812 invasion of Russia are beyond the scope of this study. Those that proved particularly egregious to Napoleon included Alexander's cool demeanor at the Congress of Erfurt followed by his less than enthusiastic support of French interests during the War of the Fifth Coalition. Conversely, the lack of French diplomatic pressure on the Ottoman Empire to end its war with Russia as well as Napoleon's ambiguity over his intentions regarding Eastern Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean embittered Alexander. As a result of the crippling effects of the Continental System, Alexander issued a decree on 31 December 1810 to tax luxury goods and wines, some of France's largest exports. Moreover, the decree opened Russian ports to neutral ships carrying British exports. British goods soon flooded the markets of Eastern and Central Europe. Napoleon had few choices other than to force Alexander's continued participation in the Continental System. Thus, in 1811, both emperors started preparing for war.
The first quarter of 1812 initiated diplomatic realignments against France; Britain assumed one of the leading roles. Before 1808, the British mainly contributed to the successive coalition wars against France by funding in the form of loans, subsidies, and credits to allies such as Austria and Russia whose armies would shoulder the main burden of fighting the French. Total domination of the seas then allowed the British to conduct limited mili-
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) tary operations against secondary targets such as the Netherlands and Naples either unilaterally or in conjunction with the Russians. However, London's 1808 decision to commit the British army to the Iberian Peninsula marked a monumental policy change for the maritime economic power. Yet this was not enough. Although the British distracted Napoleon and tied down vital imperial resources in Iberia and the Mediterranean, they realized that Napoleon's hegemony over the Continent could only be broken in Central Europe. For this reason, the British could not turn their backs on Austria, Prussia, and Russia even after all three counted among Napoleon's allies following the failed Franco-Austrian War of 1809. The British understood that when the time came for Europe to a rise against France, Britain would be expected to support it both with arms and money.
Napoleon commenced the invasion of Russia on 22 June 1812. The following month, the British signed peace treaties with the Swedes and Russians. A new British ambassador to Russia sailed from Britain in late July. Aid came in the form of a British convoy carrying 50,000 muskets and a half ton of "Peruvian" or "Jesuit's" Bark that contained natural quinine for medicinal purposes being dispatched to Russia in August. In addition, British warships operating in the Eastern Baltic contributed to the successful defense of Riga by the Russians later in the year. Resolved not only to liberate Russia, but to carry the war into Central Europe, Alexander became the catalyst for the formation of the Sixth Coalition. Yet Russian financial problems became so acute in late 1812 that a special finance committee informed the tsar that he would have to make peace with Napoleon unless he received massive British financial assistance. By the end of 1812, this committee sought a way for Britain to fund Russia before it went bankrupt.
After failing to destroy the Russian army at Borodino on 7 September 1812, the French reached a deserted Moscow one week later. Not only did the tsar refuse to negotiate, but the Russians burned the city. Having to choose between remaining at Moscow-1,200 miles from Paris-for the winter or withdrawing, Napoleon chose the latter. On 19 October, a much smaller Grande Armée commenced the retreat. On 3 November, the first snows fell; by the end of the month, Napoleon commanded no more than 40,000 walking dead. Of the 655,000 men who crossed the Russian frontier in 1812, Napoleon lost approximately 570,000 soldiers, with as many as 370,000 dead. Russian casualties have been estimated to be as high as 450,000 with two-thirds dead.
On 3 March 1813, the British formed the Sixth Coalition with Russia and Sweden against France. The Anglo-Swedish portion of the alliance obligated London to provide the Swedes £1,000,000 by October 1813. In mid-March, Prussia joined the coalition by signing a bilateral alliance with Russia and declaring war on Napoleon. London restored official diplomatic relations with the Prussians after they formally declared the end of the Continental

System in North Germany on 20 March. The British bolstered the alliance by dispatching a convoy to the Baltic carrying 54 cannon as well 23,000 stand of arms to be shared by the Russians and Prussians.

By early November 1813, this formidable coalition had driven Napoleon and his legions across the Rhine River and back into France. However, after reaching the Rhine, the members could not agree on their next and ultimate objective: should they continue the war to overthrow Napoleon, or should they negotiate a peace with the French emperor? Politics eclipsed both military operations and military cooperation. In the midst of the military planning for the invasion, the Allies offered Napoleon a conditional peace by which he would have remained ruler of a France that included the natural frontiers of the Rhine, Alps, and Pyrenees. Although these terms would have left France with territory that generations of Frenchmen had died in vain attempting to secure, Napoleon rejected the offer.
Into this fray arrived British Foreign Minister Robert Stewart, Lord Castlereagh on a mission aimed at establishing allied priorities and firming up the alliance. Moreover, London sought the continuation of the alliance after the peace in order to provide collective security against future French aggression. Allied unity, which had started to crumble during January and February 1814, was restored in March thanks in part to Castlereagh's efforts and Napoleon's intransigence. His refusal to agree to terms at the Châtillon peace conference eliminated any doubt that only Napoleon's complete overthrow would bring peace to Europe. Therefore, on 9 March 1814, Castlereagh along with the representatives of Russia, Austria, and Prussia signed the Treaty of Chaumont, which called for Napoleon to renounce all conquests in exchange for an armistice. In effect, this would have reduced France to its 1791 pre-Revolution or "traditional" borders rather than the natural frontiers. The following day Napoleon rejected the offer, ending his last chance to negotiate a peace. As a result, the Allies pledged to unconditionally defeat Napoleon. The treaty also stipulat-
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) ed that the Big Four (Britain, Russia, Prussia, and Austria) would work in concert for the next twenty years to prevent France from threatening the European balance of power.
After the Coalition's armies marched on Paris, Napoleon could not recover. On 31 March 1814, the ceremonial entry of the Allied sovereigns into Paris occurred. Three days later, a provisional French government deposed Napoleon but he refused to relinquish power. Finally, after some of his marshals mutinied, he agreed to abdicate in favor of his son on 6 April, signing the formal act of abdication at Fontainebleau on the 11th. Regardless, the British demanded the restoration of the Bourbons under King Louis XVIII; Napoleon was exiled to the tiny Mediterranean island of Elba. Although Napoleon escaped from Elba in late February 1815 and landed in France on 1 March, London enacted the Treaty of Chaumont and the signatories formed the Seventh Coalition. In the aftermath of his defeated at Waterloo on 18 June 1815 by British and Prussian armies, Napoleon sought asylum in Britain. Instead, the British exiled him to the South Atlantic island of St. Helena, where he died in 1821.
By adopting the new strategy of direct intervention, the British overturned the resource imbalance that had favored France since the Republic unleashed its hordes on an unsuspecting Europe in 1794. This returned France to the disadvantageous position it was in during many earlier conflicts: facing a two-front war. However, instead of fighting the British on the seas and in the colonies, the French now faced their rival in Iberia. The opening and maintaining of this second front against France transformed what appeared to be unlimited French resources to finite assets by forcing Napoleon to fight on a second front. For the first time in his reign, he had to contend with resource management; the challenges posed by this can be clearly seen in 1809, 1812, and 1813. In 1809, he relied on mainly German troops from his vassal states. Of the 600,000 men he led to Russia in 1812, only 250,000 were native Frenchmen. Of the 90,000 who returned, more than half were Prussians and Austrians who would actually fight against him in 1813. For the Sixth Coalition War that commenced in 1813, Napoleon could field only 200,000 men by the end of April. As one historian notes, the Grande Armée of 1813 provided Napoleon with an effective fighting force, "but one that suffered from the internal germs of weakness." Consequently, the Grande Armée of 1813 lacked many of the tactical attributes of previous French armies, which in turn placed strategic and operational limitations on Napoleon.

against British trade in French-controlled Europe that included a de-facto state of war with Russia and Prussia. Napoleon's Continental System had a significant effect on British trade, causing British exports to fall 25-55 percent between 1806 and 1811 compared to pre-1806 levels, unemployment rose, government bonds fell by 40 percent, and the pound sterling fell in value. Britain was in crisis in 1810-11 when bankruptcies occurred to an extraordinary extent among merchants, unemployment rose sharply, and British currency considerably depreciated. British industry stagnated, helping spur the Luddite protest movement against unemployment.

Napoleon at first benefitted from the effects of the Continental System and much of Europe initially rallied behind France. Like the modern European Economic Community (EEC), Napoleon unified Europe's states to protect their economies against cheaper British goods. Like the EEC, the Continental System aimed to enhance Europe's economy and provide it more leverage in trading. Early on, Belgium, Switzerland, and the industrialized regions of northern and eastern of France benefitted significantly from increased profits due to the lack of competition from British goods, especially textiles, which were produced at a much cheaper cost in Britain. Although the Continental System stimulated the French economy, the economic crisis that struck Britain in 1810-1811 spread to France, Holland, the Hanseatic Cities of North Germany, Prussia, Switzerland, and New York, demonstrating that a global economy existed in the Age of Sail. The British blockade that prevented European merchantmen from sailing severely handicapped internal European trading, which needed sea-shipping to operate at full capacity. Although Napoleon sought to replace Britain with France as the manufacturing giant of Europe, French goods lacked the same quality as British wares and they cost more. Consequently, the French economy suffered a recession as French credit declined and banks failed; French trade decreased by 33 percent from 1806 to 1813. Although the System initially stimulated manufacturing in some parts of France, it damaged regions dependent on overseas commerce. Southern
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815)
France suffered from the reduction of trade, especially the port cities of Marseille, Bordeaux, and La Rochelle.
In general, the price of basic commodities and food increased throughout Continental Europe. Not only did neutrals resent the trade restrictions, but soon French allies and satellites could not bear the weight of the System as it wrecked their economies. Illicit smuggling developed on a monumental scale. Napoleon's own brother, King Louis of Holland, allowed British goods to enter his ports. This led to his forced abdication and the annexation of Holland as well as the North German sea coast to France. Ultimately, Napoleon could not control the amount of British goods entering the Continent and so attempted to regulate the illegal trade. From 1806 to 1814, he sold 20,000 licenses to British merchants that allowed them to sell their goods on the Continent at a 50% duty.

The greatest asymmetry between Britain and France remained the former's maritime strength and control of the seas. Despite Napoleon's ambitious ship-building projects, the use of allied fleets such as the Spanish, Dutch, and Neapolitan, and the attempt to wreck Britain's economy, this advantage did not change during the French Wars. Although years of blockading Europe and supplying British forces and Spanish guerillas in Iberia stretched the Royal Navy extremely thin, its dominance meant the difference between victory and defeat. Another asymmetry that impacted Napoleon's strategy was Britain's advanced industrial status. Mainly an agrarian state, France could not generate enough industry to fill the void created by the absence of British manufactured goods. This contributed to the collapse of France's economy as well as the economies of those states under French control or allied to Napoleon.
Of the seven coalitions that formed during the French Wars, only Britain fought in each conflict. Indeed, Britain and France had competed for colonial mastery for more than a century prior with Britain gaining a clear advantage due to its insular position. France could never allocate its full resources to the competition with Great Britain without undermining its position as a Continental Power, which in turn would severely jeopardize its national security. Finally solving this conundrum in the mid-1790s, France completely shattered the equilibrium of Europe and with it the stability required by the British maritime economy to sustain Britain's power both at home and abroad. In 1793, the British sent ground forces to defend the Low Countries, Britain's major maritime interest in Europe. By 1795, the French controlled both Belgium and Holland. Thus, early in the French Wars, the British perceived this episode of their rivalry with France as potentially one of life or death. The situation only escalated after young Napoleon Bonaparte conquered Italy in 1797 as a distracted Britain handed the French a free hand in the Mediterranean. Ten years later, a Franco-Russian alliance closed the ports of the Baltic to the British. Control of these three strategic spheres had enabled Britain to maintain its Great Power status and influence in Europe. This made France the primary enemy of Great Britain throughout the French Wars. Although Britain's leadership remained cognizant of other threats such as Russia's growing maritime interests, French control the Low Countries, the Mediterranean, and the Baltic posed a national security crisis for Britain. Nowhere is this better illustrated than London's monumental change in strategy in 1808. Before then, the British pursued their traditional strategy of committing their own forces to strangle French maritime trade, harass the French in secondary theaters, and fund allies to bear the direct brunt of fighting France on the Continent. Aside from modest colonial gains, this strategy failed. France defeated successive coalitions and made tremendous territorial gains on the Continent while the British expended significant amounts of financial assistance to losing war efforts.
By 1808, London had drawn many lessons from its devastating failures to defeat France through containment, proxy wars, and even attempts to assassinate Napoleon. As a start, policy makers concluded that a British naval victory such as Trafalgar would not

By 1805, Napoleon perceived Britain as France's implacable enemy because of London's ability to finance anti-French coalitions and its refusal to accept French control of the Low Countries. Yet the British naval victory at Trafalgar that same year shattered his dream of invading the British home isles. Inheriting a French fleet that had been ravished by the Royal Navy since the beginning of the French Wars, Napoleon desperately sought control of foreign naval assets to offset the balance. Despite controlling numerous foreign fleets during various periods of his reign, Napoleon could do little to counter the asymmetric nature of warfare with the British. Although his ambitious naval construction program would have yielded newer and better ships, their officers and crews would have been no match for the seasoned veterans of the Royal Navy. Even with the resources of the entire
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815)
European continent at his disposal, Napoleon could not challenge the British conventionally. Along with London's refusal to recognize French hegemony, this meant the British would continue to finance enemy coalitions as long as the Eastern Powers of Russia, Austria, and Prussia provided the manpower. Although he managed to defang Prussia, the immense populations of Austria and especially Russia meant that Napoleon would have to fight a seemingly endless series of wars. Assessment remained relatively easy as Napoleon knew that only British gold allowed his enemies to continue the wars against him. Three years into the System, Austria took up arms against him in the Fifth Coalition War. After six years, London exclusively financed the Sixth Coalition while maintaining the war in Iberia and fighting in North America.
To defeat Britain, Napoleon developed an alternate strategy: economic warfare. Brilliant yet unrealistic, Napoleon grossly misjudged the capabilities of his empire to sustain a prolonged embargo against British trade. Ruining not only France's economy, the System wrecked the economies of satellites and allies as well. Napoleon's pursuit of defeating Britain above all else, led him down the path of his two greatest disasters: the Peninsula War and the invasion of Russia. Interestingly, he never viewed the British field army in Iberia as a primary objective, although the empire was focused on destroying the British through the Continental System. Although London finally offered a conventional target, Napoleon placed greater hope in the unconventional economic war to crush "the little island of shopkeepers."
In his duel with the Royal Navy, Napoleon carefully balanced his strengths and weaknesses. After Trafalgar, he did not risk large-scale naval engagements, recognizing that a French naval victory, however large, would not allow him to invade Britain. By refusing fleet engagements, Napoleon forced the British to carefully balance resource intensive deployments despite the fact that Britain possessed approximately half of the world's total warship tonnage by the late Napoleonic period. Napoleon's massive post-Trafalgar ship-building program resulted in French fleet concentrations in the Scheldt Estuary and at Toulon with smaller squadrons at numerous locations. Individual French ships and small squadrons periodically escaped to operate against the British. Napoleon accepted that the French would lose some of these encounters but the disruption it caused the British made the losses acceptable. Should French warships escape, the British pursued them before they could inflict damage on isolated naval assets and vulnerable maritime commerce. As the number of French warships grew, the British concentrated increased naval strength in blockade squadrons. The wide range of British global commitments left few warships in reserve as Royal Navy blockade squadrons accounted for over half of Britain's ships of the line in the years 1811-13. 
19
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815)
ples of Europe's other states that Britain sought to economically enslave the Continent. He underestimated the effectiveness of both the British army in Iberia and the Spanish insurgency that the Royal Navy supported. He misjudged the ability of his subordinates, including his brother, to heal his "bleeding ulcer" in Iberia. In the end, he staked the well-being of his empire and then its survival on defeating the British. During the on-again off-again negotiations that he pursued with the Eastern Powers in 1813 and 1814, he refused to even allow any of London's demands to be discussed. Britain likewise changed its policy and adopted the new strategy of direct intervention on the Continent; its economy weathered the recession caused by the Continental System to such an extent that by 1813 London could allocate unprecedented resources to North America, Iberia, and Central Europe. Its navy triumphed over the French in every fleet action during the French Wars, maintained a tight Continental blockade for seven years, and broke open new markets in the Western Hemisphere. The British assessed where they stood in terms of economic strength and control of the seas. Britain's ultimate victory over Napoleon in 1815 assured British naval and colonial dominance for the next 100 years, when another empire challenged Britain for its place in the sun.

The Franco-German Rivalry
The Franco-German rivalry contained many asymmetries: of political structure, population, economic might, resources, and defensible frontiers.
Until Bismarck, a mythic sense of inferiority afflicted the Germans vis-à-vis the French. They felt themselves victims of the major asymmetry in their relationship: the French had been united behind defensible borders-the Rhine, Alps, Pyrenees and the Atlantic-since the Middle Ages. The Germans, on the other hand, occupied the defenseless north German plain where no natural frontiers existed, and which had historically been divided into petty kingdoms with distinct dynastic and cultural identities. Under both republics and monarchies, the French had enjoyed a strong state tradition since Charlemagne. The Germans, in contrast, were split into three dozen states by the Congress of Vienna and, led by an inefficient German "diet of princes" in Frankfurt, had a weak state tradition. Indeed, Otto von Bismarck's determination to unify Germany stemmed in large part from his experience as Prussian ambassador to the Frankfurt diet (1851-59), where he had seethed with frustration at the Bund's inefficiency and at Prussia's subordination to Austria. But before this reunification, France, wielding the power of a single coherent state, had long possessed a controlling influence in German affairs: Richelieu dictating the borders of the Holy Roman Empire in 1648, Louis XIV annexing Alsace and other bits of western Germany in the 1690s, and Napoleon I liquidating the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 and creating a French-directed Confederation of the Rhine in its place.
Bismarck (1815-98) devoted his career to erasing the asymmetries that favored France. First, by expanding the German Customs Union (Zollverein) of 1834, he and his colleagues united the thirty-nine economies of the German Confederation under the leadership of Berlin. On the international scene, Bismarck, as ambassador first to the German diet, then to Russia and France, assiduously worked to prepare the ground for German unification. In Frankfurt, he made clear to the German princes (heads of state like the Kings of Saxony and Bavaria and the Grand Duke of Baden) that ethnically German Prussia was the natural leader of a united Germany, not the largely Slavic Austrian Empire. In St. Petersburg, he pledged support for a Russian campaign to undo the sanctions of the Crimean War, which had barred Russian naval might from the Black Sea and the Straits. In Paris, he dexterously appeared to accept French leadership of Europe while covertly planning to use French neutrality to fight a war with Austria for the command of Germany. Bismarck led the French to believe that a united Germany would behave like a loyal 10-1
The Franco-German Rivalry Napoleonic satellite state, when, in fact, he planned to unite the Germans to unlock their tremendous potential so as to overshadow the French.
The French and Prussians possessed similar political systems; both were authoritarian states with some elements of democracy. Prussia had a Landtag or parliament, but voting was restricted to wealthy, educated property-owners. A rising socialist-influenced working class was excluded and eventually bought off with various expedients: appeals to German nationalism, a social safety net, and then, from the 1890s, the "fleet policy" that created blue-collar jobs in the service of an expansive naval and colonial "world policy." France had a Corps Législatif that was gerrymandered to create a Napoleonic majority and exclude the radical urban working class; but Napoleon III also had recourse to "plebiscitary democracy," in which he would canvass public opinion on major questions (like his decision to crown himself Emperor of the French in 1852) and thus tap the loyal peasantry, giving his regime a fig-leaf of legitimacy in the democratic age.
Both systems permitted an activist foreign policy-with little popular push-back-but ran the risk, absent real checks and balances, of embroiling the state in dangerous conflicts that cooler heads (like the Republican bloc in the French Legislative Body or the Progressive party in Prussia) would have avoided. In short, both leaders had the ability to shape events and incite the emotions of their citizens. Unfortunately for France, Bismarck operated better in this atmosphere, chiefly because he performed a thorough net assessment of German and French capabilities and never took a step forward without carefully weighing the odds.
Napoleon III (1808-73) was altogether different. He was 62 in 1870 and prematurely old, suffering from gout, kidney stones, and other ailments. Moreover, he was frequently drugged with opiates and had a short attention span. Worse, Napoleon III surrounded himself with cronies, most of whom were reactionaries or opportunists, none of whom had anything like the stature, acuity or judgment of Bismarck and Moltke. Indeed statesmanship in the service of Napoleon III boiled down to thinking of ways to keep the dynasty going. There was little serious political or military long-term planning. The emperor did employ a reform-minded war minister, Marshal Adolphe Niel, from 1867-69, but then failed to insist upon implementing Niel's (attempted) reforms: an empowered general staff, promotion on merit not seniority, a reserve national guard (garde mobile), a military railroad department, or territorial army organization. 
1
The Franco-German Rivalry them-in the glow of victory-to crack down on republican and radical "subversives." Napoleon III seemed oblivious or indifferent to this agenda; power increasingly accrued to his healthy, ambitious, clerical wife Eugénie. The empress was a Spanish-born archreactionary, who craved war with Prussia, which she viewed as a hateful Protestant upstart. Informed chiefly by emotions, nostalgia, and wounded amour-propre, none of the French leaders performed a real net assessment of their strength versus Prussia's.
Overall, the French viewed the rivalry with surprising complacency. Whereas the Prussians grasped what the rivalry was about-reordering power on the basis of strength and stature-the French under Napoleon III took an absurdly amateurish and unscientific view of the rivalry. Napoleon III's camarilla (cabal)-and the emperor himself-viewed the Prussians as rascally little boys who had no business contesting power with France. The French, guilty of nostalgic thinking, failed to add up German assets or to grasp German resolve. They focused, instead, on Prussia alone, which Voltaire had famously dismissed as "a kingdom of mere border strips," a "land of sand and starveling pines."
The French, therefore, failed to mark Prussia's transition from a poor kingdom to an industrial powerhouse that produced more coal and steel in a year than France, Russia or Austria, and was tied to the other economies of Germany by the Zollverein. Just as Bismarck had carefully assessed the Austrians before 1866 and found them more flash than substance, he assessed the French before 1870, noting their small army, flat economy, and stagnant population. Certainly much of the French public grasped their vulnerability. A joke circulating in Paris during the world's fair Exposition of 1867 held that Napoleon III would win the gold medal "because he had exposed France" by not intervening in the Austro-Prussian War. But this sense of alarm didn't penetrate the imperial government and army. Even on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War, Napoleon III still fancied himself poised for a second Jena, pushing to Berlin and crushing Prussian pretensions. The vast space, resources, troops, and technocratic competence of Germany meant nothing to him.
The rivals had the same goal-to defeat the other and dominate the German spacethe Prussians directly through annexations, the French indirectly through a Confederation of the Rhine that would create new French satellites and shear off Prussia's coal and industry-rich Rhine provinces. Their rivalry gathered strength, especially after the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, because Prussia's rise was interpreted in Paris as an insult to French predominance and because continued French designs on German territory were interpreted in Prussia as impertinence in an age of nationalism. But in the frivolous way of the Second Empire, where rich, connected "friends of the emperor" gave military and foreign policy advice, French power was consistently overestimated and German power underestimated owing to ignorance and the group-thinking need to flatter the Bonapartes, especially the increasingly powerful and bigoted empress. This was a colossal strategic failure for the French, which Bismarck and Moltke shrewdly grasped and resolved to exploit. Their net assessments were stunningly accurate, informed as they were by painstaking reporting by 10-3

Although German nationalists and Prussian chauvinists alike perceived France as their primary rival before 1866, France viewed Prussia and Germany as a weak space that still could be forged into French satellites. Louis-Napoleon sought French security, like his uncle before him, by harnessing rather than opposing the spread of nationalism in Europe. Napoleon I, when he created the Confederation of the Rhine, had beefed up "middlestates" like Bavaria with old Imperial territory and thus earned their loyalty. Elsewhere, he created a Polish state (the Duchy of Warsaw) as well as a Kingdom of Italy. The goal was always to empower smaller states just enough to be useful (in alliance with France) but not enough to rival French power. In the 1860s, Napoleon III renewed this program, seeking opportunities to undo the settlement of 1815 and create a new ring of satellite states that would owe their growth to France.
That explained the French emperor's interest in Bismarck. In 1865, just one year before the Austro-Prussian War, Napoleon III hosted Bismarck in Biarritz. This was an important summit; Bismarck had returned from the Paris embassy to take up the job of Prussian minister-president (prime minister) in 1862. During a long walk on the beach, the two men discussed the future of Germany and Bonaparte agreed that Prussia would have a free hand in a war with Austria. Strategically, the French emperor was guilty of terrible short-sightedness. He wanted to weaken Austria in order eventually to break it up, into German, Hungarian, Czech, South Slav, and Polish states that would ally with Paris, still viewed as the "umpire of Europe" in the 1860s.

The Franco-German Rivalry lost sight of the real threat: the possibility that the 19 million Prussians might annex the 20 million souls of the German Confederation and become a first-tier, heavily-armed, expansive great power-larger, richer, and more productive than France. This fuzziness about strategic questions in Paris was another key asymmetry. Whereas Bismarck planned for wars with Austria and France to break down the barriers to unification, Napoleon III lost himself in weird reveries that referenced the past far more than the present and future. Louis-Napoleon did not grasp what the competition was really about; Bismarck did. As late as 1866, Louis-Napoleon still believed that his strategic mission was to weaken the Russian and Austrian Empires and prepare their partition into nation-states. This was a Rube Goldberg conception of strategy that depended on too many unpredictable variables, chief among them the loyalty of the minions. Napoleon III had supposed that Count Camillo Cavour would be a loyal minion (and thus facilitated Italian unification 1859-61), yet Cavour had merely pretended to be loyal until French power had been secured and used up; he had then asserted Italian interests against France. Bismarck too would play the loyal minion until he had gotten all he could from France; then he would attack France. Having already experienced this blowback with Cavour, Napoleon III should have been leery of Bismarck.
Bismarck's strategic mission contained none of the French waffle; he had to defeat Austria and France, keep the other powers neutral, and rake in the population and resources of Germany to vault Prussia into the first tier of great powers. He'd persuade or compel the German states to give up their old identities-Bavarian, Hessian, Saxon-in exchange for a German identity that might make the world tremble. Thus, France would find itself surprised and overwhelmed by the speed and intensity of Prussia's growth in the 1860s. By the time France reacted, it would be too late.
War exploded at the very moment when Napoleon III was mentally finalizing the future shape of Germany. He had been seeking to weaken or dissolve the Russian and Austrian empires since the Crimean War as a part of his plan to redraw the map of Europe along lines that would favor France. Like his uncle, Napoleon III viewed nation-states, birthed and nurtured by Paris, as the best way to leverage French power. Napoleon III would preempt German unification (either as an enlarged Austrian-led Customs Union or as an aggrandized Prussia) by reforming Germany into northern and southern confederations that would align with France to secure their independence from Berlin or Vienna. The Austro-Prussian War broke out shortly after Napoleon III had met with Bismarck, and the Prussian statesman had shrewdly pretended to support a French role in Germany. In reality, Bismarck invited the war with Austria to break out of the Congress-straitjacket: the assumption in Europe at the time that any changes to the borders of 1815 would need the assent of a Congress of the great powers. It was just such a Congress that Napoleon III was 10-5
The Franco-German Rivalry mulling, to solve the German, Italian, and Polish questions (in the French interest), when Prussia invaded Austria in June 1866.
In 1866, Bismarck had a sophisticated understanding of his primary rival. He needed to defeat the Austrians to dissolve the German Confederation-over which Austria presidedbut he knew that France lurked in the background as a more potent and threatening enemy. This was an atmosphere tailor-made for Bismarck's ingenuity. To weaken both Austria and France, he entered into alliance, in February 1866, with the new Kingdom of Italy. Italy itself was in large part an 1859 creation of the French army. But France's decision to renege on its pledge to "free Italy from the Alps to the Adriatic" (they freed it only as far as Milan, stopping short of Venice) and Napoleon III's demand for the Piedmontese territories of Nice (Nizza) and Savoy (Savoia), opened a rift between the two powers, which Bismarck slid into. He agreed that the Prussians would attack the Austrians in Bohemia if the Italians would attack them in Venetia. By making an ally of France's protégé, Bismarck not only opened a second front against the Austrians, he insured that if the 1866 campaign became a long war, the Italians would not mobilize with the French against Prussia.
Bismarck also attempted to sow insurrection inside Austria. The Hungarians were the Habsburg Monarchy's most restive nationality, and Bismarck organized and paid for a Hungarian legion under Georg Klapka, which actually deployed in Upper Silesia to fight the Austrian army. Klapka's military contribution was nugatory, but his threat of civil war inside Austria undercut Austrian Emperor Franz Joseph I's resolve to fight the war to the bitter end. As Bismarck needed a short war-to prevent neutrals from interfering-this was a crucial contribution.
The war itself, the "military dimension of the rivalry," confirmed Prussian professionalism. The Austrian army retained an inefficient, politicized structure designed for peacetime and unsuited for war. The Austrian general staff wielded little real power, which was concentrated instead in the 36-year-old emperor's military cabinet. Moreover, command on the all-important northern front was given to General Ludwig Benedek for political reasons. He was a popular commoner, and known in the public mouth as "the second Radetzky." Unlike Radetzky, however, Benedek proved hesitant and incompetent. He mobilized slowly, deployed to Moravia, not Bohemia, and then tried to flank march into the path of the Prussians. Defeated in a sequence of frontier battles at Vsyokov, Skalice and Jicin, he then made the ultimate error of resting at Königgrätz with his back to the Elbe and permitting his North Army to be enveloped and routed by three Prussian armies. Throughout, the emperor weakly chided Benedek from Vienna, but took no steps to remove him until it was too late.
Prussian arrangements were far more professional. The Prussian King Wilhelm I vested total authority in his efficient general staff chief Helmuth von Moltke and defended that vital chain of command against all inroads by Prussian generals who distrusted Moltke, resented his powers and criticized his division of the Prussian army into three groups that were vulnerable-had Benedek been quicker-as they traversed the Sudeten 10-6
The Franco-German Rivalry Mountains into Bohemia. Buttressed by the king and Bismarck-who traveled with the great headquarters-Moltke rapidly defeated the Austrians, permitting the realization of all of Bismarck's aims. As the war wound down, Bismarck renounced annexations to avoid provoking a coalition of neutrals against him and to make it easier after the war to ally with the Austrians. "My two greatest difficulties were first getting the King of Prussia into Bohemia and then getting him out again," Bismarck later chuckled.

Prussia's unexpected and rapid victory provoked an angry outcry in France. Bismarck's defeat of the Austrians and annexation of the north German states took a Franco-German Europe dominated by France and turned it on its head. The defining asymmetry in the relationship-French unity vs. German disunity-had been abruptly undone. The French called it the "surprise de Sadova": the surprise of a suddenly enlarged Prussia ("une Prusse colossale"), that now, with only half of Germany under its belt, possessed the population, national wealth, and armed strength to overshadow France. Finally, France recognized that it was in a strategic competition with Prussia, rather than a mentor relationship. "Grandeur is relative," privy counselor Pierre Magne cautioned the emperor. "A country's power can be diminished by the mere fact of new forces accumulating around it." Senator Lucien Murat warned that it was only a matter of time before the Prussians attacked France to extinguish Napoleon III's German influence.

The Austro-Prussian War had terminated so quickly that Napoleon III had been unable to intervene and shape the diplomatic settlement. A month after Königgrätz, the French emperor had desperately demanded "the borders of 1814," which referred to the 10-7
The Franco-German Rivalry great square of German territory on the left bank of the Rhine annexed by France during the wars of the French Revolution and returned to the German states after Waterloo. Bismarck ignored the demand; how could he sell the imperative of German unification to the German people if he was prepared even to discuss the cession of Karlsruhe, Mannheim, Koblenz and Luxembourg to the French? Bismarck then dictated peace to the Austrians, abolished the German Confederation and drew new borders in Germany without consulting the great powers. Prussia annexed 1,300 square miles of German territory, adding 7 million subjects. It also took indirect control of Saxony, Hessia, Thuringia, Mecklenburg, Hamburg, Bremen and Lübeck in a new "North German Confederation" in which Prussia controlled military and foreign affairs. Whereas Prussia had counted just one-third the inhabitants of France in 1820 and less than half in 1860, the Austro-Prussian War and the annexations almost evened the score: giving the North German Confederation a population of 30 million to France's 38 million and a Prussian army one-third larger than France's (many times larger in wartime) thanks to the Prussian use of universal conscription. It also added greatly to Prussian economic muscle. France, once Continetal Europe's great economic power slid down the ranks. Already in 1867 the coal mines of Prussia and the North German Confederation were out-producing French mines three-to-one.
With the annexations and amalgamations of 1866, the Prussian army grew from 70 to 105 infantry regiments, from ten corps to seventeen. Already in 1867, most of the North German armies had been seamlessly integrated with Prussian doctrine, drill, uniforms, and even officers.

Napoleon III spent the years 1866-70 peevishly trying to assert French leadership of Europe and mastery of Germany, even though, or possibly because, his "authoritarian empire" had become stale and unpopular. Republican, anti-regime forces were strengthening and Louis-Napoleon's only sure-fire source of popularity was an activist foreign policy in search of bold strokes and "national dignity." Yet even in this sphere, the emperor presided over a sequence of embarrassing flops. In 1863, he tried and failed to reconstitute an independent Poland over Austrian, Russian, and Prussian resistance. In 1866, he failed to wrest German territory from Bismarck after Königgrätz. In 1867, he failed to secure compensation for Prussia's German annexations in either Belgium or Luxembourg.

In French parliamentary elections in 1869, the emperor's flagging government was repudiated with more than 50 percent of voters expressing opposition to the regime. Out of options-even French army troops, given the vote for the first time, had voted against himthe emperor rather wildly (and cynically) began to ponder "a good war" (une bonne guerre) to rally the French. Prussia, he argued, had stymied his planned bold stroke in Germany and insulted French national dignity in the process. Thus, the French emperor drew "red lines" around Prussia after the humiliation of 1866. Further, he insisted on a largely Catholic South German Confederation (Bavaria, Württemberg, and Baden) that would deny that region and its 8 million additional Germans (and 200,000 additional troops) to Bismarck and make the southern states dependent on France for their defense and independence.
South Germany was critical to France's military fortunes; if the Prussians controlled it, they'd be still richer, bigger, and able to invade France on a broad front from the Prussian Rhineland in the north to Alsace-Lorraine in the south. Geography and position had historically been an asymmetry that favored France against Voltaire's "kingdom of mere border strips." Prussia's spread south would change that asymmetry in Berlin's favor, enabling Moltke to plan the sort of broad, concentric invasion of France that he'd used so successfully against the Austrians in 1866. Thus, in 1868, Napoleon III warned the British foreign secretary that if Bismarck tried to annex South Germany, "our guns will go off of themselves." 
10
The Franco-Prussian War arose from Napoleon III's need to humble and weaken the Prussians and Bismarck's need to provoke a French invasion of Germany that might serve to complete the process of German unification. Bismarck forged defense agreements with the South German states, assuring the involvement of their armies in the event of war. This was another feat of Bismarckian politics; in a few short years, Bismarck had reversed an asymmetry favoring the French: military strength. Enlarged by the North German Confederation plus the allied South German armies, Prussia added seven corps between 1866 and 1870 and became a million-man army. With just 400,000 troops, France found itself exceedingly vulnerable. Both sides now pushed for war, Napoleon III recklessly, to nip Prussian growth in the bud, Bismarck prudently, to cast Prussia as a victim of French arrogance and to complete national unification. Once again, the French displayed alarming strategic negligence. They knew the dangers of Prussian military organization-"the energy and speed of your movements [mean] that we're in danger of finding you in Paris one day unannounced," the French Empress Eugénie had complained to the Prussian ambassador after Königgrätz. "I will go to sleep French and wake up Prussian." 
11
The Franco-German Rivalry in the interwar period, the French did nothing to improve the speed and energy of their movements to stymie the Prussian war machine.
The French government also failed to complete the key rail line (Verdun to Metz) to the eastern frontier. Moreover, the war ministry failed to make any arrangements to take the railways under government control. The French army also retained its extraterritorial and "non-divisioning" system to make the army a school of the nation despite the fact that the Austrians-with the same system-had required two months to mobilize in 1866 and, as a result, been overwhelmed by the vastly more efficient Prussians. No matter. The French, with a smug belief in their ability to improvise-le système D, on se débrouillera toujours-kept their battalions scattered around France and the overseas possessions, while planning to form divisions on an ad-hoc basis during mobilization. 
12
13
Bismarck's messaging was easier, more credible, and shrewder. The right of Germans to unify was generally accepted in all but the most reactionary circles. Bismarck used German nationalism, which had not yet earned a bad name, to conceal his aggressive strokes against the powers that hemmed him in. This gave Prussia a distinct advantage; Germans and neutral great powers alike rallied to the calm, sensible Prussian "optics": that Bismarck sought nothing more than German unity. In each crisis-the Luxembourg Crisis of 1867, the Zollparlament crisis of 1868, and then three successive crises in 1870, which culminated in the Spanish throne crisis that sparked the war-Bismarck appeared merely to be defending German sovereignty, whereas Napoleon III appeared in every crisis the reactionary, petulant aggressor.
The Franco-German Rivalry Those crises demonstrated how shrewdly Bismarck actively managed the strategic competition, always with an eye on international opinion. "Great crises provide the weather for Prussia's growth," he liked to say. 
14
And so in the Luxembourg Crisis of 1867, in which Napoleon III demanded the Dutch fortress town of Luxembourg-which had doubled as a fortress of the German Confederation-as compensation for the Prussian gains in 1866 and French "benevolence," Bismarck quietly engaged the British (who feared that a French step into Luxembourg might carry them into Belgium), and then agreed only to neutralize the place. Bismarck had won all sorts of dividends in this; he appeared the "reasonable man" to the British. He avoided a public relations disaster inside Germany by merely neutralizing but not ceding the territory to the unpopular French. Better still, he enraged and humiliated Napoleon III. ("When a hunter is ashamed of returning from the chase with an empty bag, he goes to the butcher, buys a rabbit and stuffs it into his bag, letting the ears flop out. Voilà le Luxembourg," Adolphe Thiers, one of the emperor's most persistent critics, hooted in the Legislative Body.) 
15
Bismarck managed another aspect of the strategic competition between France and Prussia just as carefully. South Germany was Catholic, and so inclined to accept French protection in the event that the Protestant Prussians tried to annex the southern states, as opposed to merely federating and cooperating economically with them. To Bismarck, leaving the political and cultural obstacles separating Germany's North and South to resolve themselves naturally might take decades to overcome. But a French invasioneven better, a Napoleonic invasion-would smash the obstacles down in an instant. Francophobia lingering from the Napoleonic Wars would set the war machinery of the North German Confederation in motion and put the South German armies at Moltke's disposal. Thus, discreetly goading Louis-Napoleon would not only make it likely that the 10-11
The Franco-German Rivalry French emperor would alienate neutral powers, but that he would alienate his South German protégés as well.
The crises that eventually provoked the war-three successive crises in 1870-Bismarck engineered to cast France in the worst possible light. First, Bismarck floated the idea that the Prussian king might take the title "German emperor," to more accurately reflect his control of the North German Confederation. The French reacted indignantly to the provocation, threatening war, which made them appear increasingly reckless to the other powers. Bismarck then supported constructing a railway from Prussia to Italy via Switzerland, which, in a public speech, he called a "strategic interest." Again, the French government and legislature reacted furiously. The final crisis, which triggered the war, was the Spanish throne crisis. Having offered a Hohenzollern candidate to Madrid, the Prussian king then withdrew him from the running when faced with French threats of war. There the matter should have rested, but Napoleon III upped the ante, demanding not only withdrawal of the Hohenzollern candidate, but a pledge by the Prussians that they would never again offer a candidate for the Spanish throne. This was regarded all over Europe and the world as unconscionable arrogance, for it reopened a war scare that had seemed settled by the Prussian king's climb-down.

17
Bismarck made it all but impossible for Austria to join the war by appealing to the monarchy's increasingly influential Hungarian political elite. Austria had become Austria-Hungary in 1867, and Budapest had received its own parliament and government in part through Bismarck's encouragement. Bismarck saw Hungary's veto power over Austrian decision-making as vital to curbing any resumption of Old Austrian-i.e., anti-Prussianpolicy, and his ministrations bore fruit in 1870 when the Hungarian prime minister, Gyula Andrássy, counseled against intervention in the Franco-Prussian War. Bismarck drew off the Italians by taking their side against the Pope in the ongoing struggle for Rome, at a 10-12
The Franco-German Rivalry time when the French were still witlessly defending the Papal State-to Italy's chagrinwith a large garrison in the Holy City. Russia, in 1870, was the most important off-stage actor. Whereas Gramont merely assumed that the Russians would not support the creation of a great German state that might eventually menace Russia, Bismarck secretly purchased Russian benevolence by pledging to support repeal of the restrictions on the Russian Navy in the Black Sea that had restricted Russian movements since the Crimean War.
The military dimension of the rivalry now proceeded without outside interference, which was precisely what Bismarck had planned for. France's army had had four years to react to the lessons of the Austro-Prussian War, but presented itself in 1870 as an only superficially reformed force. Vital changes had simply not been made due to bureaucratic infighting, turf wars, political interference, and the pathetic inertia that increasingly affected the drifting Second Empire. The general staff had not been empowered. The pace of mobilization had not been improved. The army organization remained primitive, without a permanent division structure. Only infantry tactics had been reformed, but in a wooden way-defensive at all times-and without accompanying changes in artillery and cavalry equipment and tactics. Indeed the Franco-Prussian War would be an artillery war; the Prussians had rearmed with Krupp steel breech-loaders, while the French retained their bronze muzzle-loading cannons. In every battle, the superior Prussian guns would hammer the French artillery, infantry, and cavalry and put them to rout.
Ultimately, the French were defeated almost before the first shot was fired. Napoleon III insisted on taking command of the Army of the Rhine despite his inexperience. That alienated the putative commander-Marshal Achille Bazaine-who sulked and did nothing throughout the deployment phase in July 1870, giving Moltke a head-start to cross into Lorraine and Alsace and begin enveloping the French army with three widespread columns, the same operational approach he had used against the Austrians in 1866. Stunned and thrown back at Froeschwiller and Gravelotte in August 1870, the French Army of the Rhine broke into two pieces. Marshal Patrice MacMahon's piece retreated toward Paris, turning eventually north to Sedan. Bazaine's piece retreated into the fortress of Metz. Every pundit and analyst active at the time goggled in disbelief at French incompetence. With their vast reserve system, the Prussians were easily able to replace casualties and even increase their field army as the war lengthened. With their derisory garde mobile, the French were not. Moltke was, therefore, able to hive off a single army to maintain the siege against Bazaine, and then send three armies to encircle MacMahon and his reinforcements at Sedan. In just a month of fighting, the Prussians captured or destroyed the entire French army, including the emperor himself, who was taken prisoner at Sedan. As in 1866, the Prussian king defended Moltke's authority, enabling the general to move his vast armies efficiently across a broad theater of war and execute decisive victories.
The Franco-German Rivalry
Bismarck overreached in 1871. In earlier wars and crises, he had been unimpeachably moderate. "We don't live alone in Europe," he regularly reminded King Wilhelm I and the generals, "but with three other powers who hate us." Like most Germans of his generationmolded by wicked tales of Napoleon-Bismarck had a real loathing of France. He would not show France the moderation he had shown the Austrians. He not only feared France's resurgence (for which he wanted insurance), he feared republics, and France had become one after its defeat at Sedan. Thus, Bismarck annexed Alsace-Lorraine and demanded reparations of five billion francs-sixty times the indemnity he had charged the Austrians in 1866. The addition of South Germany plus Alsace-Lorraine to an already enlarged Prussia eclipsed French power. "You have a new world, new influences at work … The balance of power has been entirely destroyed," Benjamin Disraeli observed from London.

The total defeat of reactionary forces in the Boulanger and Dreyfus Affairs meant that French republicans after 1900 could embark on a vast militarization of society without fear of strengthening anti-republican forces. Until then, the army had been a haven for monarchist cliques and conspiracies. The post-Dreyfus change in the French army led to a disturbing new asymmetry in the relationship: French spending on the military was so high and the French draft so extensive that France matched German military efforts, despite Germany's economic and demographic superiority. This was accomplished by conscripting .75 percent of their population in the years before 1914 compared with German conscription of .47 percent. Thus it was that in 1914, 2 million French troops faced 1.7
The Franco-German Rivalry million Germans. That said, because the Germans drafted a smaller fraction of eligible males, they were able to train those they did better and could endow them with more heavy artillery, leading to better results in the Great War. The Germans also had much bigger reserves contained in their larger, younger population.
Net assessment methods became more institutionalized and professional in this period. The Prussian victories in 1866 and 1870-71 had enshrined the general staff everywhere, and every European army became better at gauging its relative strengths and weaknesses. Indeed, the arms races that preceded World War I were premised on net assessments that sought-in every power-to level the playing field. This was a quite different state of affairs from 1866 and 1870-71, when the Prussians had plotted shrewdly in both conflicts, but the Austrians and French had lurched haphazardly and unintelligently into war, with little truly professional net assessment.

The Franco-German Rivalry support in its own quest for colonies like Libya-remained as German allies. Bismarck had always said that Germany needed to be "one of three on the European chessboard," but he would never have gone to war with a trio like this.
The asymmetry in political structure-a balanced, democratic republic in Paris versus an irresponsible camarilla in Berlin-deeply affected the rivalry. German military and naval planners were free to provoke the world with their aggressive, unchecked procurement, planning (the Schlieffen Plan was an open secret) and saber-rattling over issues like Bosnia and Morocco. On the surface, the French réveil national was far less threatening; it emanated from the country's parliamentary and presidential system and lodged itself in a powerful, credible coalition. Overall, German braggadocio and freelancing facilitated the great diplomatic revolution that would eventually destroy the German Empire: the Triple Entente of France, Russia, and Britain.
The rivalry de-escalated for a time in this period. The chief factor in the de-escalation was the nature of the French Third Republic. It was democratic, and the French people, in general, gradually lost their fascination with Alsace-Lorraine and the "blue line of the Vosges." In 1870, Tsar Alexander II had opined that Berlin "had created an inexpugnable hatred between the two peoples," and indeed the Germans had, for a time, but tempers had cooled by 1914. Urban aesthetes and peasants alike rejected war for the "lost provinces." "As for me," French thinker Remy de Gourmont wrote on the eve of World War I, "I wouldn't give the little finger of my right hand for those forgotten provinces. My hand needs it to rest on as I write. Nor would I give the little finger of my left hand. I need it to flick the ash from my cigarette." 
23
The Dreyfus Affair, which dragged on from 1894 to 1906, ended the "golden age" of the French army that had run for twenty years after the war of 1870-71. The army's squalid comportment in the Dreyfus Affair-framing a Jewish officer to whip up anti-Semitism and undermine the republic-replaced the "golden age" with a deep distrust of the military. When the French war minister appeared before the Assembly in 1899 and declaimed-in the usual way-that "the army belongs to no party; it belongs to France," he was met with jeers and insults, so deeply was the French military discredited by its political machinations.
Bismarck would have noted this calming of the French temper and encouraged it with deft concessions or mere forbearance. His successors under Kaiser Wilhelm II lacked his moderation. The French réveil national-which made Alsace-Lorraine its center-piece again-began in 1911 after the Second Moroccan Crisis. In 1905 and again in 1911, the 10-16
The Franco-German Rivalry Germans had bid for French Morocco and had been repulsed, but had inflicted humiliating diplomatic blows on the French in both episodes: forcing the resignation of French foreign minister Théophile Delcassé in 1905 and shearing off French Congo in 1911. The second crisis led to the dismissal of Joseph Caillaux's government, which had worked for détente with the Germans, and the appointment of "Poincaré la guerre": Raymond Poincaré, a revanchist Lorrainer, determined to embark on a more confrontational policy with the Germans. 
24
25
After 1911, the French army grew sharply and became a threat to the Germans. Military service was restored to three years in 1913, and the French added artillery, machineguns and aviation. The Franco-German rivalry, that had burned for twenty years after 1871 and then cooled considerably during France's internecine Dreyfus Affair, sparked into life again after 1911. There was a lack of strategic discernment displayed by both France and Germany in this last phase of the rivalry. The French had seemingly come to terms with the loss of Alsace-Lorraine. Jules Ferry had successfully rebuked revanchists in the 1890s thus: "You'll make us believe that you prefer Alsace-Lorraine to France," and Ferry had embarked on an overseas empire to replace the losses of 1871. Now the French swerved back to an unhelpful obsession with the provinces, not for strategic reasons-the lost frontier had been sealed with a belt of new fortresses from Verdun to Belfort in the 10-17
The Franco-German Rivalry 1870s-but for opportunistic political ones. 
26
For their part, the post-Bismarck Germans were witlessly alienating every great power that mattered: the French in the Moroccan Crises and outrages like the Zabern Affair of 1913; the British with their Navy Race and colonial offensives; and the Russians with their tariffs on grain, military build-up and unyielding support for Austria-Hungary in the Balkans. The figure of Kaiser Wilhelm II loomed large. Group-think dominated his councils, where ministers and service chiefs were selected for their tractability, not their sound advice. The Kaiser wanted his "place in the sun," and his generals, admirals, and ministers would have to provide it, at almost any cost. This, then, accelerated the rivalry toward war. Neither side had a firm grip on the tiller, for both sides were milking the rivalry for domestic-political benefit; concessions were viewed on both sides as weakness and cause even for a change of government. The Germans had used "fleet policy" and "world policy" to try to drum up popular support for an increasingly unpopular regime. The réveil national pointed less to the strength of the republic in France than to the weakness and tenuousness of republican institutions: the need to attire them in pomp and glory that could be found only in the army. This period was rife with strategic miscalculations and just plain nonsense. French diplomacy was generally strong-making sure to lock in British and Russian support-but French military planning did not keep step. This was in part because of the purges undertaken after the Dreyfus Affair. Many good French officers were driven into the wilderness along with the bad ones. To make the army "politically correct," officers' eating habits (did they eat fish or meat on Fridays?) and church attendance (a bad thing in a determinedly secular republic) were cause for demotion or dismissal. Fewer bright thinkers remained to contest the tactical innovations of General Joseph Joffre (named General Staff chief in 1911) and the head of the French war college Colonel Louis Grandmaison. Joffre was stolid not brilliant; a deputy said of his choice to lead the army, "in a democracy, every fat man is a good man." He'd been chosen for his girth and amiability as well as his willingness to play the game. 
27
Joffre and Grandmaison worked up Plan XVII and new tactics to win the next war. Offensive doctrine was undertaken to undercut Germany's technical and material advantages (more heavy artillery, three times as many NCOs.) Quality (of red-trousered French infantry) was sacrificed to quantity. At the French war college, General Ferdinand Foch propounded the following formula as if it were all one needed to know: "war = moral superiority of the victors, moral depression of the vanquished." No account was taken of the real lessons of the Franco-Prussian War, that casualties had been far higher than in 1866, and would be ruinous in an age of quick-firing artillery and machineguns (of which the French had only half as many as the Germans in 1914.) Joffre and Grandmaison also 10-18   The Franco-German Rivalry eschewed the defensive-the flaw in 1870-71. Rather, they would mass their armies on the eastern frontier, and attack the Germans with the bayonet, emphasizing the "moral element." When more prudent and scientific officers like General Philippe Pétain or Foch (awaking from his war college reveries), protested that the offensive doctrines would not succeed in age of trenches, machineguns and quick-firing artillery, they were reassigned. 
28
Whereas the French focused on Germany as their main rival down to 1914, the Germans wavered on this question. By 1914, they were alarmed by the revival of the French military, but they had competing concerns. Berlin tended to view Russia as the most threatening land power, Chancellor Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg famously instructing a relative not to plant new trees on his East Prussian estate "because the Russians would conquer it" before the trees matured. The Germans viewed the British as the most threatening naval, colonial, and economic power and the one keeping them from their "place in the sun." Britenhass-hatred of Britain-would be the most conspicuous German emotion in 1914. The French, on the other hand, could focus on the Germans because of the Triple Entente coalition that they had assembled to guard their flanks. The Germans were more reckless, eschewing the prudent rapprochements with the various powers that would have permitted them to focus their strength on a single rival and instead inviting an unwinnable confrontation with them all.
Both rivals expected 1914 to decide the rivalry in the manner of 1870. France's Plan XVII called for a brutal stab into the heart of Germany by the massed French army. Germany's Schlieffen Plan would envelop that French thrust from the flank, seize Paris, compel the surrender of the French and British armies, and then turn everything against the Russians in the east. Both visions failed to materialize. Moltke the Younger reduced Schlieffen's mighty "right hook" from sixteen corps to eleven in order to attempt a double envelopment of the French from Belgium and Lorraine. Schlieffen had always demanded a ratio of 7:1 between the right and left wings of the German army in France; Moltke reduced the ratio to 3:1. Logistics also undercut the Schlieffen Plan; the further the Germans advanced from their railheads (140 kilometers in the case of the First Army), the fewer critical supplies they received. All of the armies began to run low on ammunition, as 10-19

The figure of Bismarck loomed over this rivalry from beginning to end. He had served as a kind of magician, achieving a unity that no one had thought possible. Germany had been divided at the Congress of Vienna precisely to deny its awesome potential to a single great power. Bismarck overcame this division by deftly isolating his most incorrigible enemies and managing "off-stage actors" like Britain and Russia that might have interfered with his plans.
Magicians are a rare breed, and Bismarck's successors proved less competent at directing the rivalry with France that might have been peacefully managed-to Germany's long-term benefit-by better, more supple leaders. Unfortunately, the entourage of Wilhelm II contained no such men. France recovered smartly from the defeat of 1870-71, but vacillated dangerously through the period until 1914. Leaders like Ferry and Delcassé tried to make the country forget Alsace-Lorraine, which it largely did. But military affairs once-again became a hot-button issue in the Third Republic. Before the Dreyfus Affair, the army (covertly) assailed the republic for its "cowardice" vis-à-vis the Germans. After the affair, and the taming of the army, the republic itself seized upon the army and its Continental aims as a way to rejuvenate and legitimize itself. Thus, Alsace-Lorraine was dragged back into the center of the frame by the réveil national. Both France and Germany would have had a far happier and more prosperous twentieth century had they resisted the pull-by generals, journalists, and politicians-to war, but they didn't. The rivalry would bathe itself again in blood.
Like most rivalries, this one saw perceptions of relative power change radically. Underdogs until 1870, the Germans emerged after Sedan as the top dog, relegating France to the underdog role. The Germans overplayed their hand, insisting eventually on a global dominance that called every major power into the field against Berlin, while France made the most of its own downward spiral. A France that had been isolated and threatening under Napoleon III, suddenly became alliance-worthy. Because Germany had become so powerful and obnoxious (insisting on European and overseas domination under Wilhelm II), France
The Franco-German Rivalry emerged as a helpful makeweight to the Russians in 1892, and then to the British in 1904. The timeless lesson is clear. A power eclipsed by another is not disarmed; on the contrary, it can use military deterrents, alliances, finances, trade, and levers of the media and public opinion (soft power) to improve its relative situation and thwart the "winner." How did this strategic competition end? The French won. But in their own efforts to win the peace, they antagonized a Germany that was really only lightly wounded by the Treaty of Versailles. True, the Germans surrendered 13 percent of their pre-war territory (25,000 square miles) and 10 percent of their population (6.5 million subjects), and their army and navy were reduced to 100,000 troops and a dozen lightweight ships, but the Germans remained the most potent power in a Central European space that had become a contested vacuum with the breakup of Austria-Hungary and the retreat of Soviet Russia. The advantage in "optics" would flip again, the Germans after 1919 becoming a victim of French pride and revengeand merely trying to reclaim areas that were "rightfully theirs"-the French an overweening victor. Germany would rebound to defeat France in 1940.

Throughout most of recorded human history, empires have been the normal way of organising people into political units. Naturally they have come in different shapes, sizes, structures, and powers. Looking specifically at the British and American empires, both were, more often than not, extended by private explorers, farmers, and businessmen rather than by the state; both were dominated by whites; both (eventually) were democracies; both supported private enterprise; both insisted that they were bringing the blessings of civilisation and good government to those who had suffered by their lack; and both justified the use of force as a way of providing those blessings. There were also distinct differences. The British had created a seaborne empire, while for most of its existence, the American empire has been land-based. Most important of all, the British empire was a colonial empire, while the United States, once it had conquered the land from sea to shining sea and gone through its Philippine phase, was much less a colonial empire than the semi-controller of a range of client states-besides, once it reached its apogee in the mid-twentieth century, there was not a lot of "empty" territory left to conquer and colonise. Economic interests in particular often brought them into conflict, but, partly because of the similarities and in spite of the differences, the two empires often worked together against threats from others.
Looking at the period from the beginning of the War of 1812 (called the American War in Britain while it was taking place) to the outbreak of the Second World War, there are three overarching themes.
• First of all, where the two empires shared borders, such as the Canadian-American border, there was repeated conflict, military, diplomatic, or economic.
• Secondly, when there was no common enemy, such as in Latin America, there was competition.
• And thirdly, where there was a common enemy, such as in the Far East, there was co-operation.
There was also a trajectory. In 1812, they were both expanding empires, but the British empire was already global, while the American was continent-bound. During the nineteenth century, while the United States was manifesting its destiny westwards, it was also an economic, social, and cultural colony of Great Britain; however, in the 11-1
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940 thirty years from the acceleration of its own industrial revolution to after the end of the Civil War, the United States surpassed Britain industrially.

Comparing the general positions and powers of the two empires is illuminating. First, Great Britain was a small island nation with a large and growing seaborne empire, while the United States was a large, continental nation with a growing land-based empire. (This began to change in 1867 with the annexation of the Midway Islands, a movement that accelerated in 1898.) Despite being an island nation, Britain was extremely vulnerable to invasion, as had been demonstrated by the Romans, the Angles, the Saxons, the Jutes, the Danes, the Normans, and the Dutch; only with the growth in the strength and power of the Royal Navy could Britain feel safe enough to explore and conquer across the wide oceans. By contrast, fundamentally the United States in the nineteenth century was unconquerable by an outside power, although it was perfectly capable of destroying itself. Yet during the entire period from 1812 to 1940, the British army and navy were larger than those of the United States, and overwhelmingly so in the nineteenth century. During this time, Great Britain was occupied primarily with imperial activities, problems dealt with by the Indian Army, made up of Indians but officered by the British in a ratio of roughly two to one; in the mid-1860s, they totalled about 180,000. In addition, there were in 1870 roughly another 120,000 members of the armed forces.

There were other points of strength as well. First was natural resources, and these the United States had in abundance; what it lacked for much of the nineteenth century was a wide range of domestically manufactured goods, and for many of these it depended on imports from Britain. Conversely, except for coal and iron, Britain was depended considerably more on imports of raw materials, such as timber for its ships before steel was used and cotton for its textile industry, than was the United States. But this hardly mattered, because where the British empire was supreme was in its financial and commercial power, and it could purchase what it needed. During the nineteenth century, the City of London was the world's financial centre, while the pound sterling was the world's primary transaction and reserve currency. Not only did the city finance, for example, the building of the Argentine railway system and the movement of the Southern US cotton crop to market, it was the home of the Bank of England, essentially the manager if not the controller of the gold standard. But there is another important point about this financial strength, which is that it enabled Britain to carry out a wide-ranging and influential foreign policy, including the wherewithal to subsidise allies. At the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, the Prussians helped to turn the tide, and the Prussians were subsidised by Britain; during the First World War, Britain financed or guaranteed the purchases in the United States of France, Russia, Italy, Belgium, Greece, and Rumania. 
6
There were two more important components of British strength during this period-diplomatic and naval power. Looking at diplomacy, Britain was excellent at manoeuvring countries less powerful than it was, but it was also exceptionally good at building coalitions, especially with the European Powers. The United States suffered for a good part of its history from the general lack of status of diplomats-often called cookie-pushers-and men of ability tended to look elsewhere for careers. At the same time, it feared the ability of crafty Europeans, and especially of the British, to outwit and cheat Americans. Strong distrust was never absent from Anglo-American relations.
The second component was British strength on the oceans and seas. From the time of the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805, when the Royal Navy under the command of Admiral Horatio Nelson essentially destroyed the French and Spanish fleets, and particularly after 1815, Great Britain was the dominant naval power. This did not necessarily mean that it physically controlled the oceans; rather, it controlled the Western Approaches to the UK and Ireland, and the Narrow Seas around Europe, the Baltic, and the Mediterranean, as well as strategic waters elsewhere:
• Gibraltar controlled the western Mediterranean;
• Malta gave it control of the central basin of the Mediterranean;
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940
• Alexandria controlled the eastern Mediterranean, including the entrances and exits from the Black Sea and the Suez Canal;
• Simonstown kept an eye on the Indian Ocean and the route to India, the Antipodes, and the Far East;
• control of the Channel protected the home islands, the Low Countries, and access to the Baltic Ocean, the last-named hemming in Russia;
• the West Indies Squadron protected economic interests in Central and South America;
• the Atlantic Squadron based at Halifax protected Canada and, at the same time, the east coast of the United States; and the fleet in the South China Sea protected British interests in China.
The Royal Navy also patrolled the sea lanes, supported by a network of some 157 principal coaling stations around the world that it controlled or to which it had access (much envied by the Americans, although many were open to American ships after 1815), protecting the largest merchant marine in the world. 
7
A brief comparison with the American Navy is illuminating. In the 1880s, the Royal Navy had 367 modern warships, while the United States had fewer than 90, only 48 of which could fire a gun and 38 of which were made of wood. In 1889, however, a near war with Germany over Samoa drew Americans' attention to the fact that the United States Navy ranked twelfth in the world, behind those of the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Chinese empires, none of which were noted naval powers. Congress now responded by appropriating the funds for the first three modern armoured battleships in the United States Navy; in 1904, fourteen battleships and thirteen armoured cruisers were being built simultaneously in American shipyards. 
8
With the Treaty of Paris of 1783, Great Britain recognised the independence of the United States. However, both sides found it difficult to shake loose from each other. Many British, and indeed Europeans, doubted that a republic would have the internal strength to survive, and many expected that, sooner or later, the new country would fall apart, allowing Britain and others, such as Spain, France, and Russia, to pick up some of the pieces (this expectation was nearly fulfilled, although it would take eighty years and the Civil War for it to be tested and found to be wrong). For their part, many Americans expected to continue to enjoy the economic and especially trading privileges that they had enjoyed as part of the empire, even though they had rejected it. The British for their part were incredulous at the American expectation that commercial life could go on as before the separation. 
9
The American territorial objective was to conquer Canada, which the United States assumed would not be difficult. Thomas Jefferson, for example, wrote in August 1812 that "The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighbourhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us experience for the attack of Halifax the next, and the final expulsion of England from the American continent." 
10
For the British, the war was defensive, in that its primary goal was to retain Canada, and in general to end the United States' ability to threaten the British colonies in America. (Before the Revolution, Great Britain had had twenty-three American colonies; after 1783, it still had ten.) It also wanted to avenge the sufferings of the Canadians and, if possible, to redraw the Canadian-American border to make it more defensible. It is also likely that it wanted to humble the Americans.
Empires always fear unstable borders, since, unlike those of long-established states, they are not fixed by consent. A threat exists on the other side. Particularly bad stretches of the border, such as those between Maine and New Brunswick, in New York along the Niagara boundary, between Minnesota and Ontario, and just west of the Great
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940   Lakes around the Pigeon River Falls, desperately required precise delimitation. Without it, conflict continued, and in 1812 erupted into war. The ferocity was fed by the myriad small conflicts during the years since 1783 over parts of the border whose legality was denied by one or both sides. Most of the land battles of the War of 1812 were fought at and over that border (although the fact that a good deal of fighting took place in the south eastern part of the United States should not be forgotten).
Border conflict included attacks on each other's capitals. On April 27, 1813, Americans launched an assault against York (now Toronto), the village that served as the capital of Canada, and drove out the British soldiers. A surrender agreement was negotiated, whereby the United States commanders agreed to respect private property, allow the civil government to function, and permit doctors to treat the British wounded. Despite the agreement, during their week of occupation American soldiers, including some officers, broke into homes and robbed the Canadians, pillaged the church, and locked up the British and Canadian wounded without food, water, or medical attention for two days. At one point, the priest John Strachan rescued a woman who was about to be shot by the Americans while they were looting her house. Strachan's own pregnant wife was assaulted, robbed, and probably raped by a group of American soldiers. When the Americans withdrew, they set fire to the parliament buildings and the Governor's home-the Canadian equivalent of the Capitol and the White House.

The result was that for the remainder of the century, there were recurrent conflicts between the two empires over the place of the boundary between the United States and Canada, a thinly populated country. Why should both countries care? For the British, who had taken it from the French by conquest, it belonged to the empire and they were willing to fight for it. The Americans viewed things differently. God had clearly not intended that the United States end at the 48 degree parallel and they were convinced that, once conquered, the Canadians would rapidly embrace the blessings which being American would bring.
As a diversionary tactic, Britain tried to construct a balance of power by encouraging Texas to remain independent, which would weaken the United States and turn its attention from the northern border.

Anglo-American relationship was vital for both countries. Daniel Webster, the Secretary of State, shared that belief. 17
Central to Anglo-American conflict now was control of the Oregon Territory, comprising the future states of Oregon and Washington and the province of British Columbia. President Thomas Jefferson sent out the most famous exploring expedition in American history, that of Meriwether Lewis and William Clark, with instructions to explore, discover, and map a route to the West and especially to Oregon, to enable the infant nation to expand. 
18
19
During the Presidential election of 1844, candidates cried for war with Great Britain if it did not concede the American demands for Oregon in full, including a border set at "Fifty-four forty or fight," as trumpeted by the Senator from Ohio, William "Foghorn Bill" Allen.

21
In Latin America, Great Britain and the United States were strong competitors-or rather, the United States wanted American commercial expansion in Latin America, but came up against the commercial might of the British. This seemed wrong, since from the early days of the Republic, American expansion southwards was taken for granted-Thomas Jefferson, for example, considered Cuba "the most interesting addition that could ever be made to our system of States."

Americans, after all, were also a commercial and maritime people and since midcentury their interests had expanded into Central America and the Far East. But dramatically increasing this commercial expansion appeared an imperative after 1870. The Americans experienced their own industrial revolution, but the American market itself was not big enough to absorb the wheat and preserved meats produced by farmers or the huge increase in manufactures, and there was a real fear that, if these goods could not be sold, there would be depression, with rural and urban unrest and perhaps even uprisings. But wherever the United States turned, it found the British already in possession of markets. This was particularly galling in Latin America, since the United States saw the hemisphere as its own.
In 1895, the growing American desire for predominant influence in their own backyard clashed with an existing British interest, in a now-forgotten part of South America, and the Americans won. By 1895, US strength had increased hugely, as had its confidence in its conduct of foreign affairs. At the same time, Great Britain was feeling increasingly threatened by the European Powers. This combination resulted in a major adjustment in the relationship between the two empires. The locus for the change was some territory disputed between Venezuela and Great Britain. Venezuela called for American help, invoking the Monroe Doctrine, a call that the United States had in fact ignored for a number of years.

To-day the United States is practically sovereign on this continent, and its fiat is law upon the subjects to which it confines its interposition. Why? It is not because of the pure friendship or good will felt for it. It is not simply by reason of its high character as a civilized state, nor because wisdom and justice and equity are the invariable characteristics of the dealings of the United States. It is because, in addition to all other grounds, its infinite resources combined with its isolated position render it master of the situation and practically invulnerable as against any or all other powers.

To the disgust of the Prime Minister, the British Cabinet decided that it had to agree to arbitration (that, in fact, came to a conclusion that favoured the British position). 
34
• First of all, there were increasing threats from two imperial rivals, the French and Russian empires. There was chaos in the Ottoman Empire, where the Turks were slaughtering thousands of Armenians; the British feared that Russia would take advantage of the chaos to seize Constantinople and the Dardanelles Strait, that would allow Britain to move warships into the Mediterranean, instead of remaining bottled up in the Black Sea.
• Secondly, the Russians were making alarming progress in building railways southwards to the northern border of India; in addition Russia was trying to supplant the British position in Persia and Afghanistan-a contest termed the Great Game in Central Asia. In short, India was gravely threatened.
• Thirdly, France meanwhile was thrusting eastwards in Africa, trying to cut off the British drive to control a contiguous line of territories from the Cape to Cairo; indeed, they met at the headwaters of the Nile at Fashoda and had a not unfriendly stand-off (they dined together). However, the French had to withdraw because British control of the Mediterranean meant that the French troops could not be reinforced. France was also threatening the British position in the Far East, although not as much as was Russia, which was pushing through Siberia and into Manchuria through to Port Arthur. The problem here was the Dual (Franco-Russian) Alliance of 1892/94, which meant that Britain had to consider their threats as combined.
To cope with growing imperial problems, Britain had, in 1889, adopted a "twopower standard" policy, by which the Royal Navy had to be larger than the next two threatening fleets, which were those of France and Russia. 
35
36
How did the United States fit into this? Quite simply, the British Cabinet feared that if the United States was not accommodated in the Venezuelan matter, it would become so anti-British that if Britain went to war against one or more of the European Powers, the United States would join Britain's enemies, and the result would be a British defeat. In the larger scheme of things, Venezuela did not matter. Financial pressure had increased in Britain, not helped by expenditure on the 1899-1902 Boer War, and the Cabinet finally authorised reconfiguring British naval strength to meet 11-11   Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940   what it saw as increasing threats. In 1902, Britain concluded its first-ever peacetime alliance, the Anglo-Japanese Alliance. Japan's responsibility was to patrol the China Waters, enabling Britain to move part of its fleet to the Mediterranean to meet the increased French and Russian threats. A portion of the Mediterranean fleet was moved to join the Channel fleet, in order to protect the home islands and the Low Countries from the increasing threat from Germany.
As for the Western Hemisphere, it was assumed by the Cabinet that the United States and Great Britain would never again go to war-it would be, they felt, akin to a civil war if it happened-and thus the West Indies and the Atlantic Squadrons could be moved, letting Canada take care of its own defence and leaving the Americans in control of the Caribbean. Indeed, the Americans believed that they had, in effect, taken control of their own sphere of influence by driving the British away. They had certainly taken control, but the British saw things differently: because the two countries would not go to war with each other, it was perfectly safe for Great Britain to leave the Americans in charge of protecting British as well as American interests. In short, the British had incorporated the Americans into their defence strategy. Nevertheless, at the end of the century, the British Empire still held the "five strategic keys" that "lock up the world," controlling or patrolling from the great naval bases at
• Dover (the English Channel);
• Gibraltar (the western entrance to the Mediterranean);
• Alexandria (the eastern Mediterranean and the Suez Canal);
• Cape of Good Hope (the route to the Indian Ocean and the South Pacific); and
• Singapore (the Far East) 
37
The two empires were more co-operative in the Far East. Britain, of course, opened up China by means of the Opium War of 1842, while the United States opened up Japan by means of the "burning ships" (Japanese) or the "white fleet" (American) in 1856. Lin Yse-hsü, the governor of the Chinese province of Hu-Huang, was a man of integrity and high morals. In October 1838, he was instructed by the emperor to stamp out opium addiction in China. After dealing with many of the Chinese dealers by public strangling, he turned to the foreign smugglers of opium. The British were by far the most important, but every American trading house at Canton, the only port open to foreigners, also traded in opium. The biggest US trader, Russell & Company, which was also the third largest dealer in the Indian opium trade, was headed by Warren Delano, the grandfather of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. 
38
Lord Palmerston, the Foreign Secretary, was angry at the restrictions on trade. But he and the British government had a more important reason for intervening. The millions earned from smuggling opium into China were used to buy tea to sell at home. The duty on tea levelled by the British government had, since the late 1820s, raised £3 million a year, equal to half the yearly cost of the Royal Navy. At the beginning of June 1840, a large British expeditionary force, which included steam-powered gunboats and thousands of marines, arrived in China. Lin sent out eighty war junks, but many of them were blown out of the water. The raiders imposed a blockade, and then attacked and took control of strategically important sites along the China coast.

Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940   During this whole period and into the twentieth century, the Americans benefitted from the British willingness to allow them full access to Hong Kong for their ships both commercial and military and for their traders: all of the American trading houses had their headquarters on the island. Yet for the following half-century, they disagreed over Hong Kong. President Wilson's call for the self-determination of peoples became for liberal Americans an important principle, and Hong Kong was repeatedly the focus of the attention of President Franklin Roosevelt. In 1945, he nudged the British Colonial Secretary, Oliver Stanley, remarking that "I do not want to be unkind or rude to the British, but in 1841 [sic], when you acquired Hong Kong, you did not acquire it by purchase." Stanley snapped back, "Let me see, Mr President, that was about the time of the Mexican War, wasn't it?" by means of which the United States had acquired a good chunk of the Southwest. 
43
The British had opened up China to foreign trade; the Americans opened up Japan. In 1853, the American Commodore Matthew Perry began the forced opening up of the country by steaming defiantly into Edo (later Tokyo) Bay with a fleet of four very large ships, two of them black-hulled coal-burning steamships-the "burning ships" to the panic-stricken Japanese-that carried sixty-one guns and a crew of nearly a thousand men. Perry carried a letter from President Millard Fillmore to the Japanese, which asked that Japan open its borders to trade with the Americans; the United States also needed to use Japan as a coaling station on the way to China. Perry left, but warned that he would return. The Japanese fortified the harbour, but this failed to prevent the arrival of the Americans the following year with a considerably larger fleet.
Perry had been instructed to "do everything to impress" the Japanese "with a just sense of the power and greatness" of the United States. Consequently, he brought with him huge quantities of champagne and vintage Kentucky bourbon "to grease the wheels of diplomacy" and a pair of Colt six-shooters and a scale model train to display US technological advancement. He employed Chinese coolies and African-Americans to show the superiority of white over color, and he used uniforms and pageants as manifestations of American cultural supremacy.

45
During the next several years, Japan was increasingly forced to open its doors to foreign trade, a right that had been restricted to a small handful of Dutch traders on one island in Nagasaki harbour. After two years' negotiations, the Japanese in 1858 signed a new treaty with the Americans, the Treaty of Kanagawa, which increased trading privileges, but they delayed ratification. Then one morning Harris rushed to warn Japanese officials that a British fleet of forty ships was about to enter the Bay, followed by those of France, and that if the Japanese did not ratify the treaty with the United States before the British arrived, the British would insist on more extensive privileges. Furthermore, it was more honourable and seemly to sign a treaty to which they had agreed rather than have one imposed on them. The Japanese signed, and the enraged British were forced to accept what the Americans had agreed to, with the addition of a clause of their own covering woollens. 
46
47
There was one colony in the Far East where the United States reigned supreme, and this was the Philippine Islands, collected, along with Puerto Rico and Cuba, as a result of Spain's defeat in the 1898 Spanish-American War. The British positively encouraged the acquisition of the Philippines. Indeed, the full title of Kipling's poem was "The White Man's Burden: the United States and the Philippine Islands." Why might this be? A short answer was that the British empire was increasingly under threat from Russia, France, and Germany, and the British feared that if the Americans did not take the Philippines, the Germans would. Optimists among the British political élites, as well as journalists and commentators, believed that if the Americans had their own empire, they would stop criticising the British, and understand that the two countries had many of the same ideals and interests and should work together-they were "our American Cousins," after all, according to one writer. 
48
It is always a joy to me to meet an American…for I am one of those who believe that the folly of a monarch and the blundering of a Minister in fargone years will not prevent our children from being some day citizens of the same world-wide country under a flag that shall be a quartering of the Union Jack with the Stars and Stripes. 
49
When the United States was in Manila Bay preparing to invade the Philippines, the German fleet was also there, ready indeed to claim the islands if the Americans did not want them. The Americans had already decided that they did want them, along with Hawaii and Guam; furthermore, they had already mapped a number of Pacific islands and atolls. The Americans were trying to build a commercial empire exactly as the British had done in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries-although they did not think of it that way-and they needed the Philippines to protect their trading routes to China and Japan, as well as to provide supplies. A less obvious reason to grab the islands was the intention of the Navy Department to weaken Spain by depriving it of revenues from them: the squadron was first to destroy Spanish ships, then to capture Manila, and thereafter to blockade all of the principal ports.

54
The main point here is that, unlike in North America, the Far East saw Anglo-American co-operation rather than conflict. Great Britain aided the American conquest of the Philippines in a number of ways, as the United States supported the British during the Boer War of 1899-1902 while the European Powers did not. The major threat to both was Germany. Mutual Anglo-American support helped to limit the tearing apart of China by the Russians and Germans (France was gobbling up Indo-China) and, for a while, the expansion of the Japanese Empire. They all challenged the interests of the two empires, both of which feared the closing-off of markets.
From the nineteenth century until a few years after the end of the Second World War, Great Britain was the dominant Power in the Middle East, a position sometimes challenged by France, but maintained by the power of the Royal Navy, the Indian Army, and British financial power. The Americans accepted the position as a fact of international life, and increasingly benefitted by it, as during the Spanish-American War. Yet after the First World War, the need for oil began to drive them apart, a situation that ended with the Suez Crisis of 1956, by which the United States essentially ensured the final destruction of the British Empire.
A central component of British power in the region, as well as in other areas of the world, was for nearly a century their control of the Suez Canal. Built in 1869 by the French, within a decade, the British determined to control the Canal, the gateway to India, the Far East, and the Antipodes. When, in November 1875, the opportunity arose to secure a substantial block of shares in the Canal, Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli acted quickly. For political reasons, he could not ask Parliament for the money, since it would have been blocked; he could not ask the Bank of England, because providing that amount would have deranged the markets. So he turned to the Rothschilds, then the most important merchant or investment bank in the world. The story, as told by Disraeli's Principal Private Secretary, Montagu Corry, goes like this:
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940
Disraeli had arranged with him [the Secretary] that he should be in attendance…just outside the Cabinet room and, when his chief put out his head and said "Yes," should take immediate action. On this signal being given, he went off to New Court and told Rothschild in confidence that the Prime Minister wanted £4,000,000 "tomorrow"; Rothschild…picked up a muscatel grape, ate it, threw out the skin, and said deliberately, "What is your security?"

In 1882, there was an Egyptian nationalist revolt against their overlord, the Turkish Khedive, as Egypt was part of the Ottoman Empire. There were riots in Alexandria between Europeans fearing massacre and Egyptians fearing occupation; the revolt raised fears in Britain for the security of the Canal. The British fleet shelled Alexandria, and troops landed, securing the Canal; the British then fought their way to Cairo, and took control. Army and Naval Intelligence were keen to maintain their grip: they were becoming more and more convinced that the security of Imperial routes required direct control of the Canal, and the addition of a naval base at Alexandria, that, when added to those at Cyprus and Malta, would considerably strengthen Britain's regional position. Economic benefits were also foreseen: Egyptian long-staple cotton for Lancashire mills, markets for British exports, and opportunities for British investments. There was also the familiar British conviction that the Egyptians were unable to run their country effectively, and thus it would be a kindness to remain and do it for them. Therefore, British advisors were placed in all government departments, and British forces were stationed in the country. 
56
The second important step for Great Britain in the Near and Middle East concerned Persia, or later Iran. At the outset, its importance arose because it was a vital factor in the nineteenth century Great Game over Central Asia between the Russian and British Empires, with India the prize, but there was soon a second factor, and that was oil. In 1907, the two Powers divided Persia into spheres of influence, with the southwest of the country neutral territory between them. The British were soon to regret this, because an important oilfield was discovered there in 1908 by an Englishman, the oil from which Britain badly needed for the Royal Navy. In fact, the Navy would, in 1913, decide to equip all of its ships to be powered by oil rather than coal.

Next came Mesopotamia. On the 9th of December 1917, British troops led by General Sir Edmund Allenby, a soldier of great vigour and imagination, captured Jerusalem. At noon on the 11th of December, the General, the 34th conqueror of Jerusalem, together with his officers and some foreign diplomats and military attachés, dismounted at the Jaffa Gate. They entered the city on foot, out of respect for the status of Jerusalem as the Holy City of Christians, Jews, and Moslems. Allenby had been told to do so by London, who wanted everyone to notice that whereas the German Kaiser had entered the city on horseback, Allenby, like Jesus, had done so on foot. This was part of the campaign to defeat the Ottoman Empire, and Britain would receive Palestine, together with Mesopotamia, as part of the spoils during the Versailles Peace Conference. But what was Britain doing in that part of the world? The answer, again, was oil.
In early October 1914, an expedition was sent to secure the head of the Persian Gulf, and by the end of November the British occupied the port of Basra. For the next three years, the British fought to conquer Mesopotamia, and by the end of October 1917, the Turks were forced to surrender. During the war, the British government, and especially Prime Minister David Lloyd George, were determined to extend the empire to the Middle East; thus they were desperate that Britain and its allies essentially win the war before the United States actually sent many troops over to Europe. The American president, Woodrow Wilson, had insisted that one outcome of the war would be self-determination for all peoples-that self-evidently included those in colonies (for the Americans, the Philippines were self-evidently not a colony, since they were bestowing the benefits of religion and democracy on a backward people). The British needed the Americans as allies, and could not be seen to be defying Wilson's moral crusade. Lloyd George's plan was to present the United States with a fait accompli. If the Americans could claim to have won the war for the Europeans, Great Britain would find it difficult to win the argument to maintain their empire without making harsh sacrifices in their relationship with the United States. When the Americans actually arrived on the battlefield, they did make a difference, but not enough to claim that by their arrival they had won the war. 
58
After the end of the First World War, increasingly anxious about oil supplies, American oil companies also moved into the Middle East and by 1940 had acquired concessions in Iraq and Kuwait, and particularly in Saudi Arabia, with the establishment of the Arabian-American Oil Company (ARAMCO) in 1938, when American oilmen hit a gusher. Private enterprise made the running, but it had the support of the US government, which saw Saudi Arabia as its own sphere of influence. The Second World War was to demonstrate just how essential dependable supplies had become: between December 1941 and August 1945, the Allies used seven billion barrels of crude petroleum. 
59
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940   Roosevelt insisted that the United States was not casting "sheep's eyes" towards British holdings in Iran; Churchill responded that Britain would not "horn in" on US interests in Saudi Arabia. 
60
The First World War was a partial turning point. In spite of the British urging that American interests were also at stake, the United States refused to join the war until it was torpedoed into it. After all, where was the danger? The United States had moats to the east and west and extremely weak countries to the north and south. During the period of their neutrality, Americans railed against the British use of their power against the neutral countries. In this context, the power resided in the Royal Navy and the overwhelming control of the transoceanic cables. As with the War of 1812, the Royal Navy stopped American merchant ships and hauled them into port, when their cargoes might be confiscated (and paid for), or, at the very least, held up. The United States could not object to the confiscation of armaments for Germany and their allies, since traditionally neutrals were not free to carry them to belligerents. But they did object, for example, to foodstuffs being deemed contraband. 
61
62
63
On the other hand, Britain retained its military superiority in the interwar period. True, the United States forced Britain to choose between Japan and the United States, and thus Britain did not renew the Anglo-Japanese Alliance in 1922, an alliance that had served the British well. 
64
65
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940 century. The US Congress, however, repeatedly refused to appropriate the funds to outbuild the British, and the Royal Navy retained its status until the Second World War. 
66
67
68
As the atmosphere darkened in the 1930s, the British had a growing fear that they might have to fight a three-front war: against Germany on the Continent, against Italy in the Mediterranean, and against Japan in the Far East, as, in fact, they did. The United States was not sure just what, if any, foreign policy it wished to maintain, given the Depression, but Britain did not have that luxury. They tried to convince the Americans that US interests in the Far East were also gravely threatened by Japan, but they were difficult to convince. 
69
From 1814 to 1940, the two empires were intertwined, but the emotional element changed during this period. There was never a serious chance that they would again go to war: after all, neither could actually defeat the other, although during the nineteenth century, Great Britain could inflict a huge amount of damage on the United States, while the United States could only damage Canada-important, but not life threatening. At the turn of the century, the United States was a potential Great Power, but not an actual one: it was an extremely potent economic power, and it was primus in the Western Hemisphere, where the competition was weak, but it had little military power to project and few means with which to project what it had. In contrast, the British empire was a global power of the first magnitude. The First World War began to change both positions, although this was not necessarily very evident during the interwar period; it was only the Second World War that cemented the change in the two positions.
There are two unusual points to be made about this strategic rivalry. First of all, from the late nineteenth century on, Great Britain repeatedly tried to convince the United States to act as a world power, which meant taking on the necessary responsibilities, not just enjoying the fruits of others' work (such as the American piggy-back diplomacy in China: whatever concessions Britain won, the United States insisted should be granted to it as well). Great Britain's attempts to get the United States to join the First World War are well known; the United States desire to benefit economically from Europe during the 1920s while refusing to become involved in European power struggles are also well known; but British attempts to make the Americans understand that their interests were also threatened in the Far East and thus they should prepare are perhaps less familiar. Of course, the British expected to benefit
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: The British Empire versus the American Empire, c. 1812-c. 1940
as well: countries are seldom altruistic. But the fact that they took it for granted that both countries shared the same interests demonstrates that they feared that if one went down, both would be in dire straits, as would have indeed been the case. This segues nicely into the second point: this is the only case in known history in which one Great Power, or Empire, handed on the torch of supremacy to another without a battle between them having been fought.
Britain and Germany: 1914-1945
The Approach of War (1904-1914)
If anyone in Britain or Germany in a leadership position from 1914 through to 1945 had actually read, much less grasped, Sun Tzu's admonition to understand "the other," there is not much evidence of such an effort in the actual decision-making processes that those two nations and their leaders made throughout this period. 
1
On 28 June 1914, the Serbian student Gravrilo Princip assassinated the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, in Sarajevo. One might have thought that a British government, which had found itself engaged in a naval and economic competition over the past several decades with the Germans, might have concerned itself with the possibility of a major European war. 
2
As the reading proceeded it seemed absolutely impossible that any State in the world could accept it, or that any acceptance, however abject, would satisfy the aggressor. The parishes of Fermanasgh and Tyrone faded back into the mists and squalls of Ireland, and a strange light began immediately, but by perceptible gradations, to fall and grow upon the map of Europe.

The rivalry between Britain and Germany had grown steadily in the aftermath of the Franco-Prussian War (19 July 1870-10 May 1871) that had created a unified German state and a Kaiser.

As if its performance during the prewar period leading up to the outbreak of war had not been sufficient to persuade the world that the Reich was a rogue power, the Germans inflicted a series of atrocities to crush the possibility that guerrilla resistance to their military operation and occupation as they advanced through Belgium and northern France. In slightly more than a month, they shot over 6,000 French and Belgian civilians as hostages for the supposed attacks of franc tireurs (supposed guerrillas) on German troops.

25
With its declaration of war on Germany, the British cabinet agreed to dispatch four of the six infantry divisions then present in the United Kingdom to the Continent on 12-4 5 August. It kept the other two divisions at home to resist a possible German invasion. In a series of prewar staff talks, the French and the British had already accomplished the planning and coordination for such a move.

By the end of the fighting in Flanders in 1914, little remained of Britain's professional army.

The numbing casualties that all the major powers had suffered in the opening campaigns put paid to any ideas to the possibility of a compromise peace. In November 1914, General Erich von Falkenhayn, von Moltke's replacement, suggested to Chancellor Bethmann Hollweg that the war was no longer winnable and that Germany should seek a compromise peace with the Russians. The chancellor turned the general down cold:
Germany would seek victory and political aims that were already at megalomaniacal levels-among other goals suggested the annexation of Belgium, much of northern France, and unspecified territories in the east that would make an invasion of eastern Germany impossible.
At least in 1915, the chief of the general staff sought relatively limited military aims, clearly in the hope of exhausting Germany's opponents. 
33
34
On the British side, matters did not go much better. Field Marshal Lord Herbert Kitchener, appointed to head the War Office on the outbreak of war, believed the conflict would be long and drawn out. While he believed Britain needed to commit a large army to the Continent, the fashion with which he went about establishing that army minimized much of its potential. He ignored the Territorial Army and focused mobilization on the creation of new formations. The army's High Command had not helped matters by shipping nearly all its staff officers over to France with the BEF in August 1914. Thus, it fell to superannuated and retired officers to train up the mass of volunteers who had joined up in the war's first months, the new model army to be referred to as the Kitchener armies after Kitchener, now the Secretary of War in the cabinet. Meanwhile, the French Army had to bear the burden of the fighting on the Western Front in 1915 until the British finally had mobilized sufficient forces to launch a major offensive in 1916. 
35
36
37
38
In the first war years, German military operations won tactical victories on the battlefield that seemingly suggested that the Reich would win the war. In spring and early summer 1915, the Germans achieved major successes against the Russians that drove Czar Nicholas II's forces from Poland. Nevertheless, there were no indications the Russians were willing to quit. Moreover, the British blockade was beginning to bite. The Reich quite simply lacked access to many of the raw materials essential for the conduct of modern war, such as rubber, copper, and nitrates, and especially foodstuffs. Throughout the year, Germany's commanders in the east, Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg and Eric von Ludendorff, pressured Falkenhayn to reinforce their front with the aim of crushing the Russians by driving into the depths of Russia. Their arguments were largely fallacious and ignored the logistical and strategic problems created by fighting deep in Russia. 
39
In response to the claims of Hindenburg and Ludendorff that the Reich needed to follow an Eastern Strategy, Falkenhayn focused German military strategy in the west. He completed a major strategic assessment of Germany's position immediately before New Year's Day, 1916. It represented a mixture of acute observations with bizarre conclusions. He argued that the war had exhausted both France and Russia, but that the "enormous hold which England still has on her allies" was the only thing keeping them in the conflict.
Falkenhayn particularly worried that "our enemies, thanks to their superiority in men and material are increasing their resources much more than we are. If that process continues a moment must come when the balance of numbers itself will deprive Germany of all remaining hope." 
40
The Germans began their attack in February 1916. But Falkenhayn had badly miscalculated. However, the French imposed a casualty exchange ratio of one-to-one on the attackers, as opposed to the four-to-one ratio Falkenhayn had hoped to achieve. Verdun was just the start of German troubles in 1916. In June, the Russians launched a devastating attack on ill-prepared Austro-Hungarian positions on the Eastern Front, which Germany's allies had weakened to launch an offensive against the Italians. For a time the Brusilov offensive threatened to collapse the ancient Hapsburg monarchy. Then in July, after a massive artillery bombardment, the British launched a great offensive on the Somme. Shortly thereafter the Rumanians joined the war on the Allied side.
Too much of the history of the Somme Battle that began on 1 July 1916, understand ably, but misleadingly, focuses on the disastrous casualties the British suffered on the first day of the battle. 
41
42
By early August 1916, Germany and its army were in serious trouble with major difficulties in the west and with its ally Austria-Hungary on the brink of collapse. Pressured from all sides by demands for a change in military leadership, the Kaiser removed Falkenhayn and replaced him with Hindenburg and Ludendorff, the latter the main driving force. Upon taking over command, the two generals discovered just how weak Germany's strategic situation was. The heavy casualties suffered at Verdun and on the Somme had exhausted the army, while the increasing Allied advantage in material was having a significant impact on the battlefield.
On the tactical level, Ludendorff executed a massive reordering of the German tactics. In September 1916, he carried out an extensive survey of the Western Front to include extensive meetings and debriefs with front-line officers and soldiers. Arriving on the Western Front, Ludendorff demanded that the staffs and the front-line soldiers with whom he discussed the tactical situation not give "favorable report[s] made to order." 
43
The loss of ground up to that date appeared to me of little importance in itself. We could stand that, but the question how this and the progressive falling off of our fighting power... were to be prevented was of immense importance... [O]n the Somme the enemy's powerful artillery, assisted by excellent aeroplane observation and fed with enormous supplies of ammunition, had kept down our own fire and destroyed our artillery. The defense of our infantry had become so flabby that the massed attacks of the enemy always succeeded... I attached great importance to what I learned about our infantry... Without doubt it fought too doggedly, clinging too resolutely to the mere holding of ground, with the result that the losses were heavy. 
44
45
On the other side, Field Marshal Douglas Haig, commander of the BEF since 1915, and his staff displayed little interest in finding out was occurring on the sharp end with either artillery or infantry tactics.

53
In the fall of 1916, as Ludendorff struggled to reform German tactical capabilities, he was also pushing for strategic decisions that would guarantee the Reich's defeat. In spite of the Kaiser's decision to halt unrestricted submarine warfare in 1915, the Kriegsmarine had waged a relentless campaign in favor of its resumption. The figures that the German navy presented were largely bogus. Among other numerical manipulations, its advocates calculated neutral shipping would refuse to sail to Britain, but they forgot that American shipyards possessed enormous capabilities. As Isabel Hull has pointed out, "the navy underestimated Britain. It ascribed less intelligence and will power to its foe than it assumed for Germany." 
54
55
The fact that Ludendorff worried in the fall of 1916 about the possibility that either Holland or Denmark might enter the war on the side of the Allies suggests how prepared the army was to take on the United States. In fact, Ludendorff's tactical reforms by 12-10 enabling the army to fight on for another two years ensured that the war's price in casualties and wealth would be that much higher for Germany, when the war was over. So short of troops were the Germans that Ludendorff ordered a major retreat on the Western Front in spring 1917 to free troops up for the defensive battles that he anticipated would occur later in 1917. Named Operation ALBERICH, fittingly named after the malicious dwarf of the Niebelungen saga, the retreating Germans destroyed every building, cut down every fruit tree, poisoned the wells, and left the area they evacuated a virtual desert. 
56
With the new tactics, the German Army in the west wrecked the French Army's Nivelle offensive of spring 1917. Moreover, with the new tactics it fended off the massive British offensive at Passchendaele in the late summer and fall. Matters went reasonably well in the East with the steady march of Russia toward revolution and utter collapse, a revolution that the Germans enthusiastically aided and abetted. Not only did they ship Lenin across German territory in spring 1917 so that he could further the disintegration taking place in Russia but they also supplied the Bolsheviks with gold to carry out their revolution. 
57
As he presented Germany's decision to resume unrestricted warfare to the Americans, the German ambassador in Washington also passed along the German government's terms for a compromise peace. The terms indicated why no peace was possible with the Reich other than its complete defeat. The German proposals included • a frontier in the east which would protect Germany and Poland [then a German client-state] economically and strategically against Russia;
• a provision of colonies worthy of Germany's population and status as a great power;
• a withdrawal of German troops from the territory they had occupied in France with "reservation concerning the strategic and economic boundaries, as well as financial compensation" (as if the French had invaded Germany!);
• the restoration of Belgium under what to all intents and purposes would have been under German control; and
• compensation for whatever injuries German industry and commerce had suffered during the war. 
58
For the Allies, 1917 was a dark year. While their army was becoming more tactically effective, especially in use of artillery, the application of its improving capabilities proved inept. The first and perhaps most important was the fact that mutinies throughout the French Army as a result of the failure of the Nivelle offensive had severely debilitated French military capabilities. Thus, the British were going to have to launch major military operations with their concomitant heavy casualties in 1917. Ironically, the BEF was now in a position to impose an unacceptable level of attrition on the Germans. In a series of smaller operations in April and then June 1917, the British had destroyed the German defenses on Vimy Ridge and then at Messines and imposed heavy losses on their opponents in taking those positions. Here British counter-battery fire proved particularly effective. Those two operations underlined that relatively limited attacks, which possessed overwhelming superiority in artillery, could severely hurt the Germans, even with their new defensive system. But Haig was set on launching a great offensive in Flanders. The result would be a bloody, indecisive battle fought over land that had once been a great swamp, drained by the French and Belgians in the Middle Ages. Now British, Canadian, and Anzac formations would flounder in the mud of Flanders with little success. 
59
60
As casualties ballooned into the hundreds of thousands in Flanders in late summer 1917, Lloyd George found himself appalled by the losses. Nevertheless, he refused to rein in Haig and stop an offensive that was going nowhere. 
61
At the start of 1918, the Second German Reich stood at a momentous point in its history. In the east, Ludendorff and Hindenburg imposed a peace treaty, Treaty of Brest Litovsk, on the new Bolshevik regime in Russia that sliced off Poland, the Baltic states, Finland, the Ukraine, and much of White Russia (today Belorussia). 
62
63
Ironically, it is possible that, had the Germans proposed reasonable terms for a settlement in the west, they might have achieved a peace that would have left them with most of the gains they had made from the Treaty of Brest Litovsk. But for Ludendorff, it was all or nothing. Thus, he planned a series of major offensives to knock the Western Powers out of the war before the Americans arrived. Ludendorff's offensives aimed at achieving tactical gains. When Crown Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria, one of the few sensible senior officers in the German Army and commander of the first great offensive, the MICHAEL Offensive, asked what the operational objective of the upcoming offensive was, Ludendorff replied: "I object to the word operation. We will punch a hole into [their front line]. For the rest we shall see." 
64
65
Germans now had to defend their great bulging salients that reached deeply into Allied held territory. That decreased the number of German troops defending each sector, as well as the reserves available for counterattacks. 
66
67
The Allies survived the storm. Moreover, by the summer of 1918, with the flow of reinforcements restored, Haig disposed of a stronger force than in the spring. In addition, a flood of American troops were arriving in France, 250,000 every month. While these troops were certainly not trained to the standards of the French and British, they proved exceptionally fast learners, and their opponents were on their last legs. The German collapse began on August 8. A massive British combined-arms attack, supported by large numbers of tanks, shattered German forces near Amiens. Ludendorff characterized the defeat as the "Black Day" of the war for the German Army. Much worse followed, as Allied attacks drove the Germans back into Belgium and the French territory they had seized in the war's first days. The BEF carried much of that effort, the fall campaign representing its most impressive tactical and operational performance of the war. 
68

70
71
In every respect, the contest between Britain and Germany in World War I represented a contest for the future of Europe. Without the British effort, the Germans would have won the war. The most significant British advantage lay not necessarily in their own strength but in the obdurate beliefs of their opponents-that what mattered in war was its conduct, not its strategy or political ends. From the war's opening moments, the Germans placed "military necessity" before political concerns and thus made impossible any reasonable connection between means and ends. The German military's demand that "military necessity" override all other concerns not only ensured that Britain would enter the war at its outset, it also guaranteed that the United States eventually would 12-14 find the Second Reich's behavior intolerable and throw its immense economic weight on the side of the Allies.
In contrast, the British consistently placed support for their allies high on their list of priorities. They also ensured that their actions did as little as possible to harm the interests of the major neutrals, especially the United States. At the same time to control the narrative, they highlighted the willful German disregard for international law and neutral rights. Whatever their weaknesses in military effectiveness, the strategic effectiveness of Britain's leaders ensured Allied victory.
The armistice granted by the Allies reflected French desiderata. It required the German Army to surrender all of its artillery and most of its machine guns and retreat back across the Rhine, while granting the victorious powers bridgeheads on the river's right bank. But because military operations had not reached German territory, a substantial number of the Reich's political and military leaders almost immediately claimed that the German Army had stood unbroken and undefeated in the field, only to be stabbed in the back by the Communists and the Jews. Even the president of the German Republic, who had replaced the Kaiser, the Social Democratic politician, Friedrich Ebert, greeted the troops returning to Berlin with the pronouncement that "no enemy has subdued you." 
72

74
75
76
Moreover, such a peace with the incorporation of German-speaking territories set adrift by the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, namely Austria and the Germanspeaking fringe that surrounded Czechoslovakia, would have made Germany a victorious power after all. As it was, Germany now found itself sharing a frontier with only one major European power, the badly damaged France. The fallout from the collapse of the empires 12-15 meant that a group of quarrelsome, weak powers-none of which displayed much strategic sense-now bordered the Reich to the east and south. Moreover, the success of the Communist regime in Russia ensured the Germans were not the only major power fundamentally dissatisfied with the peace settlement. The Peace of Versailles, which left Germany unified and as the strongest economic power in Europe, confronted the victorious Western Powers with a conundrum. For the French, the most pressing issue in their relations with the new Weimar Republic was a desire for the Germans to pay reparations for the damage the Germans had inflicted on France. However, there was a catch, namely that to pay that bill the German economy would have to be the most powerful in Europe, hardly what the French viewed as in their best interest. On the other hand, the British viewed the recovery of Germany and its economy as essential to their economic stability. After all, the Reich had been Britain's largest trading partner before the war. Admittedly, Lloyd George had run an election campaign in the immediate aftermath of the war promising the British people that the coming peace treaty would squeeze the Germans until "the pips squeaked." But the economist John Maynard Keynes's devastating critique of the economic consequences of the peace treaty, published in 1919, reverberated throughout the British economic and political elite. 
77
The failure of the Ruhr occupation underlined for the French that they could not act against the Germans unless they had British support, a factor that had an important effect on events in the late 1930s. The economic recovery of Europe, especially Germany, largely through extensive American loans, helped bring about an improvement in the relations among the powers. In addition, the arrival of the master diplomat and statesman, Gustav Stresemann, the Weimar Republic's Foreign Minister (1923 and 1924-29), also had a considerable effect. But while Stresemann was willing to agree to the frontiers of the Germany's western neighbors, he was unwilling to extend such guarantees to Germany's eastern neighbors.
Yet one should not assume that economic and political concerns were the only factors influencing Anglo-German relations. To begin with, the German Foreign Office mounted a massive disinformation effort to persuade the British and Americans that Germany was no 12-16 more responsible for starting the war than the other powers. 
78
79
80
81
82
83
Matters were somewhat better in the United Kingdom, but not by much. The British recovery was fragile, and its very fragility played a considerable role in the major efforts by Conservative politicians and the Treasury to hold down defense spending to minimum levels through to the late 1930s. 
84
At the end of January 1933, Adolf Hitler came to power in Germany. His political success reflected three separate events that exercised a powerful influence on the German political scene: the disastrous end to the four-year war that had bled Germany white; the great inflation of 1923; and the nightmarish impact of the Great Depression that left threw half of the Reich's workers on the welfare rolls. Hitler made no secret of his goals in his turgid statement of Nazi ideology, Mein Kampf, and he was equally explicit in a conversation with the Germany's military leaders four days after becoming the Chancellor of the Third Reich. He made clear his intention to overthrow entirely the European balance of power that had largely remained the basis of Europe's strategic relations since 1648. 
85
For the immediate future, Hitler had to navigate through a hostile European environment with minimal power. Nevertheless, he embarked on a risky policy of destroying the restrictions of Versailles piece by piece through diplomatic means. To do so, he presented himself as a man of peace-except to the Germans-who only wanted for the German people the same rights that Versailles had granted to other Europeans. 
86
It was a message all too many Europeans enthusiastically embraced. In 1936, Britain's former prime minister, David Lloyd George, came away from a meeting with Hitler, impressed by the Führer's peaceful intentions. 
87

89
Germany's program of rearmament encountered major problems from its inception. 
90
91
92
93
94
The year 1936 brought an even bigger distraction from the threat posed by German rearmament. A military revolt in Spain failed to overthrow completely the Republic but instead resulted in a civil war that pitted the radical right (the Nationalists) against the radical left (the Republicans). The Italians and the Soviets sent major forces and massive supplies to support the contending sides. Early in the revolt, the Germans provided key support to General Francisco Franco's fascists when their Ju 52 transports that flew the Spanish Foreign Legion across the Straits of Gibraltar to the Spanish mainland to participate in the fighting. But thereafter, Hitler reduced the German contribution to a small group of advisers and weapons that the Germans wanted to test. 
95
96
He did not believe that we could, or ought, or in the event, would be allowed by the country, to enter a Continental war with the intention of fighting on the same line as in the last war. We ought to make up our minds to do something different. Our contribution by land should be on a limited scale. It was wrong to assume that the next war would be fought by ourselves alone against Germany. If we had to fight we should have allies who must… maintain large armies. He did not accept that we also must send a large army. 
97
98
The British predicated their defense policy on two basic assumptions: that whatever the militaristic policies of Nazi Germany, Hitler did not want war and aimed solely at reasserting Germany's position as a major European power. Thus, given that assumption, then Britain should right the "wrongs" of Versailles and by so doing ensure Europe's peace. However, that assumption rested on a fundamental misreading of Nazi aims, part wishful thinking, and part guilt that somehow Britain had to make things right. In July 1937, Chamberlain commented to the Soviet ambassador that "if only we could sit down at a table with the Germans and run through all their complaints and claims with a pencil, this would greatly relieve all tension."

Reinforcing attitudes in London was the pernicious influence of the British ambassador in Berlin, Sir Nevile Henderson, who made every effort to place German actions in a favorable light and to minimize the aggressive nature of Nazi foreign policy. A letter Henderson wrote to Lord Halifax in the summer of 1938 underlined the tone and substance of his reporting from Berlin: Personally I just sit and pray for one thing, namely that Lord Runciman [the British politician sent by Chamberlain to mediate the differences between the Czechs and the Sudeten Germans] will live up to the role of [an] impartial British liberal statesman. I cannot believe that he will allow himself to be influenced by ancient history or even arguments about strategic frontiers and economics in preference to high moral principles.

The reaction of the other European powers was minimal. As one British commentator noted, the Germans were only moving into their own backyard. That lack of reaction only confirmed to Hitler that he was on the right track. He had claimed in Mein Kampf that the Kaiser's major mistake had been to make an enemy of Britain and believed he could keep Britain out of a future war on the Continent as his military forces built a great eastern empire on the ruins of the "season" states" and the Soviet Union. In fact, the Füher knew little about the British and what he thought he knew was dangerously skewed. In 1936, he appointed Joachim von Ribbentrop to be the German ambassador to London, Ribbentrop's qualifications being that he was fluent in English was not a part of the diplomatic formal corps, and was slavishly devoted to Hitler. He made an appallingly bad impression on the British, including many appeasers, most of whom quite rightly regarded him as a jumpedup parvenue. There were, of course, a number of pro-appeasement supporters who were glad to fill Ribbentrop's ears with nonsense. Like Henderson, Ribbentrop provided a filter that reinforced the preconceptions of those for whom he worked. Named as Germany's foreign minister in February 1938 during Hitler's purge of his senior advisors, Ribbentrop then provided the Führer with consistently anti-British advice, much of it underestimating the British. By this point, Hitler appeared to have concluded that Britain was not a natural ally of Germany and that he was going to have to deal with the British eventually.
The ease with which the Germans incorporated Austria into the Reich led Hitler to turn next to the Czechs. He might not have brought the crisis to a boil in 1938, but for the fact that in May 1938 the Czechs accused the Germans of preparing a surprise attack on their nation. In fact, that was not the case. But London and Paris warned Hitler against any move the Germans might make against Czechoslovakia. The appearance that Nazi Germany had backed down to warnings from London and Paris, as well as the fact that the Czechs had mobilized and occupied the fortifications on their exposed borders infuriated the Führer. 
109
Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW), General Wilhelm Keitel, made clear that preparations for such an eventuality were to be completed by 1 October 1938. The preamble now ominously read: "It is my unalterable decision to smash Czechoslovakia by military action in the near future." 
110
111
General Beck had no doubts as to who would win such a war. Germany's military position had admittedly improved since the 1920s, but the Wehrmacht was simply not ready for war. The Reich possessed neither the economic nor the military base to fight a major war, much less a world war, against the Allied powers with any chance of success. 
112
113
Halifax then added for the benefit of his colleagues that "[w]e were, in effect, concerned with the attempt of the dictator countries to attain their ends by force. But he asked himself whether it was justifiable to fight a certain war now in order to foster a possible war later." 
115
116
In that territory lay Czechoslovakia's fortifications, and so the Czechs were now defenseless. In strategic and military terms, the Munich agreement was a disaster for the Western Powers. It delivered the Czechs, their substantial military armaments, and their industries into Nazi Germany's hands, although the Germans would have to wait until they seized the remainder of the Czech state in March 1939 to gain access to most of the plunder. 
118
The prime minister attempted to finesse this political difficulty by announcing an effort to increase defense spending. In fact, the government obfuscated-it did nothing to repair the army's sorry state; it provided a few small ships for the navy along with the dredging of Dover and Rosyth harbors; and finally it increased the number of Spitfires and Hurricanes on order, but only by extending the two-year contract to a third year. In other words, for the immediate future there would be no increase in orders for fighters. 
119
120
122
In mid-March of 1939, the Germans occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia on the trumped up charges that the Czechs were mistreating their minorities. That move finally destroyed British illusions about Hitler's intentions. In the immediate aftermath, Neville Chamberlain attempted to minimize Hitler's action in destroying the Munich agreement. He suggested to the cabinet that the guarantee extended to the Czechs in October 1938 was no longer operable. "[T]he state whose frontiers we had undertaken to guarantee against unprovoked aggression had now completely broken up." 
123
There was some sense in fighting for Czechoslovakia in 1938 when the German army could scarcely put half a dozen trained divisions on the Western Front.... But this had been judged unreasonable, rash, below the level of modern intellectual thought and morality. Yet now at last the two Western Democracies declared themselves ready to stake their lives on the integrity of Poland. History, which we are told is mainly the record of crimes, follies, and miseries of mankind, may be scoured and ransacked to find a parallel to this sudden and complete reversal of five or six years' policy of easy-going placatory appeasement, and its transformation almost overnight into a readiness to accept an obviously imminent war on far worse conditions and on the greatest scale.

This was particularly true for the army, where Czech arms dumps had a major effect. Czech tanks would equip three of the panzer divisions that invaded France in May 1940, while Czech arms would equip the formations of Waffen SS divisions that supported the German army's drive into France and the Low Countries in May and June 1940. 133
With the German invasion of Poland on 1 September 1939 and the British declaration of war two days later, the second great war between Britain and Germany broke out. The European theater of the conflict would last for the next five-and-a-half years. The real contest between Britain and Germany, however, would be concentrated for the first twenty-two months of that terrible struggle.
After the Germans invaded Russia in June 1941 and unnecessarily declared war on the United States in December of that year, the struggle for the Germans became multifaceted and less focused on Britain. For the British, Germany always remained the main focus. It would only be with the massive and effective attacks of the Allied Bomber Command during the Battle of the Ruhr valley in spring 1943 that refocused German attention on the threat that Britain represented. In the end, it would be the critical period between June 1940 and June 1941 where the competition between Britain and Germany would determine the war's eventual outcome.
One should not believe that the Allies were in a hopeless position in September 1939, or that the Germans did not have substantial weaknesses. Allied strategy focused on building up economic and military strength for an eventual military confrontation with the Germans two or three years down the road. Given Allied weaknesses as well as strengths, this made some sense. However, what the Allied political and military leaders failed to understand was how weak Germany's economic situation was, or for that matter, how deeply the blockade would wreck the Reich's economy. 
134
For Hitler and Ribbentrop, the British declaration of war on 3 September 1939 had come as a nasty surprise. If the German economy had improved considerably over what it had been in the fall of 1938, it still confronted difficulties. Petroleum stocks were dangerously low. Germany only escaped the full consequences of its petroleum difficulties by minimal imports from Russia and Rumania and because Allied passivity allowed the Wehrmacht to stretch out the limited supplies available in stockpiles.

b) The purpose of this offensive will be to defeat as much as possible of the French Army and of the forces of the allies fighting on their side, and at the same time win as much territory as possible in Holland, Belgium, and northern France, to serve as a base for the successful prosecution of the air and sea war against England and as a wide protective area for the economically vital Ruhr [author's italics]. 
140
The fall offensive did not occur for three reasons.
• The first was the German army was most unhappy with the performance of its troops at the tactical level. The army leaders argued for a postponement of the 12-30 offensive against the west to the following spring, which led to a major blow-up with Hitler. 142
• The second reason was because of bad weather, which on a number of occasions forced the Germans to postpone major military operations in the west.
• The third reason was the Allies failed to conduct any significant military operations over the course of the fall.
The Allied failure to conduct serious military operations lay in the pusillanimity of military as well as political leaders in Britain and France. Ironically, despite his reputation, Chamberlain had argued for the Allies to make a major effort to push the Italians into the war on Germany's side if the Wehrmacht were to invade Poland. In late June 1939, the prime minister argued in the foreign policy committee that there were important advantages in having the Italians at Germany's side in any future conflict. In that meeting, Samuel Hoare, a leading appeaser, went so far as to argue that an early offensive against Italy would force the Germans to divert forces from Poland. 
143
145
146
[E]ven if Italy remained neutral, we still had to leave our forces in the Mediterranean to watch her. It would be preferable to devise means to smash Italy and thus release forces for action elsewhere. As a neutral, Italy would sustain Germany whereas an ally, she would constitute a drain on German resources. 
147
148
However, in spite of its promises to the Poles in August of 1940, the French High Command did nothing. The French commander-in-chief, General Maurice Gamelin, reported to the Poles in mid-September that he had "already fulfilled his promise to undertake the first French offensive within fifteen days of mobilization. It is impossible for me to do more." 
149
The final vulnerability in the German economy lay in the import of Swedish iron ore. For six months of the year, that ore moved through the Baltic Sea when it was ice free. During the other six months, the ore freighters had to travel from the northern Norwegian port of Narvik down the coast until they finally reached the Skagerrak and could turn into the Elbe estuary. On 19 September, Sir Winston Churchill, back at the Admiralty as the First Sea Lord, suggested that the ore trade was of great importance to the German war economy and that, if the political pressure failed to persuade the Norwegians to shut down the trade, he "would... propose the remedy adapted in the last war, namely the laying of mines inside Norwegian territorial waters." 
150
151
Hence, the Reich appears to have suffered relatively little wear and tear during the first six months of the war, and that mainly as a result of the Allied blockade. Meanwhile, it has profited from the interval to perfect the degree of equipment of its land and air forces, to increase the officer strength and complete the training of troops, and to add further divisions to those already in the field. 
152
The disastrous defeat of Allied ground forces was a direct result of the failure of the Allies to undertake any serious military action, combined with the gross incompetence of the French commander-in-chief, Gamelin. 
153

• Second was the political challenge he confronted as early as the end of May, as a cabal of appeasers, led by Halifax, pushed for Britain to make peace with the Germans.
• Third was how Britain was to meet a German air and amphibious assault on the British Isles if it stood alone. This demanded the mobilization of the British people in psychological terms to stand against what appeared to be the unbeatable power of Nazi Germany. It would also demand that the Royal Navy neutralize the French fleet to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Axis.
• Fourth, and perhaps most important in the long term, was the problem of connecting with the United States and the Soviet Union to persuade them that it was in their national interest to help Britain. Only in his attempts to reach out to the Soviets in 1940 and early 1941 would Churchill fail.
In the largest sense, the bloody mindedness of the British triumphed over the apparently more rational approach urged by the likes of Halifax and Samuel Hoare. As King George V noted in his diary shortly after the French surrender, "[p]ersonally, I feel happier now that we have no allies to be polite to and pamper."

The most significance contrast between the opposing sides lay in their ability to understand their upcoming opponent. One of the leading analysts in the British Y Service, 12-34 which monitored Luftwaffe radio transmissions, underlined the advantage the British were already enjoying in intelligence by summer 1940 in her memoirs:
[b]y the end of the summer of 1940 the Air Ministry intelligence had an almost complete picture of the Luftwaffe's Order of Battle, particularly in Western Europe… [E]ven in the summer of 1940, we could almost certainly confirm the height at which the [enemy] formations were approaching, and we were also able to give some indication, from what we were hearing, of their intended action.

Once it was clear that the Germans had failed in the Battle of Britain, Churchill's problem was how Britain was going to win the war against a Germany that controlled the Continent. The romance that followed between Churchill and President Roosevelt, aimed at drawing the United States into the conflict, proved more difficult at first than Churchill had thought of, while the Soviets proved obdurately obtuse about the danger gathering on their borders in the west. 
168
169
Therefore, Churchill had to address the problem of what Britain could do that would strike at the Germans directly. As early as the summer of 1940, he placed Britain's emphasis at hitting back at the Germans with bombers. At the same time, he pushed the cabinet to establish the Special Operations Executive (SOE), as he suggested, to set "Europe ablaze." The resistance groups that SOE helped to create and support would prove to be of considerable help in tying down German troops. In the case of Operation OVERLORD, the invasion of France on 6 June 1944, resistance sabotage and hit-and-run attacks would make the Wehrmacht's efforts to reinforce the Normandy battlefront more difficult. Nevertheless, in the end the resistance movements proved less effective than Churchill had hoped.
Initially, Churchill was optimistic about the prospects of a strategic bombing campaign against Nazi Germany. He commented in summer 1940, "There is one thing that…will bring [Germany] down and that is an absolutely devastating, exterminating attack by heavy bombers from this country upon the Nazi homeland." 170 A year later, Churchill was not so optimistic, especially after the Butt Report, which had studied the efforts of Bomber Command, indicated how little effect the bombing of Germany was achieving. He minuted Air Marshal Sir Charles Portal that …it is very disputable whether bombing by itself will be a decisive factor in the present war. On the contrary, all that we have learned since the war began shows that its effect, both physical and moral, are greatly exagger-ated… The most that we can say is that it will be a heavy and I trust a seriously increasing annoyance.

Equally damaging to the Reich's continued survival were the direct effects created by Bomber Command's efforts. By early 1943, what had been mere pinpricks turned into massive hammer blows. In the spring of 1943, in the Battle of the Ruhr, British bombers smashed up the major cities of the Ruhr. These attacks came perilously close to breaking the Reich's war economy, particularly by damaging the German ability to transport coal to the rest of the economy. As the foremost economic historian of the Reich, Adam Tooze, has noted:
Reading contemporary sources, there can be no doubt that the Battle of the Ruhr market a turning point in the history of the German war economy, which has been grossly underestimated by post-war accounts… Most significantly, the shortage of key components brought the rapid increase in Luftwaffe production to an abrupt halt. Between July 1943 and March 1944 there was no further increase in the monthly output of aircraft… As Speer himself acknowledged, Allied bombing had negated all plans for a further increase in production. Bomber Command had stopped Speer's armaments miracle in its track.

But it was much more that simply taking a few scientists into the analytic community that made the Allied analytic effort so effective in the war. Bletchley Park and the breaking of the Enigma codes was not just the triumph of mathematicians like Alan Turing. Integrating German-speaking historians and others into the effort played a large role in comprehending the intentions of German military commanders. Perhaps the best example was the incorporation of the Cambridge undergraduate history major, Harry Hinsley, into the naval intelligence effort. It was Hinsley at the age of 22 who figured out that the German weather ships off of Iceland were using the same code settings as the U-boats. Similarly, the key intelligence officer in analyzing the German U-Boat campaign was Rodger Winn, a 40-year old barrister who had been crippled as a child by polio and who could not stand for long periods of time without excruciating pain. 
180
In the largest sense, the Germans were incapable of understanding "the other." It was not just a matter of their intelligence failures, which admittedly were immense. Above all, it was their strategic assessments, skewed as they were by nonsensical ideological preconceptions, that led the Germans in 1941 to invade the Soviet Union and then at the end of the year to declare war on the United States. Thus, within two years and three months of the invasion of Poland, the Germans had managed to repeat every major strategic mistake that they had made in the first world war, thereby, setting in motion their doom. Admittedly, through the end of 1942 there was no Western Front but by the spring of 1943, Bomber Command, soon to be augmented by Eighth Air Force, had recreated a 12-38 Britain and Germany: 1914-1945   Western Front with a vengeance, in this case one that played to Allied strengths rather than weaknesses.
This essay covers the nearly thirty-one years of competitive interaction between the British and the Germans. Of those years, slightly less than a third involved direct action by their military forces. In many respects, the Germans enjoyed considerable advantages at the tactical level against their British opponents. This was true, certainly in the first stages of both wars, but particularly throughout the second. And yet in the largest sense the inability of the Germans to assess the strategic equations in both world wars completely negated their tactical advantages.
Contributing to their flawed strategic assessments was the general inability to understand the British nether strategically nor operationally. Not surprisingly, the British proved particularly adept in their handling of allies in both wars, while the Germans proved almost completely inept. It was only in the interwar period that British leaders floundered strategically and politically in their assessment of the degree of menace that the Germans represented. Those errors of judgment are perhaps understandable, but not excusable, given the nightmarish war through which Britain had so recently passed. In the end strategic leadership demands vision and a willingness to strip away the fog with which one's facile assumptions encompass harsh realities. The real strike against the Chamberlain government's appeasement policies in the late 1930s was the fact that it followed rather than led the British public in recognition of the German danger.
As suggested in the opening paragraphs, the ties between Britain and Germany should have provided these competing powers with some sense of "the other." For the most part, they did not. In the First World War, only obdurately stupid behavior on the part of the Germans forced the British to commit themselves to the struggle. The interwar period saw the British pile illusory assumption on top of illusion. Only when they were looking over the brink into the catastrophe of absolute defeat with the fall of France, did the British finally recognize the nature of the German menace. But even then it took the extraordinary intellectual toughness and perceptions of Winston Churchill for the British to hang on in the face of the existential threat that the Third Reich represented. This essay should warn those who make strategy and policy in the future, how extraordinarily difficult it is to understand "the other," even when that "other" is by history, culture, and economics intimately connected to their world. Where that is not the case and a vast gulf of history, culture, and intellectual understanding exists between two powers in a long-term competition in the international arena, the problem of understanding "the other" becomes exponentially more difficult. There facile assumptions and hopes for the future inevitably will lead to disaster. In the West, we think of peace as the norm and war as the aberration. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, however, war was the norm for Asia. China and Russia generally rejected the Westernizing global order and, with varying degrees of determination, sought to overturn it. Japan typically tried to adapt but, when that proved impossible, it too tried to create an alternate order. Sweeping changes in the global economy set the context for the diplomacy and wars among China, Russia, and Japan. Occasionally these changes were of such a magnitude and the effects so long lasting that they constituted framing events-they decisively influenced what followed by introducing new constraints and by opening new opportunities and their sweeping nature ultimately forced all to alter their previous courses of action.
Two sets of framing events upended the international context of Sino-Russo-Japanese relations: first, the Industrial Revolution and second, the combined effects of World War I and the Great Depression. After the Napoleonic Wars, the Industrial Revolution spread from England to the Continent and gradually to the rest of the world in a process that continues to the present day. Wherever it spread, it upended the regional and ultimately the global balance of power. Then mismanagement of military strategy in World War I and of economic strategy in the Great Depression destroyed the European political and economic order. The combined effects put communism and fascism on steroids both in Europe and in Asia, producing pernicious effects felt to the present.
The Industrial Revolution was a catastrophic event for traditional societies. Previously successful foreign policy paradigms suddenly and inexplicably, from their points of view, no longer worked. In fact, changes made far, far away had put them on a very unequal footing with industrialized countries. A new era had dawned based on steam power, the iron industry, textiles, the insurance industry, banking, and in its later stages on railways, telegraphs, and steamships. Together these changes transformed static societies into the rapidly changing world, taken for granted today. The new institutions and technologies produced economic growth, something virtually unknown in traditional societies, and, over several generations of compounded growth, the differences in wealth between those who industrialized and those who did not became enormous. 
1
The Industrial Revolution gave rise to an emerging Westernized global order conducive to the promotion of trade and the creation of wealth. It was based on the freedom of navigation, international law, and a growing set of international institutions to facilitate trade and communication. At its root, it was a maritime global order because its members were bound together by maritime shipping, which was far cheaper than the overland trade, which it soon eclipsed. Russia had risen to greatness, in part, as an essential link of the Silk Road, transporting Asian luxury goods to Europe. Steam navigation and the Suez Canal (opened in 1869) marginalized the overland trade and removed the economic foundation of Russian greatness.

Chinese long failed to grasp the economic, technological, and military implications of the Industrial Revolution. The Chinese government, rather than devising ways to profit from the growing commerce with Europe, resisted the increasingly strident Western demands for trade. China, the reigning superpower of the known world (that is, the world known to China), did not accept the dictates of others. It set the rules of the world order. For millennia, China had dominated its much smaller East and Southeast Asian neighbors culturally, technologically, militarily, and economically. Burma, Indochina, Korea, Japan, and Thailand belonged to China's Sinicized world. They emulated its governmental institutions, educational system, and society. Their governments followed the international norms of the Chinese global order, in which China played the grand puppeteer and choreographer of international relations.
The Han, the dominant ethnic group in China, considered their civilization to be the acme of human achievement and did not recognize the existence of other civilizations. China's destiny was to spread its civilization across the known world to unite "all under 13-2
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order heaven" (tianxia, 天下), one of the names that the Han used to designate China. Each emperor sought to maintain and, if possible, to expand the territory his predecessors had amassed. In times of population growth, the Han migrated outward in search of arable lands. They encouraged or coerced minority peoples to adopt Han practices and, over time, many of these peoples lost their original ethnic identities to become Han. Those who refused to assimilate were driven first into the hills-areas not suitable for the settled agriculture of the Han-and eventually to the frontier. Such a strategy produced ethnic homogeneity in the core lands of the Chinese empire.
The Han considered those not adhering to their practices to be barbarians, ignorant people living on the periphery, whom the Han would either buy off with trade or militarily crush when necessary. Historically, lethal security threats came not from the Sinicized world but overland from the nomadic tribes from the northwest and north, the Muslims, the Mongols, and the Manchus. The latter two had conquered China to form conquest dynasties, the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1271-1368) and Manchu Qing dynasty (1644-1911), the two territorially largest dynasties in Han history. Muslims, however, mostly rejected the Sinicized order. During China's last dynasty, the Qing, the emperor garnered the acquiescence of diverse subject peoples by adopting their religious practices-Buddhism for the Mongols and Tibetans, and Daoism and Confucianism for the Han. The emperor gave generous gifts to the leaders of his subject peoples and married daughters by secondary concubines to the sons of Inner Asian leaders, in return for compliance with Han norms for foreign policy. But the Muslims of Xinjiang, Gansu, and Yunnan rejected Han and Manchu attempts to pose as representatives of their religious hierarchy and periodically rose up to secede from the empire, a problem that continues to bedevil present-day Chinese rule over Xinjiang.

China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order (south of Lake Baikal), the precursor to the treaty ports that the Europeans would use. At the time, China was busy suppressing the Zunghar Empire. Chinese victory over the latter entailed genocide for the Zunghar Mongols, permanently eliminating both the threat and the ethnic group. 
6
By the late eighteenth century, the Qing Empire had reached its maximum territorial extent. In fact, the final military campaigns of conquest had been costly and produced little further expansion. The campaigns to subdue the Tibetan Jinchuan minority in Western Sichuan (1747-49, 1771-76) succeeded, but at enormous cost. The Qing then practiced genocide on the Jinchuan who, like the Zunghars, have disappeared from the ethnic map. The Qing Burma Campaign (1766-70) failed, as did the Vietnam Campaign (1788-89).

China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order in the north and the maritime West with trading privileges on the coast. The West decided to help the dynasty by providing military expertise. Had it fallen, the West risked losing the many treaties setting up the treaty port system-China's interface with the global maritime order and precursor to Deng Xiaoping's special economic zones set up more than a century later. China then used Western technology to defeat the most threatening rebellions: the Taiping, Nian, Donggan, and Xinjiang. There were many other factors that went into the Qing victory, but it was a close call so that the Qing may have required all factors to survive. 
9
Thereafter, China responded with a Self-Strengthening movement. Han officials rapidly understood the efficacy of Western military technology and set about learning how to use and manufacture it. In the 1860s, various Han governors set up provincial arsenals and during the next two decades established some of the heavy industry necessary to manufacture weapons. They also hired foreign military experts to form Western-drilled armies.

Like China, Russia was a great land empire, whose leaders saw power and prestige in terms of territorial extent and so aimed at maximizing all three. Likewise, Russia's neighbors were much smaller both in territory and population. But unlike China, historically Russia was not culturally central, but rather it was a backwater of Europe that could boast superiority only in military and territorial terms. Russians tried to make a case for their own spiritual superiority, connecting the Russian spirit (russkaia dusha, русская душа) with a mystical quality associated with the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian culture. Their technologically superior neighbors were struck not by Russia's soul, but by its general poverty juxtaposed to the lavish living of a small aristocracy. Long historical connections with Europe meant that Russia rapidly felt the effects of the Industrial Revolution and began importing technology much earlier than did China. These effects would become lethal after the unification of Germany in 1871, putting a technologically superior great industrial power on Russia's border.
Like China, Russia also had a highly successful strategy for empire. Russian peasants fled their enserfers and spread out in search of new land on the frontiers. Fortune seekers 13-5   China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order also gravitated toward the frontiers. Farmers soon sought government help to defend their new lands against marauders. Nearby military commands tended to provide help. Civil officials followed. If the local Russian population and skeletal administration could take and retain territory on the cheap, the Russian government recognized their actions. If they could not, the Russian government disavowed them (a scenario that Russian President Vladimir Putin may have been trying to replay in 2014 vis-à-vis Ukraine).

The history of Russia is the history of a country in the process of colonizing itself. Her area of colonization grows in tandem with her national territory. At times shrinking and at times growing, this age-old movement continues to this very day….Therefore, the periods in our history are the stages which our people have gone through in the occupation and development of the land acquired by them.

As two expanding land empires, Romanov Russia and Qing China began to overlap in the mid-seventeenth century. The modus operandi established in the early eighteenth century at the time of the Qing suppression of the Zunghar Empire lasted nearly two centuries. As a result, Russia had the earliest European presence in Beijing, an ecclesiastical mission dating to the early eighteenth century. It took advantage of the coincidence of China's great internal rebellions with the Opium Wars to negotiate their shared frontier. Without firing a shot, it acquired territories five times the area of Japan by posing as China's mediator supposedly to help fend off the British and French Opium War demands while China desperately dealt with the Taiping Rebellion.

Because China did not adhere to the Western belief that treaties were permanent, it had no intention of honoring the terms of coerced documents; rather, it would bide its time to overturn them when the opportunity arose. But attempts to disregard the terms led to more lost wars and more onerous treaty terms: the Treaty of Nanjing (1842), the Treaty of Tianjin (1858), the Treaty of Beijing (1860), the Yantai Convention (1876), and the Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895).

China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order humiliation." The Han, however, never considered their own dire treatment of ethnic minorities entailing expulsion from traditional homelands or genocide.
Russia derived little wealth from its new territories, whose resources often duplicated the rich and undeveloped natural endowment of European Russia. In any case, the new resources were mainly inaccessible until the Trans-Siberian Railway was completed in 1916, and difficult to access even then. But the goal was not wealth maximization. Rather, Russian leaders clung to the pre-industrial view of territorial extent as the key to greatness and land as the ultimate source of power.
Until the late nineteenth century, Russia faced industrial powers only in Europe, but Japan's rise introduced the prospect of a two-front, great power war. For Russia, the rise of Japan and Germany in combination with the decline of China, were game changers. In World War II, Russia would play China against Japan to prevent a combined German-Japanese invasion.
Japan's Decision to Westernize in order to Defend against the West 
21
Their grand strategy had two phases: a domestic phase followed by a foreign policy phase. During the former, Japan carefully eschewed foreign policy crises by compromising with the great powers, lest war derail the domestic reform program. China took the opposite approach. Chinese resistance led to a series of regional wars that China lost-the Opium War (1839-42), the Arrow War (1856-60), the Sino-French War (1883-85), the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95), and the foreign intervention in the Boxer Uprising (1899-1900). The constant warfare-both civil and regional-precluded domestic reforms until the last decade of imperial rule, when China belatedly tried to introduce a broad reform program along the lines of what Japan implemented, but the military modernization led to a regime-changing mutiny of the Westernized army, whose Han officers and conscripts overthrew Manchu minority rule forever.

China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order Japanese leaders, by contrast, intended to protect their national security by transforming their country into a Westernized great power. This would entail creating the domestic institutional structures to eliminate the pretext for extraterritoriality-the adherence of Western nationals to Western law while residing in Japan-and other discriminatory articles of the so-called "unequal" treaties. Japan's leaders also believed that great powers required empires. Geography dictated that theirs would be on the Korean Peninsula and extending into Manchuria in order to create a resource base sufficient for prosperity and national security.
The domestic reform phase lasted from 1869 to 1894. The reforms included compulsory education, universal military conscription, an army general staff, the Bank of Japan, a new criminal code, a Cabinet subordinate to a prime minister, Imperial Tokyo University, civil service examinations, a constitution, a parliament, a reorganized court system, and a code of civil procedure. Together they became know as the Meiji Reforms. Japan made these painful and highly unpopular changes in order to become not just a consumer but also a producer of the modern technology necessary to protect its national security.
The domestic phase of these institutional reforms ended in 1894 when Great Britain, the reigning superpower, renegotiated its "unequal" treaties with Japan with a new set that treated Japan like any European power because Japan had the Westernized institutions necessary to conduct diplomatic and commercial relations according to the norms of the Westernized maritime order. Meanwhile, China did not rid itself of its unequal treaties until the height of World War II and, arguably later, with the return of Hong Kong and Macau to Chinese sovereignty in the late 1990s.
Upon completion of the domestic phase of its reforms, Japan immediately began the foreign policy phase to create an empire. Japan colonized its neighbors to stabilize failing states in the belief that only with stability and economic integration could they all prosper. Japan and Russia simultaneously became interested in the same territory. In the third quarter of the nineteenth century, Russia conquered the khanates of Central Asia and in 1891 began construction of a Trans-Siberian Railway that promised to overturn the balance of power in Manchuria, when Russia alone would be able rapidly to deploy troops. Like the Qing dynasty, Korea's Yi dynasty became ever more dysfunctional with each passing nineteenth-century monarch. Similarly, Korea faced the largest peasant rebellion in its history. Before Russia could use the railway to dash Japan's plans for empire by dominating northeast Asia, Japan fought two wars of Russian containment: the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-95) and Russo-Japanese War (1904-05). It won both and gained not only Korea, but also Taiwan, the Pescadores, and southern Manchuria. Initially, the West extolled Japan's transformation into a great power and its constructive participation in the maritime global order.
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order
The Meiji generation developed a new security paradigm. Each major conquest began with a surprise attack-on Korea in the First Sino-Japanese War, and Russian interests in Manchuria in the Russo-Japanese War, and throughout the Pacific in World War II. After winning the first two wars, Japan installed administrative institutions under the Imperial Japanese Army to maintain public order and to extract resources. It invested heavily in infrastructure, pacification, resource extraction, commercial crop development, and education. These created a literate population, a superior infrastructure, and rapid economic growth particularly in urban areas.

The Meiji generation understood the dawning post-Industrial Revolution global order far better than did Russia's leaders, let alone China's. The latter two saw the threat posed by the Industrial Revolution in military terms, so their solution entailed the importation, use, and manufacture of military technology. The Meiji generation saw the interconnections between civil and military institutions. Because many senior leaders had served in both, they had connections crossing institutions. The Meiji Constitution, however, did not set up any requirements to maintain these connections. The next generation would have better formal educations, but career tracks within particular organizations, so that military leaders would lose their appreciation for the civil side of governance and civil leaders would lack military credentials and, therefore, their military counterparts often did not respect them. In the early twentieth century, although the West continued to approve of Japanese goals, it increasingly loathed their methods that relied on coercion when those undergoing colonization resisted. The more concerted the resistance, the more vicious Japan's reprisals became. By the mid-1930s, a proclivity for reprisals would make Japan's empire ungovernable by creating determined enemies wherever the Imperial Japanese Army deployed.

• Those who ignore fundamental structural changes in the international economy do so at their peril. Time does not wait for the stubborn. Nor does time wait for the blind. It is imperative to distinguish one's primary, secondary, and tertiary enemies.
• China correctly identified the primary enemy as Chinese seeking to overthrow the dynasty but it did not grasp that Russia, a country after Chinese territory, was the secondary problem, while the West, separated by seas could never pose an equivalent threat.
• Ignorance of one's enemies is dangerous. A deeper Chinese knowledge of the West would have revealed the latter's primary interest in trade, which the Chinese could have turned to their mutual benefit.
• Finally, power is as much about a country's economic base and the structure of its civil institutions as it is about military institutions and hardware. Japan was the lone developing country of the nineteenth century to grasp the importance of institutions, whose structure then either predisposes or impedes the formulation of effective strategies.
The combined effects of World War I and the Great Depression upended the global order yet again. Between the Napoleonic Wars and World War I, there were no global wars. Most European conflicts were short. Until the Russo-Japanese War, Europeans won all their wars against non-European powers and usually at minimal costs to themselves, as was the case for their nineteenth century conflicts with China. In World War I, relentless trench warfare destroyed a generation of young men across Europe, sent time and again over trenches into oncoming machinegun fire with predictable results. The army leadership across Europe stuck with costly military strategies rather than carefully coordinating offensives with allies and military services. The scale of the bloodshed made a spectacle of European governments for their colonies, which now found much more to criticize in their overlords, and for European voters and veterans, who lost faith in their governments. The war severely weakened all European states politically and economically, although the expansion of the British Empire disguised the severity of Britain's wounds. Regime change occurred not only among the Central Powers, but also much more ominously in Russia and soon in Italy.
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order Russia could not endure the relentless battlefield casualties. The autocracy already faced a growing revolutionary movement prior to the hostilities. After relentless defeats, support for the tsar evaporated in the armed forces. When the successor provisional government tried to continue the war, the army collapsed, opening the opportunity for a Communist coup in the capital. Civil war (1917-22) followed. The new communist government rejected not only the traditional political and economic order, but also the social order. Communism entailed the imposition centralized political institutions under the communist party, the nationalization of all private property, and physical elimination of huge classes of people who resisted these changes or simply had no place in the new scheme of things. Their elimination required vicious civil wars when those slated for death resisted and, as a consequence an omnipresent secret police developed in countries with successful communist revolutions.
Meanwhile, in post-war Italy, fascists assumed power in the midst of a severe post-war depression and public outrage over the denial of territories promised by Italy's wartime allies. The fascists promised to restore prosperity and greatness with a new Roman empire. They emphasized nationalism, the martial races, government economic planning, and the evils of the maritime global order. The Russian communists and the Italian fascists inspired copycat movements across the globe. Both movements constituted violent attempts to replace the maritime global order.
Upon taking power in Russia, the Communists (then known as the Bolsheviks) ceded some of the most productive parts of the empire to the Central Powers in return for peace under the Treaty of Brest Litovsk. In addition to a large indemnity, Russia lost 25 percent of its population, 33 percent of its manufacturing, and 27 percent of its agricultural lands. 
28
The Communists built effective civil and military institutions with incredible speed, and the Soviet model became the roadmap to seize power in a shattered land that Soviet allies followed the world over: Starting with the likeminded banded together to establish a communist party, which in Tsarist Russia's case operated in exile for many years to protect the leadership from arrest. Within Russia, the party operated at two levels: the public and the covert. It had as large a public presence as the host legal system would allow and a covert presence engaged in terrorism, cadre recruitment, and propaganda to discredit the incumbent government. The plan was to destroy the host government from within, seize power, and implement a social revolution to eliminate elites of all ilk.
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order To win the civil war, the Bolsheviks leveraged their central position in St. Petersburg and Moscow to use the railway system that fanned out from these two hubs. They paired each military commander with a party member, connected with the secret police, who could eliminate uncooperative commanders as well as their families. Likewise, it paired party members with experts in the civil bureaucracy. This assured Communist Party control. The Bolsheviks also had a strong social program promising land to the peasants and literacy education for recruits. Land gave peasants a reason to fight, but in a classic bait and switch strategy, after the civil war, the new government deployed its battle-hardened army to take back the land from the peasants. It did so out of communist principles and financial necessity. 
29
30
The Russian Communists, like the tsars before them, saw greatness in terms of territorial extent and had the even more grandiose vision of transforming communism into the new world order, with Russians in the leadership position. They immediately developed the export version of their roadmap to power. They set up the Communist International, or Comintern, to train party members and funnel economic and military aid abroad. Although the public face of the Comintern was an organization independent of Russia, in reality it was an arm of Russian foreign policy. The Comintern helped others set up legal front organizations and recruit the likeminded, while also developing a covert organization to engage in proscribed activities-often propaganda in countries restricting press freedom and assassinations. In the 1930s, it encouraged the establishment of Communist parties along its borders and throughout Europe: Russia was particularly active in China, where its propaganda efforts were more effective than in any other country. The Bolsheviks promised to eliminate all tsarist unequal treaties, gaining instant popularity among Chinese intellectuals, but then secretly reneged without the intellectuals' noticing.

Economic depression created an environment conducive to extremism. It is no coincidence that Japan began the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1931, the year after the United States fatefully introduced the Hawley Smoot tariff raising its rates to historic highs. The other industrial powers followed suit, leaving trade-dependent Japan out in the cold and its civil leaders, who had long advocated cooperation with the West, in disgrace. This opened the door to the military's eclipse of Japan's civil leadership. Military-backed assassinations of both civil and military leaders silenced surviving moderates and produced cabinet appointments of members favoring an aggressive foreign policy. The finance minister was no longer included in key policy discussions so that the economic and financial consequences of military decisions were no longer carefully analyzed. Government decisions became measured in terms of operational rather than strategic success-in terms of military victory in the field of battle rather than in terms of the long-term impact on economic growth, the 13-14
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order actual foundation of both military power and personal prosperity. Japan's military lacked their grandparents' understanding of the civil underpinnings of effective governance and confused means with ends. Military victory was a means; prosperity and security were the ends, which the military means soon precluded. In many ways, the Chinese Nationalists followed a similar path. In China, as the Great Depression persisted and Japanese military intervention escalated, the Nationalist Party emasculated the civilian leadership leaving the military in charge.
In 1931, Japan abandoned the maritime order in which it had long been a constructive member, with fateful consequences for all. Its leaders chose a strategy of autarky to survive in a protectionism world. This entailed an empire expanded to a size sufficient to practice autarky, beginning with the invasion of Manchuria, an area larger than Germany and France combined. When the League of Nations condemned Japan's actions, it withdrew from the organization in 1933, signaling its rejection of the maritime global order for an alternate order based on conquest, autarky, nationalism, and military dominance over politics and society. Some have called this order fascism. Japan did so, just as the Nationalists developed a strategy that finally seemed capable of defeating the Chinese communists. The escalation of Japanese military operations derailed this process, even though the communists were the primary adversaries of both the Japanese and the Nationalists.
Russia observed with great concern the rise of fascism on two fronts in Germany in the West and Japan in the East. Russia had fallen to a one-front war in World War I when allied with the world's wealthiest nations. This time it was diplomatically isolated and had yet to recover from the combined effects of World War I and the Russian Civil War. In the 1930s, it tried to set up Germany to fight the West so that Russia could play the role of a jackal state late in the war. In fact, when Russia joined with Germany in 1939 to destroy Poland and divide Eastern Europe, it allowed Germany to acquire the resource base necessary to go to war. Germany then turned on Russia, the real target of its ambitions, as Adolf Hitler had made so clear in Mein Kampf, a book Joseph Stalin should have read, but apparently did not. So Russian strategy was disastrous in Europe.
However, the strategy was highly effective in Asia, where the Russians brokered a truce in the Chinese civil war. China rejected Japan's plans to transform it into a colony but did not replay the Manchus' failed strategy of conventional military resistance along the accessible coastline. Instead, the Nationalists and Communists together delivered a mixed conventional-guerrilla strategy that overextended Japan's limited manpower in a futile attempt to garrison the vastness of China. The Japanese army forgot about the rationale for the invasion, which was primarily economic, to become focused on operational wins that led to overextension ever farther inland as the Chinese traded space for time and implemented a ruinous boycott of Japanese goods. China lacked the conventional arms necessary to eject Japan, so the war stalemated. In the end, Japan's strategy of warfare impoverished both China and Japan.
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order In late 1936, within two weeks of the German-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, threatening an alliance that could visit a two-front war on Russia, Russia intervened diplomatically in the Chinese civil war. On the Russian promise of conventional military weapons, the Nationalists and Communists agreed to halt the civil war in order to combine against Japan, whose invasion of China had proceeded without interruption from Manchuria (1931-33), Jehol (1933), and throughout North China (1933-35). In 1937, after the Russian diplomatic intervention, the Second Sino-Japanese War escalated to encompass Central and South China, when the Nationalists abandoned their strategy of defeating the Communists before fighting the Japanese and went to war against Japan. Both the Communists and Nationalists believed that the Russians would also provide soldiers. They did not get it. Once they were in, Russia was out. Millions of Chinese died fighting Japan so Russians would not have to.
In 1941 when Japan decided to cut off foreign aid to the Nationalists by attacking US, British, and Dutch interests throughout the Pacific, it transformed the Nationalists from an isolated adversary into a member of a great-power alliance. This decision made victory impossible. By excluding the finance minister from high-level government meetings, the military ignored the mortal economic effects of its preferred strategy that rested increasingly on wishful thinking rather than on a hardheaded assessment of capabilities and goals. Japan's leaders forgot the roots of their prosperity, which lay in trade, not warfare. Before these irretrievable strategic mistakes, the West missed an opportunity to work with Japan in the 1920s when civil war wracked North China and when Soviet involvement became manifest. Japan's leaders correctly warned of the long-term dangers posed by the spread of communism to China, not only for Japan, but also for the world. The West, however, remained fixated on exacting retribution from Germany for past misdeeds, rather than focused on forestalling future disaster. If the West had not chosen to export its economic problems through protectionism, the speed if not the actual rise of communism and fascism might have been slowed. We will never know whether active Western diplomacy in China in combination with US membership in the League of Nations would have helped Japan remain engaged in the Western global order.
• Keep the global economy healthy so that constructive participation in the global maritime order offers economic growth not poverty.
• Align military campaigns with allies in order to maximize the damage on those who would overturn the global order.
• Likewise, cooperate with friends and coordinate economic policies. The failure to do so by civil and military leaders alike in World War I and the Great Depression-the sins of omission-came at a huge cost, paid not only by their children who fought their war but by their grandchildren, who fought yet another world war that grew out 13-16
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order of botched war termination of World War I and economic mismanagement of the Great Depression.
World War II leaders, the conscripts of World War I, did not repeat the mistakes of their grandparents, but paid careful attention to allies, joint and combined operations, war termination, enforcement of the peace, and the health of the global economy. So World War I was not the war to end all wars. It destroyed neither the will nor the ability of Germany to rise again. Instead it gave rise to two potent world orders hostile to the maritime global order: communism and fascism that both promised to right the wrongs of unfettered capitalism. The Great Depression put both movements on steroids when democracies throughout the developed world failed to end the depression, leaving workers and factories idle in societies in desperate need of income and manufactures. In contrast, the communists' and fascists' breakneck military spending and comprehensive government economic planning restored their economies to growth long before the conventional strategies followed elsewhere yielded results. For the Anglophone world, World War II was fought to undo the damage.
In the 1930s, Britain and the United States, observed global events with increasing dismay. Adolf Hitler's invasion of Western Europe then made clear that fascism, not communism posed the greatest threat. Hitler's invasion of Russia soon convinced Russia that the fascists posed a greater danger than the capitalists. German and Japanese actions created a lethal opposing alliance out of the most unlikely partners. Imperial Britain, communist Russia, and the anti-colonial United States cooperated in a way that would have been unthinkable prior to the rise of Hitler. Britain, the guarantor of the pre-war world order, and the United States, which would become the guarantor of the post-war peace, spent the war years, not only carefully coordinating military campaigns with Russia, but also planning the institutional structures to maintain the post-war order. Their plans ran counter to those of Russia, so it is not surprising that the unlikely alliance dissolved immediately after the common threat of fascist Germany disappeared.
Post-war, the Western allies and Russia set about building opposing global orders. The West tried to reintroduce the maritime global order through the United Nations, the Bretton Woods system, the Marshall Plan, regional alliances-most notably the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Economic Community, and, at the national level, through democratic elections. Membership in these institutions and alliances was voluntary, and, over time, more and more countries found that membership was in their own interests, thereby contributing to the spread and deepening of the maritime global order.
Although the war left fascism in tatters, it invigorated communism. After World War II, Russia helped communists in Eastern Europe infiltrate the host Ministry of the Interior 13-17
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order to arrest their way to power by incarcerating or executing members of non-communist parties. The presence of the Red Army, which after World War II never left, provided backbone to communist party rule.

When the Chinese communists won the civil war, they added a chapter to the communist playbook on taking power-not from the cities but from the countryside. The Chinese communists created armies from scratch through a long process of turning peasants into party members and cadres into guerrilla, whose forces over the years became more proficient at larger military operations. Their strategy to take over the host from within entailed three stages of military development that ultimately brought victory in large conventional battles. Transition to the final stage required imported conventional weapons, which presumed a great power ally, i.e., Russia, the only available great communist power. So Russia and China armed and funded communist movements the world over. The West countered with its own aid programs, leaving all sides in the wars of independence well armed. 
37
China played a critical role at the end of the Cold War. The Chinese communists had required Russian military, economic, technical, and other aid in order to win the long Chinese civil war. Yet both countries remained true to their continental traditions that made them wary of great power neighbors. Russia had funded multiple sides throughout the Chinese civil war to delay the rise of a bordering great power. Russian advisers had even tried to discourage the Chinese communists from crossing the Yangzi River in 1949 to unite the country. 
38
Mao Zedong proved much more astute at politics and war than at economics. His insistence on the Great Leap Forward (1958) collectivizing and nationalizing all of China produced the country's first nationwide famine, the Great Famine (1958-62), in which 40 million died.

China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order Chinese frontier, which was far more expensive for Russia than for China, whose population density formed a powerful defense. Russia, whose eastern periphery had hardly any Russian population, relied on expensive mechanized forces. These expenses in combination of Russian military expenses garrisoning Eastern Europe and defending against NATO constituted an enormous financial burden on a not particularly productive economy.
Although the communist model proved effective for imposing and maintaining oneparty rule and installing a dictator for life, it was ill-suited for creating prosperity thereafter. Communists correctly emphasized the primacy of economics but did not understand how modern economies produce wealth. So they executed the very categories of people necessary to run a modern economy. Likewise, they eliminated the very institutions and laws necessary to promote economic growth-most notably private property and free markets. And they also eliminated the freedoms necessary to run effective markets, the principal ones being freedom of expression and freedom of movement.
The extraction of investment capital from agriculture impoverished the bulk of the population, who were originally peasants even in Russia. The focus on heavy industry in order to build a state-of-the-art military retarded the development of light industry and the production of consumer goods, so that living standards stagnated after reaching pre-war levels. Moreover, full nationalization of industry put the party in complete control over the urban economy and central plans dictated production thereafter. Modern economies, however, turned out to be far too complicated to plan. The decentralized markets of capitalist countries proved to be far more adept at allocating resources and maximizing production and innovation. The human costs of imposing and maintaining communist rule kept on mounting, requiring extensive prison camp systems to deter critics.
Although the model produced the rapid growth of heavy industry, it set the conditions for the stagnation of agriculture and light industry. Because the growth was not balanced or self-sustaining-the gains from collectivization and nationalization occurred but once-over time economic growth rates lagged far behind those in the West. There was also the yawning gap between the tale the communists told about how they ruled and the actual historical record. This became known as the Big Lie, which did not set the conditions for an innovative society either, rather, unorthodox thinking risked imprisonment. Communism yielded extreme political repression and long-term economic stagnation detrimental to its ultimate survival.
It took several generations before the evidence concerning divergent living standards became overwhelming even to the communist elite, who by the 1980s must have realized that their own purchasing power at home was literally inferior to that of US welfare mothers with access to Walmart. (The author's anecdote: while living in Moscow at that time, the local "super" market sold a total of about 75 different goods, comparing unfavorably with the variety offered by standard candy racks lining US supermarket checkout lanes.) The cumulative effects of communism left Russia so far behind 13-20   China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order technologically that its military equipment could no longer match that of its rivals and trend lines indicated that its economic problems were compounding.
Russia and the Soviet Union formed an odd, inverted empire. According to communist theory, the mother country by definition was the most economically developed part of the empire that extracted primary resources from the underdeveloped and impoverished periphery. In the Soviet Empire, Eastern Europe and the Baltic States were far more prosperous and economically developed. Indeed, those parts of the empire with the deepest historical association with Western Europe and the maritime world remained the wealthiest.
The Russian government was the primary victim of the Big Lie. When Mikhail Gorbachev tried to reform Russia so as to save communism, he sequenced political reforms before economic reforms, while planning to fund the economic reforms from savings generating by terminating the Cold War. This would allow him to shift money from foreign to domestic policy. He apparently had no idea how hated Russian rule was in Eastern Europe and among Russia's many nationalities, so that when central power weakened the colonies bolted. He also apparently did not understand that Russia was one of the most backward parts of the empire and had long lived off the labor of others. When Eastern Europe became independent and no longer had to subsidize Russia, Russian living standards collapsed. Even in Russia proper, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union lost power before the economic reforms could bear fruit.

• Mistakes the magnitude of World War I and the Great Depression take generations to repair.
• Immersion in domestic politics to the exclusion of the vital interests of friends and foes (America in the roaring twenties and during the Great Depression) risks reaping the whirlwind.
• Not only is it important to prioritize (and correctly) one's enemies, it is equally important to treat one's friends right.
• Soviet coercion of Eastern Europe and China yielded long-term hostility among its closest neighbors-hardly a recipe for security in the modern age. Indeed, strategies entailing the oppression of allies or occupied lands boomerang in the long term, delivering the opposite of intended outcomes.

The cell phone has brought telephone service throughout the world, while the Internet has made knowledge accessible worldwide. It is no longer possible to close off populations in the way required by past dictatorships unless one intends to live (and die) in the abject poverty of North Koreans. With instant media, foes can no longer be fought sequentially, in the way required by past continental powers. Rapid communication allows small countries to recognize threats in real time and combine forces to counter a great power foe.
Today prosperity requires connections with the outside. Communist countries that intend to become prosperous, or just wealthy enough to maintain strong militaries, cannot remain walled off financially as in the past. Much of their wealth, particularly in the case of China, is based on participation in the global maritime order through mutually beneficial trade. These connections make countries that threaten the global maritime order more vulnerable to sanctions than in the past. Moreover, the myriad international organizations that form the backbone of the global maritime order have grown stronger as more and more countries find participating in them beneficial and whose participation then strengthens these institutions. The communications revolution has put dictatorships of all kinds in a far more disadvantageous position than in the past both at home and abroad.
With the implosion of the Soviet Union and the many revelations from its archives concerning the brutality of its rule and poverty of its citizens, communism has been defanged. Communism became a lethal threat to the global order because so many people around the world believed its message and emulated its model. Even China has now abandoned the economic model, which, according to Marxist teachings, justifies communist political institutions and one-party rule. It is unclear how long the political superstructure can survive the demolition of its economic foundations. In any case, communism no longer has 13-22   China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order any export value. China's abandonment of communist economics has restored its historical place as the dominant economy of Asia and funded its ambitious foreign policy that gives little consideration to the interests of close neighbors but focuses on old grievances from the Second Sino-Japanese War.
Japan long acquiesced to US foreign policy dictates, but with the sixtieth anniversary of World War II, according to conventional Japanese periodization, the World War II era has ended and a new era has begun. China's continued reliance on hatred as the motivating force for its foreign policy, however useful domestically, boomeranged internationally. Hatred creates enemies and spikes tensions in ways that are ultimately self-defeating. Already, Chinese militancy toward Japan rapidly eroded the latter's strong post-war pacifism. China responded to the 1989 Tiananmen uprising with a thorough revamping of textbooks in order to restore student loyalties to the government. Past texts had rallied student sympathies around the hatred of the Nationalists and class enemies. Post-Tiananmen texts vilified Japan and the West, i.e., the maritime global order.

Overextension is a real problem that real people face more often than one might think. The Russian empire imploded twice in the twentieth century because of over-extension: once mid-World War I and once at the end of the Cold War. Japan succumbed to overextension in the Second Sino-Japanese War, the Nationalists in the Chinese Civil War, and arguably the Qing dynasty conquered too much to hold forever. In all cases, the results were catastrophic. Allies are often essential to avoid overextension. A growing list of enemies is disastrous. Therefore, competent foreign policy must take into careful consideration the interests of other countries. There are at least two types of overextension, military and economic. A competent foreign policy aligns ambitions with the underlying economic base. Those who think offensive weapons are the ultimate currency of power are wrong, as the fate of China's self-strengtheners and the Soviet Union demonstrates. The underlying economic base in combination with the roster of one's friends is the ultimate currency of power.
It is important to fight the right enemy. China fought the wrong enemies in the Opium Wars-Britain and France, instead of Russia, which took something valuable-a huge swath 13-23   China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order of territory that was never returned. Japan fought the wrong enemy in Second Sino-Japanese War. The communists were the primary enemies of both Japan and the Nationalists. By fighting each other, they predisposed a communist victory in the Chinese civil war-a problem that still endures.
Censorship and dictatorship impeded the flow of information necessary to make the accurate assessments on which a sound foreign policy depends. Dictatorships have been best at deceiving themselves, as they succumb to their own propaganda, with dire consequences for themselves. Note, for example, the fate of both the fascists and communists whose lies eventually could not hide the reality. Communism was a nonfunctional economic and political model that Russia and China would have been better off discarding sooner rather than later. Censorship, however, allows bad paradigms to survive far longer than their natural shelf life, victimizing censors and censored alike.
As seductive as the idea of deterrence is, in practice, if the value of the undesirable activity is associated with regime survival by the undesirable party, then deterrence is unlikely to succeed. US attempts to deter Japan by embargo before World War II precipitated the very attacks it was designed to forestall. Japan viewed its problems in China as existential and therefore was not susceptible to deterrence. Likewise, Japan's attempt to deter further Western intervention in China by bombing Pearl Harbor and targets across the Pacific produced the very march on Tokyo that Japan could not parry. Isolationist America turned on a dime when the attacks made clear to voters that the global order on which their prosperity depended was at stake.
In high-stakes disagreements when deterrence is not feasible, then the very lethality of the threat can be used to strengthen the international system to put time on one's side. Threats can be used to build alliances, strengthen international institutions, and facilitate cooperation to create enduring mechanisms and precedents that both further constrain undesired actions and continue to strengthen the international order long after the crisis subsides. Thus, the threat can be used to set the conditions for its elimination. This approach replaces a negative objective (deterrence), with a positive objective (strengthening of the global order). In World War II, the Allies set precedents for cooperation that the Western Allies further developed after the war. The Western alliance in the Cold War then deepened the global order. The lethality of the threat of fascism during the global hot war followed by the communist threat in the ensuing cold war made this possible. In this way, the more dire the threat, the stronger the international order becomes. In 2014, Vladimir Putin took the first steps to restore the Russian empire with the seizure of the Crimea, beginning anew the age-old process described by the tsarist historian Kliuchevskii. Although the communists reconstructed the fallen tsarist empire, Vladimir Putin faces a more difficult task. A repeat performance may not be possible in the age of modern international law that rejects unilateral territorial changes; when real-time news shows tanks as they cross borders allowing others to respond immediately; with a global 13-24   China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order financial system controlled by the maritime order, which can freeze, seize, or restore assets; and, most importantly, without a highly marketable ideology as communism once was. Moreover, the wealth gap separating Russia from members of the maritime order has only grown, positioning Russia ever more poorly to impose its will on others. Russia's best course of action is to join the maritime order but, like China, it prefers to forge its own path.
Historically, Russia has been incredibly savvy at the operational level combining diplomacy, propaganda, and coercion to take contiguous territory often on the cheap. Its methods depend on failing state, non-state, or defeated state neighbors as well as secrecy. But Russia has been incompetent at the strategic level because its strategies have produced death on a massive scale both at home and abroad, and poverty for itself and its friends. Likewise, Chinese history has been unbelievably bloody. Ongoing civil war in some part of the country is the norm not the exception. Times of prosperity have been brilliant but shorter than the devastating periods of unremitting warfare.
There are unsettling parallels between China today and Japan of the 1930s. Both divide the world in terms of island chains, allude to an Asian Monroe Doctrine, and try to make neighbors follow their wishes. In both systems, the military holds great power. These similarities follow earlier parallels between the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping and those of Meiji Japan. Will China's rise also be followed by a strategic suicide? Watching the evolution of China's maritime territorial disputes that have alienated its neighbors, one wonders whether China will repeat Japan's mistake to confuse ends with means. If the ends are security and prosperity, then a fight over small islands and even energy rights will not be worth the candle.
Today, there are no economic problems the magnitude of the Great Depression that set Japan (and Germany) on the road to self-destruction. But the Chinese Communist Party faces an existential domestic threat to its continued rule of the magnitude of that faced by the Qing dynasty and the continuance of Manchu minority rule. The survivors of the twentieth century communist killing spree may wish to settle scores with their government. Certainly, there is much domestic anger at perceived corruption of party members. Should events and desires not align, one wonders whether China's leaders will suffer the same sort of amnesia that Japan's did in the 1930s and forget the international commercial connections on which their prosperity depends. They are correct that democracy poses an existential threat to one-party rule. The two systems are mutually exclusive. China's leaders must decide whether their goal is the perpetuation one-party rule or the prosperity of China. So far, it has been possible to pursue both goals simultaneously, but a fork in the road approaches when they will have to choose.
The goals of land and maritime powers differ fundamentally.
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order
• Land powers strive to for the domination and absorption of neighbors, producing a negative-sum international environment not conducive to wealth generation. Their global order emphasizes wealth confiscation not creation.
• Maritime powers focus on positive-sum transactions to create wealth through trade.
Japan has embraced the maritime world. Russia continues to reject it. And China remains torn.
China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order
Germany and Russia's "enduring strategic rivalry" lasted almost exactly seventy-five years and embraced two world wars. Within that time frame, there were occasional periods of rapprochement and even strategic cooperation between the two, first as common guarantors of monarchical stability and solidarity in the late nineteenth century (1873-79, 1881-94), then as bitter opponents of the post-1918 Versailles settlement (1921-33), and then, for a relatively brief but terrifying period, totalitarian partners standing against the western alliance (1939-41). These periods of calm were not the same as friendship, however, and the two never dropped their mutual attitude of wary suspicion. Their enmity culminated in the two world wars, and indeed, was a principal cause of both conflicts. In both world wars, Russia and Germany fielded the largest armies, fought the greatest campaigns, and spilled more blood against one another than any other combatant powers.
It is tempting to seek the roots of tension between the two in the distant past, and historians have been doing just that for decades. The standard historical narrative points to struggles for land between Teuton and Slav in the medieval or even ancient worlds. Key signposts along the way include the wars on the eastern marches of the Carolingian Empire, the German Drang nach Osten ("eastern impulse") or Ostsiedlung (eastern settlement) of the Middle Ages, and-richest of all in terms of myth and legend-the Teutonic Knights carving out a monastic principality in the primeval forests of East Prussia, ruling the conquered natives as overlords from their dark, forbidding castle at Marienburg (today, Poland's Malbork).

The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 dominant land power in Europe, one hegemon, Russia and Germany were probably destined for war at some point.
Upon closer analysis, equally dramatic asymmetries present themselves, and they too played a role in fostering conflict. Seen from the Russian perspective, Germany was smaller but more densely populated, much more heavily industrialized, and thus far more dynamic and potentially expansionist. Germany was a powerful spring that might break its ties at any moment, uncoiling itself and wreaking havoc on anyone unlucky enough to be in the way. After 1871, the Germans held a hegemonic position in the European littoral, from which they not only blocked Russian access to the west but were also well poised to turn and devour the lumbering eastern empire whenever they chose. In such a scenario, Russia's vast size would be a hindrance rather than an advantage, retarding military readiness and turning mobilization into a matter of months rather than days. Fear of Germany was, therefore, the latest incarnation of a long-standing Russian xenophobia, generated by Russia's sense of its own insecurity and reified over the centuries by the devastating Mongol, Swedish, and French invasions.
For all its dynamism and power, Germany, too, could look to the east and conjure a vision of its own nemesis. Germany was a relatively crowded land, constricted in a geographical and strategic sense. It occupied a dangerous spot in the middle of the North German Plain, lacked much in the way of defensible borders, and possessed only the narrowest access to the sea. Historian Michael Stürmer has described it as der Macht in der Mitte ("the power in the middle"), surrounded by enemies or potential enemies in the course of its historical development: France to the west, Austria to the south, Sweden to the north, and, of course, mighty Russia to the east.

The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945
Before 1871, good relations between Russia and Prussia were a bedrock of European diplomacy. Not only were they two of Europe's most conservative monarchies-staunch enemies of the French Revolution and Napoleon, for example-but their self-interest also ran in parallel directions, and Polish weakness and instability were a magnet to them. In the eighteenth century, both had taken part in the most hard-headed and cynical event of the era: the three partitions of Poland in 1772, 1793, and 1795.

In view of the necessity to abolish everything which could revive the memory of the existence of the Kingdom of Poland, now that the annulment of this body politic has been effected, the high contracting parties are agreed and undertake never to include in their titles the name or designation of the Kingdom of Poland.

The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   Just a few years earlier, they had it within their power to halt the entire process. Unfortunately, the creation of modern Germany dovetailed neatly with a period of internal consolidation in Russia. The Crimean War (1854-56) had been a disaster, with the armies of Tsar Nicholas I displaying ineptitude in the field, losing one battle after the other, and failing even to defend Sevastopol, a powerful fortress on their own soil.

Most importantly, Alexander abolished serfdom in 1861. The abolition of serfdom was fraught with all sorts of complexities, including compensation for the landholding class, and historians continue to discuss its successes and failures. Nevertheless, it is no exaggeration to say that the reforms of Alexander II created the modern Russian state.

It did not take long for that realization to set it. The old Prussia had been a reliable and conservative junior partner-and the new Germany was anything but. In terms of military power, economic production, internal dynamism, and brilliance of leadership, it had leapfrogged its former friend. The foundation of the Reich had also undermined the notion of monarchical solidarity and legitimacy. In destroying the German Confederation, Bismarck had dethroned one prince after the other, and had even seized the treasury of George V of Hanover. Historians may well argue today about the nature of the "real 14-5
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   Bismarck"-the great unifier, the balance of power genius, the "white revolutionary." 
21
22
To achieve these ends-maintenance of the status quo and isolation of France-one of his first diplomatic moves after the victory over France was to propose the formation of a Three Emperors' League (Dreikaiserbund)-Germany, the Habsburg Empire, and Russia, united in common opposition to radicalism, revolution, and restive subject nationalities. 
23
Unfortunately, it was doomed from the start. The foundational problem was that the three powers were no longer conservative in any real sense. Post-1866 Austria had become Austria-Hungary, the land of the Ausgleich and power-sharing between the German and Magyar populations. Forcibly expelled from its dominant role in German affairs, it had shifted its center of gravity to the east and south. The only place where it could exhibit the dynamism and expansionism that were so de rigueur in the late nineteenth century was the Balkan Peninsula where Ottoman Power continued to recede.
That same description applied to the other two partners. Stripped of its old role as protector of Orthodox Christianity by defeat in the Crimea, Russia had adopted a new one: active protector of the small Slavic nations, the "little brothers," against the depredation of Magyar, Teuton, and Turk. The center of gravity for this effort would be the Balkans, and Russian foreign policy began to focus there in an increasingly aggressive manner. As for Bismarck, no one could possibly have taken him seriously as a conservative, least of all he himself. As he proved throughout his career, he was ready to take whatever actions he believed were necessary at the moment, unfettered by promises or principle. It was both the beauty and the flaw of Realpolitik. 
24
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   The problem of managing allies who were at cross-purposes in a traditionally volatile corner of Europe eluded a solution, even for a diplomat as skilled as Bismarck. His frequent suggestions to partition the Balkans, placing the western half under Austria-Hungary and the eastern under Russia, were always half-hearted (and unworkable) and his tendency to say one thing to Chancellor Gorchakov and another very different thing to the Austrian foreign minister, Jules Andrassy, only exacerbated the problem-increasing suspicions and keeping tensions at a high level. But there was no easy solution, and in Bismarck's defense, keeping the two potential adversaries talking was preferable to seeing them go to war, a war that would have set Europe aflame and dragged in both Germany and France at some point.
Given its systemic problems, the Three Emperors' League quick demise was no surprise. The Balkans had long been a graveyard of empires and overly precious diplomatic schemes. The Great Power here, the Ottoman Empire, was in the midst of a long, slow decline that had once led Nicholas I to dub it the "sick man" of Europe. Already in the nineteenth century, the Serbs, the Greeks, and then the Romanians had risen up and won first their autonomy, and then their independence. In August 1875, it happened again, as an anti-Turkish rebellion broke out among the ethnic Serbs of Herzegovina, spread to neighboring Bosnia, and thence, by 1876, to Bulgaria. The Turks suppressed rebellion in all these vilayets (provinces) with their customary vigor, atrocities broadcast to the west in full living color in W. E. Gladstone's grisly pamphlet Bulgarian Horrors and the Question of the East.

27
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   By this point, the other European powers had become concerned about the prospect of a decisive Russian victory, which seemed to herald the end of the Ottoman Empire as well as Russian dominance of the entire Near East. Warnings flew from the various capitals into St. Petersburg, and Great Britain sent its Mediterranean squadron fleet to the Dardanelles, its ritual sign of support for the Ottomans. Tensions simmered, then exploded in March 1878 when Turkey and Russia signed the Treaty of San Stefano. Its key clause was the establishment of a large, independent Bulgaria straddling the Balkan peninsula, which most European statesmen presumed would be a puppet state of the power that had liberated it-Russia. Austria-Hungary, Great Britain, and France all protested angrily at what appeared to be a naked Russian power grab in the Balkans, and a general war seemed on the near horizon.
Bismarck had intentionally held back from the crisis up to this point. For public consumption, he declared Germany's utter disinterest in the Balkans. The entire region, he once proclaimed to the Reichstag, was not worth "the bones of a single Pomeranian grenadier," not worth the life of one German soldier, in other words. He now proposed an international conference to settle the dispute, promising to act as an "honest broker" at the deliberations, an individual who had no dog in the fight but who simply wanted to see justice done. In June 1878, the Great Powers dutifully convened at the Congress of Berlin, with the representatives of the Great Power, among them Otto von Bismarck, first chancellor of the German Empire; Gyula, Count Andrássy, Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, A. M. Gorchakov, Chancellor of Russia, Benjamin Disraeli, prime minister, of the British Empire, and William Waddington, minister of foreign affairs, for France.
The Congress resulted in an apparently reasonable compromise, splitting the Greater Bulgaria into three sections: the autonomous principality of Bulgaria (north of the Balkans, including the city of Sofia), Eastern Rumelia (between the Balkan and the Rhodope mountains, placed under an Ottoman-appointed Christian governor and Great Power supervision); and Macedonia, which was returned to the Ottomans. To compensate for Russia's presumed dominance in Bulgaria, the Congress gave Austria-Hungary permission to occupy and administer (but not to annex) Bosnia and Herzegovina, while Great Britain signed a separate convention with the Ottoman Empire that ceded the island of Cyprus to British rule. 
28
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   The Russians knew who to blame for their travails at Berlin. Not Britain, whose support of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire was a pillar of foreign policy. Not Austria-Hungary, which had stolen in at the last moment to pick up the spoils from Russia's military victory. Not France, certainly, which as deranged with anger as it was towards Germany, still managed to come away from the Congress with something to show: permission to occupy and administer the North African city of Tunis.
All of them had signed the Treaty of Berlin but to the Russians, the identity of the culprit was clear. It was the statesmen who stood at the center of the talks, the one around whom everyone seemed to be revolving, the one who claimed to be an "honest broker," but now, suddenly, did not seem very honest at all. He was a genius; everyone in Europe said so. Anything that took place at this Congress in his own backyard had to be his doing.
The Russians-government and public opinion alike-blamed Bismarck. In the aftermath of the Congress, he and his new Germany became punching bags for the Russian press and for Pan-Slavs in general, with one newspaper claiming that, "The honest broker acted for a big commission."

The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   It began in 1879, when Germany and Austria-Hungary signed the Dual Alliance, a mutual defense pact directed against Russia: Should, contrary to their hope, and against the genuine desire of the two high contracting parties, one of the two empires be attacked by Russia, the high contracting parties are bound to come to each other's assistance with the whole war strength of their empires, and will accordingly conclude peace together and upon mutual consent (Article 1).

But even this minimal policy was unable to withstand the reality of Balkan politics. Although the next few years passed uneventfully enough, and the Russians renewed the Three Emperors' Alliance on schedule in 1884, another Bulgarian crisis arose the next year that overturned Bismarck's carefully wrought alliance system altogether-a sign of how 14-10
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 fragile any treaty relationship is if it crosses paths with strategic realities. The original ruler of Bulgaria, Knyaz (Prince) Alexander of Battenberg, was a cousin of Alexander III and an officer in the Russian army. His reign thus seemed to fulfill the promise of Russian primacy in the new state. In 1885, however, after an uprising in Eastern Rumelia, the separated principality declared union with the mother country, and the Grand National Assembly of the new enlarged Bulgaria broke with Russia and forced Alexander's abdication. Eventually, the Assembly offered the throne to another German prince, Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, a figure with close familial ties to the western dynasties. Now Russia's humiliation from 1878-79 was complete, as its one legitimate gain from the war with Turkey had apparently slipped through its fingers. 
37
By now, the well-established ritual of Russian foreign policy admitted only one possible scapegoat for this development: Bismarck. The Pan-Slavs were particularly outraged. M. N. Katkov, writing in the Moscow newspaper Vedomostei, accused Russia of "losing its identity as an independent power" and being "pushed out of the East [Balkans] step by step":
Our allies used everything imaginable-cajolery and lures, cheating and sophistry, a charade of principles, psychological pressure, the cosmopolitan orientation of our diplomacy, the illiteracy of our politics, and the threat of [hostile] coalitions.... We see with great concern that, due to the Three Emperors' League [sic], Russia's authority was shaken; that its policies, injurious to Russia, and to which Russia contributed on its own, alienated from Russia those countries for whose independence Russia had shed so much of its own blood. 
38
Events had now driven Bismarck's vision of peaceful cooperation with Russia into the last ditch. Part of him despaired altogether but that was nothing new. He was given to depression. This was, after all, a man who even at the peak of his power suffered from nightmares: I go on dreaming what I am thinking awake, if I can sleep at all. Recently I saw the map of Germany in front of me, on it there appeared one decaying patch after another and peeling off.

Promising "benevolent neutrality" in the event that either party "should find itself at war with a third Great Power" but specifically excluding a German war with France or a Russian war with Austria, the Reinsurance Treaty was Bismarck at his Machiavellian best. At the very least, it violated the spirit of the Dual Alliance (since expanded into a Triple Alliance with the addition of Italy), and later attempts by historians to defend it fall into hair-splitting legalism at best. The new Kaiser, Wilhelm II, who succeeded to the throne in 1888, regarded it as dishonorable and unworthy of a great Power, and so did many of the advisors around him. Wilhelm II was a callous and crude young man in so many ways but even he could see that treaties so complex they required a team of lawyers to interpret were no treaties at all. His refusal to renew the Reinsurance Treaty was one of the crucial issues leading to Bismarck's forced resignation in 1890. Bismarck's successor as chancellor, Leo von Caprivi, complained that conditions in the Balkans have increased the antagonism between Russia and Austria. Germany would run the danger of someday having to decide between Austria and Russia.... What value are alliances if they are not founded on a community of interest between nations?

The run up to World War I has generated a standard historical narrative. It begins with Germany's turn towards "world policy" (Weltpolitik) and fleet building, and goes on to include a series of treaties and diplomatic crises: the Anglo-French Entente Cordiale of 1904, the First Moroccan Crisis of 1905, the formation of the Triple Entente of 1907, a Second Moroccan Crisis in 1911, and the Balkan Wars of 1912-13. All were important to the outbreak of war but none as important as the Bosnian Crisis of 1908-9 (also known as the First Balkan Crisis). Taking place precisely in the middle of the seventy-five year era discussed in this essay, it may be the single most important event in the history of Russian-German rivalry-the defining moment.
In October 1908, Austria-Hungary made a unilateral decision to annex Bosnia-Herzegovina. The move was defensive rather than aggressive. With the onset of the Young Turk revolt in the Ottoman Empire, reform, centralization, and constitution-writing were the order of the day in Istanbul. Bosnia-Herzegovina was still under the nominal suzerainty of the Sultan, and with a new Ottoman Parliament expected to make a declaration affirming the empire's territorial integrity, the position of the provinces would once more come into question. Indeed, the Habsburgs themselves had never settled on a satisfactory definition of "occupation and administration," the language used in Article 25 of the Treaty of Berlin, as opposed to outright annexation. It therefore seemed prudent to the Austrian foreign minister, Alois Lexa von Aerenthal, to settle the ownership of the provinces once and for all with a definitive annexation.
Of course, prudent or not, this was a Balkan issue of international importance, and the Austrian declaration touched off a violent reaction. Serbia, which had the best ethnic claim to Bosnia-Herzegovina, spearheaded the outrage but the Russians, too, objected to this clear breach of the Berlin treaty. The Serbs had successfully drawn Russia into war in the past, and they did their best to do it again this time. The Serbian foreign minister, Nikola
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   Pasic, approached the Russians to ask for their support in a war against Austria-Hungary. His Russian counterpart, Alexander Izvolsky, demanded the convening of another international congress. He had just met with Minister Aerenthal, privately at Buchlau Castle in Moravia in September. 
44
Back and forth went the war of words, with Serbia and Russia both threatening military action against Austria-Hungary. War might very likely have broken out were it not for German intervention. In March 1909, the acting state secretary in the German Foreign Ministry, Alfred von Kiderlen-Wächter, presented an ultimatum to the Russian government demanding that it cease its agitation over the issue. Germany had already advised the Austrians to seek international approval for suspending Article 25 of the Berlin Treaty:
But before we make this proposal to Austria-Hungary, we have to know with certainty that Russia would accept the Austrian note and that it will agree, without reservations, t1o suspend Article 25. Please tell Mr. Izvolsky categorically that we expect a precise answer-yes or no. Any evasive, hedged, or unclear answer we would have to regard as a rejection.
In case of rejection, Kiderlen went on to warn, Germany "would then withdraw and let events take their course." 
45
46
The Bosnian Crisis is the key to understanding Russian behavior in the summer of 1914. Once again, events in the Balkans-in this case, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand-had thrown Europe into crisis. Once again, Austria-Hungary appeared to be on the march. Just as it had taken Bosnia-Herzegovina in 1908, so now it seemed poised to swallow up Serbia in revenge for its alleged role in the murder of the Archduke. Once again, Germany was backing Austria-Hungary to the hilt, threatening language was 14-14
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 emanating from Berlin, and it seemed as if Russia's allies might prefer talking the issue to death than act. Once again, Russia promised to come to Serbia's defense but backing down as it had done in 1909 was not an option this time. Russia's prestige, indeed its very status as a Great Power, was on the line. This time, Russia would force the issue-declaring mobilization and setting its armies in motion towards the Austrian border. But not merely the Austrian border: Russian troops were also pouring into Poland and the Baltic littorals, heading towards the frontier with the real enemy, the foe who had blocked Russian advancement at every turn for the past forty years: Germany. In that sense, German-Russian strategic rivalry was the real and proximate cause of World War I.
The same is true of World War II-that is to say, the war arose out of the complex relationship between Germany and Russia. On the surface, both of them had a great deal in common in the post-1918 era. The Tsarist and German Empires were gone, the victims of popular discontent and revolution. In their place were regimes dominated by modern ideologies-communism for the Soviet Union, first democracy and then fascism for Germany. Both states had suffered grievous territorial losses as a result of the war, and worst of all, the postwar settlement had resurrected the state of Poland, a fact that neither was inclined to accept in the long term. Indeed, the Chief of the German Army High Command in the early 1920s, General Hans von Seeckt, had gone so far as to say that Poland's existence was "unbearable" (unerträglich) for Germany. 
47
The Treaty of Rapallo in 1922, for example, took the western powers by surprise. While the two greatest land powers in the world had apparently buried their hatchet, closer inspection shows it in less dramatic colors. The two did agree to a mutual renunciation of claims resulting from the war, a sensible path, since the regimes that had incurred those debt and obligations no longer existed on either side. The victorious allies would have done well to treat Germany in a similar fashion. In addition, a limited military cooperation began, with the Germans sending personnel to a Soviet tank school at Kazan and a flying school at Lipetsk. 
48
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   Even this limited form of cooperation ended abruptly when Adolf Hitler came to power in January 1933. Hitler had risen to power on the basis of his anti-communism, and one of his first acts upon becoming German Chancellor was to toss every official of the German Communist Party into concentration camps. As the man who claimed to have saved Germany from Bolshevism, he would have had a hard time sending German military personnel to the Soviet Union. At any rate, his decision to rearm (begun immediately but not announced formally until March 1935) soon rendered the military link unnecessary.
As in 1870-71, this momentous change that was taking place in Germany did not evince much of a reaction from Russia. Once again, it was a time of introversion in Russia-another looking inward. Vladimir Lenin's death in 1924 had thrown the Communist Party of the Soviet Union into chaos, and a succession struggle dominated the next four years. By 1928, Josef Stalin had emerged victorious, liquidating or expelling his rivals for power. That same year, he introduced the First Five-Year Plan, a grandiose vision for transforming the Soviet economy through an instant industrial revolution from above. It featured the seizure of all private property in the countryside, the forced collectivization of agriculture, and the mass murder or starvation of millions of those unfortunate enough to be labeled "kulaks," or wealthy peasants. The horrors of this current round of domestic introversion would culminate in the late 1930s with the purges, Stalin's bloody war against his domestic political enemies. 
49
In terms of relations with Germany, Stalin stood for "socialism in one country." He focused almost exclusively on domestic and social policy and suspended attempts to subvert capitalist regimes abroad. Nevertheless, from Moscow's point of view, a very familiar pattern soon began to appear. In the 1920s, a beaten-down and depressed Germany had posed little threat to anyone. But now Germany had rearmed, had revived economically, and was undertaking all sorts of provocative acts. It left the League of Nations, declared rearmament, remilitarized the Rhineland, forced the Anschluss with Austria, and provoked the Sudeten crisis in 1938. Each time, the Western Powers objected, sometimes on their own and sometimes as a group through the League of Nations, and each time they failed to follow up their words with actions. The phrase "collective security" was on everyone's lips but if the term implied going to war on behalf of someone else's interests rather than self-interest, no one seemed eager to take the first leap. Thus, Germany's recovery of the hegemonic position it had lost in 1918 once again seemed inevitable, and it appeared that the West was willing to acquiesce in it, just as it had acquiesced to the Germans during the Congress of Berlin and the Bosnian Crisis.
As always, the key to understanding the German-Soviet relationship was Poland. In January 1934, Nazi Germany and Poland signed a non-aggression pact. It was an improvement in relations compared to the Weimar Republic, which had steadfastly
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 refused, even under its most accommodating Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann, to sign any sort of "Eastern Locarno" recognizing Germany's borders with Poland. 
50
Germany and the Soviet Union eyed each other warily, in this, the one region that both considered to be a vital state interest. Whoever controlled Poland was ideally positioned to launch a war on the other, the reason they had partitioned it in the first place and the reason they rejected its current existence. As German power waxed in the late 1930s, and war came to seem more and more inevitable, each side became progressively more terrified of the other establishing a predominant position in Eastern Europe and Poland. The Munich Conference, which handed the Sudetenland to Hitler after a summer of war fever, without even inviting the Soviet Union, did nothing to allay Soviet anxieties. Stalin feared that the West was trying to divert German aggression to the east, luring the Reich into a war with the Soviet Union. Usually attributed to Stalin's "paranoia," his reaction can also be seen as a conditioned response from the Kremlin leadership since the formation of Germany in 1871, whether that regime was a Tsarist autocracy or a Communist dictatorship.
The stage was set, therefore, for the dramatic events of the summer in 1939. Munich had destroyed Czechoslovakia and saved the peace, but not for long. Hitler's seizure of Prague in March 1939 seemed to portend a strike against Poland. The subsequent Anglo-French Guarantee to Poland (as well as Romania) in April 1939 was to Hitler an intolerable example of meddling in Germany's backyard. It was, by British standards, "a continental commitment with a vengeance," 
51
With the western powers having thoroughly alienated both Germany and the Soviet Union, there could be only one logical solution: a rapprochement between the two giants. Hitler intended to invade Poland all along, and he wanted to avoid the two-front war that had sunk Germany in World War I. Stalin wanted to stay out of a European war, not least
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 because of Japan's threatening attitude in the Far East, and he certainly had no desire to fight Germany one-on-one in Poland while the western powers held back, as he suspected they would (and as they actually did).
The first feelers came from Moscow. They included hasty public denials that the Soviet Union would aid Poland in the event of war, a declaration by the Soviet chargé in Berlin that no real quarrels existed between the Soviet Union and Germany, and, in May, the dismissal of Maxim Litvinov as foreign minister and his replacement by V. I. Molotov. 
52
53
Finally, as the summer wore on and the September 1st date for the invasion of Poland approached, Hitler became personally involved in the diplomatic process. After he sent a direct message to Stalin, the Soviet Union agreed to receive German foreign minister Joachim von Ribbentrop in Moscow on August 23rd. Here, Ribbentrop and Molotov signed a ten-year non-aggression agreement, but that was only the public face. The Nazi-Soviet Pact also contained a "Secret Additional Protocol" dividing Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence "in the event of a territorial and political transformation of the territories belonging to the Polish state." 
54
The Nazi-Soviet Pact exploded on the world like a bombshell. Ideological enemies who had been "pouring filth over each other" for years were suddenly embracing like old friends. 
55
56
Ideology aside, the Pact offered obvious benefits to both sides. In the words of one analyst, not for a long time "had the possibility of territorial expansion been so real and apparently without risk for the Soviet Union, and not since 1870 had Germany been so hopeful of securing a war on one front." 
57
58
Stalin's willingness was more problematic, and appears on the surface to be a massive blunder. The pact made perfect sense for the Soviet Union, however. The West was offering Stalin a chance to fight Germany by himself, at least in the opening phase of the war, and promised him nothing in return. Hitler wanted to him to do nothing, and promised him everything. The amount of blame heaped on the Western Allies for not pursuing the negotiations with Stalin more aggressively is equally misplaced. Having backed Poland, they had nothing to offer Stalin, no matter how aggressively they might have pursued it. Despite the rage directed at Stalin at the time-and by historians ever since-for signing a treaty with Hitler, he was not blind to strategic realities. He warned Hitler's foreign minister, Ribbentrop, that Germany should not expect an easy victory in the upcoming war, since Britain would fight "stubbornly and cunningly,"

The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   The key to understanding the Pact, however, is that it restored the original historic basis for a Russian-German modus vivendi. It was the same as it had been in the great era of Prussian-Russian friendship from 1770 to 1870: the destruction of Poland. This time there were no distractions, no diversions or detours into the Balkans or anywhere else. The conflict unleashed by Adolf Hitler in 1939 soon became known as "World War II." In its opening phase, however, with the German Panzers driving into Poland on September 1, 1939, and the Soviets responding from the east two weeks later, it was nothing more or less than the Fourth Partition of Poland.
Although German and Russian interests often ran in parallel and symmetrical paths over the decades, we cannot say the same about their warfighting. Once the shooting began between them, powerful asymmetries were more likely to come to the fore. Germany truly was a coiled spring. Its initial blows were always its strongest ones. German planners had long recognized that they could not fight and win sustained wars of attrition-neither the state's geographical position nor limited resource base would permit it. Rather, it had to fight a high-tempo war of maneuver, seeking out and destroying as much of the enemy force as possible in the opening weeks of the fighting. The Germans called it Bewegungskrieg, the "war of movement," and its goal was to keep Germany's wars kurtz und vives (short and lively), in the memorable phrase of its most successful practitioner, Frederick the Great. 
61
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 this posture was not so much a choice that they had made at any discrete point but rather a result of systemic factors of time, space, and transport. The land was immense, the communications network-roads and railroads-primitive by the standards of Western Europe. By definition, then, the Russians had to absorb the initial blow from German armies, no matter how grievously it might land. They could trade space for time, as they had against Napoleon, i.e., they could retreat, abandon tens of thousands of square miles, and scorch the earth as they went, denying it to their advancing adversaries. It would always be a painful process but Russia knew it had to survive a great deal of pain early in order to have any chance of winning in the end.
Both world wars saw the asymmetries play out more or less precisely. In World War I, the Germans quickly encircled and destroyed an entire Russian field army at the Battle of Tannenberg (the "Second Battle of Tannenberg," to German nationalists) in August 1914.

His complete lack of strategic basis for the move had one beneficial impact: it surprised the Soviets, especially Stalin, who simply could not understand why Hitler would do such a thing. Stalin had reports of military preparations along the border, even German reconnaissance over-flights of Soviet territory but they seemed to make no sense. "I think Hitler is trying to provoke us," he muttered to one of his generals on the evening of June 21st, 1941. "He surely hasn't decided to make war?"

73
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   But it was not. The Red Army had survived the worst military onslaught in the history of war but it was still in the field. Its manpower reserves were just beginning to be mobilized, its industries were getting into high gear, and its weaponry was far better than German intelligence had reported. In all these early battles-even when its leaders were inept and its levies poorly trained-it had taken a toll on its German adversary. The Wehrmacht was designed for fighting short campaigns in central and western Europe, lands with a relatively temperate climate and an excellent road network. The wear and tear of a logistics-intensive campaign deep inside Soviet Russia and Ukraine had wounded it deeply, and it was a shadow force that reached Moscow by December.

75
For the next forty months, the two adversaries engaged in some of the hardest and bloodiest fighting in the history of warfare. Two bitter rivals, each dedicated to stamping out the other, two monstrous regimes, the wholesale killing of civilians on all sides: the Russo-German War set new standards in all these areas, turning Eastern Europe into a slaughter-pen, "the Bloodlands," and we should all hope we never see anything like it again. 
76
Even today, analyzing that rivalry is not easy. It did not arise out of economics. For much of their history, the two had a mutually beneficial economic relationship, with the Germans producing manufactured goods and the Soviets providing raw materials out of their bountiful surplus. Nor was ideology at its root. National Socialism and Marxist Communism may have been bitter ideological rivals, as far apart on the spectrum as possible, but the two states found enough in common to ignore their ideologies and sign a treaty of cooperation in 1922 (Rapallo), a trade treaty in mid-August 1939, and the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact later that month. They even became "friends," according to the official record, in late September 1939. Mutual stereotyping of national character may have played a role. Russian Pan-Slavs saw themselves as the bearers of an organic, spiritual culture, and the Germans as materialistic and soulless. Pan-Germans did the same in reverse; they were the bearers of Kultur in the highest sense and the Russians were uncouth brutes from the steppe. Such absurd propaganda did inform public opinion to a certain extent but was never determinative to policy makers. 
77
The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945   With economics, ideology, and national character excluded, what factor was left? In 2012, Robert Kaplan published The Revenge of Geography. 
78
The post-1945 world said goodbye to all that, of course. Germany was no longer a rival to anyone but a truncated and divided pawn between the U.S. and Soviet Union in the Cold War. Even today, while a reunified Germany is an economic and financial giant, it has apparently been weaned off military adventurism and expansionist policies altogether-to the world's relief.

The Russo-German Strategic Rivalry: 1871-1945 Some of Russia's potential victims, however, already have a "security guarantee" from the West: NATO. The tragedy of such Russian policies is that there is no better way to encourage Germany to take a more active military role, a development that could have ominous possibilities.
In 1989, looking back from a distance of fifty years, the dean of U.S. diplomatic historians, Gerhard Weinberg, described the Nazi-Soviet Pact as a result of "terrible miscalculations made by both parties." He went on to comment:
Perhaps a new perception of the past will enable the Soviet Union to see the secret protocol as part of a mistaken and adventurous policy by Stalin-a policy that cost Russia the most horrendous losses.... As Europe moves into a new phase, perhaps the Soviets as well as the Germans may come to see that allowing the peoples living in between them to enjoy a real independence can contribute to the security of all countries. 
81
And let us hope it never does. A secure and free Poland keeps Germany and Russia separated, and therefore serves as Europe's best proof against a potential catastrophe: a rebirth of the strategic rivalry between the two giants. As we peer into an uncertain future, the issue of Polish liberty comes once more to the fore, as it has many times in the past. At the state to state level, Japanese policymakers felt constrained by international rules invented by westerners after they had completed their dirty-handed conquests.
Third, intertwined with vulnerability and inequality was an ambitious quest to build a self-sufficient and militarily invulnerable empire. Initially confined to interests in Korea and the Liaiotung Peninsula in southernmost Manchuria, this imperial vision grew by leaps and bounds until, by 1941, it encompassed most of Asia.

Fourth, the Japanese military played a disproportionate role in national policy until 1945. Early in the Meiji Era, when the idea of a prime minister and a national legislature formed by political parties first appeared, the military insisted that politicians could not be trusted to place national interest above politics and therefore should not control the armed forces. Thus both the Army and the Navy General Staffs were placed under the Emperor's authority instead of the civilian cabinet. The Army and Navy ministries henceforth focused on administration, budgets, and personnel. As members of the cabinet, the Army and Navy ministers reported to the Emperor through the prime minister. The ministers did not command the powerful chiefs of staff, who controlled the actual forces. This did not mean that the ministers were not often supportive of the General Staffs. It soon became the practice that the army and navy ministers must be appointed from among active duty officers, making the ministries as well devoted to service interests. This system, called the "independence of the Supreme Command" endured until Japan's surrender in August 1945. Foreign policy could not be made without integrating the views of the services. Should the Army or Navy ministries disagree with the cabinet, they would resign and the government would collapse. Until the services nominated an active duty officer as minister no government could be formed. Politicians tended, therefore, to defer to military recommendations on foreign as well as domestic policy.

Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941
As spoils from the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, Japan wanted the island of Formosa, control of the Shandong Peninsula on the mainland, the end of Chinese meddling in Korea, and key ports on the Liaotung Peninsula in South Manchuria. China agreed to these terms plus a $135-million indemnity. But the war spoils infringed on Russian and German desires for concessions and bases. In April 1895, Russia, Germany, and France successfully pressured Japan to give the Liaotung Peninsula back to China. This was a body blow to the proud Japanese, despite a last-minute increase of the indemnity to $200 million. A huge outcry of dissatisfaction with the Triple Intervention toppled the Ito Hirobumi cabinet in 1896.

Japan too adopted the spheres of influence approach. And the spheres of influence related to territory so in some ways the commercial competition was actually territorial competition. Russia, one of the most aggressive countries, was on Japan's doorstep. The most likely area for Japan to create its own sphere of influence was precisely the region in which the Russians were deeply involved. In the early 1900s, as China disintegrated, Japan became more aggressive on the mainland. There was consensus that national security depended upon control of the Korean peninsula. Even if Japan pushed the Russians out of Korea, the peninsula would not be safe with Russian domination of Manchuria, so Manchuria became a prime focus. Between 1895 and 1904, Japan slowly won this political and economic struggle. Japan built several key rail lines within Korea. Many Japanese settlers went there. Japan provided 60 percent of Korean imports and took 80 percent of Korean exports. Even in these early days, Japan was unique among the competing powers in seeking an absolutely reliable supply of strategic resources. Reliability implied eliminating threats to the region from which strategic resources were found, threats to the transport routes to Japan, and an enhanced level of administration and financial controls to assure that the development of the resources met Japanese needs.

After acquiring the Philippines and Guam in 1898-99, the Americans became more engaged in Asia, though less aggressively than the Europeans. The Open Door Policy defined that engagement as peaceful commercial activity without further territorial 15-5   Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 acquisitions. The United States declined to establish an exclusive sphere of influence and insisted on trading throughout China. Why confine ourselves to one sphere, Americans reasoned, when with our broad and competitive economy we can out-compete the Japanese and the Europeans across all of China? Secretary of State John Hay's Open Door notes of 1899 and 1900 announced that all powers agreed to his plan to renounce spheres of influence and to respect Chinese territorial and administrative integrity. In reality, the skirmishing for national advantage continued.
The Open Door Policy remained the basis of American policy in Asia to 1941. The Open Door inherently ran against Japanese expansion which was increasingly characterized by the use of force, direct administrative control of acquired territory, and the exclusion of other powers. Given later Japanese complaints of American hypocrisy, the United States applied the Open Door only in Asia. In its own hemisphere, the United States welded Puerto Rico and Cuba into the American economic system via tax and tariff policies. It ruled out sharing the ownership or control of the Panama Canal. It intervened frequently in Central America and the Caribbean. The Greater Caribbean region became, in fact, an American lake. On the other hand, unlike Japan in Asia, the United States faced no constellation of powers competing for Caribbean influence. Practically and realistically, the distinct situation in Asia called for a different approach by Japan and perhaps by the United States.
South of the Great Wall, Japan had less success in gaining railway concessions and other advantages. In that region, Japan had to cooperate with the major European powers, especially Britain, while in Manchuria and Korea Japan had to cope with Russia. In this situation, Japan had to choose which countries to confront and which to embrace. It embraced Britain via a 1902 alliance, freeing itself to focus on Manchuria and Korea. The alliance recognized that Japan was "interested in a peculiar degree politically as well as commercially and industrially" in Korea. In short, Japan committed to the Open Door in China below the Great Wall in exchange for British recognition of special interests in Korea and Manchuria.

Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 Yet there were still worries. The Russian threat was beaten but hardly eliminated. Japan needed to solidify its hold on Korea and expand its interests in Manchuria. Japan poured advisors and troops into Korea. Soon there were 5,000 civilian advisors scattered throughout the Korean government making sure Japan's wishes were followed. Two Army divisions kept order. In 1910, Japan annexed Korea. The powers were not overly concerned because they had no great economic interests in that country. But Manchuria was part of China. Japanese actions there might affect the treaty port system throughout all of China. Yet Manchuria was precisely where Japan now set its sights.
The army and navy sought force levels that would allow expanded operations on the mainland, but the Diet, conscious that the war savaged national finances, refused big military increases. The inter-service competition for resources accelerated, troubling cabinet stability and becoming a fixture in Japanese politics.
General Yamagata Aritomo, one of the genro (elders who were informal but trusted advisors to the emperor) sent Emperor Meiji a plea calling for an army strong enough to undertake on the mainland whatever policy the government decided. This was a striking example of the cart before the horse, an early manifestation of what became a characteristic of army (and, later, navy) planning: pushing for larger resources without reference to a policy goal. Logically, the government should decide the policy goal and the military should ask for the resources to attain it. Instead, military strength itself became the goal. In essence, the policy objective became unhindered unilateralism. It encouraged overly ambitious military requests, because if the policy goal was expansive but undefined, who could say how much was enough?
In this aggressive atmosphere, Japan's first national defense plan appeared. The Imperial National Defense Policy of 1907 planned a military capable of unilaterally achieving any and all ambitious policies. This meant an army of 25 divisions in peacetime with a surge capacity of 25 additional divisions in wartime. A bigger fleet would be built on the so-called "8-8" plan: two fleets built around 8 battleships, 8 heavy cruisers, and 268 light cruisers, destroyers, and submarines. That said, the naval increase merely kept Japan at rough parity with the growing American navy and preserved the battleship ratio with Britain. 
13
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941
No specific American military or even diplomatic actions in East Asia forced Japan to identify the United States as a prime threat. No large ground or naval forces were based in China nor in Asia for that matter. The Philippines had not been turned into a naval bastion. There was no large dry-dock nor other necessities to support a fleet. Nor on the diplomatic front had the United States done much more than voice the Open Door mantra of "equal access to China" while American business interests tried to make money. What was the real as opposed to the imagined threat? If the policy goal is the ability to intervene anywhere, then the threat picture worsens rapidly. In this period, there was no increase in American military capacity to damage Japan itself or Japanese interests or freedom of action in Korea, Manchuria, or North China. Nor was there intent to do so. Japan simply imagined a large American military threat where none existed.
Imperial Army leaders considered diplomatic and administrative issues related to Korea and Manchuria as embedded within military policy and therefore solely within the army's purview.

A young rightist fanatic stabbed Abe to death, then disemboweled himself over a map of China, presumably suggesting the area of Abe's weakness.

Japan kept the Group Five demands secret, but when China leaked them to the United States, American distrust skyrocketed. Pressure from the United States and Britain and a resolute China forced Japan to drop the Group Five demands. China accepted the remainder. The United States threw a sop to Japan by recognizing that "territorial contiguity creates special relations" between Japan and the Chinese regions of Shandong, South Manchuria, and North China (eastern Inner Mongolia). 
19
The 1917 Lansing-Ishii Agreement attempted to smooth the waters. The so-called agreement between Viscount Ishii Kikujiro and Secretary of State Robert Lansing settled nothing. The two sides simply re-stated their positions without true compromise or meeting of the minds. Once again, the United States accepted Japan's special interests in China, but did not spell out either the geographic range of "China" or exactly what "special interests" meant. The two countries did, however, reaffirm their devotion to the Open Door and the territorial and administrative integrity of China, but did not specify how they had now harmonized their previously discordant views. Japan merely repeated its devotion to principles it recently violated.
The fourth opportunity of World War One was Japan's intervention in Siberia. The Siberian Intervention was an American brainchild to assist the Czech Legion, which had been fighting the Germans on the Eastern Front, fight its way through the Bolsheviks along the Trans-Siberian Railway to Vladivostok and then travel by ship to Europe. Several nations sent small contingents. Wilson dispatched 7,900 Americans and asked Japan for 7,000 soldiers. The Japanese agreed to intervene militarily, but for reasons of their own: to build a buffer against the traditional Russia enemy, and to lay the base for control of Siberian
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 resources should the Russian state disintegrate. The Imperial Army sent more than 70,000 troops as far as Lake Baikal. It was an extremely costly venture in money and lives (5,000 casualties); and Japan did not withdraw until 1922, after the Washington Conference.
In the idealistic atmosphere of the Fourteen Points and the creation of the League of Nations, many people thought cooperation was better than the arms races, competition, and secret treaties that led to the human and economic catastrophe of 1914-18. In the new atmosphere of peace it seemed senseless to boost peacetime military spending above wartime levels. For various reasons, Japan, Britain, and the United States desired a respite from build-ups and confrontation. Though the United States did not join the League of Nations, it rejected total isolationism and put forward a new framework for international relations that emphasized arms limitation, cooperation governed by legalistic principles, and consultation. Historians now call this new framework the Washington System because Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes hosted a conference in the capital that produced three important treaties. The Five Power Treaty set capital ship ratios at 10 for Britain, 10 for the United States, 6 for Japan, and 1.75 for France and Italy. The Four Power Treaty pledged Britain, Japan, the United States, and France to consult, rather than act unilaterally, in any crisis. The Nine Power Treaty bound the major powers to respect the Open Door principles of equal access to China and no seizure of Chinese territory. During the 1920s, additional treaties and conferences tackled arms limitation and forged no-war pledges. The Washington System aimed to stabilize international politics by adherence to overarching principles such as maintaining the Open Door, renouncing war, ending arms races, and abandoning imperialism.
Prime Minister Hara Takashi supported this new approach. Hara was the first prime minister to come from a political party and the first commoner to hold the office. He was despised by the ultra-nationalists and disliked by the conservatives, who thought he was too reliant on diplomacy rather than force in dealing with the often-rebellious colony of Korea. Facing severe budget shortfalls, Hara wished to avoid a costly naval race with Britain and the United States, the latter of which was already contemplating a major fleet expansion. Hara appointed Admiral Kato Tomosaburo, who had been both Commander of the Combined Fleet as well as Navy Minister, as a key negotiator at Washington along with Japan's ambassador Shidehara Kijuro. The two men accepted the premise that Japan was better off constraining the growth of British and American navies than by trying to out build them. Not all Japanese agreed. In November 1921, during the naval negotiations, an ultra-nationalist assassinated Hara as he walked through Tokyo Station. He was replaced by Finance Minister Takahashi Korekiyo, who was well also aware of Japan's inability to out-build the United States, and who approved Admiral Kato's agreement to the final 10-10-6 capital ship ratio among the great naval powers.
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941
The Washington Conference made most admirals angry. Japanese officers complained about unequal ratios. British officers grumbled that their navy, traditionally the largest and most powerful, now merely equaled the American fleet. Some American officers argued that, by freezing the fleet, the agreement made it impossible to defend the Philippines or to defeat Japan quickly in its home waters. This point of view ignored two points: first, that such freedom of action would be unobtainable if Japan matched the American build-up; and, second, the Philippines were not a crucial American interest, and therefore huge peacetime expenditures to defend were not justified Japan tried to comply with the spirit of the Washington treaties. In 1922, it abrogated its alliance with Britain, returned Shandong peninsula to China, and withdrew troops from Siberia. The question would be whether Japan could consistently attain its goals within the this System, as it might fail to protect existing interests, or Japan might develop goals that could not be attained within the established rules based regime. Both happened.
In fact, Japanese opposition to the Washington System began at the Washington Conference itself. Admiral Kato was the leader of the "treaty faction," a group of naval officers who realized that Japan's relative naval power was best maintained by treaties that limited the growth of the other powers rather than by trying to out-build them. Kato's subordinate, Admiral Kato Kanji (the two were not related) was the Navy's chief technical representative on the delegation. He demanded that as a great power, Japan should have parity with the United States and Britain. Overruled, he insisted on a 10-10-7 ratio. As Japan's navy did not patrol globally like the Anglo-American fleets, a 10-10-7 ratio would make the Imperial Navy dominate in East Asia against either power. Kato Kanji lost that battle as well. His biographer describes him simply as an expert doing his job. 
20
The Washington System worked for about ten years. It then began failing in Asia, as Japan could not obtain its desired level of benefits (growing trade and resource access on the continent) via peaceful cooperation. Three developments doomed Japan's attempt at cooperation. 28 Northern Expedition under Chiang Kai-shek extended KMT control northward toward Beijing. The KMT even attacked foreign concessions on the coast. Japan began viewing the KMT as a threat to Japan's interests in Manchuria and north China. In 1927, the retired general Tanaka Giichi became both prime minister and foreign minister, and ordered the selective use of force to slow the KMT's advance. At the same time, the Kwantung Army leadership sensed that the Manchurian warlord Chang Tso-lin was abandoning his cozy relationship with Japan, so without consulting Tokyo, mid-level officers killed Chang by blowing up his railway car as he passed through southern Manchuria. Prime Minister Tanaka's inability to hold the Army accountable for this rash action toppled his government. His successor Hamaguchi Osachi, attempted to stay loosely within the Washington System. The Hamaguchi cabinet was non-interventionist, attempting to restore good relations with Chiang Kai-shek's government in Nanjing. Japanese militarists charged Hamaguchi with weakening the country, especially after the conclusion of the London Naval Conference in 1930, which precipitated a major political crisis.
Second, the Great Depression hugely complicated Japan's resource quest. The "standard" interpretation is that the Great Depression caused hardship across Japan but especially in rural areas, where the military recruited heavily and with which military leaders identified (as opposed to an excessively western "big business" that identified with modern urban areas. In December 1931, Inukai Tsuyoshi became prime minister with Takahashi Korekiyo as finance minister. Under Takahashi, finance minister until 1936, the government intervened more often in the economy. He banned currency exchanges, stopping the outflow of gold. He boosted exports by allowing producers to fix prices and share export markets as they wished. He subsidized mining companies to bring in more gold. His strong guiding hand helped Japan weather the depression better than most countries. Whereas GNP dropped in the United States, it grew in Japan, at least until the mid-1930s. That said, traditional sectors like agriculture and silk and textiles fell on hard times, while the modern conglomerates such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi profited, especially as military procurement grew dramatically. Military spending composed 43 percent of the government expenditures by the mid-1930s, far higher than that of the western powers.

23
Even as Chinese nationalism, global depression, and wrongheaded expansionist thinking ruined cooperation, Japan made a final, vain attempt to stay within the Washington System. At the London Naval Conference of 1930, Japan pursued compromise and win-win solutions. But what once would have been considered foreign policy successes were now viewed, back at home, as sell-outs and surrender. After the unpopular London treaty, the ultra-nationalists would have their day.
The discord over the London treaty carried over from the Washington naval negotiations in 1921-22. It was really a single, long, contentious period. By 1930, Admiral Kato Kanji's "fleet faction" had equaled the influence of the "treaty faction." Kato himself was chief of the Naval General Staff. The London treaty extended limitation from capital ships to other warship classes. Japan received its much-desired 10-7 ratio in destroyers and submarines, but there was a huge fight over the cruiser ratio. Japan wanted 10-7 in cruisers as well. Partly this resulted from different needs. Britain preferred to have a lot of light cruisers to patrol its global empire, but the United States and Japan wanted 10,000 ton heavy cruisers that were more useful in major fleet actions. In the end, because the United States pledged to defer building to its treaty limits before 1936, Japan got better than a 10-7 ratio in heavy cruisers in fact if not in the treaty itself. Overall Japan improved its relative position in naval strength. But Kato Kanji and the hardliners successfully portrayed the London treaty as adverse to Japan. Within the Imperial Navy, the moderates were increasingly shunted aside. By 1934 Japan decided against participating in future naval conferences and after 1936 no longer adhered to Washington System limits.
The final success at London was perversely the kiss of death to moderate civilian government. Prime Minister Hamaguchi Osachi was tough, stubborn, and not inclined to toady to ultra-nationalists, who were offended by Hamaguchi's non-traditional attempt to give women the vote. That bill failed to pass the Diet. In the midst of the depression, with government revenues slumping, Hamaguchi cut government expenditures, which upset militarists who thought military budgets should be sacrosanct. But the final straw was the
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 London Naval Treaty. Right-wing politicians and conservatives raged that Hamaguchi sold out Japanese national security. The result, as so often in the 1930s, was assassination. In November 1930, walking through Tokyo Station not far from where Prime Minister Hara had been murdered in 1921, Hamaguchi was shot by Tomeo Sagoya, a member of an ultranationalist secret society. Hospitalized for several months, Hamaguchi died in early 1931.
If Kato Kanji was an example of a senior officer crossing the line into national policy formulation, Lieutenant Colonel Ishiwara Kanji is a good example of a second growing phenomenon-the inordinate influence of mid-level officers. Ishiwara came to Manchuria in 1928, after preaching a fervent expansionist message to eager young officers at the Army Staff College. Ishiwara was a "total war" believer and advocate of an invulnerable, autonomous empire. 
24
After the Hamaguchi shooting in late 1930, there was a rash of ultra-nationalist murders of moderates. Some junior officers joined plots to cleanse the government of perverse western thoughts by killing political and business leaders. The Cherry Blossom Society, a secret group of ultra-nationalists within the Imperial Army, had similar aims. A third group under Inoue Nissho aimed to kill twenty people but succeeded, in February and March of 1932, in murdering only Finance Minister Inoue Junnosuke and Takuma Dan, the director of the giant Mitsui zaibatsu. In May 1932 eleven young naval officers stormed into the prime minister's residence and murdered Prime Minister Inukai for insufficient support for military expansionism in Manchuria. They attacked the homes of Count Makino, Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal, and Prince Saionji, the last genro, but both men slipped away before the attacks.
The assassinations, if not the intimidation, peaked in the February 26, 1936, coup attempt by the ultra-nationalist Imperial Way faction of the military. Coup leaders, mostly majors, backed by 1,500 troops, fanned out to kill six men, including former prime 15-14   Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 minister Okada Keisuke and Admiral Suzuki Kantaro (who was the emperor's grand chamberlain). They missed Okada and Suzuki but murdered the able finance minister Takahashi Korekiyo, the current Keeper of the Privy Seal Saito Makoto, and Watanabe Jotaro, who oversaw military education. This time, the Army suppressed the rebels, considering their extreme demands illegitimate.
After 1936, the government and the military largely stopped outright murder, as senior military officers supported militarism but not social revolution and overthrow of the government that they sat atop. But the radicalism of junior and mid-level officers and excessive deference to them continued. To manage the simmering lower and middle ranks, the aptly-named Control Faction, of which General Tojo Hideki was a leader, dominated the Army. There was little daylight between the basic goals of the ultra-nationalists, the Control Faction, and its civilian fellow travelers, and so-called moderates. All groups believed Japan should be Great Japan. And murder was still a possibility. In August 1941, the ultra-nationalists sensed that Hiranuma Kiichiro, a cabinet minister, was quietly working with US Ambassador Joseph Grew to prevent war. A man slipped into his house and pumped six shots into him. Hiranuma somehow survived, but the threat of such violence was always on the minds of policymakers. In his biography of Yamamoto Isoroku, Agawa Hiroyuki describes how the militarists intimidated the Navy Minister and vice minister, barging into their offices with rants and extreme demands. To preclude an attempt on the moderate Yamamoto's life, he was transferred afloat as Commander of the Combined Fleet. Even prime ministers were not immune. Eri Hotta notes that fear of assassination led Konoe to meet secretly with Ambassador Grew in fall 1941.

Late in the decade, the isolationist mood began to lighten. While Japan was fighting the Chinese, the United States grew increasingly alarmed at the 1938-41 Nazi rampage. In American eyes, Japan linked itself to the hated Nazis by signing the Anti-Comintern Pact, joining the Axis Pact, and emulating Nazi expansion by enlarging the China War and moving into northern and southern Indochina. Around 1938, the United States began to think that there was no hope that Japan would return to normal behavior on its own and began applying economic embargoes. FDR successfully lobbied for inclusion, in the 1939 Neutrality Act, of provisions for arms and war materiel sales to belligerents-meaning Britain and France-on a cash and carry basis. By 1940-41, the United States was quite pessimistic about a change in Japanese behavior and ramped up economic pressure. In January 1941, FDR wrote Ambassador Grew, "we must recognize that the hostilities in Europe, and Africa, and in Asia are all parts of a single world conflict… We are engaged in the task of defending our way of life and our vital interests wherever they are seriously endangered."

The Pacific War began from two clashing visions, and the unwillingness or inability of either country to change positions. China was a major, core issue for Japan, which identified very significant interests there. In the peculiar thinking of many nationalists and militarists, loss of Japanese interests in China was an existential threat to the Greater Japan imagined by those groups. On the other hand, the United States was essentially a status quo power in the Pacific. Rather than a competition-with both nations striving for the same goal-it was a worsening political-ideological clash of ideas about Japan's ambitious vision of its future, how rapidly it would reach that ambitious objective, and whether the 15-16   Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 United States could accommodate itself to both the process of getting there and the ultimate Japanese goal of an autonomous empire. At its most basic, the rivalry was an aspiring hegemon versus a status quo power. 
28
When did war become a probability? The main driving force for eventual war was the failure to settle the China war, either by outright Japanese victory or by compromises and accommodations by either Japan, the United States, or both. But the timing of that failure was equally important. As Japan enlarged a China war it could not win, Americans increasingly connected Nazi aggression with that of Japanese militarists. American sensitivity to Japanese actions heightened after 1938, and American policy stiffened. The United States began to think that there was no hope that Japan would return to normal behavior on its own and began applying economic embargoes. Rather than make Japan malleable, the embargoes and freezes made the militarists even more determined to cut off and isolate the Chinese and replace imports from the United States with oil and other strategic materials from Southeast Asia. Barring compromise, war became unavoidable, particularly after Japan's occupation of northern Indochina in 1940, quickly followed by the Axis Pact in Sept 1940. After the move into southern Indochina in July 1941 and the subsequent oil embargo, the only compromises that would prevent war were politically impossible in either country.
15-17 1. The two countries sought dissimilar economic goals. Though both sought economic penetration of Northeast Asia, Japan's goal was state driven and security related, to control nearby territory as a security buffer and as a resource base to build a modern military and an industrial state. America's goal was a state-encouraged search for new markets to profit investors, entrepreneurs, and shareholders. Resource acquisition was not a significant goal.
2. Japan sought its goals with much higher intensity level. Those goals were essential to the building the secure, self-sufficient, hegemonic Japan that many badly wanted. Japan's vision was so strong that it could not give it up in 1941,as they were certain that an architecture of unfair rules made by others constrained their future. Though the United States pursued its goals with less intensity, it clung to the Open Door, China-centric policy, backed by embargoes that directly challenged Japanese aspirations. That weak American push-back was unsuccessful. Over forty plus years, Japan's span of interests grew immensely. The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95 was fought over competing aspirations in Korea. In 1941, Japan occupied much of East Asia and Indochina and pondered the conquest of Southeast Asia. In short, America followed a "failed containment" policy.
They understood each other's resource base, trade flows, productive capability, and existing and planned force structure. Virtually all American and most Japanese policymakers knew intellectually that Japan would lose a total war.
Because national goals and policy positions were defined by ideology, by ideas and beliefs and values. Japan chose to define its future as a powerful, autonomous empire, an Asian hegemon. The United States chose to overvalue its national interests in Asia and hold tightly to Open Door principles. Rather than accept the certain loss of compromising, Japan gambled on war with little chance of victory. By standing pat on its Open Door principles, the United States too avoided the certain loss of compromise, confident that its obvious material superiority would bring Japanese compliance and American "victory" without a war.
5. Japan had a particularly complex set of constitutional and legal procedures that complicated the process of getting to the right answer. Moreover, the military, increasingly dominated by persons with extreme views, especially beneath the very top, wielded disproportionate weight. The independence of the general staffs, and the requirement that the army and navy ministers be active duty officers gave the military great influence on the formation of cabinets and shaped the understandings and agreements on future policy that were part of cabinet formation. The military supplanted civilians in several key posts. It was not uncommon for military men to serve as prime minister, as Tojo did from 1941-44.
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 6. As a group, Japanese leaders increasingly tended toward stronger positions, rather than caution and moderation. This was partly because those positions came from ultra-nationalists, whose mindset prized boldness, a pure spirit that foreswore compromise, and a belief that will and commitment could prevail over material reality. The inner circle performed no analysis that resolved policy contradictions and conflicts. Platitudes-such as "We must work hard to prepare"-glossed over serious planning flaws and wrongheaded assumptions. As Eri Hotta noted:
The leaders' shortsighted and wishful thinking went hand in hand with ready references to Japan's high moral ideals, the superiority of the Japanese spirit, Japan's grand mission to liberate the whole of Asia from Western colonialism, and their wish for a peaceful resolution of the diplomatic and economic stalemate. None of these were conflicting aims in their mind-so long as they remained abstract. They created the illusion of ideological consistency and uniformity in Japan's leadership. 
29
30
The mind-over-matter factor had worked before, according to unchallenged but mistaken cultural assumptions of Japanese policymakers. In 1941, "the tendency to divide 4 by 2 and come up with 3 proved Japan's undoing." So did a refusal to back down. Asked how he and his colleagues could have taken take such a gamble, Tojo replied that Japan "had been challenged and had to fight, no matter what the state of her preparedness…." 
31
32
On the other hand, Japan misjudged the threat picture. It saw threats everywhere. Foreign Minister Matsuoka asserted that joining the Axis would deter the United States from "encircling" Japan by leasing bases in New Zealand and Australia, despite the fact that those two countries were five thousand miles from Tokyo, as far from Tokyo as Seattle.

Was there no possible middle ground? The two most commonly mentioned "off-ramps" from the road to Pearl Harbor were (1) a fall 1941 summit between Prime Minister Konoe and President Roosevelt, and (2) the modus vivendi notion of late 1941. Before analyzing those possibilities for last-minute compromise, let us examine bilateral relations in 1940-41.
By 1940, even some strong supporters of Japan's hardline position began to question the government's policy, but they made no headway. Prince Fushimi, the Chief of the Naval General Staff from 1932 to April 1941 and the emperor's second cousin, had long endorsed Kato Kanji's "fleet faction." He backed the occupation of northern Indochina but questioned the signing of the Tripartite Pact, which he feared would cut off steel, oil, and other key imports from the United States and lead to a protracted war. He raised those points during the Imperial Conference of September 19, 1940.
Prince Konoe, just returned as prime minister, admitted that trade relations would worsen. But he claimed that with consumption controls "we should be able to supply the military and thus withstand a rather prolonged war" with the United States. 
35
The president of the Privy Council, Hara Yoshimichi, asked, "I wonder if our taking a firm stand might not have a result quite contrary to the one we expect." Matsuoka replied that the United States would react reasonably: "Japan is not Spain. We are a great power with a strong navy in Far Eastern waters. The United States may adopt a stern attitude for a while, but I think she will dispassionately take her interests into consideration and arrive at a reasonable attitude." Then Matsuoka, who never seemed to grasp the internal contradictions in his analyses, stated: "As to whether she will stiffen her attitude and bring about a critical situation [war], or will levelheadedly reconsider, I would say the odds are fifty-fifty." The Imperial Conference then approved this rash plan of joining the Axis, accepting a 50 percent chance of a crisis with the United States, hardly a prudent course given Japan's vulnerability. 
36
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 On July 1, 1941, the Liaison Conference considered the move into southern Indochina. The Germans had just launched an attack on Russia, and the Conference briefly discussed whether to take advantage of that fact by invading Siberia. Minister of Commerce and Industry Kobayashi Ichizo warned that Japan did not have the resources to support a war. He was ignored. The following day, an Imperial Conference blessed the southward advance and rejected any moves against Russia.

Navy Chief of Staff Nagano stated that the there was a "very high" probability of a prolonged war with the United States. But, he stressed careful preparations, without ever considering whether Japan could actually win a long war. Instead Nagano focused on seizing "the enemy's important military areas and sources of materials quickly at the beginning of the war…obtaining vital materials from the areas now under hostile influence." If the initial attacks were successful, "our Empire will have secured strategic areas in the Southwest Pacific, established an impregnable position, and laid the basis for a prolonged war." Ultimate success in a prolonged war was "closely related to the success or failure of the first stage in our operations." Moreover, as the embargo on oil and other resources was already eroding Japan's war making ability, war had to come soon-barring significant Anglo-American concessions. 
44
45
The problem was that no realistic preparations or battle plan that could do the trick. Nagano and others grossly overestimated Japan's capability to extract resources from conquered areas. In 1941, the Navy Ministry and the government's Planning Board made separate but similar estimates of Japan's oil supplies for waging war. Both utterly overestimated how much and how fast oil would flow from Southeast Asia. These estimates assumed that by the third year of war, oil from the conquered south would almost 15-23   Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 satisfy wartime consumption needs, but left aside consideration of whether Japan could safely bring the oil home. Director of the Planning Board Suzuki Teiichi stated that "if important areas in the South were to fall into our hands without fail in a period of three or four months, we could obtain such items as oil, bauxite, nickel, crude rubber, and tin in about six months, and we would be able to make full use of them after two years or so."

Many historians have considered whether the proposed Konoe-FDR summit could have led to peace. Most believe that neither nation's domestic politics would allow a compromise, so a summit would have been fruitless, though, a sizable minority think it could have worked.

A summit was a gamble. It would probably have failed, but it was worth trying. Even if unsuccessful, as it very likely would have been, it would not have worsened the diplomatic crisis or accelerated the Pearl Harbor attack. FDR had showed initial interest in a summit, but after reflection and likely pressure from Hull, replied that there must be preliminary agreement on key issues before a meeting. No American, certainly not FDR, contemplated a meaningful concession without extracting an even greater concession, such as withdrawing from Indochina and possibly from China as well, from Japan. Konoe probably knew that he must make a big concession and that he would have to sketch that concession before FDR would even consider a summit. Yet preliminary agreementsbetter said-preliminary compromises-were exactly what Konoe could not extract from the hardliners. Only a summit without pre-conditions could lead to a settlement, at least in his mind. Was the United States justified in failing to arrange the summit? It is almost impossible to imagine, after examination of the well-dug-in policy positions, that Japan would have withdrawn, in the short term, from Indochina, much less from China itself. A summit without Japanese concessions would have been seen as appeasement. American policymakers judged that the chances for real compromise and agreement were nil so they did not pursue the summit proposal. They were probably right, but a summit was worth the gamble to save the blood and treasure later expended on the war.
The second off-ramp on the road to war was a modus vivendi that was never presented to the Japanese. On November 6, 1941, FDR suggested that a modus vivendi would postpone war and give the American military more time to prepare. As FDR sketched on November 20, the modus vivendi would restart the oil flow and provide some rice shipments if Japan froze further deployments. 
52
Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 * * * * * Aside from a summit or a modus vivendi, could the United States and Japan have reached a workable compromise? What if the United States had resumed oil, steel, and other shipments, and coerced the Dutch, British, and Vichy French to break open closed colonial systems to supply Japan with much greater amounts of resources. Japan wanted those resources to maintain military freedom of action and specifically to win the China war. If the Japanese had gotten the resources from the United States and Southeast Asia, they might not have attacked. A major sticking point remains: the China War. With its imagined close relationship to China, the United States predictably objected to Japan's use of American resources to wage a vicious war on its friend. But if the resource flow was guaranteed, Japan might have ended the China war south of the Great Wall and returned, more or less, to the pre-1937 situation that America had tolerated. Neither nation would have been particular happy with that solution, but it might have prevented total war. The Chinese in Inner China and Manchuria and the Koreans would still have been under Japan's thumb, but it can be argued that correcting that unfortunate situation was not a critical national interest of the United States.
The US-Japan rivalry is best characterized as strong status quo power versus an impatient aspiring hegemon. Within that overarching structure, several themes shaped the rivalry. Side-effects from the Great Depression and strengthening Chinese nationalism convinced Japan that its interests could not be served under the Washington System. An aggressive, increasingly nationalist Japanese military unduly influenced foreign and security policy. The civilian policy-making structure was weak, diffuse, and structurally incapable of resolving contradictions in policy ends or ways and means. The ever-stronger quest for an autonomous empire consumed the very resources it acquired. The military capability to intervene anywhere became a policy objective, and this mindset naturally found threats everywhere. By 1941, Japan somehow felt encircled though there was no existential threat. As Japan's goals on the mainland and Southeast Asia expanded steadily, the United States remained a status quo power, without vital interests in East Asia, and responding weakly until the late 1930s. Underlying Japanese policy was an unrealistic culturally derived belief that the indomitable Japanese spirit could triumph over any material disadvantage. A related belief, held in some quarters, was that the United States was not tough enough to fight a long war, especially if severely bloodied at the outset. As America linked Nazism to Japanese militarist expansion and toughened policy toward the Empire, neither the United States nor Japan was willing to accept the other's key goal: autonomy approaching hegemony for Japan, and peaceable status quo application of the Open Door for the United States. In the end, Japan rashly gambled on a war that many Japanese realized might be lost.
Strategic rivalries include momentum shifts, unexpected twists, and outright reversals of fortune, and the Cold War is no exception. Reeling from Vietnam, Watergate, the twin oil shocks, and stagflation, the United States appeared on the defensive in the 1970s. Meanwhile, Soviet imperialism reached new heights in the Third World, with Moscow backing proxy forces in Angola, Ethiopia, Nicaragua, among other places. By the time Soviet tanks rumbled into Afghanistan in 1979, détente was already a dirty word among U.S. leaders, and the "correlation of forces" seemed very much in Moscow's favor. But a snapshot-even one that stretches over a decade-does not give sufficient context to a strategic rivalry, let alone determine its outcome. Armed with hindsight, the Cold War's outcome today appears obvious, but this was far from self-evident while events were unfolding. Most observers-and most participants for that matter-expected the strategic stalemate to last much longer.
Then, in 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed-suddenly, completely, and, for the most part, peacefully. To understand this stunning reversal, it is necessary to reassess the larger context of this rivalry. My goal is to provide a thematic assessment, with an emphasis on the interplay of geopolitical and ideological factors, the development of strategy, and the role of military power, including its nuclear, conventional, and unconventional dimensions. First, however, I address what distinguished the Cold War from other strategic rivalries.
The atomic revolution provided the Cold War rivalry with the novel risk-global destruction. Throughout history, strategic rivalries have led to the elimination of empires, states, and even entire civilizations. Yet the risk of nuclear war threatened future generations in a way that previous strategic rivalries never could, possibly to the point of humanity's extinction.
Moreover, the technological marriage of long-range missiles and atomic warheads produced the revolutionary combination of unprecedented destruction at unprecedented speed. By the 1960s, both sides had intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching the other in a half hour. Beginning in the late 1970s, Moscow deployed mobile 16-1
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   SS-20 missiles in Eastern Europe capable of quickly destroying NATO targets. In the early 1980s, NATO responded by deploying Pershing II and ground-launched cruise missiles, giving it the capacity to strike Moscow in ten minutes. Not to be outdone, Moscow periodically positioned ballistic missile-laden submarines off the Atlantic coast capable of reaching Washington, DC, in similarly short order. These reduced warning times meant neither superpower could rule out nightmarish, nuclear bolt-from-the blue scenarios.
Even strategic antagonists can share common psychological scars, and the Cold War is no exception. Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union and the Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor left Moscow and Washington with a primal fear of surprise attack. Such shared experiences led the superpowers to keep their strategic forces on high alert levels (at least compared to the interwar era), and to place a premium on strategic warning. For the United States, this led to extensive reconnaissance flights over the Soviet Union, with the resulting embarrassing shoot down of Francis Gary Powers's U-2 spy plane (1960).
The Soviet Union and the United States also shared military superiority over other potential rivals. World War II left Britain and France exhausted; Italy, Japan, and Germany prostrate in defeat; and China entangled in a costly civil war from 1945 to 1949. The Soviet Union, though it suffered horrendous casualties, had found the resources to crush the Wehrmacht, Hitler's armed forces, and it maintained a much superior land force than its European and Asian neighbors long after World War II ended. The United States, on the other hand, suffered comparatively light casualties but demonstrated the capacity to churn out military hardware at a jaw-dropping rate (the United States produced nearly 100,000 aircraft in 1944 alone). 
1
The superpowers also shared a mutual interest in avoiding direct military conflict with each other, given the capacity for destruction and potential for escalation (proxy wars were another matter). The Soviets aggressively probed Western weaknesses but they were neither reckless nor suicidal. Some U.S. military leaders embraced bellicose rhetoric-for example, General Curtis LeMay was the inspiration for General "Jack D. Ripper" in Stanley Kubrik's movie Dr. Strangelove-but political leaders generally behaved cautiously when it came to nuclear matters. This common ground helped to keep the Kalter in the Kalter Krieg (the "cold" in the Cold War).
Beside these common interests, asymmetries permeated the strategic rivalry from the outset. Except for Pearl Harbor, the United States exited World War II with its homeland unscathed, now a maritime nation capable of generating large land and aerial forces,
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   possessing an atomic monopoly, championing democratic capitalism, and committed to leaving its recent isolationist past behind. The Soviet Union emerged from the same contest with its homeland ravaged, an immense land power with modest naval and aerial power, determined to prevent Germany from ever again dominating Mitteleuropa, and animated by Marxism-Leninism-Stalinism and deeply rooted tsarist imperial traditions.
These asymmetries flowed largely from geography. The Soviet Union and the United States ruled over huge land masses-the first and third largest countries in the world, respectively-that provided each with strategic depth. But the geographic similarities end here. The United States, a maritime power, exploited its lengthy coastlines and port facilities; the Soviet Union, a continental power, had far less access to ports. Located in the temperate zone, the United States also possessed the world's most fertile agricultural lands; the Soviet Union's land mass was located in much colder climes (mostly north of the U.S.-Canadian border), which made farming, already difficult with forced collectivization, even more so.
Geography provided the United States with some clear security advantages: its oceanic moats, combined with friendly states to the North and South, obviated the need to defend its territorial borders against invaders. As such, the United States homeland was secure from physical attack, at least until the Soviets developed long-range bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles. In contrast, the Soviet Union had to cope with longrange, U.S.-based delivery systems; medium-range systems based on its periphery; and more traditional security concerns along its vast European and Asiatic borders.
Ideological and geographical asymmetries combined to provide the Cold War with a blended reality, with the relative weight of each varying according to time, place, and circumstance. Ideological tensions antedated the Cold War, with President Woodrow Wilson and Bolshevik leader Vladimir Lenin articulating the principles of democratic capitalism and international communism, respectively. Between the two world wars, the ideological rivalry festered while both powers focused on domestic concerns.

Geopolitics trumped ideology during World War II. President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill found common cause with Joseph Stalin in defeating Nazism. As long as both sides were locked in a desperate struggle for survival, ideological tensions remained muted. The Soviets even disbanded the Third Communist International in 1943. So, for most of the war, the erstwhile allies focused on geostrategic concerns: the timing of a second front, the dangers of a separate peace, and the division of post-war Europe. Unfortunately, goodwill engendered by wartime cooperation soon dissipated, hastened by Roosevelt's death in April 1945. By the time of the Potsdam Conference (1945), if not earlier, ideological differences were reasserting themselves.
The early Cold War assumed a Eurocentric focus, given unresolved questions about Germany's future. As the conflict escalated, it became clear that the Soviets were not going to allow free elections in countries they occupied. This dispute over elections marked an early inflection point in reigniting the rivalry, and it foreshadowed other early Cold War crises, including the Czechoslovakian coup d'état (1948) and the Berlin blockade (1948-49).
Europe was not the only area the rivals found themselves contesting. They were also at loggerheads in the Middle East, with access to oil resources a key focus. In 1946, the United States pressured the Soviets to withdraw their military forces from northern Iran, pursuant to the Tripartite Treaty of Alliance (1942) signed by Great Britain and the Soviet Union. U.S. and Soviet maneuvering in Iran reflected an early case of Cold War containment. The Soviets wanted to maintain a military presence in Iran for geopolitical reasons-chief among them securing access to additional oil supplies and providing its border with a greater security buffer. To these ends, they established a puppet regime in the northern province of Azerbaijan. The United States had its own geopolitical interests in the region, including access to oil and protecting the "Northern Tier," the members of the Central Treaty Organization (1955 to 1979), against communist thrusts. These interests, when combined with a more idealistic desire to strengthen the credibility of the United Nations (UN), led Washington to pressure the Soviet Union by backing multiple UN Security Council (UNSC) efforts to resolve the issue. (Three of the first five UNSC Resolutions focused on the Iran crisis.) The United States scored a diplomatic victory when Stalin, sensing U.S. resolve stiffening, agreed to withdraw his forces.

Containment rested on the assumption that one's adversary was rational, not fanatical. Stalin's willingness to back down, at least in the case of Iran and Turkey, provided some reassurance to Truman that, with the proper mix of geopolitical incentives, he could influence Moscow's behavior.
Cold War dynamics, however, cannot be explained in geopolitical terms alone. As the Cold War progressed into the 1950s (and beyond), ideology pushed the superpower competition into remote and forbidding locales. Small islands such as Quemoy and Matsu off the southeastern coast of China assumed importance far in excess of what geography alone would dictate. Likewise, conflict spread to the steep hills in Korea, dense jungles of Vietnam, and jagged mountains in Afghanistan, among other places.
The incompatibility of democratic capitalism and Soviet communism represented the taproot of Cold War hostility. The competing worldviews sidelined prospects for any negotiated resolution. The superpowers, therefore, tailored their respective narratives to internal and external audiences, using all the public diplomacy and propaganda tools at their disposal, including leaflets, pamphlets, newspapers, and television and radio broadcasts.
Stalin and his successors up to Mikhail Gorbachev viewed the conflict through the lens of class conflict. Nikita Khrushchev put it colorfully when he said, "If anyone believes that our smiles involve abandonment of the teaching of Marx, Engels, and Lenin, he deceives himself poorly. Those who wait for that must wait until a shrimp learns to whistle."

The flaw in Soviet foreign policy…consisted in the fact that all its energy came from an ideological source. A hard core of ideological constructs 16-5   Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   ultimately determined the behavior of the USSR on decisive questions of international relations… 
9
Later, the nuclear revolution also forced communist ideology to adapt, especially after both sides acquired the hydrogen bomb. Acknowledging the potential for nuclear catastrophe, Khrushchev rejected the idea that world war was "inevitable." He, instead, embraced "peaceful coexistence" at the Twentieth Party Congress, invoking a concept developed by Lenin. Khrushchev's reformulation did little to assuage the ideological conflict, however. Met with suspicion in the West, this announcement-and subsequent Soviet behavior-failed to ease tensions.
The Soviets considered the United States its number one foe throughout the Cold War, but China also figured prominently in their calculations. Here, too, ideology played a major role in determining the arc of Soviet-Sino relations, with its progression of alignment, alliance, and bitter estrangement. The fallout, in turn, had significant implications for the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. For example, North Korea under then-President Kim Il-Sung invaded South Korea with Moscow's and Peking's moral and material support. Worse, from a long-term perspective, the Soviets helped China develop its atomic weapons. Much later, the United States exploited the Soviet-Sino schism with President Nixon's opening to the People's Republic of China in 1972.
Ideology also played a crucial role in the Cold War's bloodless resolution, a remarkable event that will be covered in more depth later in this chapter. Here it suffices to note that Soviet ideological malaise, rather than conviction, proved a contributing factor. A loss of ideological confidence, born of economic stagnation and the bitter fruits of imperialism, preceded the Soviet Union's political disintegration.
Mindful of the ideological and geopolitical nature of the threat posed by the Soviet Union, the United States adopted containment as its overarching strategy for the Cold War. Writing in Moscow, diplomat George Kennan outlined his framework of containment in his famous Long Telegram and his Foreign Affairs article (1947) written under the pseudonym "Mr. X." Kennan described, in general terms, the rationale for countering Soviet aggression, leaving to others craft the particulars of implementation. 
10
The Soviet atomic bomb test (1949) spurred President Truman to undertake a comprehensive review of U.S. strategy. Drafted in early 1950, National Security Council report NSC-68 painted the competition between superpowers in stark terms and emphasized the risks the United States faced unless it changed course. "The issues that face us are momentous, involving the fulfillment or destruction not only of this Republic but of civilization itself." 
11
The Soviet strategy had a dual-edged quality. The defensive element aimed to address Moscow's fears of "capitalist encirclement"; the offensive component sought to advance Soviet power, preferably without engaging the United States in direct military conflict. As Kennan noted in his Long Telegram in 1946, the Soviets, comforted with the ideological certitude of ultimate victory, did not have a fixed timetable to advance their conquests. 
12
While both sides clearly recognized the nature of the strategic competition, they often erred with respect to intelligence estimates. Most resulted from faulty extrapolations-such as the "missile gap" in the 1950s, when the United States overestimated the size and projected growth of the Soviet missile force. Deception efforts also played a role, as happened at the 1955 Moscow Aviation Day parade, when the Soviets circled a small number of bombers around the reviewing stand to create the illusion of a larger force.
Other U.S. intelligence assessments underestimated Soviet strengths and timelines. The Soviets' testing of an atomic bomb in 1949, for instance, took place much earlier than expected. In 1957, the Sputnik satellite provided another unwelcome surprise, foreshadowing the Soviets' capacity to deliver long-range nuclear payloads. Later, post-Cold War assessments revealed the Soviet biological arsenal to be much larger than estimated.

Multiple factors contributed to Soviet intelligence failures, starting with their highly centralized intelligence system that focused mostly on ensuring party loyalty. As a result, analytic efforts received far fewer resources. Soviet intelligence products often consisted of little more that press summaries.

Faculty intelligence estimates such as the Soviet SS-20 deployment also suggests the broader significance of military power assessed in relation to the capabilities of other powers and specific historical contexts. Consider, for example, the Soviet Union's possession of the world's largest land army after World War II, most of it positioned in Eastern Europe. This force provided Moscow with strategic depth and political leverage, thus serving both geopolitical and ideological purposes. In time, though, the deployment of these same forces engendered resentment.
Military power, and the spending required to sustain it, also imposed an everescalating strain on an increasingly wobbly economy. In the long run, the cost of mainlining military forces that absorbed roughly 20 percent of GDP crippled the Soviet economy beyond the point of repair. Unable or unwilling to challenge hardliners within the defense establishment, the reform-minded Gorbachev maintained these spending levels until the late 1980s, though the economic damage was clearly visible to all.
In the near term, though, the Red Army's defeat of Nazi Germany provided the Soviet regime with a deep reservoir of political legitimacy. Military power helped Moscow maintain its superpower status, even as France, China, and the United Kingdom joined the nuclear club during the 1950s. But the arsenals of these second-tier powers remained puny when compared to Moscow's nuclear capabilities, which only the United States could afford to match. Likewise, no other nation-state could match the two superpowers' conventional capabilities.
The Cold War also placed new demands on U.S. military power, including the sustainment of a permanent defensive perimeter overseas. Maintaining the forward deployed military posture required a level of continuous global engagement that was new to American diplomats, as they worked to secure overseas bases and security alliances. The success of these efforts provided the United States with strategic depth and forward-based military forces to contain communist aggression. Moreover, The U.S. global military posture was bought at roughly one-third the price the Soviet Union was paying, as measured in terms of a percentage of GDP.
The United States not only helped form a series of global security alliances, in direct contrast to its isolationist course after World War I, it undertook a leadership role within these alliances, particularly within NATO (established in 1949). This was a striking departure from past practices, where the United States following President Thomas Jefferson's advice to avoid "entangling alliances" had remained aloof from formal 16-9   Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   alliances with any foreign power since the Revolutionary War.

Over time, the costs of maintaining such large forces at home and overseas-though never as crippling as what the Soviets endured-left a deep imprint on the U.S. economy. as the military-industrial complex that Eisenhower warned America about in his Farewell Address (January 17, 1961) came into existence and continued growing. Large, and by U.S. historical standards, unprecedented peacetime military spending distorted the economy: the government soaked up research dollars at the expense of the private sector, and the practice of spreading procurement dollars across a large number of congressional districts made defense spending more to responsive political interests than to strategic ones.
But U.S. defense spending also had positive effects on the economy. Spinoff and dual-use technologies, ranging from microelectronics to aviation design, not to mention the networking capabilities that underlay the Internet, all provided significant benefits to the civilian sector. In contrast, the Soviet civilian sector gained comparably little from its military expenditures-a fact that partially explains Soviet efforts to steal Western technologies.
More broadly, U.S. military spending had a powerful effect well beyond protected narrowly defined security interests: it underwrote the strategy of containment, U.S. global engagement and ushered in Pax Americana, a period of peace that allowed the global economy to surge forward unscathed by major inter-state wars. In fact, it is hard to conceive the globalization of the world's economy without the shield of American arms. This dominance did not occur by happenstance. American strategists understood the importance of comparative analysis in assessing the relative strengths and weaknesses of national power, and how best to exploit asymmetries in force structure, strategy, and doctrine. Created in 1972, the Office of Net Assessment focused on making just such comparisons and interactions, giving the United States an important analytical advantage over the Soviet Union, especially during the latter stages of the Cold War.
For their part, the Soviets expended considerable efforts to determine the so-called correlation of forces. Their methodology also considered a wide range of political, military, economic, and cultural variables. In this regard, both the U.S. and Soviet approaches avoided the perils of drawing too many conclusions from "bean counting" military hardware. But the Soviet approach differed since its practitioners viewed trends and events through the lens of ideological determinism.
In wartime, a belief in the inevitability of victory can help nation-states recover from initial battlefield disasters, as the Soviet Union did during World War II. In terms of peacetime economics, however, the same certitude promotes a stay-the-course mentality,
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   even when overwhelming evidence indicates changes are necessary. This helps explain why Soviet leaders were able to rationalize their economy's declining performance-and their resultant inaction-over several decades. Substantive reform efforts began only after Gorbachev and his like-minded cohorts cast aside the ideological blinders worn by their predecessors.
Nuclear weapons played an important role in the superpowers thinking about military power and the nature of victory, both in ideological and practical terms. Military power during the Cold War played the decisive role in winning World War II. In the Cold War, it also played a crucial role in some contexts, including multiple Berlin crises, the Korean War, Cuban missile crisis, and Vietnam, but a secondary or even marginal role in other situations. In all cases, Washington and Moscow wrestled with the same fundamental challenge: how to convert unprecedented military power into political influence without provoking a direct superpower clash of arms and the attendant risk of nuclear war. This continuous risk of direct superpower conflict assumed several forms and shaped military force structure, alert levels, and doctrine. For example, the superpowers took the threat of surprise attack very seriously. Fearing a sudden "bolt from the blue," they each placed a tremendous emphasis on strategic warning. Moreover, both rivals had to guard against allies and client-states leading them down risky paths they would prefer to avoid. For instance, the United States found itself restraining South Korean strongman Syngman Rhee's desire to attack North Korea prior to the Korean War. Moscow faced a similar challenge with Cuba's Fidel Castro, who repeatedly attempted to goad the Soviet Union into war with the United States.
Though Castro appeared unconcerned about the potential for escalation, the Soviets and their American counterparts always had to weigh the risk of war against the backdrop of nuclear weapons. These weapons shaped superpower thinking about military power, and nuclear strategy represented an important subset of containment strategy. The United States' atomic monopoly (1945-1949) presented unique challenges for the Soviet Union. Privately, the Soviets worked furiously on the development of their own atomic weapon; publically, they assumed a posture of studied nonchalance, treating the atomic bomb as just another weapon. Later, the Chinese adopted similar rhetoric for much the same reason, with Chairman Mao disparaging the Soviet advantage in nuclear weapons.
Even after the United Kingdom, France, and China joined the nuclear club, the United States and the Soviet Union measured their arsenals almost entirely against one another, and hence retained, by a wide margin, the two largest nuclear arsenals throughout the Cold War. There was no template for the superpowers to harness the latent destructive power of nuclear weapons into meaningful political ends, though the Allied strategic bombing campaigns of World War II provided a point of departure. Thus, for much of the Cold War, 16-11   Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   policymakers and strategists on both sides found themselves working in uncharted territory, with few signposts to guide them. In fact, military strategists, who one would have thought could make major contributions in this era, refused to undertake the deep thinking required in an increasingly complex strategic environment, perhaps because the unprecedented destructive power of nuclear weapons appeared to gut the concept of military victory. Hence, the rise of the "civilian defense intellectual" who, for much of the Cold War, did almost all of the original thinking on U.S. nuclear strategy-starting with the scholars at the RAND Corporation, including Herman Kahn, Bernard Brodie, and Albert Wohlstetter.

Yet despite its seriousness, the Cuban missile crisis did not denude nuclear weapons-or nuclear threat-making for that matter-of their political utility. For example, during the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, when an Arab coalition prepared to attack Israel, U.S. Secretary of State Kissinger made a very public and calculated reference to the dangers of nuclear escalation so as to deter Soviet intervention in the Middle East. 
23
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   As the Cold War matured, the advent of increasingly accurate delivery systems and second-strike capabilities ensured a nuclear stalemate at the strategic level. The inability of either side to achieve a clear advantage eventually opened the door to strategic arms negotiations and to begin the long process of creating alternatives to mutually assured destruction.
Still, much nuclear posturing continued along the road to, if not peace, at least strategic parity. For instance, the United States underwrote most of its security guarantees to Europe through its strategic nuclear umbrella. This required that western European nations demonstrated their commitment to NATO by allowing Washington to deploy nuclear weapons on their soil. The hope was that such measures would enhance deterrence, but the Europeans understood that these deployments would undoubtedly attract Soviet nuclear strikes on their nations in the event of a conflict. Forward deployed nuclear weapons thus reassured U.S. allies-and frightened them at the same time. These fears led NATO to adopt the Harmel Report in 1967, which committed the alliance to a policy of détente while simultaneously reaffirming its security commitment to deter Soviet expansion.
Nuclear posturing had far less effect in the superpowers' battle for influence and dominance in the Third World, as such weapons meant little to Third World revolutionaries, save the special case of Fidel Castro and the Cuban missile crisis. Clearly, the Viet Cong did not feel threatened by the U.S. nuclear weaponry any more than the Afghani Mujahedeen feared Soviet nuclear weaponry. Their defiance in the face of nuclear supremacy was proved well founded, given the opprobrium the superpowers would receive from any use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear adversaries.
In the late 1960s, the Soviet Union had achieved a rough equivalence with the United States insofar as nuclear capabilities were concerned. This opened the door for strategic nuclear weapons negotiations where both sides admitted that their nuclear weapon stockpiles had reached the point of diminishing returns.
By the early 1970s, the atmospherics surrounding U.S.-Soviet détente created an additional incentive for the superpowers to negotiate. Despite these conditions, strategic arms negotiations proved tortuous and protracted for several reasons:
• Many of the problems revolved around the rivals' different capabilities: the Soviets placed great emphasis on land-based intercontinental missiles, while the United States allocated its weapons more evenly among land, sea, and bomber-based systems. These and other asymmetries bedeviled negotiators.
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   • At times, the negotiations themselves took on the character of a medieval theological debate, complete with high priests of nuclear theology strategy and esoteric terminology that was beyond the ken of mere mortals.
• The rough parity of strategic nuclear forces did provide, however, enough of a basis for ensuring a modest agreement pursuant to the Strategic Arms Limitations Talks (SALT). As a result, in 1972, the superpowers signed SALT I as well as codified the doctrine of mutual vulnerability with the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which placed severe limits on the superpowers' defensive capabilities.
• The superpowers nevertheless continued to modernize their nuclear arsenals, which the terms of SALT I permitted, but this had more to do with bureaucratic inertia than any realistic attempt to alter the calculus of mutually assured destruction.
Though compelling for its parsimonious logic, mutually assured destruction came at a cost. By holding each other's population hostage to nuclear annihilation, the superpowers reinforced preexisting ideological and geopolitical hostility. From this angle, the underlying logic of mutual vulnerability violated civilized norms, a necessary evil in the absence of viable policy alternatives such as disarmament or strategic defense. This calculus changed after the Reagan administration took office.
Long before assuming the Oval Office, Ronald Reagan developed an interest in strategic defense, stimulated in part by visits to Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and the North American Air Defense Command. 
24
Though clearly aspirational in the near term, SDI jarred the Soviets. So did Reagan's later refusal to consider SDI a bargaining chip at Reykjavik, Iceland, talks in October 1986. 
25
The Reagan administration's newfound commitment to strategic defense exploited the Soviet's relative disadvantage in microelectronics and computer technology. The Soviet leadership grasped the implications of this revolution even before Reagan announced his SDI initiative. In the past, the Soviet's wide-ranging espionage efforts offset some of the U.S. technological advantages, as Soviet agents pilfered certain weapons designs, including, most spectacularly, that of the atomic weapon. But the microelectronics-based revolution was too broad and too deep for the Soviets to steal their way to technological equivalency. Equally problematic, the Soviet's centralized economic system lacked the ability to create disruptive technologies of its own, let alone match those of the United States. In this case, as it usually does, entrepreneurship handily beat centralized planning in generating technological innovation.
Technological innovations also had a profound effect on how both sides thought about organizing and employing conventional forces. In fact, dramatic advances in conventional weaponry, particularly those that favored the United States during the latter stages of the Cold War, began shaping the strategic rivalry almost as much as nuclear weapons. When, in the 1980s, the Office of Net Assessment took careful note of Soviet Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov's writings about a Military-Technical Revolution (MTR), Dr. Andrew Marshall and his staff began reformulating these ideas into a broader concept, emphasizing the integration of dramatic technological advances, doctrine, and organization to achieve decisive battlefield effects. Collectively, these ideas became known as the Revolution of Military Affairs or RMA. U.S. military operationalized elements of the RMA in the Air-Land Battle Doctrine, as the U.S. Army reoriented its focus back to Europe in the wake of the Vietnam War. By providing the United States with the capacity to attack Soviet rear-echelon forces, the Air-Land Battle Doctrine offset numerical disadvantages NATO faced in the European theater with a marriage of superior technology and doctrine. These doctrinal and technological advancements greatly enhanced the deterrent value of conventional forces in Europe, thereby reducing the risk of political coercion. For their part, Soviet thinkers recognized that highly accurate conventional weapons could, in localized circumstances, achieve nuclear weapons-like effects without incurring the opprobrium associated with actually using nuclear weapons.
The development of the Air-Land Battle Doctrine and emerging RMA had a number of long-term effects. The Air-Land Battle Doctrine generally reflected close cooperation between the U.S. Army and Air Force. 
26
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   communications failures during the U.S. intervention in Grenada (1983), thus set the stage for Congress to pass Goldwater-Nichols Act (1986), which mandated jointness among the Services. At another level, the evolving RMA inadvertently provided added incentives for U.S. and Soviet adversaries to embrace unconventional and asymmetric military strategies-a trend that continues in the Cold War's aftermath, as evident by the enduring popularity of irregular warfare in Afghanistan and Iraq, among other places.
Unconventional conflicts had far-reaching implications for the Cold War writ large. The Cold War began in Europe but most of the bloodletting occurred in the Third World. Proxy wars involved slow, grinding conflicts, largely outside the glare of media attention. They had their own dynamics and were quite divorced from the superpower competition in conventional and nuclear arms. Decolonization, which gained momentum in the aftermath of the World War II, provided the backdrop for many of these conflicts. Colonial powers struggled against the nationalistic tide, seeking to maintain their empires by intimidation or, in some cases, by outright force. The superpowers courted, cajoled, and, at times, coerced the new nationalistic leaders. Some proved willing stooges. Other leaders of newly independent states, such as Egypt's Gamal Abdel Nasser, played their own game, seeking to play superpowers off one another to advance their own political ends.
With its markedly anti-Western overtones, decolonization provided Moscow with opportunities to exploit. In January 1961, Khrushchev pledged Soviet support for "wars of national liberation," which displaced Stalin's earlier emphasis on "socialism in one country." Khrushchev's commitment to support revolutionary struggles also strained Soviet-Sino relations, as Chairman Mao had his own ambitions in the developing world. Soviet interventions included the deployment of combat troops, advisers, supplies, and various forms of economic and political support, all a further drain on the tottering economy. Soviet imperialism reached its zenith in the 1970s, with Moscow subsidizing a wide range of activities in Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Central America, and Latin America. 
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   Several factors prompted the superpowers to vie for power and influence in the Third World. 
27
The Soviet Union sought to exploit the colonial legacy of Western powers, backing anti-colonial movements and wars of national liberation. Rhetorically, Moscow also lumped together the United States with European powers, even though U.S. colonial possessions were quite limited-most notably the Philippines, a consequence of the Spanish-American War. The United States found its own anti-colonial perspective, a byproduct of the Revolutionary War, at odds with the views of its European allies.
Moreover, the United States had mixed emotions when it came to intervening in the Third World. Its idealistic impulses tugged in opposite directions: its desire to retreat from the Old World competed with a messianic urge to remake it in its own image. These idealistic sentiments, in turn, intersected with more real politik concerns, including the need to contain Soviet expansion without driving America into financial ruin and risking costly stalemates like Korea. Domestic U.S. debates over Cold War intervention abroad thus reflected a swirl of intersecting interests and values. The defeat in Vietnam effectively ruled out large-scale U.S. military intervention abroad for the remainder of the Cold War.
Ideological competition magnified the importance of superpower territorial gains and losses abroad. Soviet leaders believed that gains in the Third World validated their political system. Much later, reformers like Gorbachev considered Soviet difficult abroad to be symptomatic of deeper problems at home. By the 1980s, the "wars of national liberation" had long since lost their luster for the Soviet people and their leaders.
The quest for new markets also played a role in the superpowers' quest for influence in the Third World, but more so for the United States, given its commitment to promote international trade. Scarred by memories of the Great Depression, the United States clearly wanted to create a post-World War II international economic world order based on low tariffs and the rule of law. Radical critiques of U.S. foreign policy, however, often exaggerated the influence markets had on Washington decision-makers by interpreting their every move abroad through every through the lens of economic imperialism.
The Soviet Union was less interested in developing markets abroad. The Soviet Union's reliance on autarky in the 1930s largely insulated it from the Great Depression, and left a lasting-and mostly favorable-impression on its leaders. Until the mid-to late 1980s, Moscow's insistence on maintaining a centralized economy stifled innovation and largely limited trade to within the Soviet bloc. In the selected markets where Moscow
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   permitted trade, shoddy workmanship made most Soviet products unattractive and uncompetitive with buyers in the outside world.
The Cold War competition for allies and client-states, as well as the value newly independent states placed on their sovereignty, stimulated the growth of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), beginning with the Bandung Conference in 1955. The Non-Aligned Movement lacked the capacity to prevent superpower intervention in the Third World, but its ability to mobilize political opposition presented another cost to foreign military intervention. Most non-aligned countries sharply criticized U.S. intervention in Vietnam, for example. Soviet interventions in the Third World also elicited sharp criticism as well from NAM leaders. Yugoslavia's Josip Broz Tito, for example, denounced the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968. Later, when Politburo leaders were considering military intervention in Afghanistan in 1979, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko anticipated-correctly, for the most part-that "All the non-aligned countries will be against us." 28 Arming the Proxies U.S.-Soviet competition included various forms of security assistance to allies and clientstates. Foreign military sales and transfers provided the superpowers an avenue for leveraging their military power in order to gain inroads into the Third World. There was no shortage of demand, with revolutionary movements and governments clamoring for superpower arms. Such arms fueled proxy wars in Angola, Mozambique, and El Salvador, among other hot spots, throughout the latter half of the 1970s and much of the next decade. America's efforts to supply such weapons were often hampered by oversight imposed by a post-Vietnam-Watergate Congress, which moved rapidly reassert its authority on a wide range of oversight matters. For instance, Congress passed the Arms Export Control Act (1976), making U.S. arms transfers subject to intense oversight by Congress, as well as the Clark Amendment curtailing U.S. military aid to insurgents in Angola. This created an asymmetry, as the Soviets leaders faced no such restrictions on who they could help. With a much freer hand, Moscow subsidized Cuban arms purchases, which fueled Havana's intervention in Central America and Africa. At times, however, these arms transfers also proved problematic for the Soviet Union. In 1972, for instance, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat kicked out thousands of Soviet advisers, after confiscating millions of tons of war materiel the Soviets had obligingly sent him. Moreover, there was a growing perception that Soviet military equipment was inferior to what the United States had to offer. Egyptian and Syrian military commanders blamed Soviet-supplied arms for their battlefield humiliations, pointing at how much better U.S.-supplied technology fared in Israeli hands. Superpower efforts to arm proxies were both a cause-and-effect of their strategic rivalry. Their efforts reflected the intensity of the rivalry and helped to sustain it by fueling a wide range of protracted Third World contests. These battlegrounds provided an 16-18   Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   attractive outlet for competition, given the superpowers' reluctance to fight one another directly. The security risks were generally low because neither superpower exported their most advanced weapons. Security assistance-whether in the form of government and direct commercial sales-had the added appeal of providing another stimulus to the superpowers' industrial bases.
In some cases, superpower efforts to provide arms for proxy fights had a significant battlefield impact. These included Soviet support for the Viet Cong during the Vietnam War and U.S. assistance to the mujahedeen in Afghanistan. The competition in the Third World also had a lopsided economic effect with its adverse impact on the Soviet Union. Moscow's economic burdens, at this time, were also growing, as the Soviets discovered what previous empires had all endured: at some point client-states stopped providing net economic gains, and, instead, become a resource drain. As a result, the Soviet Union's efforts to updates its own economy were greatly hampered by the fiscal and resource drain imposed by Moscow's Eastern European clients. For a time, the Soviet Union's abundant natural resources and growing populations could compensate for these disadvantages, but stated GDP growth was masking the system's pervasive structural weaknesses.
Throughout the Cold War, the superpowers constantly reassessed how well their interests and values aligned with those of the states and non-state actors requesting various forms of security assistance. Here, as elsewhere, ideological factors colored Soviet thinking, especially regarding the desirability and durability of alliances and partnerships. Marxism-Leninism predicted the capitalist powers would fight one another as well as members of the socialist camp. As the Cold War progressed, however, it became clear that capitalist powers were not going to fight one another-despite intra-alliance rivalries and periodic crises. Post-Stalin Soviet leaders concluded that, far from being imminent, intra-capitalist wars were not even likely. Flexibility on this particular point did not, however, detract from the Soviet view (pre-Gorbachev) that the superpowers remained locked in a fierce ideological competition, notwithstanding periodic thaws in the relationship.
The ideological trajectory of the Soviet-Sino relationship, another key dynamic of the Cold War, also morphed over time. Stalin initially supported nationalist leader Chiang Kaishek and the Kuomintang when they were much stronger than the Chinese Communist Party. After the Chinese Communists' victory in 1949, the Soviet Union moved to back the now-People's Republic of China. The early Cold War period witnessed a genuine alliance between the communist giants. Nowhere was the intimate nature of this cooperation more apparent than in the field of nuclear weapons cooperation: Soviet scientists provided their Chinese counterparts with technical knowhow and assistance throughout much of the 1950s. But just a common communist ideology brought these two historic rivals into a quasi-alliance, so ideological differences played a role in the split. The most contentious 16-19   Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   issues involved de-Stalinization and "peaceful coexistence" with the West-two concepts the Chinese communist found repugnant, even though they did not affect the essence of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry. The ideological differences were exacerbated, as often happens in international relations by the personnel animus between the two state's leaders, Khrushchev and Mao. The Soviet leader remarked in his memoirs:
Politics is a game, and Mao Tse-tung has played politics with Asiatic cunning, following his own rules of cajolery, treachery, savage vengeance, and deceit. 
29
Their long-simmering differences first erupted in public view in October 1961, at the Twenty-Second Party Congress. In a thinly veiled attack on China, Khrushchev unleashed a fusillade against Albania's embrace of Stalinism. Zhou Enlai, the head of the Chinese delegation, stalked out of the congress and departed Moscow early. Before long, the Soviet Union found itself fighting a two-front ideological war against democratic capitalism and Maoism. By the end of the decade, the Soviet Union and China were engaging in divisionsized border skirmishes along the Ussuri and Amur Rivers in the Soviet far east.
President Nixon and Chairman Mao found common ground in their opposition to the Soviet Union-another example how geostrategic concerns often trumped ideology during the Cold War. Both nations cast aside their ideological differences and normalized relations in 1972. The significance of this turning point is hard to overstate, especially if one imagines-notwithstanding the hazards of counterfactuals-the security challenges the United States likely would have faced if the Soviet-Sino split had never occurred.
If the Soviet-Sino split revealed the importance of alliances in a negative sense, NATO provided a positive example, demonstrating the importance of successful alliances in shaping the Cold War. U.S. political and military power ensured its status as first among equals within NATO, but it was rarely capable of bending NATO to its will if the other member states were opposed to a particular action. On the other hand, the countrymembers of the Warsaw Pact assumed only a pretense of equality as the Soviet Union dictated policy. NATO's resilience is clear when one considers the long list of crises that strained the alliance-among them tensions over Suez, the disaster in Vietnam, France's withdrawal from command structures, the collapse of détente, and the Soviet deployment of SS-20snot to mention chronic bickering among allies over defense spending. NATO muddled through all of them, retaining its cohesion against the Soviet threat.
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   Tensions within the new Warsaw Pact also resulted in bloodshed: Soviet troops crushed rebellions in Hungary (1956) and Czechoslovakia (1968). Each of these proved costly not only in economic terms but in maintaining alliance unity, which the Soviets always viewed as suspect. Moscow probably realized that its heavy-handed approach to enforcing order fueled a smoldering resentment among its client-states and tarnished its image abroad, but Soviet leaders worked within a system that could imagine no other policy solutions to perceived betrayal.
NATO and the Warsaw Pact reflected asymmetries on several levels.
• In the first place, conventional military force ratios heavily favored the Soviets throughout the Cold War; the Soviet-dominated alliance led in tanks, troops, artillery pieces, and aircraft.
• However, the West's technological prowess helped to compensate for the Warsaw Pact's numerical advantages, especially when combined with doctrinal and organizational changes, as happened with the U.S. Army's adoption of the Air-Land battle.
• Geographically, the Warsaw Pact reflected a tighter grouping than NATO (the accession of Greece and Turkey stretched the concept of a "North Atlantic" alliance). For NATO, geography mattered less than the common values and interests that knitted the alliance members together. The experience of the Warsaw Pact clearly showed that political coercion did not engender reliable, let alone enthusiastic, allies. Though NATO members routinely vented their frustrations, giving the appearance of disunity, there was never any real danger of dissolving the Alliance, despite persistent Soviet efforts to split the alliance.
Washington sought to build on NATO's success by creating other anticommunist alliances, including the Baghdad Pact and Southeast Asian Treaty Organization (SEATO). U.S. efforts to link the alliances via common members (Turkey was part of NATO and the Baghdad Pact; Pakistan a member of the Baghdad Pact and SEATO) reflected the "architectural ingenuity" of Secretary of State John Foster Dulles. 
30
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   Southeast Asia proved similarly ill-suited to a NATO-like security alliance. Alarmed by the French disaster at Dien Bien Phu (1954), the United States created SEATO to protect the region against further communist predations. With a geographically dispersed membership-only the Philippines and Thailand actually resided in South East Asia-SEATO found itself encompassing a disparate set of national security interests. As historian Bradford Lee noted, "Each of them was more wrapped up in its own specific problems than in the general American project of extended containment." 
31
From a strategic perspective, both the SEATO and Baghdad alliances lacked the internal cohesion of the NATO alliance (critics dubbed SEATO a "zoo of paper tigers"). Writing in 1957, Henry Kissinger noted that …neither SEATO nor the Bagdad Pact are we associated with partners with whom we share the degree of common purpose conferred by the cultural heritage which unites us with our European allies. 
32
33
The Cold War's scope and complexity created extraordinary challenges for national leaders. The superpowers had to consider each other, outside actors, and long-term historical forces over which they had limited influence. Yet a select number of leaders, through their force of personality, retained the ability to shape events and trends during the Cold War. Stalin and Truman exerted the greatest influence during the early Cold War, while Gorbachev and Reagan dominated its endgame.
Ruthless and opportunistic, Stalin viewed the world primarily from a Marxist-Leninist perspective. He also treated everything-from his own standing within the Soviet hierarchy to the Soviet Union's standing relative to Western powers-with the same zerosum mentality. Stalin backed down on occasion, to be sure, but only when outmaneuvered or faced with an unfavorable constellation of factors, as noted earlier with early Cold War crises involving Iran and Turkey. With Stalin in charge, the prospects for any type of détente, let alone negotiated resolution of the Cold War, remained dismal. No other Soviet leader would come close to matching his iron grip, and Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev, while heads of the Communist Party, never wielded power over the Politburo to anything approaching the degree Stalin achieved. Other Soviet leaders served as mere caretakers given their short tenures. During Reagan's first term, Soviet leaders Yuri
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   Andropov (November 1982 to February 1984) and Konstantin Ustinovich Chernenko (February 1984 to March 1985) died within three years of one another.
On the U.S. side, President Truman did more than any other Western leader to shape the Cold War's early trajectory. He embraced major initiatives with relish, such as his eponymous doctrine (1947). The Truman Doctrine grew out of specific concerns that communist guerrillas forces might prevail in Greece and Turkey, especially after cashstrapped Britain informed the United States it could no longer provide the two countries with financial assistance. Ideological concerns imbued the Truman Doctrine, and it assumed a more universal cast with its pledge to "support free people who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures."
Conceptually, the Truman Doctrine fit well with the framework of containment. But like Kennan's formulation, the Truman Doctrine did not specify what type of support the United States would provide. Politically, it had the benefit of strong bipartisan support, as did the Truman Administration's other major national security initiatives, including the Marshall Plan (1948) and the creation of NATO (1949).
The voluntary nature of these initiatives contrasted with the Soviet approach towards its client-states. The Brezhnev Doctrine reflected this view, declaring, in effect, that becoming a member of the Communist bloc marked an irreversible transition (once a Communist, always a Communist). Initially cited to justify the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia (1968), this doctrine came under strain as the Soviet Empire increasingly experienced political and economic woes. The Polish crisis in 1981 effectively ended the Brezhnev Doctrine. 
34
35
The sudden and bloodless end of the Cold War was atypical for strategic rivalries. A closer look at the interplay of President Reagan and President Gorbachev is, therefore, crucial to understanding why these dynamics unfolded the way that they did. Gorbachev understood that a stagnant and overcommitted Soviet Union could no longer compete with the United States and the West. True, Gorbachev had his own reasons for pursuing reform, but the Reagan administration calibrated its pressure-playing U.S. strengths against Soviet weaknesses-to reinforce his natural inclinations.
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   Over time, George Kennan's initial conception that resistance to Soviet thrusts would lead to its "break-up or the gradual mellowing of Soviet power" morphed into an approach that became comfortable with an enduring stalemate. In other words, successive U.S. administrations strived to manage the competition rather than to end it. President Reagan's approach to containment, however, marked a departure from his predecessors.

• support for anti-communist guerrillas in the Third World ("Reagan Doctrine") to exploit an overextended Soviet Empire;
• an unapologetic defense of democratic capitalism;
• a greater willingness to use military force in pursuit of policy objectives;
• elements of economic warfare, and
• the sabotage of Soviet espionage efforts aimed at stealing U.S. technology. 
38
While the United States appeared rejuvenated in the 1980s, signs of Soviet politicalmilitary strains mounted. Domestically, the Kremlin appeared on autopilot after Brezhnev's death in 1982, leading to Yuri Andropov and then Constantin Chernenko, a pair of short-time successors. Internationally, the Kremlin had precious little to show for its efforts in the Third World, particularly in its most ambitious intervention-Afghanistanwhere the human and economic costs were mounting at an unsustainable rate. It would take a forceful leader to change the Soviet Union's trajectory at home and abroad-Mikhail Gorbachev.
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   Gorbachev's accession to General Secretary (1985) marked another turning point in the Cold War. He understood, for example, that Soviet efforts to impose socialism on Afghanistan were doomed to failure. Tellingly, he implored Moscow's handpicked leader, Mohammad Najibullah, accordingly: "Give up on the leftist bent in economics. Learn to organize the support of the private sector." 
39
On the domestic front, Gorbachev's pursuit of Glasnost ("Openness") and Perestroika ("Restructuring") got underway, slowly and unevenly at first but soon picked up speed. Acutely aware of the Soviet Union's systemic weaknesses, he sought to reform Soviet communism but failed to anticipate what these reforms would unleash (in this he was far from alone).
With the benefit of hindsight, the Soviet collapse had the trappings of inevitability. Gorbachev's effort to reform the communist system proved self-defeating. Though he understood that military spending was crushing the Soviet economy, the apparent necessity of keeping hardliners in check made it impossible to lower defense-spending levels. It was not until 1989 that Gorbachev announced significant cuts in the military forces. 
40
Reagan and Gorbachev were a study in contrasts. The former actor and governor was a more intuitive decision-maker than his younger, legally trained counterpart. Still, they developed a personal chemistry and though their relationship did not end the Cold War, it helped to set the final trajectory. Their effectiveness was enhanced by their shared gift for reaching well beyond their natural constituencies: Reagan connected with people behind the Iron Curtin and Gorbachev gained favor among Western elites. Unfortunately, for the Soviet Empire, it was Reagan's message that resonated amongst the "subject" populations. And though Gorbachev could get on a Time Magazine's cover as Man of the Year, and his wife became a fashion leader, he had no message that appealed to the Western masses. In the end, Western populations were, on the whole, satisfied with their lot, while those within the Soviet Empire yearned for a system that could deliver consumer goods on the scale they could readily see in the West.
Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   The Role of Chance While this chapter has emphasized the role of strategy, it is important to remember that chance occurrences also shape historical outcomes. The notion that the White House-or the Kremlin for that matter-managed crises with the rheostat-like precision is more myth than reality. The famed "eyeball to eyeball" moment that Secretary of State Dean Rusk recalled during the Cuban missile crisis was wildly inaccurate: the ships in question were approximately five hundred nautical miles apart at the time.

The Cold War did not endure for more than four decades because of some basic political misunderstanding or failure to communicate. Even before the superpowers had a dedicated "hotline" (a byproduct of the Cuban missile crisis), they had plenty of direct and indirect means to communicate. The problem was that the rivals understood each other too well, knowing that the incompatibility of their political systems meant that the rivalry could not be ended by negotiation or compromise. Ending it without recourse to suicidal military conflict could only be accomplished if one or the other surrendered the ideological underpinnings of its system, and adopted in large measure that of the other.
In the end, this is what happened and the superiority of U.S. strategy played a significant role in the outcome. Less an iron rule of conduct than a roomy framework, the "containment strategy" allowed successive administrations to put their own stamp on specific policies while adhering to a larger national approach to what was viewed as a continuing Soviet menace. In fact, "containment" proved flexible enough to adapt on the fly to changes of policy, which sometimes took place within a single administration, as happened with President Carter's adoption of a more hawkish posture after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. At other times, the changes were more tonal than substantive, such as President Reagan's modulating his anti-Soviet rhetoric during his second term.
As a strategy, containment proved remarkably effective over the long haul and despite costly setbacks in Korea and Vietnam. Part of the answer is with the institutional checks and balances that, combined with a political culture of domestic restraint, provided the United States with built-in shock absorbers to cope with internal and external pressures. In contrast, the Soviet Union's ideological rigidity and geostrategic ambitions proved a lethal combination. Additionally, Moscow's imperial overreach drained the 16-26   Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   Soviet Union's resources and diminished whatever ideological appeal the Soviet Union once enjoyed.
Cold War momentum shifts made it difficult for outside observers to make predictions in mid-stream. Writing in 1987, historian Paul Kennedy made the right argument (imperial overstretch) but focused on the wrong superpower (United States) in his widely read book, The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers. The Soviet Union's weaknesses are clearer in retrospect, as is often the case with defeated rivals. The Soviet Union certainly gave the appearance of a formidable enemy well into the 1980s-and with good reason, given its vast territorial expanse, dominant position in Eastern Europe, farreaching interventions in the Third World, and bulging conventional and nuclear arsenals. But it was also a fragile empire who had long passed the point of imperial overstretch. It was only waiting for a catalyst to precipitate the fall. U.S. institutional strengths also were clearer in retrospect.
• Democratic discourse allowed stakeholders to blow off steam, while elections provided citizens with the opportunity to remove incompetent leaders in an orderly fashion. Juxtaposed next to rigidity of the Soviet system, Western democracies appeared supple. Institutional checks and balances, combined with a political culture based on civic restraint and the rule of law, allowed the United States to self-correct its excesses.
• In contrast, the Soviet Union's ideological rigidity and geostrategic ambitions worked at cross-purposes as the Cold War matured. Domestically, the Soviet apparatchik system cultivated short-sighted leaders, which made the entire system less responsive, like barnacles accreting on the hull of a ship. Internationally, Moscow's imperial overreach drained the Soviet Union of resources, crimped its growth, and sullied its ideological appeal. Third World nationalism, as well as U.S.-backed anti-communist resistance movements, further complicated Soviet efforts.
• Gorbachev's increasingly frantic efforts to reform the system proved self-defeating: instead, they served to expose the system's underlying contradictions and hasten its demise. Gorbachev said it best: "The delusion was that at the time I, like most of us, assumed this could be accomplished by improving and refining the existing system." 43
The United States endured economic and financial shocks aplenty during the Cold War, as did its allies. But for every crisis there was a recovery that strengthened the economy. Centralized planning helped the Soviets mass-produce armaments during World War II, but as the Cold War advanced beyond the 1950s this system proved ill-equipped to 16-27   Cold War Strategic Rivalry: The Soviet Union Contra Mundo (1945-1991)   compete with capitalist countries. The Soviets enjoyed strong economic growth rates in the early years of the Cold War, but this was in part because devastation wrought by World War II left the country with a low baseline. The ideological rigidity of the Soviet Union limited its capacity to enact political and economic reforms, and it fell further and further behind the West. "Above all, this was because the totalitarian system possessed tremendous inertia," Gorbachev would later note. 
44
For all its permutations among different administrations, the strategy of containment retained its overall coherence. Continuity along these lines excluded the extremes of conciliation and preemptive military action against the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's strategy, by comparison, reflected a mix of offensive and defensive elements, as the geopolitical fear of encirclement combined with ideological thrusts aimed at destabilizing the United States and its allies. The ideological and geopolitical differences dividing the superpowers ensured a rough stalemate until Gorbachev ushered in Glasnost and Perestroika, and President Reagan embraced a more muscular form of containment designed to reinforce the effects political changes within the Soviet system were having.
The Cold War's aftermath also provides insights into the nature of the rivalry. The ideological underpinnings of the Soviet Union were thoroughly discredited, save for communist remnants in Cuba and North Korea. However, the geopolitical impulses underlying Soviet foreign policy have since reasserted themselves with a vengeance, especially under President Vladimir Putin's neo-imperial reign. For the U.S. side, policymakers spent over a decade after the Soviet Union's collapse grasping for a new overarching strategic concept to replace containment, only to find airy formulations such as "enlargement" lacked coherence and utility in the face of new security challenges wrought by 9/11.

dangerous opponent and threat to British colonies in the Far East as well as to the British Dominions Australia and New Zealand.
Nevertheless, the chiefs of staff committee consistently worst-cased their reports, overestimated the military power of potential opponents, and minimized the real and latent strength of the Western Powers. Emblematic of their reports was their pessimistic report of March 1938 immediately before the Czech crisis broke. They concluded that no pressure that we and our possible allies can bring to bear, either by sea, on land, or in the air could prevent Germany from invading and overrunning Bohemia and from inflicting a decisive defeat on the Czechoslovakian army. We should then be faced with undertaking a war against Germany for the purpose of restoring Czechoslovakia's lost integrity and this object would only be achieved by the defeat of Germany and as the outcome of a prolonged struggle. In the world situation today it seems to us… Italy and Japan would seize the opportunity to further their own ends and that in consequence the problem we have to envisage is not that of a limited European war only, but of a World War. On this situation we reported as follows some four months ago: 'Without overlooking the assistance we should hope to obtain from France and possibly other allies, we cannot foresee the time when our defense forces will be strong enough to safeguard our territory, trade and vital interests against Germany, Italy, and Japan simultaneously.' 104 Such assessments did not drive appeasement; rather, they allowed Chamberlain to justify his best-case analysis of German intentions to cabinet and parliamentary doubters.
Meanwhile, Hitler's all-out rearmament program was running into serious difficulties with production runs cancelled or delayed because of a lack of raw materials, all resulting from major shortages in hard currency.

Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941
As Japan and the United States warily circled each other, and the possibility of war loomed, the Japanese ambassador in Washington, though publicly courteous and conciliatory, secretly urged an attack on Hawaii. In an encrypted telegram to his prime minister, he insisted that a "strong naval armament should be at once dispatched for the purpose of occupying the islands by force." 1 Surprisingly, this incendiary message was sent not in 1941, but in 1897.
Only recently have historians become aware that forty-four years before Pearl Harbor, there was another possibility of a Japanese attack on Honolulu. In 1897, Japan was no longer the weak, semi-feudal nation that Admiral Perry encountered in 1853. The capable Imperial Navy, its core composed of modern British-built steel cruisers, quickly defeated the Chinese Navy in the 1894-95 war. Fresh from that victory, Japan turned its attention not only to Korea and northern China but eastward to the Hawaiian Islands. Both the United States and Japan sought to control the independent Republic of Hawaii, run by a small white oligarchy that, in 1893, overthrew the Native Hawaiian queen. An 1896 census showed that Japanese sugar plantation workers, nearly all males between twenty and forty years of age, represented a quarter of the population. For these male immigrants, the Imperial Government demanded suffrage equality with white males, who numbered fewer than half the Japanese. Suffrage and equality might, however, turn Hawaii into a Japanese possession; a development the United States would not accept.

Though in 1897 the two powers tussled over the same objective, the episode was important for its uniqueness. Until shortly before Pearl Harbor, the two nations pursued different goals, though both were expansionist powers.
Throughout the rivalry, both were rising powers. The United States became a global power after the 1898 war with Spain. After World War I, the United States was the world's most powerful nation, though it demobilized most ground forces and possessed overseas bases only in the Caribbean, the Philippines, and Hawaii. Japan was a rising middle power, stronger in military than in economic terms. While possessing less material power overall than the United States, it was, by 1941, the most powerful country in Northeast Asia.
During the 1897-1941 rivalry, the United States remained much larger in terms of population and the economy. The US population grew faster because of much greater immigration. When the Meiji Era (1868-1912) began, Japan's population was 34 million, climbed to 53 million in 1914, and reached 74 million in 1941. The United States population was 38 million in 1868, 99 million in 1914, and 140 million in 1941. In GDP, the American economy was four times bigger in 1870, and five times bigger in 1941. In per capita GDP, therefore, the gap narrowed slightly. In 1941, the American per capita GDP was three times that of Japan. This was partly because the Japanese economy weathered the Great Depression better than the American giant. Though American growth in the 1920s had exceeded Japan's, during 1929-41, the Japanese economy grew 66%, with an actual decrease in GDP only in 1930. The much larger American economy grew 23 percent, most of that growth coming in 1939-41 (but then doubling during World War II).

Location and resources were the most dramatic and persistent asymmetries. The United States was ideally located, with oceans separating it from its biggest rivals, and no 15-2 Enduring Strategic Rivalries: US-Japan Strategic Rivalry to 1941 meaningful threat in its own hemisphere. But Japan lived in a tough neighborhood, with Russia always a threat, the Europeans lurking about, and China, though constantly in political turmoil, able to field forces strong enough to tie down the Japanese Army and drain the Japanese treasury.
Unlike the United States, Japan had few resources: little iron ore, not much coal, few steel plants, no strategic minerals, and worst of all, no oil. It sought those resources first in Korea, Taiwan, and South Sakhalin, then in Manchuria and North China, next in all of China, and, in 1941, in Southeast Asia. Until shortly before Pearl Harbor, Japan imported many essentials-oil, scrap steel, aviation fuel, machine tools-from the United States. The comparatively closed international trading system complicated Japan's quest to diversify supply. As the big British, French, and Dutch colonial empires privileged imports from their home countries, especially manufactures, exports of raw materials back to their home countries took precedence over exports to outsiders. It was difficult, therefore, for Japan to buy as many resources as it wished, and even more so to sell into the colonial empires to earn money to buy resources. Only Northeast Asia was not "locked up," but even there Japan competed with Russia as well as the European colonial powers, first in Korea, then in Manchuria, and finally across China.
Aside from material factors-population, military capability, the size of the economy and its growth, resources, and location-Japanese imperialism differed from American imperialism in its ideological and psychological underpinnings in at least five ways.
First, feelings of vulnerability infused Japanese policymaking down to 1941. The West used Japan's military vulnerability to pry open the shogunate and trigger its 1868 collapse. The feudal samurai class and its successor, the professional military, played an important role in Japan's swift embrace of many western practices, partly to strengthen the country to resist military threats. Japan swiftly built up its military, but for decades, western powers could intimidate Japan into surrendering hard-won gains. As the decades passed, Japan sought ever more strength to act-if it wished-with impunity in Northeast Asia. And as Japan grew stronger, the target area for unilateral action expanded.
Second, anger at inequality undergirded Japanese diplomatic and security policy. In the Meiji Era, Japan worked unceasingly to rid itself of the hated unequal treaties that allowed extraterritoriality and tariff oversight. Even as Japan shed the treaties, it confronted the racial superiority of the Western powers assumed for themselves. American racial discrimination was the most publicized, as few Japanese immigrated to Europe and a great many went to Hawaii and the American mainland. We need not linger over the many incidents of anti-Japanese, anti-Asian sentiment, such as discrimination in housing and workplaces, unequal pay, separate schools for "orientals," restrictions on immigration, and finally the 1924 ban on Asian immigration. This sad history made it emotionally much easier for Japanese to see America as disrespectful and unfair and unlikely to give Japan its due.

Currently, few sources exist to assist US Government policymakers in understanding the dynamics of enduring strategic rivalries. One such rivalry is the emerging Sino-US strategic competition, which remains a matter of predictive guesses based on unreliable trend lines. To help fill this intellectual void, the Office of Net Assessment (ONA) asked IDA to develop an historical study of the most important "strategic rivalries" from ancient Greece to the end of the Cold War (1991). IDA, in turn, asked a small number of historians and international political scientists, leaders in their fields, to write structured essays on the most important "enduring strategic rivalries." This collection of essays identifies the most important and enduring strategic rivalries, and examines the pitfalls and opportunities for ONA to use in its planning and presentations to US government policymakers.
