Since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Russia's military power in general and combat capabilities in the Far East in particular have eroded considerably.
Poor financial support, demoralization of military personnel, and most important, lack of purpose have all con-tributed to the erosion of Moscow's military capability in the Far East.
Furthermore, Russia may not pose any immediate or mediumterm threats to South Korea.
However, Russia's military potential should not be treated lightly.
It is still the second largest nuclear power in the world.
Gradual erosion notwithstanding, its military deployment in the Russian Far East is quite formidable, with 762 ICBMs, 25 SSBNs, and 69 strategic bombers.
And the total number of forces currently deployed in the area is substantial: manpower figures are over 225,000,300,000, and 420,000 for naval, air, and ground forces respectively.
In the event of major contingencies, Russia can swiftly prepare for combat {Defense White Paper 1998:33; Yon 1996).
