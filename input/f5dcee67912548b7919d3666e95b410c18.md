The potential influence of hybrid warfare on modern conflict is vast, and yet fundamentally dependent on the observer's analytical perspective, or at which level of conflict they choose to focus their attention.
At the strategic level, the hybrid theory of warfare can be seen as the employment of information operations and diplomacy in conjunction with cyber and electronic operations to weaken an opponent, or to sow the seeds of chaos in relation to an adversary.
Russian hacking into US political parties during the 2016 presidential campaign is an example of this idea.
Several US intelligence agencies assess that Russia utilized cyber and electronic forces to locate information which could be used to influence the US election.
Then they utilized various means of media to distribute that information with the goal to discredit the US political process and political institutions, and politically weaken the United States.
Similarly, the strategic component of hybrid warfare in relation to Ukraine can be seen during the precursor to annexation of Crimea and offensive action in the Donbas, as Russia used information operations and diplomacy to weaken the government in Kiev.
