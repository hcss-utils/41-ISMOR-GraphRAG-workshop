This paper will define NATO as all 29 members of the Alliance.
However, this discussion will primarily focus on the U.S., Canada, the major European military powers (UK, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Poland, Czech Republic, Norway, Holland, and Denmark) and the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania).
Of note, this list does not include Turkey which, at the time of writing, has formed a close relationship with Russia and may choose not to commit forces to a conflict against Russia
