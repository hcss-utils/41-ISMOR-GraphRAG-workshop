To illuminate Russian thinking about this subject, we examined official Russian strategic documents (such as the Information Security Doctrine), public statements by Russia's leaders, and publicly available Russian-language military writings pertaining to information confrontation in general and to the role of social media in particular.
Importantly, Russian military and defense experts often abstain in publicly accessible formats from declaring what Russia's approach is or should be.
Instead, they discuss the nature of information confrontation in the abstract, or they address their perceptions of the approaches to information warfare adopted by the United States or the West; so, we must infer their views of Russia's approach from this discussion.
