Our analysis provides only one part of the answer to a question of great complexity, one that is perhaps of existential interest to some allies of the United States: What is Russia's current capacity to project ground combat power?
We showed how many forces Russia can physically move over a given distance and a given period of time.
Power projection includes deployment, but also the ability to fight at the far end of the deployment arc.
For example, Russia might be able to deploy a ground combat brigade to the Kuril Islands, but how capable would this deployed force be against a given adversary?
What if it had to fight the Japanese Self-Defense Forces, even for a limited period?
What if the United States intervened with all its military power in an extended conflict?
Understanding power projection requires a deeper analysis of force composition, training, will to fight, and physical capabilities, as well as a comparative analysis of effectiveness against a given adversary in a given context.
Some generalizations could then be drawn about intrinsic Russian ground combat power.
These generalizationsintegrating deployment capacity and combat capability-could be used to create a ground combat power projection model that could be applied to many different scenarios.
