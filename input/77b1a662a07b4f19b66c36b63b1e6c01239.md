Third, the United States should extend the multi-domain exercises to include allies and coalition nations that have the possibility of fighting together in a future war based on the threat priorities.
At this evolving stage of the multi-domain approach to operations, it is critical to experiment with multiple scenarios and take lessons to improve the capabilities and interoperability.
Exercises focused on China and Russia are surely priorities for the United States; however, exercises focused on other threats mentioned in the MDO concept, such as Iran and North Korea, are equally important because countries do not always get the war they want.
Experimenting with the multi-domain approach to counter North Korean threats during regular ROK-US combined exercises can be an option as well.
Using these kinds of exercises, various lessons can be learned and applied to the future development of the concept and doctrines.
