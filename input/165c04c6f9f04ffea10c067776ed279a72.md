If Hitler had died in the July 1944 attempted coup but the coup members had not overthrown the Nazi party then it is highly unlikely that WWII would have been concluded in the summer of 1944.
Goebels, Goring, Himmler and many others were quite cable of carrying on the Nazi cause to the bitter end.
Similarly, Soviet Russia did not end with the death of Stalin, Vietnam did not end its war when Ho Chi Minh died, Communist China is still around despite Mao's passing, and North Korea did not implode with the death of Kim D-Sung.
Nazi Germany and the German people only changed when the Nazi party was systematically excised from post war Germany and the country was completely occupied and dismembered by the Allies.
It was the elimination of the Nazi party and the occupation of the Germany that was required to permanently change the political landscape.
