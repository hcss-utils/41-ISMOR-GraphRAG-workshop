For example, in 2015, Russian Minister of Defense Sergey Shoigu observed "a consistent expansion of NATO.
In a relatively short time, it has almost doubled with 12 members.
Currently, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, and Ukraine are actively preparing to join the block, while Finland, Sweden, Serbia, and Moldova are being involved in its sphere of influence."
In 2019, Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, General Valerii Gerasimov, echoed Shoigu's sentiment before the Academy of Military Sciences, stating, "Today, Washington is continuing along a path of expanding its system of military presence near the borders of Russia and of destroying the system of treaty relations on issues of limiting and destroying arms, which are leading toward the disruption of strategic stability."
