Continuity in Russia's development of ground capabilities is likely, including a focus on long-range strike, C4ISR, and rapidly deployable forces.
However, there could be changes in the factors involving energy prices and economic growth or in Russia's relations with the West or China that could give Russia incentives to pursue different ground combat capabilities.
The potential outcomes of these options offer insights for the range of different future Russian military capabilities.
In general, we continue to expect a prioritization of capabilities associated with strategic deterrence, regional dominance, and internal security.
