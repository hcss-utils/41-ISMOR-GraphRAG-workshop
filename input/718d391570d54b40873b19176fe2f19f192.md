Our opponents in various parts of the world know 4GW is the only kind of war America has ever lost.
And they know we have lost three times: Vietnam, Lebanon, and Somalia.
This form of warfare has also defeated the French in Vietnam and Algeria and the USSR in Afghanistan.
It continues to bleed Russia in Chechnya and the U.S. in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other areas where we are engaged in the global war on terror.
This record of defeat of major powers by much weaker fourth-generation opponents makes it essential to understand this new form of warfare and adapt accordingly.
