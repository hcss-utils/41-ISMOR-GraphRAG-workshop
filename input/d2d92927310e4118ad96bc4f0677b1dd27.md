The central challenge to U.S. prosperity and security is the reemergence of long-term, strategic competition by what the [NSS] classifies as revisionist powers.
It is increasingly clear that China and Russia want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model-gaining veto authority over other nations' economic, diplomatic, and security decisions.

The result is a return to great-power politics and a balance-of-power approach to dealing with the world's most formidable and consolidated governments-a far cry from the challenges posed by state weakness.
