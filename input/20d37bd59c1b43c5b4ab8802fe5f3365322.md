Contemporary Russian proxy support prior to the outbreak of largescale conflict in Ukraine in 2022 demonstrated some parallels to that of the Soviet Union, but its means and methods differed considerably.
The network of ideologically aligned Communist parties and related organizations that undergirded Soviet proxy interventions lacks a present-day counterpart.
But post-Soviet Russia's lack of ideological commitment also provides flexibility, and Moscow has shown itself able to use proxy warfare to pursue its geopolitical interests by exploiting tools that the Soviet Union would not, such as PMCs.
Russian successes in the Middle East show that Russia can be a force to be reckoned with even when it is far from its traditional sphere of influence.
Yet, it remains to be seen how Russia's large-scale conflict with Ukraine beginning in 2022 will both illustrate and impact Russian capabilities in this regard over the long term.
