What remains to the Army is a choice of which threats for which to prepare.
The thesis of this monograph argues that major combat operations is the correct choice for preeminence in Army preparedness because high-end hybrid threats-like Iran, North Korea, Hezbollah and the Chechen rebels-present more of an existential threat to the U.S. and its interests and allies than those posed by terrorist groups, nuclear proliferation or failing states.
And, even when the U.S. ground forces are required to engage the latter, it is their expertise in major combat operations skills which provide initial access and credibility.
Currently there are few, if any, military forces in the world with the combat credibility of the U.S. Army.
It is this skill and credibility that led to the success in Afghanistan in 2001,   Iraq in 2003, and Haiti, Bosnia, and Kosovo, among other areas, in the 1990s.
Juxtapose those American successes with the perceived U.S. Army failure during combat operations in Somalia as an example of the consequences of failing in MCO tasks; the consequences of not maintaining that preparedness are readily apparent and amplified by the experience of the Russians in Chechnya and the Israelis in Lebanon.
