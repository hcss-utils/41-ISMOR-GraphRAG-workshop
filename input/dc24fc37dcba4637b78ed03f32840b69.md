This report documents the results of a project that assessed the reasons why counterinsurgents in the developing world so often adopt counterinsurgency strategies and practices at odds with U.S. preferences and how the United States can influence its potential partners' choices in these conflicts.
xiv Countering Others' Insurgencies When pursuing partnerships with regimes that are fighting insurgencies, however, the likelihood of success using such "small-footprint" approaches is inextricably bound with the local context and particularly the nature of the partner government. Too often the importance of local context is minimized in discussions of U.S. security strategy, particularly in relation to the problems of fragile states. Proponents of small-footprint and indirect approaches overwhelmingly cite as models the recent U.S. operations in the Philippines and Colombia-without providing any indication of the generalizability of these models.
This study seeks to understand the extent to which the "success stories" of U.S. partnerships such as those with the Philippines and Colombia can be generalized-or, phrased differently, to understand the conditions under which the small-footprint model is likely to succeed in bringing an end to an insurgency that both the United States and its partner seek to combat. It explores how local circumstances shape the "art of the possible" in such partnerships and how the United States can best maximize the potential and minimize the risks of these often uneasy alliances. More specifically, the study asks three central questions:
• Why do counterinsurgents adopt particular counterinsurgency strategies and practices? • What are the likely consequences of these strategies, in terms of conflict outcomes and civilian casualties? • When the United States finds a partner government's counterinsurgency strategy and practices problematic, what can it do to influence its partner's actions to improve the chances of a favorable outcome?
The answers to these questions provided in this report are derived from a mixed-method research design incorporating both quantitative and qualitative analysis. Simple statistical analyses are applied to a dataset of counterinsurgencies that have terminated since the end of the Cold 
Counterinsurgency is perhaps the most context-dependent activity in which militaries engage. Consequently, no universal set of policy prescriptions is possible. A few broad rules of thumb can nonetheless be discerned.
First, where U.S. and partner-nation interests fundamentally diverge, there is little hope of a productive partnership to combat an insurgency. The amount of U.S. leverage and information is too small for conditionality to be used effectively to overcome the divergence.
Second, conditionality can reasonably be used to enforce "redlines," where the United States would be willing to walk away from a partner if the partner crossed certain thresholds of acceptable behavior, or to press for a limited number of important but narrowly scoped reforms, or to take advantage of specific moments in time when more wide-ranging political change is possible. In most cases, however, it is extremely unlikely that conditionality can be used to press for morefundamental transformations of partner nations in accordance with U.S.-preferred models of counterinsurgency.
Third, given the duration of most contemporary insurgencies and the length of time it typically takes to build state capacity or institutionalize mechanisms of political inclusion, the United States should enter into partnerships with the expectation that they will be long-term and will have relatively low odds of success in the short-to-medium term. Decisionmakers should carefully weigh their ability to make such long-term commitments, particularly where potential partner nations are problematic. With the memories of the September 11, 2001, attacks fading and public attention no longer monopolized by the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, decisionmakers should expect more critical scrutiny of such light-footprint engagements.
Beyond these broad rules of thumb, a number of specific mechanisms may be useful to manage partnerships with difficult partner regimes. Such mechanisms include the following:
• The United States can help partner regimes credibly commit to political compromises with reconcilable elements of the armed opposition through a variety of instruments, potentially including large-scale commitments of foreign aid and, in some contexts, international peace operations. • Progress toward greater democracy is normally heavily contested, usually occurring only when incumbents are unable to resist demands for greater political inclusion. Periods of prolonged military stalemate in a civil war may provide such openings. In these cases, political reforms are less about alleviating popular grievances and winning the general population's hearts and minds in order to defeat insurgents. Rather, they are about providing a framework in which reconcilable opposition leaders come to believe they can participate with minimal fears of persecution or marginalization. These processes typically do not look like Western conceptions of "democracy," at least for many years, often two decades or more. But they can provide-and often have provided-a means for ending violent conflicts. Such fragile political systems require support in their initiation phase, and they require buttressing to prevent collapse. The United States and other international partner nations can help in both of these phases. • The United States should make the principle of civilian oversight and other accountability mechanisms central to its security-sector assistance. As a general rule, the United States should also stress quality over quantity in developing partners' security forces. This finding highlights the importance of imparting the necessary doctrine, leadership, discipline, and (where appropriate) technology to manageable numbers of partner-nation forces and then sustaining these qualitative improvements. Wherever possible,
xx Countering Others' Insurgencies partner-nation units receiving such assistance should be closely paired with U.S. forces to ensure that the United States has visibility into how its assistance is being used. • Security forces that do not include members of the same ethnic or religious affiliation as the population in which they are operating are at particularly high risk of abusive behavior. The United States, therefore, should work with partner regimes to improve the representativeness of their security services. Unfortunately, incorporating personnel from disaffected populations during the course of intensive fighting risks subversion within these forces.
The ideal time to integrate personnel from different communities, therefore, is before fighting erupts or, if that is not possible, as early within a conflict as possible. • Unfortunately, all of the above prescriptions are long-term and uncertain. Moreover, they are all substantially more difficult to implement during ongoing fighting than in peacetime. These challenges suggest that security-sector reform efforts should be a central element of U.S. "phase-zero," or peacetime, engagement strategy, not a peripheral concern or an issue to which significant resources are devoted only after a crisis erupts.

With the United States exhausted by more than a decade of war and facing severe fiscal limitations, decisionmakers are striving to place American defense policy on a more sustainable footing. Central to this effort is a commitment to work through partner nations wherever possible, providing support to countries with which the United States shares interests or values while also ensuring that the primary responsibility for these nations' security remains their own. Thus the document that currently guides U.S. defense policy states:
Building partnership capacity elsewhere in the world . . . remains important for sharing the costs and responsibilities of global leadership. Across the globe we will seek to be the security partner of choice, pursuing new partnerships with a growing number of nations. . . . Whenever possible, we will develop innovative, low-cost, and small-footprint approaches to achieve our security objectives.

affected states. Such states increase the risk of spillover conflicts throughout the region in which they occur, damage the economies of neighboring states, contribute to flourishing transnational crime networks, spread pandemic disease, and foster transnational terrorism. Yet U.S. interests in such states are seldom substantial enough to warrant large-scale interventions.
In many ways, this guidance encapsulates what has become the dominant sentiment within the U.S. defense community. Many of the best-known thinkers in this community have advocated "smallfootprint" approaches to stabilizing fragile states over the past several years, and such thinking has become dominant within the Department of Defense. 
2
The likelihood of success using the small-footprint, or indirect, approach in such circumstances is inextricably bound with the local context and particularly the nature of the partner government. Where the partner government is hopelessly corrupt, abusive toward its own population, or incompetent and ineffective, or where the partner government is pursuing goals that diverge significantly from those of the United States, the small-footprint approach can become deeply problematic.

Too often, the importance of local context is minimized in discussions of U.S. security strategy, particularly in relation to the problems of fragile states. Proponents of small-footprint and indirect approaches, for instance, overwhelmingly cite as models the recent U.S. operations in the Philippines and Colombia, without ever providing any indica-tion of the generalizability of these models. 
6
This study examines U.S. partnerships with governments fighting counterinsurgencies-or, more specifically, the conditions under which the small-footprint model is likely to succeed in bringing an acceptable end to an insurgency that both the United States and its partner seek to combat. For the purposes of this analysis, an insurgency is essentially synonymous with a civil war and is defined as an armed conflict that pits the government and national army of an internationally recognized state against one or more armed opposition groups able to mount effective resistance against the state; the violence must be significant, causing more than a thousand deaths in relatively continual fighting that takes place within the country's boundaries; and the rebels must recruit mostly locally, controlling some part of the country's territory.

• Why do counterinsurgents adopt particular counterinsurgency strategies and practices?
• What are the likely consequences of these strategies, in terms of conflict outcomes and civilian casualties? • When the United States finds a partner government's counterinsurgency strategy and practices problematic, what can it do to influence the partner's actions to improve the chances of a favorable outcome?
The report's answers to these questions are derived from a mixedmethod research design incorporating both quantitative and qualitative analysis. In Chapter Two, the policy and academic literature on counterinsurgency is reviewed to determine core principles of counterinsurgency and key areas in which counterinsurgency practice differs among those who practice it. From this discussion, a typology of counterinsurgent regimes is derived to suggest how the characteristics of potential U.S. partner nations shape the strategic choices available to them. In Chapter Three, simple statistical analyses are applied to a dataset of counterinsurgencies that have terminated since the end of the Cold War (72 in all) to understand the manner in which these wars have been fought and the likely outcomes of wars fought by different types of counterinsurgent regimes.
This broad overview frames more in-depth analyses of two important recent U.S. partnerships, those with the Philippines and Pakistan (Chapters Four and Five, respectively). On the basis of the quantitative analysis, the Philippines was selected to represent a U.S. partnership in a promising environment. Pakistan was selected to represent a much more challenging environment for the small-footprint approach. These case studies combine insights from secondary literature, a wide variety of quantitative data sources, and interviews conducted with several dozen government officials, military officers, and civil society actors in the Philippines, Pakistan, and the United States.
In Chapter Six, the implications of the quantitative analysis and case studies for U.S. partnership strategies are discussed. Two broad partnership strategies are outlined, along with a number of specific mechanisms for managing difficult partnerships. The chapter concludes with a summary of the implications of the research findings for U.S. foreign and security policy.
The report makes three central arguments, all of which represent potentially important contributions to our understanding of counterinsurgency and U.S. partnership strategies.
First, although there are certain universal (or near-universal) principles that can be extracted from Western counterinsurgency doctrine, not every counterinsurgent is equally capable of implementing these principles. Understanding context-and in particular, the characteristics of the counterinsurgent regime-is critically important to understanding the wide variety of counterinsurgency strategies and practices that can be observed throughout the world.
Second, the "success stories" of U.S. light-footprint interventions (especially in Colombia and the Philippines) represent relatively promising types of partner nations. Unfortunately, only about one in eight counterinsurgencies in the post-Cold War period has been fought by a regime that scores as highly on critical characteristics as do Colombia and the Philippines. The vast majority of regimes fighting insurgencies have much less-favorable characteristics, and consequently, their chances of pursuing a counterinsurgency strategy compatible with U.S. preferences are much lower. We should not generalize from U.S. experiences in Colombia and the Philippines and assume that similar indirect approaches will work elsewhere; in fact, the odds are against such successes.
Finally, except in rare circumstances, the United States is unlikely to be able to exert sufficient leverage on partner nations to induce the regimes to undertake transformational reforms. Recognizing the limits of its influence, the United States should avoid committing to certain partner nations altogether. Where U.S. security interests are such that it cannot afford to remain disengaged, there are options the United States can pursue to induce more modest changes in its partners' counterinsurgency practices. These alternative approaches are all problematic, but in the conditions that characterize a substantial portion of potential U.S. partners, they are the best that can realistically be adopted.
This study examines the strategies and practices that regimes adopt when fighting insurgencies. Other studies have examined the strategies and practices that counterinsurgents supposedly should adopt, and still others have focused on how external powers can help to provide them the capabilities with which to conduct counterinsurgency. Surprisingly, few studies have systematically examined how regimes actually do practice counterinsurgency.

The existing policy literature is focused overwhelmingly on the experience of the United States and other Western nations. The ends and means of counterinsurgency are frequently taken as a given, leading quickly to a narrow focus on operations and tactics. Such a focus is understandable: Over the past decade, the United States has faced the urgent task of dealing with its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As the United States plans for the drawdown of its military presence in Afghanistan and contemplates a wider range of light-footprint "shaping" activities throughout the world, however, it is important for the defense community to broaden its perspective.

The current official U.S. doctrine on counterinsurgency represents an enormous evolution from the thinking that predominated a decade ago.

Counterinsurgency is often conflated with a particular way of war-exemplified, for example, by the "hearts-and-minds" approach so often advocated in the Western counterinsurgency community. Yet by itself, counterinsurgency is simply a type of military operation, and it is conducted differently by different countries. 
5
Unfortunately, most of the policy literature on counterinsurgency offers little insight into how developing countries have fought their own insurgencies. It generally suffers from a bias toward Western or other external interventions, largely to the neglect of indigenous incumbents departments and agencies. Unlike U.S. Department of the Army, Field Manual (FM) 3-24, the Counterinsurgency Guide is more forward-looking and examines the conditions under which the United States should engage in future counterinsurgencies abroad. Five levels of involvement spanning the gamut from the deployment of a single advisor to a robust direct intervention are discussed. In addition, the U.S. Army is taking the lead on drafting a revision to FM 3-24 and has invited feedback from a wide range of scholars, practitioners, and operators. As of this writing, the estimated date of publication is December 2013.
10 Countering Others' Insurgencies (that is, regimes fighting insurgencies within their own countries). Such regimes constitute roughly 81 percent of the post-1945 counterinsurgencies and 97 percent of those since 1990, yet the literature typically focuses on counterinsurgency conducted by foreign militaries. 
6
Perhaps the greatest departure between the classic-counterinsurgency literature and the recent track record of insurgencies in the developing world is the former's focus on institution-building and attaining a monopoly on violence. Political elites equipped with limited resources engage in cost-benefit analysis to determine what they consider to be an acceptable outcome. This calculus often results in policies aimed more at mitigating the harm caused by an insurgency than at achieving a decisive defeat. As Paul Staniland contends, "Informal bargains, collusive state-insurgent relationships, and shared sovereignty are often less costly and more enduring than trying to build strong states, an endeavor that integrally involves coercion, extraction, and centralization."

Soldiers who have actually had to fight in counterinsurgencies often claim that all insurgencies are unique; no lessons can be universally applied, because the circumstances of each conflict are so different. 
9
Three principles of counterinsurgency characterize the predominant Western approach:
• The counterinsurgent regime should seek accommodationincluding opportunities for participation in the governance of the country-with the reconcilable armed opposition. • The counterinsurgent regime should use violence discriminately (i.e., should avoid harming the general civilian population) when targeting the irreconcilable opposition, or "hard core," of the insurgency. • The counterinsurgent regime should provide public goods (including both security and various social services such as education and health care) to disaffected populations in order to ensure their loyalty and prevent their support of insurgent groups.
These three principles have been articulated with remarkable consistency from the early "classics" of the Western counterinsurgency canon such as those of David Galula and Sir Robert Thompson through to the recent U.S. field manual on counterinsurgency, FM 3-24. 
10
The third principle-the requirement to provide public goods to the general population-has much less universal applicability. Indeed, Western counterinsurgency thinking has in many ways been hampered by a focus on a state-building model overly influenced by the European experience.
The need to bring the reconcilable opposition into the political process has long been recognized, but its importance has increased in recent decades as the dynamics of insurgencies have changed.
Insurgencies endure much longer than they once did: The average duration of civil wars in the period immediately after World War 
10
II was only approximately two years, but by the post-Cold War era, their duration had risen to about 15 years. 
11
12
These conflicts are also extremely damaging to the countries in which they are fought-so much so that they have been described as "development in reverse." 
13
Moreover, insurgencies have extremely damaging consequences beyond the borders of the country originally affected: They generally increase the risk of spillover conflicts throughout the region in which they occur, damage the economies of neighboring states, contribute to flourishing transnational crime networks, spread pandemic disease, and foster transnational terrorism. 
14
Given these trends, it is not surprising that a growing proportion of internal conflicts end in negotiated settlements, cease-fires, or stalemates. Whereas the vast majority of civil wars in the decades after World War II ended in military victory for one side or the other, now only a minority do. 
16
Determining which segments of the opposition are reconcilable is, of course, rarely a straightforward matter. Groups with limited, clearly defined political objectives seldom need to resort to insurgency in the first place against governments that are willing to accommodate the reconcilable opposition. In most cases, reaching accommodation with insurgents is instead achieved through an iterated process of fighting and talking. As the costs of continued fighting become clear, the outlines of an acceptable compromise begin to emerge-at least for those warring parties whose minimum acceptable outcomes are compatible with one another's. In many conflicts, however, portions of the opposition have minimum acceptable outcomes that will never coincide with the government's. Any accommodation with these parties is inevitably tactical-a pause before renewed hostilities.

There is strong support for the notion that government use of force usually must be discriminate to be successful. 
18
19
While there is a consensus of opinion on the first two elements of classical Western counterinsurgency doctrine, there is no such consensus on the need for the state to provide public goods to its population as 
18 Paul et al., 2013;
Paul, Clarke, and Grill, 2010
This claim challenges much recent orthodoxy on counterinsurgency and "good practice" for fragile states. The U.S. Army's doctrine for stabilizing fragile states, for instance, charges the Army with helping the host nation provide health care and education and assert control over the illicit economy.

As long as control over resources is divided equitably between the regime and the armed opposition, the record of civil-war termination suggests that insurgencies can be brought to a satisfactory end without extending the state's reach. Indeed, many peace deals are predicated on informal understandings and a tacit acknowledgment by state leaders that the regime will exercise little effective control in remote regions. In Mali, for instance, the formal democratization and decentralization that underlay the peace that the country enjoyed from the latter 1990s until recently was accompanied with a more informal acceptance of the fact that the central state would exercise less control over even illegal activities in the north of the country.
Nevertheless, it is important to be clear about the limitations of such peace deals. They often prove less durable than more formal arrangements, in part because they typically provide few institutionalized conflict-resolution mechanisms between the warring communities.

Counterinsurgent regimes' strategies and practices can be understood in terms of the three principles discussed above: the political accommodation of the reconcilable armed opposition, the discriminate use of violence, and the provision of public goods to disaffected communities. As Figure 
2
More specifically, we can discern four different models or "ideal types" of strategies of particular interest: 27 
High Low High Low High Low 
27
1. Classic counterinsurgency. The classic Western approach to counterinsurgency emphasizes the three principles outlined above. It is not purely a hearts-and-minds approach in that it recognizes the importance of the well-targeted use of force, but it places stronger emphasis on an inclusive, capable, and accountable government than do the other strategies. This strategy is most often associated with the United Kingdom and the United States and, to a lesser degree, France-highly capable Western democracies. 2. Strong-state repression. On the opposite corner of the front side of the diagram in Figure 
2

Each of these approaches to counterinsurgency is potentially viable. Iraq under Saddam Hussein, for instance, was able to crush Kurdish and Shiite insurgencies through strong-state repression. Similarly, as will be discussed in greater detail in Chapter Five, Pakistan has relied on containment strategies in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) for decades. However, there is substantial evidence that the strategies in the upper right-hand corners of Figure 
2
The designation of these strategies as models or ideal types indicates that no country practices counterinsurgency in a "pure" form. Indeed, even the United Kingdom, perhaps the foremost proponent of the classic counterinsurgency strategy, has never truly practiced counterinsurgency as its doctrine would suggest. 
28
Given the considerable evidence that suggests that accommodating the reconcilable opposition and applying violence discriminately maximize a regime's chances of waging counterinsurgency successfully, why do all counterinsurgents not adopt this approach? The answer appears to be that not all regimes can apply these principles with equal success.
Both the policy and academic literatures suggest that two characteristics of a regime are particularly important in determining how it will prosecute counterinsurgency: its degree of political inclusion and the extent of its capacity.
These characteristics, as well as the extent of the regime's military superiority, lie at the center of the analysis in this section and in Chapter Three. Here, we explain why different types of counterinsurgent regimes are likely to adopt different counterinsurgency strategies and practices and discuss the likely implications of these choices for achieving negotiated settlements with the armed opposition and using force discriminately. Chapter Three examines the record of the past two decades to determine the extent to which the characteristics of counterinsurgent regimes can explain outcomes in these wars. As will be seen, those characteristics shape the ability of the United States to positively influence regimes' counterinsurgency practices.
The first critical characteristic of counterinsurgent regimes, political inclusiveness, is understood here as the extent to which organized political actors are afforded opportunities to meaningfully influence the formulation and execution of public policies. 
29
A central lesson to be learned from both the policy and academic literatures is that non-democratic regimes find it difficult to accommodate elements of the armed opposition. There are at least two reasons why more-democratic regimes find it easier to accommodate the reconcilable opposition:
• Breadth of coalitions. Non-democratic regimes are often based on narrow coalitions that would be highly threatened by major concessions to the opposition, even if top leaders wanted to compromise. 30 • Ability to make credible commitments. Non-democratic regimes may be willing to make concessions, and there may be sufficient areas of mutual agreement between the regime and the armed opposition to make a peace deal possible. But the regime may find it difficult to convince the opposition of the credibility of its commitment to compromise due to a lack of institutionalized "hand-tying" mechanisms. 
31
If more-democratic regimes are in fact better able to accommodate the reconcilable opposition, we should see a number of patterns in the way wars terminate. More-democratic regimes should be better able to broker formal peace deals with the armed opposition. Consequently, unless their record of military victory is poorer than that of less-democratic regimes, they should also be more capable of securing a favorable outcome-that is, either a victory or a formally negotiated settlement that meets at least the minimum demands of all parties.

Settlement," International Organization, Vol. 51, No. 3, Summer 1997;
Kenneth A. Schultz, Democracy and Coercive Diplomacy, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2001. 32
There is also reason to believe that greater political inclusion restricts a regime's ability to use violence indiscriminately. The relationship is greatly tempered, however, by the fact that counterinsurgency is typically a particularly brutal form of conflict-a fact that not even the best-intentioned regimes can escape.
Numerous examples exist of public opinion restraining democracies' use of violence in expeditionary counterinsurgency. 
33
• Transparency and public accountability. Democracies have robust civil societies, including a free press and advocacy organizations, that can expose brutal and repressive practices carried out by the regime. They also have numerous channels through which citizens can express their preferences and hold government leaders accountable. • Executive constraints. Democracies typically diffuse executive power and more effectively constrain executive autonomy than do autocracies, providing more opportunities for other sectors of the government to restrain abusive security services. 
34
34
Research, Vol. 44, No. 2, 2007, pp. 233-246. 35
Evidence about lesser forms of indiscriminate violence is more mixed. Although "consolidated democracies" are generally agreed to be the least likely form of government to conduct violent repression, what have alternatively been labeled "intermediate," "hybrid," or "illiberal" democracies may be as likely as autocracies to engage in such acts. 
36
The second critical characteristic of the counterinsurgent is state capacity-what Samuel Huntington called the degree rather than the type of government. 
37
• Provision of public goods. Both U.S. counterinsurgency doctrine and academic studies suggest that governments gain the support of their populations through the widespread and effective provision of public goods such as public sanitation and health services, physical infrastructure (e.g., roads and bridges), and education. 
38
39
• Sustainment and discipline. Strong, capable states are more likely to be able to pay their forces regularly and provide them with necessary supplies and other material support, and they are more likely to be able to effectively monitor the performance of their agents in the field and discipline personnel who behave in abusive, predatory, or counterproductive ways.

Counterinsurgency is, in the end, a form of warfare. The quality of governance provided by the regime is critical, but without the requisite military capabilities, governance is inadequate. Violent conflict emerges precisely because the parties to the conflict cannot find a mutually acceptable solution to their disagreements within existing political mechanisms. Even if the government improves the quality of its governance during the course of an insurgency, a political solution that does not sacrifice core government interests requires at a minimum a military stalemate, if not the clear superiority of the governing forces. 
42
The examination of counterinsurgents' characteristics and their consequences suggests four broad generalizations about their likely behavior:
• Regimes that are more politically inclusive and have higher degrees of state capacity are more likely to adopt the classical approach to counterinsurgency. • Regimes that are more politically inclusive but possess only weak state capacity are more likely to adopt informal accommodation as their predominant strategy. • Regimes that are less politically inclusive and have higher degrees of state capacity are more likely to engage in strong-state repression. • Regimes that are less politically inclusive and possess weak state capacity are more likely to pursue containment strategies.
These generalizations are summarized in Table 
2
Predictions are not particularly helpful, however, without indicators of the key causal variables-we need to know how to characterize a particular regime before we can predict what its likely behavior will be. Fortunately, considerable efforts have been made to measure the key characteristics of counterinsurgent regimes by the academic and research communities. While all of the measures have been criticized, they provide a reasonable approximation of the underlying concepts. Moreover, from a more practical perspective, each of the measures can predict regime behavior, as demonstrated in Chapter Three.
The first key characteristic of counterinsurgent regimes, their degree of political inclusion, can be approximated with the Freedom House index of democracy, using the midpoint of the Freedom House scale as the basis for distinguishing between more-and less-inclusive regimes. 
43
We rely on two indications of the second critical determinant of counterinsurgency strategies and practices, state capacity. One may be called state reach, the ability of the state to exercise influence within society. States with poor state reach are characterized by "low state penetration and capacity; a rural, scattered settlement structure; and poor communications."

A "hearts and minds" counterinsurgency campaign places the focus on the people, the military consequences of which are requirements for population control measures and local security of the population. Population control measures and local security both demand security force numbers proportional to the population.

Consequently, we have had to rely strictly on numbers of government military forces. 
49
Together, these variables can explain a great deal about why counterinsurgents adopt particular counterinsurgency strategies and practices. Table

In this chapter, we quantitatively assesses the extent of the relationship between regime characteristics and patterns of conflict termination and use of indiscriminate violence. More specifically, we use the simple statistical technique of cross-tabulation to assess the historical record of all the insurgencies that have taken place in the post-Cold War eraa total of 89 cases, of which 17 were ongoing as of 2008 (the last year in our dataset)

• Decisive war termination, including both government victories and negotiated settlements • Durable peace • Indiscriminate use of force by the regime (i.e., large-scale violence directed against non-combatants).
We use as transparent a method as possible so that readers can understand exactly how the results were derived, which cases were influential in driving those results, and how they relate to the case studies presented later in this report. 
2
The following two sections explain why regimes' political inclusiveness, state capacity, and military superiority shape their ability to accommodate the reconcilable opposition and use violence discriminately, as well as the implications of these practices for favorable termination of insurgencies. A final section integrates the quantitative analysis with the typology of counterinsurgent regimes introduced in Chapter Two to help decisionmakers understand the counterinsurgency strategies and practices that potential partner nations are likely to adopt.
It is extremely difficult to assess the general record of governments' success in negotiating with elements of armed opposition. Many deals exist informally. Some are made with individuals or small groups of insurgents-side deals so minor that there is often no historical record of them.
We can, however, learn a great deal about governments' abilities to accommodate the reconcilable opposition by looking at processes of war termination. Wars can end in a number of ways: through military victory by the government; military victory by the insurgents; a military stalemate followed by a formal, comprehensive peace agreement between the warring parties that clearly delineates the terms of the post-conflict order; or a military stalemate followed by informal, tacit agreements. As Table

This discussion provides a baseline estimate for a regime's likelihood of success in counterinsurgency following the core counterinsurgency principles discussed in Chapter Two.
The record of all conflicts that have terminated in the post-Cold War era strongly supports the notion that more-democratic countries are much better able than less-democratic countries to accommodate armed opposition movements without sacrificing core interests.

Similarly, more-democratic countries are better able to achieve an acceptable decisive outcome-that is, an end to an internal war in which the government either wins an outright military victory or is able to reach a formally negotiated peace agreement with the armed opposition that guarantees each side's core interests in the absence of military victory for either side.

Finally, more-democratic countries appear better able to sustain peace in the aftermath of civil wars. As Figure

likely to achieve negotiated settlements to conflicts, and they are more likely to sustain peace. These relationships, however, are insufficient to be statistically significant. Nevertheless, counterinsurgents with strong state capacity are nearly twice as likely as weaker states to achieve an acceptable conflict outcome (i.e., either an outright military victory by the government or a formally negotiated peace deal in which both sides are able to secure their core interests). As shown in Figure

Consistent with the findings in Chapter Two, data from the post-Cold War era suggest an ambiguous relationship between a government's military capacity and conflict outcomes. High force-to-population ratios and high force-to-force ratios are associated with somewhat better odds of a government victory, but the difference between more and less militarily-capable governments is not sufficient to be statistically significant in nearly any of the specifications we examined. 18

The first possibility flies in the face of U.S. military doctrine and the writings of many of the most respected counterinsurgency theorists. The possibility should not be dismissed, however. As discussed in the Chapter Two, counterinsurgency warfare has changed profoundly in the past few decades due to the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, changes in funding streams, the spread of guerrilla tactics, and a radically altered international context, among other reasons. Whereas military victory was the norm in the decades following World War II, a minority of insurgencies terminate in victory today. It is possible that although they are still important, military means simply do not exercise the same degree of influence on conflict outcomes that they once did.
It is also possible that our methods are inadequate to capture the relationship between military capacity and conflict outcomes. In particular, it could be that especially dangerous insurgencies cause governments to build large security forces. In this case, our results could be biased by adverse selection: The countries with particularly difficult insurgencies would create large security forces, leading to an apparently inverse relationship between the size of the forces and success in battling insurgencies. Such biases may be particularly apparent when using force-to-population ratios. Our use of the force-to-force measure, however, should at least partially alleviate this concern. Insofar as the number of insurgents is an indication of the threat they pose to the government, force-to-force ratios automatically control for the possibility of adverse selection. Force-to-force ratios, however, also failed to reveal any consistent relationship between military superiority and the ability to secure favorable outcomes.
Finally, and perhaps most plausibly, the lack of a statistically significant relationship between military capacity and conflict outcomes could be driven by our measure of military superiority. Force ratios capture only the number of government forces. They say nothing about their equipment; their tactics, techniques and procedures; or their dis-cipline and accountability. It may well be that a more holistic measure of military sufficiency-if one were available-would reveal a much stronger relationship with conflict outcomes. This "quality over quantity" argument is entirely plausible, and it also has significant implications for U.S. partnership policies-a point to which the discussion will return later in this report.
The second overarching principle of counterinsurgency is that the use of force must be discriminate; otherwise, ordinary citizens have nothing to gain by not supporting the insurgency. To better understand when regimes are likely to employ violence indiscriminately in the prosecution of a counterinsurgency, we examined the relationship between democracy, state capacity, and force sufficiency on the one hand and intentional mass killings of civilians by government forces on the other.
Data on deaths in war zones-especially data on civilian deaths in an insurgency environment-are notoriously elusive. Wary of unwarranted precision and of missing important cases of indiscriminate violence, most studies of this issue have relied on a dichotomous coding of mass killings (i.e., a simple yes-or-no categorization) with a low threshold, so that even relatively low levels of civilian deaths are enough to count as mass killings or indiscriminate violence. The problem with such an approach is that it typically finds that nearly all governments engage in some degree of indiscriminate violence during counterinsurgency. 
21
Counterinsurgencies are "dirty wars." It also fails to distinguish horrific campaigns of violence from much lower levels of abuse. This report adopts a somewhat higher threshold: Intentionally killing 2,000 or more civilians per year throughout the course of an entire counterinsurgency is considered mass killing or truly indiscriminate violence. 
22
Based on this standard, data from the past two decades strongly support the contention that democratic accountability mechanisms are critical to preventing indiscriminate violence. The relationship between military sufficiency and the discriminate use of force is much more complex-a finding with implications that will be discussed in the case studies in Chapters Four and Five.
A broad review of the historical record of the past two decades strongly supports the claim that democratic accountability is critically important to preventing abuses and atrocities by government forces. Only two relatively democratic countries (fewer than 10 percent of the total) engaged in mass killings of civilians during the course of counterinsurgency campaigns in this period. 
23
24
As discussed in Chapter Two, state capacity might influence a regime's proclivity toward indiscriminate violence in two ways: Weak states may be more likely to use indiscriminate violence because they lack sufficient positive inducements to persuade discontented populations to side with them, or they may be more likely to engage in abuses because they lack sufficient oversight and control over their fielded forces. The state-reach variable is probably a better choice of measures to test the argument that weak regimes rely excessively on "sticks" because they have too few "carrots." The government-effectiveness variable is probably more appropriate for assessing the extent to which more-capable governments are able sustain more-disciplined forces in the field.
The state-reach variable does not reveal any clear relationship between state reach and indiscriminate violence.

An examination of the relationship between force ratios and mass killings of civilians produces seemingly inconsistent results. Force-to-force ratios provide apparent support for the claim that less-capable regimes resort to indiscriminate violence in desperation, lacking the military 50 Countering Others' Insurgencies means to implement more-precise counterinsurgency campaigns.

Much is at stake in parsing these alternative explanations. If the first explanation is true, the appropriate policy response may well be to build stronger security sectors to weaken insurgents. If the second explanation is correct, such a policy would pour oil on the fire.
Unfortunately, the simple quantitative techniques used here do not allow us to determine which of these rival explanations is correct. Even the most sophisticated statistical techniques would provide only partial insight into this question. 
31
So far, the quantitative analysis has proceeded by examining each of the relevant factors in isolation. If we return to the typology of counterinsurgent regimes presented in Table

Because neither measure of military sufficiency proved to have a statistically significant effect on conflict outcomes, this variable was not included in the typology of counterinsurgent regimes.
Grouping cases of insurgency in this way is revealing. Counterinsurgent regimes that are both relatively more politically inclusive and have higher levels of state capacity (as measured using the state-reach index) are almost exactly twice as likely to reach an acceptable outcome as regimes that are neither inclusive nor have reasonably high levels of state capacity. The most-effective regimes-those that are both relatively inclusive and have high levels of state capacity-achieved an acceptable outcome in counterinsurgencies in the post-Cold War era 87 percent of the time. The least-effective regimes-those that are neither politically inclusive nor have high levels of state capacity-secured acceptable outcomes to such conflicts 40 percent of the time, less than half the rate of the most-effective counterinsurgents. Expressed another way, regimes that are neither politically inclusive nor have high levels of state capacity are nearly five times as likely as inclusive, high-capacity regimes to fail to secure either a military victory or a formally negotiated peace deal that is acceptable to all parties.
Once again, it is important to recognize that the successful U.S. small-footprint operations cited in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review and elsewhere-Colombia, El Salvador, and the Philippinesall occurred in countries with the best possible type of counterinsurgent regime. But the United States has also launched small-scale interventions in many less-promising environments-for example, in Somalia and Yemen-and it is anticipating a small-scale intervention in Afghanistan after 2014.

Of course, just because more than half of all insurgencies occur in countries governed by the least-favorable type of regime, this does not mean that more than half of all U.S. military interventions are likely to occur in such countries. Indeed, the historical record suggests that a disproportionate share of U.S. military interventions-somewhere in the vicinity of half-occur in best-case environments.

More-inclusive regimes are not only better able to broker negotiated peace deals, they are also better able to sustain a peace once it is achieved. Of particular interest, among low-capacity regimes, those that are more inclusive demonstrate significantly better odds of remaining at peace for at least five years after an insurgency ends. Indeed, as Figure

Discriminate Use of Violence Table 3.3 shows the relationship between regime characteristics and mass killings of civilians by the government. Just as weak and noninclusive regimes are less likely to terminate insurgencies on favorable either the conflict or the post-conflict periods, the relationship between political inclusion and negotiated settlements becomes considerably stronger. 
Durable peace, no resumption of conflict within five years terms, they are also less likely to use violence discriminately.

This typology of counterinsurgent regimes and the quantitative analysis of counterinsurgency in the post-Cold War era not only provides a broad overview of counterinsurgency practice, it also informed our selection of cases for in-depth study.
Drawing on well-established social science methods, we chose cases that exhibit significant variation on the causal variables of interest.

It would be wrong, however, to think of the Philippines and Pakistan as only two cases. Perhaps even more revealing than the contrasts between them are the differences in counterinsurgency strategy and practice that can be observed over time and between regions within each of them. The case-study chapters that follow therefore examine how changes in political inclusiveness over time and differences in state reach from one subregion to another in each country have shaped these regimes' policy choices.
The case studies also provide important insights into the effectiveness of U.S. assistance to counterinsurgent regimes. If the findings of our analyses are correct, counterinsurgency practices and outcomes are largely a reflection of the character of counterinsurgent regimes. U.S. assistance designed to improve the capabilities of partner nations' secu-rity forces is thus unlikely to produce superior outcomes unless these capabilities are harnessed to an appropriate counterinsurgency strategy. The choice of counterinsurgency strategy, in turn, should-at least in part-reflect a potential partner regime's inclusivity and civil capacity. American assistance, in other words, might play an important role in strengthening the counterinsurgency capabilities of a regime that is already predisposed to a classical counterinsurgency model, but it is unlikely to be able to induce a partner government to change its basic orientation toward counterinsurgency. Chapters Four and Five show that these predictions have generally been fulfilled in the Philippines and Pakistan. Chapter Six turns to the broader literature on counterinsurgency and development to suggest that the experiences of these two countries are generalizable, but also to explore ways in which the United States might adapt to its limited ability to influence events on the ground in such contexts.
The Philippines is often viewed by Americans as an archetypal counterinsurgency success story and the quintessential model for how effective partnerships can improve partner nations' conduct of counterinsurgency. In the post-9/11 Philippines, U.S. non-combat support, primarily through a light-footprint advise-and-assist role, has contributed to the severe degradation of terrorist groups such as the Abu Sayyaf Group (ASG) and Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and insurgent groups such as the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
This chapter examines counterinsurgency in the Philippines and how the United States has influenced its course. It analyzes Philippine approaches to counterinsurgency from the early Marcos period in the 1970s through the present, using the analytical framework in Chapter Two. It describes how key factors described in the analytical framework-political inclusivity, military superiority, and state capacity-have varied in the Philippines over time and vis-à-vis particular insurgent groups and, in turn, assesses the extent to which the presence or absence of these factors maps onto the discriminate use of force and the will and ability to successfully accommodate reconcilable groups or factions of groups.
It also examines how other case-specific contextual factors influenced these outcomes or, alternatively, influenced the presence or absence of the key explanatory variables. One such factor is the influence the United States has exerted over Philippine counterinsurgency practices, particularly in the post-9/11 era, in which it deployed a light-footprint military intervention that has simultaneously increased Philippine counterinsurgency capabilities and mitigated the Southeast Asia terrorist threat to the United States.
This case study suggests the utility of looking to the post-2001 Philippines as a possible model for influencing future counterinsurgencies in partner nations. But given that counterinsurgencies do not typically happen in the first place unless host-nation conditions are extremely poor, this period in Philippine history provided a decidedly favorable environment for a small-footprint intervention. As a result, OEF-P should not be considered a default model for cost-effective, indirect approaches, but rather as one among numerous possibilities. The case study shows that practitioners should also heed the lessons of previous Philippine counterinsurgency experiences-less-favorable environments in which the government's policies and practices were only partially consistent with overarching American preferences and in which the United States' influence was relatively limited or constrained. On balance, the broader record of Philippine counterinsurgency suggests as many warnings as it does models for the future.
The first section of this chapter presents a historical overview of counterinsurgency and counterterrorism in the Philippines. The next section analyzes the sources of the Philippine government's strategies and practices. We then assess the ways in which the United States was able to influence Philippine counterinsurgency strategy. The chapter concludes with broader lessons that can be learned from the Philippine experience.
For most of its post-independence history, the Philippines has been a democracy, albeit a fragile one characterized by political patronage and coalitions dominated by relatively narrow, parochial interests. Widespread poverty has hamstrung human development, and armed conflict has persisted since before the country's independence in 1946. Of the numerous factors that shape the environment in which insurgent and counterinsurgent forces currently contend in the Philippines, two in particular stand out: extreme ecological and societal diversity and a history of intractable, low-intensity conflict.
The Philippines is an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands and a variety of ethnic, tribal, and religious groups. Slightly larger than the state of Arizona, the Philippines has 300,000 square kilometers of territory and shares no land borders with other countries. It is the seventh most populated country in Asia and the twelfth most populated country in the world, with a population of more than 97 million.

The human terrain of the Philippines is also defined by its diversity. Tagalog is the predominant ethnic group, encompassing over 28 percent of the population. The next-largest group is the Cebuanos, at 13 percent. Perhaps the most striking fact about Philippine ethnic demographics is its fragmentation, as more than one-fourth of the Philippine population does not belong to any of the country's six largest ethnic groups.

Conflict has played a persistent role in the Philippine Islands for centuries. Dating at least to the beginning of the Philippines' encounter with Spain in 1521, irregular warfare has endured in the southern and other parts of the archipelago. After the United States took control of the Philippines in 1898, a nationalist resistance that had been active against Spain continued to violently resist U.S. rule. Following a bloody counterinsurgency campaign, the United States emerged victorious in 1902, but despite tamping down the Philippine nationalist resistance, it never fully quelled resistance throughout its new territorial holding; violent resistance from the Muslim Moro population in the southern Philippines was especially persistent.
In 1935, the Philippines was granted self-governing commonwealth status, with a plan put in place to transition the country to full independence in 1945. In the meantime, the Philippines became a key World War II location in the Pacific theater. In 1942, Japan occupied the islands, controlling the country until the United States, along with Filipino resistance forces, began to reclaim control in 1944 and regained control in 1945. Following Japan's surrender, the Republic of the Philippines attained independence in July 1946. A democratic government was elected to coincide with national independence. Manuel Roxas was elected the country's first president in 1946. Foreshadowing later periods on which we focus, the post-independence government was almost immediately threatened by armed insurgencies. Most threatening was the Hukbalahap, or "Huk," a communist insurgency that began a rebellion against the Roxas government in 1946 and was not defeated until 1954.

Today, the Philippines' main internal threats are the New People's Army (NPA), a communist insurgency that is active throughout the country; the MILF, an Islamist-separatist movement that is active in the south; and the ASG, a thuggish Salafi jihadist organization based in the southern provinces of Basilan and Sulu. The ASG has links to al Qaeda and JI but is equally well known for its high-profile criminal activities, including numerous kidnap-for-ransom operations targeting Westerners. None of the groups currently pose an existential threat to the GRP. They do, however, foment widespread instability, undermine foreign investment, participate in rampant human trafficking, and engage in subregional terrorism.
The NPA is the military wing of the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). Since its foundation in 1969, it has sought to establish a communist state in the Philippines by waging a rural-based insurgency according to the Maoist doctrine of protracted people's guerrilla war. The group has traditionally maintained a presence throughout the country, but it is primarily active in the regions of Luzon, Visayas, and parts of Mindanao.
The threat posed by the NPA has fluctuated over time, peaking in the late 1980s during the unpopular regime of President Marcos, when the NPA strength reached an estimated 25,000 armed guerrillas and a mass base of support significantly larger than that. In the post-Marcos era, the NPA has struggled to elicit the same degree of popular support, and a series of brutal interfactional clashes within the organization has weakened its organization internally and undermined its legitimacy and credibility in the eyes of the Philippine population. However, the threat posed by the NPA began to escalate once more following the collapse of peace talks in 2005, and there was a sharp rise in attacks carried out by the group.
Although the NPA has been able to maintain a steady operational tempo following the launching of a concerted counterinsurgency campaign targeting it in 2006, its capabilities have been steadily degraded, and its areas of operation have increasingly been curtailed. Nevertheless, although it is no longer capable of posing the threat it once did, and despite intelligence in early 2010 suggesting that the group was once again suffering from internal fractionalization, the NPA remains militarily powerful and has become a successful social and political actor through its control of political parties and organizations. While a resolution to the conflict remains elusive, NPA representatives met with government negotiators in Hong Kong in early December 2010, and peace talks resumed in Oslo in mid-February 2011. Although both sides agreed to hold further talks, NPA violence continued, and disagreements in early November 2011 led to the peace talks being postponed. The NPA insurgency continued apace into 2012.
As of 2012, the NPA asserted that it had an active presence in 70 of the Philippines' 81 provinces, yet its presence appears to be thin: A 2007 Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) estimate claimed the NPA was highly active in only 2,121 of the Philippines' 42,000 barangays, the country's village-level administrative divisions. In February 2010, the AFP claimed that NPA influence had been further eroded, with the group controlling only 1,077 barangays.

By the mid-1970s, the MNLF boasted more than 10,000 members and controlled large swaths of Mindanao and Sulu. With the country already under martial law, President Marcos responded to the MNLF's advance with heavy doses of force, committing 80 percent of his available troops to the southern Philippines.
In 1976, the MNLF agreed to a 16-point accord with the GRP. Concurrent with this accord, a referendum on autonomy for the southern islands was held in 1977. But because the islands had a Christian majority, the referendum failed to garner a majority vote, the MNLF's autonomy bid failed, and the organization splintered into several groups. In 1986, the MNLF and the GRP signed a truce in which the parties agreed to continue discussion of full autonomy for the Mindanao region, with a joint commission to be set up to develop the details of a proposal for full autonomy of Mindanao, Basilan, Sulu, Tawi-Tawi, and Palawan, subject to democratic processes. Finally, in 1996, President Fidel Ramos agreed to a peace accord with MNLF leader Nur Misuari. The agreement created a four-province Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao, of which Nur Misuari joined the political leadership.
The MILF is an Islamist militant group based and operating in the southern Philippine region of Mindanao, particularly in the provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, and North Cotabato. Salamat Hashim established the MILF in 1977 as a splinter faction of the MNLF with the aim of creating an independent Islamic state in Mindanao. However, MILF structure and policy direction were not specifically defined until 1984.
The Philippine government never really saw the MILF as anything more than a radical splinter of the MNLF, upon which it continued to focus both its military and diplomatic efforts. However, the MILF grew steadily, particularly through its control of the mosques in central Mindanao. The group was also a beneficiary of the 1996 peace accord between the government and the MNLF, as 5,000 to 6,000 MNLF combatants rejected the accord and joined the MILF, doubling its size. By 1999-2000, the MILF controlled vast swaths of central Mindanao, where it established Islamic-based governing structures.
Peace talks resumed in Malaysia in December 2009. While the MILF initially rejected a power-sharing offer in February 2010, it announced the following September that it would be prepared to accept an agreement in which a Muslim "substate" was created. The revision of the MILF's objectives paved the way for the resumption of exploratory peace talks in February 2011, when the group presented the government with a proposal to create a semi-autonomous politi-Counterinsurgency in the Philippines 71 cal entity in Mindanao. The future of the peace process was called into question in October, following the MILF's involvement in a clash between the military and the ASG that left 19 soldiers dead.
Currently, the MILF is one of the most powerful militant groups in Southeast Asia. It commands approximately 10,000 armed fighters and has well-established bases from which it exerts political control over local Muslim communities. Its principal areas of activity include the southern provinces of Lanao del Norte, Lanao del Sur, Maguindanao, and North Cotabato.

The ASG is a Sunni militant group based and operating in the southern Philippine region of Mindanao, particularly on the island province of Basilan and the nearby island of Jolo in Sulu province. While the ASG's global jihadist outlook and its ultimate desire to establish an independent Islamic republic make it ideologically similar to al Qaeda and JI, the group is also known for its criminal activities, including a number of high-profile kidnappings for ransom involving Westerners. The ASG's links to al Qaeda and JI and its targeting of Westerners helped ensure that the group would become a focus of U.S. counter-terrorism efforts after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States. Indeed, a series of joint U.S.-Philippine military and political actions have substantially degraded the ASG's capabilities.
Although the ASG's top leadership hierarchy has remained unclear since Khadafy Janjalani was killed in 2006, numerous other ASG commanders and subcommanders were subsequently killed or captured, including ASG spokesman Jainal Antel Sali, alias Abu Solaiman; Ismin Sahiron, the son of a top ASG commander; and other key operatives, including Jundam Jamalul and Borhan Mundus. The AFP claimed that 144 ASG rebels were killed, were captured, or surrendered in 2007, bringing the total number of ASG rebels to fewer than 400 (from a peak of between 1,000 and 1,200) for the first time in years.
The ASG has nonetheless demonstrated that it can still inflict significant casualties. In July 2007, ASG and MILF forces ambushed a group of AFP Marines searching for a kidnapped Italian priest on Basilan. Fourteen of the Marines were killed, ten of whom were beheaded. In August 2007, the ASG conducted an attack that killed 15 AFP Marines in Basilan province.

The AFP, established in 1935, is an all-volunteer, tri-service organization comprising an Army, a Navy, and an Air Force. By constitutional mandate, the AFP is under civilian control, with the President of the Philippines as its Commander-in-Chief. All AFP branches are part of

Throughout more than three decades of armed communist insurgency and Muslim separatism, the GRP's responses have been a compromise between civilian and military interpretations of the armed threats and how best to respond to them. This tension between civilian and military authorities is reflected in the mix of government and military responses to the threats, as seen in the "right-and left-hand approaches" to counterinsurgency since the 1950s. The balance between the right hand (primarily the use of military force) and the left hand (socioeconomic and political measures to address the root causes and win the hearts and minds of the people) has tilted in favor of one side or the other, depending on the overall political, economic, and social context, the strategic situation on the ground, and the personality and policy preferences of political and military leaders.
Overall, a highly conventional military strategy predominated during martial law and dictatorship, because the military was a main partner of the civilian leader in the government, Ferdinand Marcos. The Marcos government depended on the military for political survival, giving the military a role in politics, a large budget, and significant bureaucratic clout. The military's influence in the counterinsurgency strategy was also determined by the rise of the NPA and the MNLF soon after the imposition of martial law and the growth of these organizations during the rest of the Marcos era, as well as the growing opposition to his rule from the broader sociopolitical spectrum.

In response to the rise of militancy in the Philippines, the United States began preparations to resume military support, and in 1998, U.S. SOF deployed to the Philippines to help establish a counterterrorist unit to address the Islamist threats that were growing in the southern part of the country. The unit, called the Light Reaction Company, was modeled after a U.S. SOF Special Missions Unit.

Using the theoretical framework developed in Chapter Two and the empirical findings presented in Chapter Three, we analyzed three factors associated with Philippine counterinsurgency strategy and outcomes: political inclusivity, military superiority, and state capacity. Consistent with general patterns in counterinsurgency campaigns, changes in regime type from autocracy to democracy are associated with government adoption of counterinsurgency strategies that involve pursuing negotiations with at least certain parts of the opposition and an expressed desire to use force discriminately. These preferences have been evident in multiple elected administrations' commitment to the minimal use of conventional firepower and avoidance of indiscriminate sweep operations and a greater emphasis on reintegration programs and other civil-military operations intended to win popular support vis-à-vis the insurgents they faced.
Democratic Philippines governments' ability to implement such strategies have invariably been imperfect and susceptible to compromise by political factors or capacity gaps; in some instances, the regimes reverted back to conventional approaches favored by the military or other actors. Despite these inconsistencies, as of mid-2013, the GRP is close to achieving a peace agreement with the MILF and appears to have minimized the ASG threat and the foreign terrorist threat in its southern islands.

The second time period, roughly spanning 1986 to 2000, can be viewed broadly as a transitional period. During this period, the country transitioned toward democracy. Policies and operational methods changed, but the government's capacity to implement reforms was limited. The limitations stemmed in part from the civilian government's weakness relative to the military, whose most senior officers from the Marcos period retained much of the political clout Marcos had conferred on them. Their disagreement with the civilian government's policy preferences and the military's reliance on old tactics from the Marcos period, which often involved conventional operations in which force was applied indiscriminately, played a key role in shaping the ultimate approach that was taken in countering insurgencies. In this period, the democratically elected regime made attempts to forge a peace agreement with each major insurgent group. But only one such effort-the 1996 peace deal with the MNLF-succeeded. Despite the increased level of political inclusiveness, the government's lack of capacity relative to the military often resulted in counterinsurgency approaches that most closely resembled containment. Such an approach was evident, for instance, after peace talks with the NPA and the MILF repeatedly broke down and intermittent large-scale military operations resumed. The government also was left to pursue a containment strategy against the ASG, which was never interested in a negotiated peace and was thus alternately ignored and dealt with through military operations that in many cases relied on the use of indiscriminate firepower.
The third broad period began in 2001 after Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo succeeded Joseph Estrada as President and significantly expanded the country's relationship with the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. U.S. assistance, both military and civil, increased dramatically during this period. Although the dramatic expansion in U.S. aid was inadequate to boost state capacity throughout the country in such a short period of time, it made a dramatic difference in the government's capabilities in the small peripheral region of the Sulu Archipelago, where joint operations by the U.S. military and its Philippine partners gave the government an unprecedented reach. Democratic institutions were also increasingly consolidated in this period: Despite allegations of electoral graft in 2004 and 2010, a return to military rule appears increasingly unlikely. The government's approach to counterinsurgency has followed relatively predictable patterns: Against the NPA, it undertook the closest approximation of the classic counterinsurgency model that it had taken to date. Against the MILF, it engaged in an ongoing peace process and worked to restrain the military from conducting operations that could compromise the process, an approach consistent with the informal-accommodation model described in Chapter Two. And against the ASG, it has worked with U.S. partners to combine civil-military operations with discriminate targeting of ASG members-an approach that again approximates the classic counterinsurgency model.
Although the GRP's policies over these four decades do not perfectly align with the behavior that we might expect based on the framework presented in Chapter Two, the extent of congruence is remarkable. In only two of the ten subcases depicted in Table 
4
These variations are explored in greater detail below.
After being democratically elected in 1965, Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in 1972, in part because of threats posed by internal armed groups and in part because his reelection prospects were poor. Under martial law, Marcos subsequently greatly increased the size of the AFP, in terms of both budget and personnel. At the same time, his government showed little genuine interest in making concessions to reconcilable elements of the insurgencies it faced, which grew significantly during this period.
Under martial law, Marcos' main weapon against insurgency was military force. The military budget was increased by 700 percent from 1972 to 1976; the number of Philippine Security Forces (PSF) was also increased from 60,000 to 157,000. 
25
Marcos' gambit backfired: Civilian casualties skyrocketed, Filipino public opinion increasingly turned against the regime, and the insurgencies flourished. The NPA grew its base enough to shift from an almost exclusively rural movement to one that also drew from urban areas, particularly local universities whose students were prone to radical ideas. Overall, the CPP-NPA grew from a small group of about 1,100 in 1971 to an estimated 7,200-10,660 members by 1983.

The Marcos government was not completely opposed to negotiating with insurgents, but, consistent with the framework outlined in Chapter Two, it was neither willing nor able to credibly commit to a comprehensive peace accord. In 1977, the GRP entered into a temporary peace deal with the MNLF, the Tripoli Agreement. The terms of the agreement's implementation, however, which consisted of the MNLF's requirements for regional autonomy, were left open to a referendum that was to be held at a later time. Meanwhile, both the GRP and the MNLF violated its initial terms, and the MNLF splintered into multiple groups. The Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) would not be formally created until 12 years had passed and a democratically elected administration was in place, and even then, the newly created entity still failed to end the Muslim separatist insurgency. 
28
After Corazon Aquino assumed the presidency in 1986, she immediately announced plans to negotiate with the insurgents and to offer concessions such as amnesties and reintegration packages. Peace talks with the NPA were accompanied by a short cease-fire from December 1986 to January 1987, when the talks collapsed due to the NPA's lack of a serious commitment to peace, dissent from Marcos loyalists in the military, and a general lack of U.S. support for any settlement ceding substantive concessions to communists.

The "clear" stage would involve combat, intelligence, and civilmilitary operations conducted to defeat the insurgent armed groups and to neutralize their political and military infrastructures. The aim was to gain possession or control of strategic areas or key terrain to allow holding forces to come in for the next stage or operation. The "hold" stage was intended to reestablish government control and authority and to preserve the initial gains of the clearing forces through occupation and control of the cleared areas. It was to signal the strength of local defense capabilities to defend the cleared areas from incursions and reentry of rebel groups. The "consolidate" stage involved the collabora-

With nowhere else to turn, Aquino, under intense pressure from the military and with promises of increased U.S. support, reversed course and launched a total-war policy against the NPA. Interestingly, however, although the NPA sought to take advantage of the uptick in AFP abuses, it was less able to do so under the democratically elected Aquino than it had been under Marcos' martial law, with support less forthcoming from moderate elements of the population, perhaps because the democratic system afforded possible opportunities for reforms that would simply never happen if the NPA were to win.

Ramos' successor, Joseph Estrada, returned responsibility for internal security operations to the AFP in 1998. After some initial skirmishes, the military and the insurgent groups both escalated

90 Countering Others' Insurgencies operations in a tit-for-tat fashion, and the hope of a negotiated settlement was largely dashed in 2000 when Estrada declared a strategy of all-out war against the MILF, which resulted not only in a renewal of combat, but also in high levels of civilian displacement in Mindanao.
Estrada was ousted in 2001 and replaced by Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Although his ouster was dubbed "People Power 2," it came after the AFP withdrew its support, citing his corruption and unpopularity as evidenced by popular protests in Manila, and shifted to supporting Arroyo. Subsequent presidential elections in 2004 and 2010 were allegedly subject to irregularities, but whatever their flaws, democratic processes are now institutionalized-an outcome that was far from certain when Marcos went into exile in 1986. While not impossible, a return to Marcos-style martial law appears increasingly unlikely.
Since 2001, the GRP's stated strategy for addressing its internal security threats has been to pursue a negotiated solution with both the MILF and the NPA through ongoing peace processes. As of July 2013, a settlement with the MILF appeared increasingly likely, although the government's dialogue with the NPA has been less productive for a variety of reasons.

A second explanatory factor associated with Philippine counterinsurgency strategy and outcomes is military superiority, which reflects the balance-or imbalance-between government armed forces and the size and capabilities of the insurgents and terrorists. Change over time to the military balance can shape strategy and indeed did shape GRP strategy. Contrary to the hypothesis that governments tend to be more discriminating in their use of force when they enjoy significant military superiority, however, the Philippines experience suggests that quantitatively superior government forces might use either high or low levels of indiscriminate violence. The nature of the regime and the quality of the counterinsurgency forces it deploys account better for the variation over time in the Philippines.
The history of Philippines counterinsurgency since Marcos' ouster maps onto this framework relatively well. Under Marcos, the country was under de facto authoritarian rule for 14 years. Marcos' military was significantly larger than the rebel forces he faced, particularly after he invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the expansion of the both the AFP and pro-government paramilitary forces to fight armed dissident movements. Consistent with our framework, Marcos' authoritarian regime did not bargain in good faith; rather, it knowingly implemented policies that would undermine the Moro Muslims' demographic majority status in Mindanao and thus reduce the chances that an agreed-upon referendum would force the concessions sought by the MNLF. Moreover, the Marcos regime's use of force became more and more indiscriminate as the military's relative dominance eroded due to booms in rebel recruitment, particularly by the NPA from the late 1970s through the first half of the 1980s.
As Figures 4.   size of the military in subsequent years. By 1977, it grew to 155,000, where it remained fairly steady through 1982, at which time it declined to 113,000, where it would remain fairly steady for the remainder of Marcos' tenure. 
44
Marcos not only increased the number of military personnel in his armed forces, he also increased spending on the military. From 1972 to 1974, Philippine military expenditures increased 142 percent, jumping from $119,320,000 to $289,035,000. Philippine military

Counterinsurgency in the Philippines 95
The discussion of military superiority raises an important point. One explanation for the steep decline in ASG strength in the early 2000s involves the quality of the modest number of U.S. troops deployed to the southern Philippines. Their training and doctrine, not to mention the high quality of the equipment, weapons, and technical assets they brought, were both sufficient and appropriate to support the PSF campaign against the ASG and facilitated a quick, significant degradation of the ASG organization. Moreover, the AFP has developed increasingly potent SOF capable of performing unconventional small-unit operations independently.
The relative quality of the PSF deployed to counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations clearly correlates with partner-nation qualities the United States seeks. High-quality troops-that is, AFP troops who have undergone rigorous, specialized training in counterinsurgency and counterterrorism, and whose operational approach is guided and disciplined by appropriate doctrine for such operationsare more likely to be able to build rapport with the local population and plan and execute intelligence-driven operations in a selective, discriminate fashion than are soldiers who lack these qualities. 
52

53
Although troop quality-of both U.S. SOF advisors and their Philippine counterparts-certainly plays a role in PSF posture and effectiveness against unconventional threat groups, it is important not to divorce it from context. Thinking through a counterfactual scenario in which the U.S. intervention occurred in a different time period suggests that the post-9/11 U.S. intervention might have come at a propitious time for the United States to be able to cultivate counterinsurgency tactics within the AFP. The Philippine government was committed to maintaining democratic institutions (even while government corruption remained relatively high) and seeking political accommodation with those insurgent groups that could reconcile with the central government. Had the United States provided the same train-

Like the governments of many fledgling states in the developing world, the GRP has struggled to generate sufficient capabilities to effectively exercise governance throughout its territory. One result of the lack of government authority in certain parts of the country is that even when the GRP and a rebel group both appear to have a willingness to negotiate toward a conflict settlement, the GRP has had difficulty making a credible commitment to comply with and enforce such a settlement. Indeed, factional politics and intragovernment instability severely undermined peace processes with both the MNLF and the MILF, the latter of which is still unresolved. If democracy is a factor associated with governments that tend to be more willing to negotiate with moderate elements of insurgencies, it appears that democratic states must also have the capacity to implement a deal.
The Philippines has had limited capacity for several reasons. First, the country's geography makes committing to the implementation of a peace agreement difficult for many of the same reasons it makes fighting insurgents difficult. This can result in an "equilibrium" of protracted, low-intensity insurgency.
What exactly are these geographic conditions? The Philippines is an archipelago of more than 7,000 islands, many of which have rugged or jungle terrain, which provides an abundance of safe havens where insurgents can recruit, stage operations, and avoid apprehension by government authorities. The terrain also makes it difficult for the government and insurgents to monitor each other and ensure transparency during and after a peace process. Indeed, the combination of geographic challenges and relative poverty in the Philippines means that-as is the case in most countries in the developing world-the logistics required for effective counterinsurgency, counterterrorism, or stability operations are difficult.
These challenges differ across the various insurgencies in the Philippines. The more-concentrated, territorial nature of the MILF and especially the ASG in the southern Philippines, along with the geographical constraints imposed by the islands where they operate, can help government forces find insurgent camps and limits insurgents' freedom of movement to elude apprehension when the military or police are able to conduct timely operations. At the same time, parallel, state-like structures built by the MNLF and the MILF make parts of the southern Philippines akin to denied or hostile areas, in which the AFP's operational latitude is limited. Conversely, the more-dispersed nature of the NPA has allowed it to better withstand strong government offensives, although it has also made it more difficult for the group to firmly establish its primacy.
The GRP's limited capacity must be understood in comparative perspective. Relative to all regimes battling insurgencies, which tend to have very low governance and overall state capacity, 54 the Philippines has a reasonably competent governmental infrastructure that can provide some degree of public goods even in remote rural areas. Compared with most of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and many of the poorer countries of Asia, it scores considerably better on both indices of state capacity used in this study. 
55
In addition to the geographical and logistical challenges involved in vanquishing an insurgency in the Philippines or cooperating with one, the institutional capabilities of the AFP dedicated to these efforts are modest. Relatively weak civilian oversight, along with embedded patronage networks, sometimes results in corruption and mismanagement, especially within the AFP officer corps.

Despite numerous post-Marcos strategic and doctrinal initiatives to broaden counterinsurgency efforts to include civil functions in a "holistic" approach, the AFP has in practice shouldered much of the burden of internal-security operations. Consequently, deviations from new counterinsurgency approaches have been relatively common, and the GRP's response has thus often been to revert to old, conventional approaches that rely on heavy firepower and sweep operations, which have failed to eradicate the insurgencies and have sometimes undone progress made in addressing popular grievances.
Despite the incomplete reform of GRP counterinsurgency approaches during successive post-Marcos democratic governments, there is some correlative evidence linking development projects to counterinsurgency successes.
As Figure

There are also qualitative examples that illustrate what robust civil-military integration in counterinsurgency looks like when the GRP has the capacity and will to implement a classic counterinsurgency approach in a concerted, sustained way. The counterinsurgency effort in Bohol province, once an NPA stronghold, is one of the clearest illustrations of successful civil-military integration. In Bohol, development was assigned a significant role in the local campaign, and provincial counterinsurgency efforts were subsumed under the auspices of the Bohol Poverty Reduction Management Office. The civil aspect of the Bohol campaign was multifaceted: Governance, environmental management, social welfare, peace and security, urban management, education, health, rural improvement, population management, sustainable livelihood, infrastructure, and economic management were components of the overarching effort against the NPA.
58
59
While perhaps an exceptional case-the GRP considered Bohol a high-priority province for operations against the NPA-Bohol indicates the potential of such an approach. Indeed, the war-torn province changed from among the poorest provinces in the Philippines in 1997 to one of the fastest-developing provinces by 2001. By the mid-2000s, Bohol was virtually free of insurgency.

The U.S. military has played a significant role in the southern Philippines in OEF-P since 2001, when the U.S.-Philippines security relationship was reestablished after security cooperation between the two countries had diminished in the 1990s.
In the post-9/11 period, the Philippines became the Southeast Asian front line of U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the Global War on Terrorism. During the 1990s, there was relatively little interest in the ASG or its links to foreign terrorist groups.

108 Countering Others' Insurgencies adopted an increasingly repressive and indiscriminate strategy vis-à-vis the opposition, even undermining chances for a sustained peace with the MNLF separatists through its policies. Subsequent democratic regimes, starting with Corazon Aquino's in 1986 and followed by Fidel Ramos' in 1992, implemented policies that were more open to accommodating moderate or reconcilable elements of the opposition, while continuing military campaigns against opposition that was less willing to engage the government. These military campaigns were often aimed at pacification-an integrated civilian and military approach that would combine reconstruction and military operations-although they sometimes reverted to more-conventional, military-led campaigns that relied on heavy force against insurgent encampments. After 2001, however, the Arroyo and Aquino governments largely reconstituted earlier efforts to engage moderate insurgents, advance peace processes, and develop methods for more-discriminate targeting of insurgent and terrorist groups' hard-line elements.
The democratically elected Estrada regime, starting in 1998 and ending in 2001, is the main outlier to this general pattern. With U.S. support to the Philippines during the 1990s significantly diminished, the Estrada regime was particularly weak, and at the same time, it was renowned for its corruption, siphoning off remaining available resources that could have been used to build governmental capacity to counter insurgents. With little remaining capacity in the civil sector and low-level violence between the AFP and insurgents ongoing, Estrada authorized the military to resume major combat operations that derailed the southern peace process and caused widespread harm to the civilian population. 
78
The Philippines provided a hospitable environment for the United States to partner with to counter mutual threats, particularly during 78 Carolina G. Hernandez, "Institutional Responses to Armed Conflict: The Armed Forces of the Philippines," background paper, submitted to the Human Development Network Foundation, Inc., for the Philippine Human Development Report, 2005, pp. 14-15.   Counterinsurgency in the Philippines 109 the post-9/11 period, by which time the GRP had established consolidated, if imperfect, democratic institutions. Like other democratically elected governments that followed Marcos' regime, the post-2001 Philippines has sought to negotiate an end to conflicts with groups it considers reconcilable. These efforts have met with only partial success: The MILF peace process holds significant promise for an agreement, while NPA negotiations have never developed to the same stage of maturity and are currently stalled. 
79
80
By injecting additional resources, oversight, and capabilities, the U.S. military also appears to have helped to stabilize civil-military relations-a chronic source of policy instability in the Philippines since the transition to democracy in 1986. It is entirely possible, however, that this stability will be fleeting, as there is no institutional mechanism in place to build or sustain the capacity to maintain smoother civil-military relations in the absence of the combination of qualities and resources the United States brings to the environment.
Finally, although the United States' partnership with the GRP should be considered a success story, claims about that success should be qualified by questions concerning the long-term sustainability of the gains that have been made. Philippine capacity to counter insurgent and terrorist groups effectively and selectively is unquestionably greater now than it was during any part of the pre-9/11 period. It is unclear, however, whether the GRP will be able to deploy and sustain certain capabilities that have enhanced its capacity and contributed 110 Countering Others' Insurgencies to its counterinsurgency and counterterrorism successes over the past decade. The United States, acting indirectly in support of the GRP, has provided important intelligence support and logistics capabilities, such as intelligence obtained from technical sources and airborne ISR assets, robust helicopter support, and night-vision capabilities, all of which are critical enablers of timely collection and validation of intelligence and of precise military operations that minimize collateral damage and civilian harm. 
81
Since its independence in 1947, Pakistan has faced numerous challenges from violent non-state actors. The number and intensity of internal conflicts began to escalate following the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, particularly in the northwest regions of the country. The United States began to take an active interest in Pakistan's approach to counterinsurgency at that time and especially after the Taliban resurgence beginning in approximately 2006. In a 2007 National Intelligence Estimate, U.S. officials expressed concern over Pakistan's counterinsurgency campaign against the Taliban and their foreign and al Qaeda affiliates operating in the northwest and tribal areas. According to the estimate, increased activity by these groups threatened to erode gains made in Afghanistan and, more importantly, to destabilize a nuclear-armed Pakistan. 
1
This chapter examines the drivers and trajectory of Pakistan's various counterinsurgency campaigns since 2001. In contrast to the Philippines, Pakistan possesses a large, professional, and highly capable military but weak state capacity and civilian institutions. Despite frequent elections over the past decade, opportunities for meaningful political participation remain limited. 
2
The Pakistan case merits careful consideration for other reasons as well. Because the government of Pakistan has fought multiple insurgencies during this period, it offers the chance to explore many "minicases" under different subnational conditions. Comparing the different approaches that the government has taken at different points in time and against different insurgent groups provides us with considerable insight into the domestic determinants of counterinsurgency strategy and practices.
Regime characteristics-in particular, the extent of political inclusion and state capacity-have shaped Pakistan's preferred strategies for countering insurgency. The nuances of case-study methods allow us to explore subtle variations in both domestic features and counterinsurgency approaches. By dividing Pakistan across distinct regions (Swat/ Malakand, Balochistan) and various agencies within FATA and over different time periods (before and after civilian governments), we are able to analyze how different levels of inclusion, state capacity, and military superiority in eight subcases have impacted strategy and outcomes.
Across these eight subcases, we find that Pakistani governments have usually pursued containment strategies typical of less politically inclusive regimes with low state capacity. As the government has moved closer toward democracy in recent years, however, it has often (although not uniformly) adopted strategies characteristic of moreinclusive regimes, emphasizing greater efforts toward accommodation of the reconcilable opposition and more discriminate use of force. Yet even in this period, government strategy has varied by region, as some subcases reveal. In regions closer to the core of the Pakistani state that possess better institutions for higher levels of political inclusion and state capacity (e.g., the Swat Valley), the government has adopted approaches resembling classic counterinsurgency strategies. In peripheral regions like FATA and Balochistan, in contrast, the state has been more prone to using force indiscriminately and denying even potentially reconcilable opposition movements the opportunity for meaningful political participation in state structures.
The U.S.-Pakistan security partnership is commonly regarded as a failure, particularly since the steady decline in relations that began in 2011. Our analysis suggests that a more-nuanced view is appropriate. The study clearly reveals the limits of U.S. leverage, even in countries to which it provides large amounts of assistance, but it also reveals specific circumstances under which the United States might positively engage. Finally, it suggests the potential for even partners with unfavorable characteristics to adopt elements of Western counterinsurgency best practices, at least under certain conditions. To be clear, the story of the U.S.-Pakistan relationship is not an encouraging one. It does, however, hint at ways in which the United States might influence problematic partners' counterinsurgency practices on the margins.
The first section below provides background detail on the Government of Pakistan (GoP), the insurgent groups it has fought since 2001, and the counterinsurgency campaigns in FATA, Swat/ Malakand, and Balochistan during the pre-and post-2008 periods. The next section analyzes the influences of the three domestic structural variables-political inclusion, state capacity, and military superiority-across each of the eight subcases. The third section analyzes the role of the U.S. partnership assistance in shaping GoP strategy. Finally, the chapter concludes with some key findings supporting the broader claims of this report and some additional implications of the Pakistan case.
The GoP has presided over an extremely diverse and contentious ethnic and political landscape carved out of British India in 1947. Throughout nearly all of its independence, Pakistan has been considered a weak and 114 Countering Others' Insurgencies non-democratic state, but it has possessed a very large and capable professional military. It has fought four major wars with its longtime rival, India, as well as a number of counterinsurgency campaigns. Today, its landscape is dotted with numerous militant organizations of ethnonational, sectarian, and religious extremist variants, some of which the GoP disregards, some which it directly fights, and some of which it tacitly relies on as an internal or external national security tool. The government has engaged in three major counterinsurgency campaigns against the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) since 2001, its previously inchoate incarnations in FATA since 2002, the Tehrik-e-Nifaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi (TNSM) in the Swat Valley and Malakand Division since 2007, and a range of Baloch nationalist insurgent organizations in Balochistan since 2005. At certain points in time, it has prosecuted all three counterinsurgency campaigns simultaneously, stretching the limits of an already weak state. Consequently, its approach to these insurgencies has varied, following preexisting patterns of varying geography, political topography, and state capacity across regions and even subregions.
The physical and economic landscape of Pakistan has been very unevenly distributed, which has led some to describe it as an artificial construct. Pakistan is roughly the size of France and the United Kingdom combined and home to 180 million people. While the province of Punjab forms the bulk of Pakistan's industrial base, population centers, political authority, and arterial road networks, the province of Sindh remains important as an agricultural center and home to Pakistan's largest city and commercial capital, Karachi. The Northwest Frontier province, recently renamed Khyber-Pakhtunkwa (KP), has been increasingly integrated into the political, economic, and social fabric of Pakistan since the 1970s. However, the vast expanse of Balochistan province, which makes up 47 percent of Pakistan's territory but only 4.5 percent of its population, largely exists apart from the other three provinces and is mainly valued for its natural-resource deposits and its newly developed Gwadar port. FATA, Gilgit-Baltistan (previously the
Federally Administered Northern Areas), and Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) are also physically remote and sparsely populated territories.
This geography underpins very uneven political topography, particularly for the non-provincial territories where political authority is more closely akin to suzerainty than modern state governance. FATA remains outside the Pakistani constitution and is governed by federal political agents and tribal leaders under a set of draconian rules laid down by the British in 1901, and the GoP has deployed segmented and distinct approaches to different agencies even within FATA based on tribal composition. 
3
The human terrain of Pakistan is equally complicated, with most major ethno-linguistic groups concentrated and generally dominant in the provinces named after them, creating an array of centrifugal forces contributing to tension, instability, and conflict. The dominant ethno-linguistic group of Punjabis makes up 45 percent of the population. The rest of the population is made up of 9 percent Saraikis (concentrated in southern Punjab and sometimes counted as Punjabis), 15 percent Pashtuns, 14 percent Sindhis, 7.5 percent Mohajirs (Urduspeaking immigrants from Northern India, with the majority concentrated in urban Sindh), 3.5 percent Balochi, and 6 percent other. Along with English, the official language of Pakistan is Urdu, although only 8 percent of the people are native speakers. Nearly all groups have been involved in some violent internal challenge to the state or dominant groups, through either ethno-nationalist movements or Islamist militant movements. Prior to 1947, most of modern-day Pakistan constituted the frontiers of the British Raj, indirectly ruled and policed due to the harsh terrain and unruly tribes. Only Punjab province, which was both one of the richest provinces and one of the chief contributors to the British Indian Army,

On paper, Pakistan is the most urbanized country on the South Asian subcontinent (excluding the Maldives), with 36 percent of the population living in cities. In daily life, however, kinship networks remain strong and have prevented the breakdown of old sociocultural structures. The country's ethno-linguistic diversity, combined with the strength of kinship networks of collective solidarity, have left Pakistan a weak state beset by many strong societies.
6
Regime type and political inclusion. Since its independence, Pakistan has vacillated between civilian-led and military-led governments. For the most part, however, the politics of the country have not been very democratic or politically inclusive, and the military has historically dominated politics even during periods of civilian rule.

8
These steps toward greater democracy were capped by a major historical achievement in March 2013, when the democratically elected civilian government became the first to complete a five-year term and peacefully transition without military intervention to a newly elected civilian government, suggesting a more robust and sustained commitment to democratic governance by all institutions. 9 Some charge that the military has refrained from intervening in domestic politics in large part as a choice, because it still controls national-security policy. While this is true to a large extent, its choice has been in part shaped by institutional developments that make interventions costlier, such as a stronger media, judiciary, and parliament, and these civilian institutions have begun to assert themselves in some national-security debates. Thus, while Pakistan as a whole cannot be considered to have

State capacity. Pakistan is considered by most scholars to be a relatively weak state (like all states in South Asia) because of its weak economy, level of development, political capacity, and quality of governance.

A vast array of insurgent, terrorist, and militant organizations based in Pakistan have challenged state forces, institutions, or authority at various points in time. In addition to these clear challengers to the state, there are a number of militant organizations that are either ostensibly neutral or even allied with the GoP. We focus primarily on the strongest insurgent organizations that have directly threatened the state and have been the targets of counterinsurgency campaigns over the past decade. These include the Taliban-affiliated TTP and TNSM, as well as Baloch nationalist insurgents.
Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan.

The nascent Pakistani Taliban eventually formed the basis for the TTP, which was officially declared in late 2007 to be an umbrella organization of 40 senior Taliban commanders and Islamist militant movements totaling 40,000 fighters. These diverse movements were united by a desire to fight a "defensive jihad" against the Pakistan Army's incursions in the tribal regions. In July 2007, the Pakistani military's siege and storming of Islamabad's Red Mosque, where militants had holed themselves up, provided a major impetus to TTP cohesion and escalation of operations. The incident triggered a wave of attacks and suicide bombings beyond FATA against military targets and civilian population centers throughout the country. Baitullah Mehsud, a militant commander from the Mehsud tribal region in South Waziristan Agency (SWA), initially presided as the head of the TTP fighters. After his death in August 2009, he was succeeded by Hakimullah Mehsud. Though the TTP is similar to the Afghan Taliban in its ethnic and ideological origins, its goals and targeting are different, with TTP violence focused on the GoP.

After Muhammad was jailed for leading a large militia to fight the United States in Afghanistan in 2001, his son-in-law Maulana Fazlullah assumed leadership of the TNSM. Fazlullah managed to revive it in 2006 by running an illegal radio station promoting Islamist values and denouncing modernity, Pakistani President Musharraf, and the United States (earning him the nickname "Mullah Radio"). Under the leadership of a sympathetic provincial government run by a coalition of religious parties, the region of KP and the Swat Valley in particular was subject to increasing radicalization and became a haven for militant organizations as well as violent and overzealous enforcement of sharia, the intimidation of locals, and disruption of development measures like vaccinations and girls' education. Fazlullah was given free rein to continue his radio propaganda in exchange for halting the TNSM's intimidation campaign. After the July 2007 storming of the Red Mosque, however, the TNSM declared jihad against the GoP and began to attack security forces and government buildings, effectively taking control of the region by October 2007.
The TNSM, initially estimated at between 500 and 3,000 armed forces in 2007, grew to between 6,000 and 10,000 by 2009 by drawing in foreign fighters as well as generating local recruits. The group turned out to be surprisingly capable, motivated, and adept at guerrilla warfare, retreating to the mountains surrounding the Swat Valley during major Pakistan Army sweeps. Though religious in its aspirations and driven in response to GoP military actions, the TNSM managed to mobilize new recruits through a combination of appeals to local grievances and opportunities for payment, power, and score-settling, as well as some amount of forcible recruitment. While this mobilization and political violence coincided with the rise of Pakistani Taliban violence in FATA and shared similar motivations, the TNSM's trajectory, agenda, and targets of violence remained distinct to the Malakand region.

This most recent round of Baloch insurgency was a response to perceived encroachment and subjugation by the Pakistani center, including the construction of the Gwadar port and new Army cantonments, underpayment for resources extracted, and administrative restructuring under the Musharraf regime that would undercut the tribal levies system. Violence was a form of coercive bargaining to restore a degree of provincial autonomy and increase Balochistan's resource share, and it was confined to tribal militias that mostly targeted infrastructure and some GoP security forces. For its part, the GoP saw this uprising as a threat to the modernization and development of Balochistan and sought to crush it.
Initial estimates of the size of Baloch forces in 2005-2006 ranged from 1,000 to 14,000, though the upper figure likely included all potential tribal militia members rather than actual hardened fighters. While the Baloch insurgents suffered significant losses in the early years of the insurgency, after the heavy-handed military response, the number of insurgent fighters is believed to have grown to between 3,000 and 12,000, expanding across social classes. At the same time, the goals of the insurgency shifted from limited autonomy to separatism, with growing public support for an independent state, and its targets expanded to include civilians.

In November 2007, the Army launched its first campaign, Operation Rah-e-Haq (Just Path), to take back control of Swat, deploying between 12,000 and 15,000 troops.

When the deal collapsed, a second round of major operations was required, and the military was sent back in late July 2008, this time with a slightly larger force. The military repeated the same "blow up, patch up, blow up" cycle of clear-and-occupy operations relying on conventional tactics and artillery. Fearing excessive collateral damage, however, it failed to clear militants out of the towns and abandoned their checkpoints to retreat to the ridges of the valley. This excessive caution and premature declarations of victory resulted in a loss of control of the valley by late 2008. As border tensions with India mounted in the wake of the Mumbai terrorist attack in November 2008, the Pakistani military nonetheless hesitated to commit larger numbers of troops for more-decisive action. Peace negotiations began again in February 2009, and another deal was signed in April.

The war in Swat was the first, and so far the only, time the Pakistan Army successfully completed a counterinsurgency campaign according to the book: the militants were killed, captured, or driven out, the area was secured, the displaced population returned, their homes were rebuilt, and the civic administration was revived. The army had finally learned the principles of "clear, hold, build, and transfer" . . . and could carry them out when it had the will to do so. 68

In 2005, the GoP deployed tens of thousands of troops supported by tanks and helicopter gunships. Operations involved indiscriminate bombing and shelling, with substantial loss of civilian life. This first round of highly firepower-intensive military operations culminated in the assassination of the Bugti and Marri tribal leaders (in late 2006 and 2007, respectively) and the arrest of the Mengal leader.

The insurgency spread across the province, encompassing areas that had previously remained at peace, including southwest Balochistan and urban centers such as Quetta. It also spread beyond its rural and tribal roots, gaining the support of other sectors of society, including the middle class and student organizations. Ultimately, the uprising took a more radical turn, spawning organizations that were willing to target civilians and opposed to compromise with the government.

Despite these repressive measures, sympathy for the movement has increased substantially since 2006. A Gallup survey in July 2012 found that 37 percent of the Baloch population favored independence outright-a position not quantified in previous years but thought by analysts to be much lower-while 67 percent supported greater autonomy, suggesting that state policies were increasing rather than depressing nationalist sentiments.

Even these abbreviated accounts of the counterinsurgency campaigns between 2001 and 2013 clearly reveal the relationship between Pakistan's general level of political inclusion and state capacity and its selection of counterinsurgency strategies and practices. For most of this period, the government relied on heavy-handed but unsustained counterinsurgency operations approximating the containment model discussed in Chapter Two. A closer look at these operations, however, reveals important variation over time and between regions. As the regime became more democratic, it increasingly turned to a classical counterinsurgency model in the core region of Malakand and the Swat Valley. Due in part to low state penetration into the hinterlands of FATA and Balochistan, on the other hand, the regime continued to rely on other models in these regions.
The approaches adopted by the Islamabad government cannot, however, be fully explained by the regime's degree of political inclusivity and state capacity, nor is military superiority a determining factor-in fact, the regime only selectively applied its tremendous military capabilities, depending on local contexts and threat perceptions. A closer examination of these cases reveals the importance of other, albeit secondary, factors, including ethnic representation within the security forces.
The accounts from the previous section suggests that the dominant GoP counterinsurgency strategy was containment-on average,

When making comparisons with other countries, general measures of political inclusion and state capacity are useful, but they capture only an average for what is often highly uneven political terrain. Moving away from this average treatment of Pakistan to its subnational variation, one finds further evidence for the expected consequences of these structural variables. As described earlier, some subregions of Pakistan were more politically inclusive and had greater state capacity than others (core regions), and this variation appeared to shape the GoP's diverse counterinsurgency approaches, as Table 
5
During the period of military rule, the government employed a containment strategy in the peripheral regions of Balochistan and FATA-an approach typical of less-inclusive regimes with weak state capacity. After the transition to civilian rule and increasing (albeit highly imperfect) democratization from 2008 on, the pattern becomes more complicated. In the region of Malakand, where political inclusion and state capacity were higher than in the periphery, the state was eventually able to concentrate much higher levels of resources. Consequently, the government responded to the direct threat to the core regions of the country posed by the growing insurgency in the Swat Valley with a classic counterinsurgency campaign. In the more peripheral regions of FATA and Balochistan, the regime continued to use counterinsurgency models more in keeping with a low-capacity state.
Interestingly, the state also appeared to rely on more-autocratic approaches in the periphery despite its gradual transition toward higher levels of democracy. Specifically, it continued to employ containment strategies in Balochistan and much of FATA, as predicted in the discussion in Chapter Two. Only the Waziristans depart from these predictions and warrant further explanation. In SWA, the government eventually drew considerable resources from the center and undertook counterinsurgency operations most similar to the strong-state repression model because the tremendous violence inflicted from insurgents of this region on Pakistan's core was no longer containable. In NWA, an overstretched government's recognition of militant political neutrality led to informal accommodation typical of more-inclusive but lowcapacity regimes. This variation is explained in greater detail below, including a discussion of factors outside of the analytic framework presented in Chapter Two that account for some of the Pakistan government's observed behavior.
The case of Pakistan generally supports predictions of how political inclusivity and regime type shape counterinsurgency strategy. Given that Pakistan was a non-democracy for much of this period, we would expect that on average, it would rely on more-repressive, indiscriminate military operations with few meaningful measures of political accommodation and reconciliation-in other words, strong-state repression or containment policies, depending on the resources the government could muster. This prediction generally holds true for the campaigns in Balochistan and most of the campaigns in FATA and Swat. The GoP struggled to make credible commitments, relied on a narrow political constituency, was less accountable to the broader public, and allowed little civilian input on national-security matters, generally resulting in the use of indiscriminate force with high civilian casualties and low prospects for reconciliation. The deals and cease-fires the military regime did make in FATA prior to the return of civilian rule in 2008 were merely tactical, shallow (involving a narrow subset of militants), and neither trusted by insurgents nor durable.
Indiscriminate force continued in Balochistan throughout the insurgency. After the 2008 elections, however, repressive tactics became less visible. The irrelevance of the Baloch constituency, "a small, politically weak, recalcitrant, and untrustworthy ethno-tribal minority," allowed the GoP to continue with this approach. 
86
87
Civilian casualties in FATA were not particularly high in the early stages of the conflict, not because of any commitment to the discriminate use of force by the military government, but rather due to limited state capacity to support coercion and sustained operations. When the military did conduct major operations, it relied on largeunit actions, intensive firepower, and "indiscriminate and excessive force." 88 A number of missteps may have resulted from not involving civilians-both politicians and the civil bureaucracy-in decisionmaking processes with the potential to disrupt a military's organizational

Pakistan's gradual transition toward more-democratic politics following the 2008 elections led to significant changes in its counterinsurgency campaigns. The most obvious change in strategy took place in Swat, with the government transitioning from a containment strategy to a classic counterinsurgency strategy focused on securing the population, instituting reforms, and redressing grievances. Scholars and practitioners alike credit the civilian government for enabling this change in strategy by generating resolve, public support, and consensus, which bought time, legitimacy for a sustained military campaign, and the military's eventual transition from an enemy-centric to a populationcentric approach.

92
Some change in strategy after 2008 was also seen, though to a much lesser degree, in Balochistan and FATA. Attempts at accommodation to redress Baloch grievances increased under civilian rule, with four major attempts launched in the past few years, two of which involved concrete steps such as the passage of legislation, implementation of some political reforms, and redistribution of a greater share of economic resources. A fifth attempt may soon be launched by the newly elected Sharif government. 
93
94
95
In addition to shifts in the level of democracy over time, different levels of accountability in political institutions and quality of governance at the provincial level may explain some of the uneven shifts to a classic 150 Countering Others' Insurgencies counterinsurgency model after 2008. The fact that the strategy shifted to a more discriminate model in the Swat Valley but not in FATA and Balochistan may have been the result of higher levels of political enfranchisement and more direct accountability of the government in KP. Even after the elections in 2008, FATA had no elected representatives and was primarily controlled by the military with little input from civilians. Moreover, government officials had greater confidence in the efficacy of investments in public goods and institutional reforms in KP, where the social and governance infrastructure existed to support and legitimize them. By contrast, government officials saw little incentive to invest effort or resources in FATA or Balochistan, where many perceived that "it wouldn't take."
96
The Pakistani government's approach to NWA provides another departure from its typical policy of containment, albeit of a different kind. In NWA, short-term cease-fires graduated to informal accommodations as the government came to believe that militant groups in the region did not directly threaten the Pakistani state or core, at least for the time being. Given their geographic location on the border, Wazir tribes were a key political constituency cultivated since the Afghan jihad of the 1980s, represented well in the military, and potentially useful as leverage in a future Afghanistan political settlement. 
97
Pakistan's weak state capacity throughout the past decade has led it to generally pursue less-resource-intensive strategies, particularly containment and, on occasion, informal accommodation, both of which are more prone to indecisive outcomes and conflict resumption. Even when the GoP attempted to complement military operations with development in FATA and Balochistan, it produced very little return on the ground due to scarce resources, a lack of focus, and weak institutions for implementation. 
98

In two cases, the state did not adopt a counterinsurgency model typical of low-capacity counterinsurgents: the second round of campaigns in Swat and SWA. In both cases, the GoP's threat perceptions were heightened, although for different reasons in each case. The existential threat in SWA stemmed from the TTP core that had initiated a rash of suicide bombings across the country. By contrast, the heightened threat in the Swat Valley derived from the nature of the territory threatened-what Pakistani officials termed "settled areas" rather than tribal or unsettled areas.
In the case of SWA, the increased and direct threat to the Pakistani mainland forced the GoP to mobilize its scarce resources for a more-comprehensive and decisive campaign following the strong-state repression model. Between 2007 and 2009, the insurgents in FATA, and specifically the TTP insurgents based primarily in the Mehsud region of SWA, were able to project violence outside the tribal areas and into urban centers of Pakistan, including Lahore, Karachi, and Islamabad, yielding more lethal attacks in denser areas and much higher levels of civilian casualties than in previous years. The TTP also became an existential threat to Pakistan, deliberately targeting not only military outposts in FATA but military bases, barracks, command and intelligence headquarters, and even places of worship frequented by military personnel throughout core Pakistan, particularly in Punjab. This direct threat to the Pakistani mainland led the GoP to embark on a strong but repressive counterinsurgency campaign in the eastern part of SWA to dismantle the Mehsud command center. Though SWA state capacity was weak prior to 2009, the acute threat compelled Pakistan to make investments in rapidly developing it, beginning with a large and sustained military presence following two months of major ground operations to extend state reach and collect better information for intelligence-driven operations. Military occupation continues today with the Army's 9th and the 40th infantry divisions remaining in place to hold the area and consolidate their grip through some limited public goods such as the construction of roads and basic infrastructure. The treatment of the civilian population, however, has generally been con-Counterinsurgency in Pakistan 153 sidered harsh, with little attempt to repatriate and accommodate tribesmen, 90 percent of whom remain IDPs. 
100
101
FATA's and Balochistan's historically weak capacity and isolation had acquired a path-dependence due to increasingly prohibitive costs of development and a set of vested interests in the semiautonomous nature of these ungoverned spaces. 
102
103
While military superiority and manpower has been a focal point for the counterinsurgency literature, this case study of Pakistan's recent counterinsurgency campaigns finds mixed outcomes. Only one case found a correlation between military superiority (and quality) and the type of strategy adopted.
Military superiority is no guarantor of classic counterinsurgency approaches. In the Swat Valley, a more than threefold increase in troop levels resulted in an almost prototypical classic counterinsurgency strategy involving restraint, population protection, public goods, accommodation, and a decisive outcome. But when Pakistan's enormous military capabilities were deployed to the tribal regions of Balochistan from 2005 to 2007 and in SWA in 2009-2010, none of these processes or outcomes resulted. Though perhaps obvious, the utility of military superiority is constrained by what a state or military chooses to actually do with the forces deployed. The case of NWA is most telling. The Pakistan military is believed to have deployed 40,000 troops in the agency since 2010, but it has generally avoided military engagements-both major offensives and defensive encounters.
Meanwhile, higher force quality might be associated with improved fighting effectiveness, but it does not appear to be related to a particular model of counterinsurgency. The deployment of higherquality forces (more regular military from the eastern border and SSG forces) only seems to correlate with more-sustained operations, not with a particular model of counterinsurgency. In Swat, higher-quality forces were used for a more classic counterinsurgency approach, while in SWA, they were used for a more repressive, conventional campaign. Elsewhere, higher proportions of FC have been effectively utilized in support of a "second-best" strategy of informal accommodation, as appears to be the case in NWA at present. 
104
Perhaps more important than either the quantity or quality of security forces is their composition-that is, the extent to which they are representative of all the important subpopulations within a country, in terms of both overall numbers and representation in the officer corps and general staff. Particularly in a state like Pakistan, in which the military has played a dominant role, the composition and representativeness of the military appears to exert a major influence on counterinsurgency strategy toward different subnational groups.
In Pakistan, Pashtuns emerged as a powerful ethnic constituency in the 1970s. They have been highly represented-perhaps overrepresented-in the GoP security forces, with a greater share in the military (15 to 20 percent) than their population share (14 percent), an artifact dating back to the recruitment policies of the British Indian Army. Moreover, they comprise nearly all of the FC. By contrast, the Baloch are very poorly represented in both forces.

Although the United States engaged in a strategic partnership with Pakistan throughout the period under review in this study, the partnership was primarily motivated by the United States' need to obtain Pakistani cooperation on counterterrorism and counterinsurgency operations in Afghanistan. The United States did not make serious efforts to influence GoP counterinsurgency until 2007.

111
While assistance led to some improvements in GoP military capabilities, particularly tactical and operational ones, it seems to have had little success in fostering improvements to state capacity or political inclusion. Upgrading military superiority was, for the most part, straightforward and undoubtedly in the GoP's interest, allowing military assistance to translate into real gains. Assistance to alter regime structures, however, targeted more complex and contested institutions-a much more challenging goal. Moreover, continued U.S. reliance on Pakistan for logistics and other support made it difficult for U.S. policymakers to compel the GoP to do anything it did not perceive to be unequivocally in its own interest.
112
Equipment from the United States was perhaps the most coveted form of military assistance, from the Pakistani perspective. While a number of conventional weapons systems were sold to the GoP for leverage or access, U.S. provision and sales of lift capability, airpower, ground mobility, ordinance disposal, and night vision equipment made the Pakistan military a more competent force for fighting a counterinsurgency campaign. Beginning in 2007, deliveries of 26 combat and transport helicopters seemed to correspond with the increasing aggressiveness and operational tempo of Pakistani counterinsurgency opera-tions. These assets proved critical for a number of close-air-support missions and the SSG deployments in mountainous terrain to retake the Swat Valley in May 2009. 
113
114
115
As early as 2004 and perhaps earlier, a small SOF presence in Waziristan was deployed to provide support to the Pakistani military, but without mutual interests in operations in FATA, GoP commanders made a deliberate choice to underutilize these assets. Once the GoP internalized counterinsurgency operations in Swat and FATA as its own and committed to serious campaigns in 2009, however, the United States deployed ISR units to support the 11th Corps prior to and during its operations in SWA and Bajaur, as well as intelligence fusion cells embedded with the SSG and FC. Much of this support was politically feasible as long as it was kept largely secret from the broader public, though this eventually proved untenable as relations deteriorated. 116
For years, the FC was continually criticized for deficiencies such as unskilled personnel, poor training, inconsistent leadership, lack of mobility, outdated weapons, shortage of equipment, a proclivity for desertion, and compromised loyalties. 
117

Pakistani officials and analysts agreed that there were some improvements in FC skill sets, but they contended that these gains were a result of training on newly provided U.S. equipment rather than in basic skills. Organizational tensions between the FC and the regular Army and suspicions that U.S. SOF were used as a cover to spy on Pakistan, particularly following the Raymond Davis episode, 125 may have led some to discount the training's effectiveness. Nevertheless, FC training and investment seemed to expand the pool of capable counterinsurgency forces just as the need arose by 2009. 126
Economic assistance provided to the GoP from the beginning of the U.S. partnership in 2001 until 2008 essentially aimed to buy cooperation. Assistance was primarily focused on sustaining the government, with an initial $1 billion in debt forgiveness, deferral of debt payments, and direct budget support, largely in the form of cash transfers without any conditions or accountability measures. Most funds prior to 2008 were intended to reward Pakistan but lacked any transformative goals, with very little (about 9 percent of all assistance) dedicated to develop-122 Interview with former U.S. official, June 2013.

Critics of the U.S.-Pakistani partnership point to its failures and seek to explain why the United States did not get more out of it, in terms of both support for its Afghan policy and reforms within Pakistan itself. 
137
First, the U.S. and Pakistan simply had different and strongly held strategic interests. For obvious reasons, Pakistan placed its domestic stability above U.S. goals in Afghanistan. It feared another costly and bloody escalation of violence, such as the one that devastated urban Pakistan between 2007 and 2009. Instead of large-scale operations aimed at a decisive outcome, the GoP adopted a counterinsurgency strategy of informal accommodation in NWA involving peace agreements (and perhaps bribes) that appeared to be keeping a lid on violence. Additionally, some of the militant organizations in NWA and SWA were useful allies of the government, balancing or managing other, more-threatening groups.

Third, large amounts of money intended to buy Pakistani cooperation were never sufficient to fully shift Pakistani interests and behavior. . The GoP saw coalition support funds, the bulk of the funds transferred early on and 40 percent of the overall funding, as something it was owed. 
145
146
A fundamental shift in GoP strategy was too much to expect, despite the substantial amount of assistance the United States provided. While the United States struggled to influence GoP strategic behavior, it was better positioned to improve certain military capabilities and enable some successful tactical operations with injections 144 Deputy to the Special Representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan Daniel Feldman, "Testimony Before South Asia Subcommittee, House Foreign Affairs Committee," transcript, April 5, 2011; Gen.

Elahi, eds., Pakistan's Quagmire: Security, Strategy, and the Future of the Islamic-Nuclear Nation, London: Continuum International, 2010, pp. 75-92. Some U.S. officials acknowledged this problem. In reference to the $5 billion he helped raise through the Friends of Democratic Pakistan donor community, Richard Holbrooke stated that "Pakistan needs $50 billion, not $5 billion." General Petraeus also recognized this and said, "You get what you pay for. We have not paid for much of anything in Pakistan." See Nasr, 2013, p. 80; interview with Pakistani military official, July 2013. of material and economic support. These injections of tactical assistance would have an impact on Pakistani counterinsurgency practices, however, only when the government was already motivated to fight and shared the same threat perceptions of certain militant groups. This confluence of threat perceptions existed in Swat and SWA, but it has been absent in other parts of FATA and in Balochistan, which has been utterly neglected by U.S. policy.
The case study of Pakistan offers further support for the theory and empirical analysis presented in Chapters Two and Three. There is broad support for the contention that political inclusion and state capacity influence a state's general choices of counterinsurgency strategy in terms of the level of discriminate violence, provision of public goods, and openness to reconciliation. At a more nuanced level, when counterinsurgency campaigns are broken down over time and space, the predictions still hold: Regions with higher levels of political inclusion, institutional integration, and state capacity prior to conflict are more likely to exhibit counterinsurgency campaigns that look like the classic counterinsurgency model. Subnational conditions, in other words, may explain much of the variation in counterinsurgency approaches that cannot be explained by the properties of the state at the macro level.
Since these subnational conditions are also important determinants of conflict onset, counterinsurgency will take place more frequently in these weak areas, leading states to more frequently adopt strategies of containment or informal accommodation. The type of competitive state-building the classic counterinsurgency model envisions assumes that a state can impose its writ on these "ungoverned" spaces. Generating the local architecture and tools necessary to implement this approach in a sustained manner may be infeasible, however, due to local resistance and excessive costs, as has been the case for the Pakistani government in FATA. In these areas, governments may have to settle for second-best strategies like informal accommodation and may need to foster a gradual, decades-long approach to integration and state-building.
The Pakistani case offers no support for the claim that a country's ex ante possession of military superiority dictates the manner of its application or the type of counterinsurgency campaign the state conducts. States in a high-threat environment with other internal or external concerns may choose to economize their force deployment and hold most in reserve for other purposes. Pakistan's overall military superiority has never seriously changed since 2001, but Pakistan has employed different types of strategies depending on local contexts (what was threatened) and threat perceptions (who was threatening). The government chose not to deploy its military superiority in the early FATA and Swat campaigns but did so in Balochistan, because it judged the insurgency there to be more threatening to the state at the time. Likewise, how a state utilizes its military capabilities may vary. The government used its military superiority for strong-state repression in Balochistan, classic counterinsurgency operations in Swat, and containment in FATAeven after learning the lessons of population security in Swat. Ethnic representation in the security forces, however, can have some impact on a state's use of force, its willingness to make accommodations, and its ability to adapt. In the case of the GoP encounters with Pashtun-based militant groups, there is some evidence that empathy, information, and concerns for cohesion motivated the security forces that have a significant Pashtun presence to sign peace deals, minimize their use of force, and eventually-when compelled to take action-adapt a populationcentric counterinsurgency model. In contrast, in Balochistan, the GoP felt unencumbered and routinely defaulted to punitive measures, with little concern for the moral or strategic consequences of indiscriminate force or half-hearted accommodation efforts.
While political inclusion and state capacity seem to have been quite important in shaping counterinsurgency strategy in Pakistan, these features have been very difficult for third parties like the United States to manipulate through assistance policies, particularly in a nearto-medium time frame. Overtly tinkering with GoP domestic politics has proved to be not only difficult but also counterproductive for relations with Pakistan. The United States found it easier to bolster military superiority and enhance certain capabilities, with no certainty that these would be employed for counterinsurgency practices consistent with U.S. interests or values. U.S. material support for Pakistan worked best in areas of greatest mutual interest-particularly in Swat and, to a lesser extent, in SWA. There is always a risk, however, that some military assistance-particularly equipment and forces trainedmight be redeployed for purposes other than the one that motivated U.S. support. In the case of Pakistan, U.S. military assistance could easily be used to prosecute highly repressive counterinsurgency operations in Balochistan, where the United States has both limited interest and little influence.
The GoP's employment of second-best strategies like informal accommodation in parts of FATA (most notably in NWA) both mitigated some conflict and sidelined some insurgent combat power. As a result, Pakistan was able to concentrate its military superiority for decisive actions in Swat and later in SWA for operations that are still ongoing. Though harmful to U.S. interests in Afghanistan, the GoP's choice of informal accommodation in NWA may have been in its best interest in its attempt to ensure some stability and avoid the fallout of previous operations while consolidating its hold over territories in which it had retaken control.
Finally, very little could be done by the United States to change Pakistan's overall cost-benefit calculus in NWA and its strategy toward the region, at least in the near-to-medium term. For a time, the GoP's counterinsurgency goals and priorities were thought to overlap with U.S. policy goals in Afghanistan, with failures to act ascribed to a deficit of capability. The U.S. failure to change the GoP's strategy of informal accommodation in NWA to a more confrontational approach, however, was due to different strategic interests and divergent theories of "victory."

is nearly five times as high (60 percent) in the worst-case environments. Similarly, whereas fewer than 10 percent of all politically inclusive regimes have resorted to indiscriminate violence as a tool of counterinsurgency, 39 percent of regimes that are not politically inclusive and do not possess reasonable levels of state capacity have used such tactics. In other words, the chances of wide-scale abuse by security forces are four times greater among the worst-case regimes than they are among the more-favorable regimes.
The case studies of the Philippines and Pakistan in Chapters Four and Five broadly support these quantitative findings. The focus on specific countries also provides an understanding of how various factors operate over time and across different subregions, helping to explain the microdynamics of conflict in these countries. In both the Philippines and Pakistan, more-democratic governments were more likely to adopt a classical counterinsurgency model that sought accommodation with the reconcilable opposition and used violence relatively discriminately. This tendency was particularly pronounced in regions where the governments possessed the necessary civil capacity to implement hearts-and-minds approaches. In contrast, during periods when these countries were ruled by more-autocratic regimes and in regions where the state exercised little effective control, governments were much more likely to seek to contain and suppress insurgents through raw force.
The successes of U.S. policies in the Philippines and Colombia, in other words, were critically contingent on the character of the partner regime. This conclusion is not meant to deny the importance of U.S. assistance; to the contrary, the case study of the Philippines suggests that U.S. aid played a critical role in recent successes there. But similar U.S. policies with less-promising partner nations should not be expected to produce anywhere near the same levels of success. And as our quantitative analysis revealed, the majority of potential U.S. partner nations-including many that are central to ongoing U.S. counterterrorism efforts-are much less-promising partners.
Managing Troubled Partnerships 175
These results should be sobering for those proponents of indirect or light-footprint approaches who suggest applying them in less-promising environments than those of the Philippines and Colombia. What, then, should U.S. policymakers do with this information if they are not simply to throw up their hands in exasperation?
One possibility is to be highly cautious in the choice of partner nations, partnering only with those that have favorable characteristics. Unfortunately, such an approach provides little guidance about what the United States should do in cases where it has important security interests at stake in a counterinsurgency being fought by a less-promising potential partner nation. Counterinsurgent regimes may be unattractive, but not infrequently, the insurgents they are fighting are even worse.
A second option would be to force liberalizing reforms on its partners, as the United States attempted to do in El Salvador in the 1980s. 
1
A third alternative is to look for small wins-that is, lesser reforms and informal practices that might serve as the basis for achieving at least minimally acceptable outcomes. Even among the worst types of counterinsurgent regimes, a significant number have managed to achieve satisfactory outcomes-often through a negotiated settlement with insurgents-and to do so without the use of indiscriminate violence. These outcomes suggest that the United States and its allies should explore alternatives to the traditional approaches that constitute the canon of Western counterinsurgency theory.
The sobering statistics presented in Chapter Three and the lessons that can be gleaned from the case studies should encourage decisionmakers to reflect long and hard before committing to a counterinsurgent regime that lacks reasonable levels of political inclusivity or state reach. Regimes that score low in both of these dimensions are unlikely to bring a counterinsurgency to an acceptable end, and they run a high risk of resorting to indiscriminate violence while pursuing their indecisive campaigns. In many or most such cases, the United States would be well served to heed Daniel Byman's advice and "act more like a third party to a conflict rather than an open and strong ally of government forces."

Such an approach is similar to the development community's recent embrace of the principle of selectivity-that is, awarding aid only to those countries that are judged likely to use the assistance effectively. 
3
Exercising selectivity is critically important in the nationalsecurity field as well as in development assistance, but there will inevitably be cases in which compelling national-security interests are at stake and U.S. decisionmakers do not believe they can afford to run the risk of having even a problematic partner government defeated by even more problematic insurgents. Here is where the analogy to the development community breaks down. Aid agencies are much more capable of abandoning a partner government that routinely underperforms than are defense authorities-at least when the partner represents a critical national-security interest. In such cases, the United States may be left with little choice but to attempt to work with the partner nation. How, then, should it manage such difficult partnerships?
As the previous chapters have indicated, the traditional hearts-andminds approach fits poorly with the characteristics of most regimes waging counterinsurgency. The large majority of them are autocratic regimes with weak state institutions, poorly outfitted to offer broad political participation rights and public goods. The Western response has often been to attempt to make partner regimes into better governments-more inclusive, more capable, and less abusive. As discussed below, although this approach is attractive, it has a discouraging record of success. In particular circumstances and for particular purposes, however, it may be appropriate.
Many of the classic works in the counterinsurgency literature note a long litany of failed efforts to impose reform on unwilling partner governments, most obviously in South Vietnam.

In theory, the United States should have considerable leverage while supporting a partner regime threatened by insurgency. Particu-larly if the partner regime would be at high risk of defeat without U.S. assistance, threats to withdraw that assistance should be highly persuasive. The problem is that U.S. credibility and the reputations of key U.S. actors become intertwined with the fate of the partner regime. Withdrawing U.S. support for a partner might lead to the partner's defeat, which would be seen as a blow to the United States' global reputation for supporting its allies and would impose domestic political costs on those decisionmakers who had initially supported the partner regime. 
6
7
Stated in such linear terms, the leverage dilemma is almost certainly wrong: Taken to its extreme, it implies that the United States would have maximum leverage when it supplied no assistance whatsoever to the partner regime. Nonetheless, studies of development assistance do suggest that a donor's ability to exercise leverage over an aid recipient is significantly weakened if the recipient is critical to the donor's national interests.

Seldom is conditionality such an all-or-nothing proposition, however. Conditionality is often applied to specific programs, so in theory, the United States should be able to fine-tune its conditionality, prodding a recalcitrant partner forward by threatening to withdraw specific aid programs if the partner does not make satisfactory progress toward reform. Such an approach would not place the regime's survival at risk but would threaten to deny specific programs or funds that the partner regime finds useful.
Yet such fine-tuning of conditionality is extremely difficult in practice, particularly in conflict environments. In general, external actors are at an acute information disadvantage when seeking to influence the politics of foreign countries, especially countries in which formal institutions are weak and politics is even more informal and personalitydriven than in developed countries. As a result, aid intended to influence political structures in recipient countries is often manipulated by local actors to serve purposes opposite from the ones intended. challenges donor nations face in monitoring the effects of their aid are even more pronounced in conflict environments, where their personnel often operate under severe mobility restrictions. This dynamic was observed in both of the case studies in this report and can be seen even in heavy-footprint theaters such as Afghanistan, where the United States possessed many more transportation assets and capabilities for personnel protection than is the case in light-footprint interventions.
Turning to the key characteristics of counterinsurgent regimes that are the focus of this study, we find a number of reasons to doubt the ability of most partner regimes to implement wide-ranging reforms in the course of fighting.
In aggregate, the countries in our sample experienced very little change in their degree of political inclusion during the course of conflict. On average, their Freedom House democracy scores changed by only 0.10 point on the seven-point scale from the first year of the war to the last. Fewer than 9 percent of cases experienced large positive change in their democracy scores-that is, a change of two or more pointsduring the course of fighting. In general, then, it is unrealistic to expect significant liberalization as a part of a counterinsurgency strategy. As a peacemaking and peace-building strategy, however, greater political participation may be much more realistic. Many regimes become more inclusive and participatory as a part of the war termination process. In such cases, efforts to improve political participation are much less about winning hearts and minds by redressing grievances than they are about providing a framework that reconcilable opposition leaders will feel offers them realistic opportunities for political participation and influence over the allocation of state services.
Building the state capacity of partner nations is even more daunting, at least within a time frame that is relevant to counterinsurgents.

Lant Pritchett and his colleagues estimated how long it would take the worst-rated countries of the world to reach a level of state effectiveness equivalent to that of middle-ranked developing countries-countries such as Algeria, Tanzania, and Guatemala-on a variety of governance indicators. The results are sobering. If the 20 worst-rated countries continued to reform at their current pace, most of them would never reach the current quality of governance of middle-ranked developing countries, because their recent performance has been negative. Even if the worst-ranked countries experienced a miraculous change and started to reform as rapidly as the 20 fastest-reforming countries in the world, most would still require approximately 15 years to reach the middle tier of developing-country state effectiveness, and some would require three decades. If the bar were raised so that the goal were to become as effective as the 75th percentile of developing countries, most of the 20 worst-rated countries would require approximately 25 years to reach the goal, even if they consistently implemented reforms as rapidly as the top 20 fastest-reforming countries in the world.

More problematic are efforts to improve leadership and personnel systems. Many militaries in developing countries are built around patronage networks, where the military functions to provide important resources and/or employment to regime loyalists. Moreover, regimes frequently structure their militaries to minimize the risk of coups rather than to maximize the military effectiveness of the organization. Consequently, the quality of leadership is often highly degraded, and foreign military advisors have considerable difficulty changing these patterns.

Is it possible to make "bad" counterinsurgents better? The evidence assembled here and in our case studies suggests that it is extremely difficult to transform partner nations during the course of a conflict. Change typically comes slowly, and attempting to use external aid to leverage reform efforts has a poor overall record of success. Despite these findings, the literature on development assistance and international diplomacy suggests at least three ways in which conditionality policies are appropriate and, indeed, critical components of an overall partnership strategy.
First, aid conditionality is necessary to "sterilize" the negative effects of foreign assistance. Many observers warn that foreign assistance provides regimes with an independent source of income and patronage, making them less reliant on-and thus less responsive totheir own populations. 
15
16
While possible in theory, terminating assistance to a regime that has long received it is more difficult in practice. The central problem is that actors in the sponsoring state become personally invested in the success of the partner nation and the policies adopted toward it, making it difficult for them to even recognize failed policies, much less be willing to abandon them. High-level decisionmakers are very reluctant to cut their losses and withdraw even after overwhelming evidence of their strategy's failure has accrued, because of personal incentives to gamble on even low-probability efforts to rescue a failing intervention.

The research presented here has indicated that the United States can easily partner with relatively inclusive, higher-capacity regimes such as those in the Philippines and Colombia. Particularly where those regimes lack needed military capabilities, the United States can offer critical assistance. With regimes that are inclusive but lack capacity, the United States still has substantial options-albeit at reduced odds of success. In such cases, the United States should strongly consider whether informal accommodation would meet minimal U.S. security goals.
The more-challenging circumstances are those in which the regime is not inclusive, especially when it lacks both political inclusion and state capacity. The odds of success are not favorable in such situations, and the risks of abusive behavior by the regimes are substantial. If the United States still believes it must partner with such regimes 
19
Counterinsurgency is perhaps the most context-dependent activity in which militaries engage. Consequently, no universal set of policy prescriptions is possible. At least three principles, however, can be discerned from the case studies in this report and the broader literature on counterinsurgency and development to guide U.S. partnerships with problematic partners.
Alignment of interests. Where U.S. and partner-nation interests fundamentally diverge, there is little hope of a productive partnership to combat an insurgency within the partner nation. The United States' leverage and information are insufficient to effectively use conditionality to overcome such gulfs. Examples of fundamental divergences in interests include cases in which the partner nation does not perceive an insurgent group as a threat (and may even regard it as a partner for fighting proxy conflicts, as has sometimes been the case in Pakistan) and cases in which the United States demands the elimination of ungoverned spaces over which the partner nation lacks the resources to assert effective control. Less fundamental differences in goals can be managed, as the Philippines case demonstrated. Even so, such relationships entail risk-particularly the risk that the partner nation will use military capabilities developed with U.S. assistance for purposes that the United States opposes. In such cases, it is important that the United States make clear and stand by its redlines.
Pushing on open doors. Conditionality can reasonably be used to enforce redlines, to press for a limited number of important but narrowly scoped reforms, or to take advantage of specific moments in time when more wide-ranging political change is possible. In most cases, U.S. efforts to reform the partner nation should focus on finding areas of agreement, potentially helping to convene the networks of actors in the partner nation that can implement changes, and then providing the necessary resources and technical expertise. U.S. support to AFP operations in the Sulu Archipelago, as described in Chapter Four, is one such example of a narrowly targeted, intensive collaboration. U.S. assistance helped to transform the GRP strategy from containment to classic counterinsurgency by providing resources and knowhow, but it was successful largely because the governments in power at the time were predisposed to such policies. This approach accords with concepts such as good-enough governance and problem-driven adaptation, which are currently popular in the development community. 
20
Long duration. Given the lengthy duration of most contemporary insurgencies and the length of time it takes to build state capacity or institutionalize mechanisms of political inclusion, the United States should enter into problematic partnerships with the expectation that they will be long-term relationships, typically with low odds of success in the short-to-medium term. This point was highlighted by the divergent results of long-term U.S. counternarcotics assistance in Pakistan and counterinsurgency aid focused on immediate results. Similarly, the more-successful recent U.S. light-footprint interventions-those in the Philippines and Colombia-have already lasted more than a

Because only a minority of conflicts now end in outright military victory and the proportion decided by defeat on the battlefield has been steadily declining since World War II, the need to reach political accommodation with at least that portion of the opposition that can be accommodated without compromising core interests of the counterinsurgent appears to be increasing. Unfortunately, such accommodation is difficult for regimes characterized by low levels of political inclusion.
What can the United States do to facilitate such bounded accommodation? Depending on the precise circumstances, a number of instruments are available.
Bolstering the credibility of regime commitments. Democracies sometimes seek to implement accommodative solutions to insurgencies but lack the resources necessary to follow through on all of their promises. In such cases, foreign assistance can be critical in helping the counterinsurgent regime make good on its commitments, as the case of the Philippines illustrated. In other cases, even autocratic governments are willing to cut deals that would give rebels important political rights and resources. Autocracies, however, find it difficult to credibly commit to such deals-that is, to convince insurgents that they will stand by the terms of the agreement even after the rebels disband. The United States and other external actors can play a critical role in making such commitments more credible. Peacekeeping operations are the best-known mechanism in such circumstances. 
21
22
Promoting local solutions. Counterinsurgency theorists have long advocated more-inclusive, participatory politics at the local level as a key element of counterinsurgency. 
23
24
25
Seizing rare opportunities for more-dramatic change. Progress toward greater democracy is normally heavily contested, occurring only when incumbents are unable to resist demands for greater political inclusion. A prolonged military stalemate in a civil war may provide such an opening. In this situation, political reforms are less about alleviating popular grievances and winning the general population's hearts and minds in order to defeat insurgents. 
26
27
Accepting that the United States usually has only limited influence in light-footprint partnerships and that success is a long-term prospect implies an important corollary: The United States must undertake pol-"Diversity, Disparity, and Civil Conflict in Federal States," World Politics, Vol. 59, October  2006, pp. 1-50.  icies to mitigate the risk that its partners will use violence indiscriminately or otherwise engage in large-scale abuses while receiving U.S. military aid. Clearly such a policy is in line with American values, but it is also in line with U.S. interests. As discussed in Chapter Two, the discriminate use of violence is an important predictor of counterinsurgent success. It is also often necessary in order for the United States and other Western democracies to sustain their assistance to a counterinsurgent regime and sometimes to developing-nation partners more generally. The example of increasing Congressional opposition to aid for El Salvador in the 1980s has already been mentioned. Even more starkly, French popular reaction against the French government's support of the Habyarimana regime in Rwanda after the 1994 genocide was a significant factor in France's retrenchment from its military commitments in sub-Saharan Africa. 
28
Improving civil-military relations. As the case of the Philippines shows, even relatively promising regimes can have their counterinsurgency strategies undone by poor civil-military relations. Strong democratic oversight is typically associated with more-professional, higher-quality militaries, while many autocratic regimes suffer from problems of leadership and capability traceable to a heavy reliance on patronage networks, the need to prevent coups, and similar pathologies. 
29
30
31
Quality over quantity. There have been frequent debates over the relative priority of the quantity and quality of security services in a counterinsurgency context, with force ratios that measure the quantitative adequacy of security forces having recently come under considerable criticism. 
32
Intercommunal integration. As Pakistani operations in Balochistan in particular demonstrated, security forces that do not include members of the same ethnic or religious affiliation as the population in which they are operating are at particularly high risk of abusive behavior. 
33
Phase zero. Unfortunately, all of the prescriptions offered in this section are long-term propositions. Moreover, they are all substantially more difficult to implement during ongoing fighting than in peacetime. Consequently, when the United States partners with more autocratic regimes, it is accepting a high level of risk that its assistance will be abused by partner-nation forces. These warnings suggest that security-sector reform efforts such as those discussed above should be a central element of U.S. phase-zero, or peacetime, engagement strategy, not a peripheral concern or an issue to which significant resources are devoted only once a crisis erupts.

between Ulfelder and Valentino's year ranges for mass killings and Doyle and Sambanis' civil-war lengths to calculate an average value for mass killings per year. We chose Ulfelder and Valentino's year ranges because mass killings associated with a civil war could have taken place prior to the start date coded using Doyle and Sambanis' procedures. We then matched the civil wars in Doyle and Sambanis and the masskilling incidents in Ulfelder and Valentino based on approximate year and event type. In cases where a mass-killings record spanned multiple civil wars, we assumed that the mass killings were even across the civil wars. As discussed in Chapter Two, Ulfelder and Valentino also rely on a lower threshold of violence to code a case as an instance of mass killings. We selected as our break point an average of 2,000 or more intentional killings of civilians for each year of the civil war, with the number of such killings determined by the average of Ulfelder and Valentino's high-end and low-end estimates. Ulfelder and Valentino's data were collected for the period from 1945 to 2006; if a civil war was either ongoing or continued after 2006, we used 2006 as the latest year in the mass-killings calculation.

The government effectiveness variable from the World Bank's WGI provided one of our two indicators of state capacity. According to the WGI source document, "Government Effectiveness captures perceptions of the quality of public services, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's commitment to such policies."

Our second indicator of state capacity is Holtermann's state-reach variable. 
4
We derived our indicator of political inclusion from Freedom House's Freedom in the World dataset. Freedom House reports two scores per year: The first is a political rights score, on a scale of 1 through 7, with 1 being the most free and 7 being the least free. The second is a civil liberties score, also on a scale of 1 through 7, with 1 being the most free and 7 being the least free. We took the average of these two scores for each year, then averaged a country's combined score for all the years of a conflict.

Force-to-force ratios were calculated as the ratio of government to insurgent forces. For data on insurgent forces, we used the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) Non-State Actors dataset, Version 3.3.

Force-to-population ratios were calculated as the ratio of a country's government military forces to its inhabitants. As with force-to-force ratios, data on government forces were derived from the World Bank's WDI. This variable is entitled Armed Forces Personnel, Total and consists of active duty military personnel, including paramilitary forces if the training, organization, equipment, and control suggest they may be used to support or replace regular military forces. The original source of the data is the International Institute for Strategic Studies' The Military Balance. The indicator begins in 1989. If the indicator was not available for a certain country year, it was omitted from the average. Data on countries' total populations were also found in the WDI. Using this ratio, we created two binary variables based on two different break points: average force-to-population ratios of 5:1,000 and 10:1,000. We used both break points in separate cross-tabulations of the relationship between military superiority and the outcomes of interest.

c 2 = 3.6409, and the bivariate relationship is statistically significant at the 0.1 level (p = 0.056). If we are interested only in outright military victories, we find-perhaps surprisingly-that democracies are somewhat more likely to win, although the difference is not sufficient to achieve statistical significance. Relatively more-democratic states won approximately one-quarter of the time (six cases out of 23), whereas non-democracies won only approximately one-sixth of their counterinsurgencies (11 cases out of 65).
c 2 = 2.8236 and p = 0.093.

c 2 = 7.6469 and p = 0.006. Interestingly, the relationship between government effectiveness and indeterminate outcomes is not nearly as strong, achieving nowhere near statistical significance.
Depending on the precise specification of the relationship used, the results can range from no relationship whatsoever (i.e., high-and low-capacity states have almost exactly the same odds of achieving a favorable decisive outcome) to a weak relationship (i.e., highcapacity states tend to achieve better outcomes, but the relationship is not sufficiently strong to be statistically significant at even the 0.1 level).

Chris Paul and his colleagues, for instance, find that in only five out of 85 cases did government forces avoid "excessive collateral damage, disproportionate use of force, or other illegitimate applications of force."See Paul, Clarke, and Grill, 2010.  Similarly, when we compare Ulfelder and Valentino's list of "mass killings" by government forces with the list of recent civil wars, we find that governments engaged in mass killings (as defined byUlfelder and Valentino)  in more than two-thirds of all cases of civil war or insurgency. See Jay Ulfelder and Benjamin Valentino, Assessing Risks of State-Sponsored Mass Killing, Political Instability Task Force, February 2008, with data updated through 2010 by the authors of this report, and the list of civil wars taken from
Doyle and
We used the most comprehensive data on large-scale killings by government forces that we could find-Ulfelder and Valentino's mass-killings database, developed as part of the CIA-funded Political Instability Task Force. We then matched these events to Doyle and Sambanis' list of civil wars or insurgencies. We took the average of the high-end and low-end estimates of civilian deaths, then determined the average number of deaths per year of the conflict.
As before, relatively democratic is defined as scoring in the top half of Freedom House's democracy index (i.e., an average combined score of 4 or less during the course of a conflict).
c 2 = 6.9282, and the results are statistically significant at the 0.01 level (p = 0.008).
c 2 = 3.4599 and p = 0.063.
c 2 = 3.0911 and p = 0.079. If we use a 10:1,000 force-to-population ratio as the break point between counterinsurgents with military sufficiency and those without, countries with low force-to-population ratios remain substantially less likely to use force indiscriminately, but the relationship does not achieve statistical significance.
See, for instance, Clapham, 2004, p. 91.   
Experimental methods provide the strongest identification strategies, but they are difficult to devise in such circumstances, and they provide results that are highly context-specific.
The proportion of cases in each type of country was calculated from the entire sample of insurgencies that have taken place in the post-Cold War era, whereas the proportion of cases ending in an acceptable outcome was calculated using only those cases in which the insurgency had actually ended by our data cutoff date.

As in Table3.1, military superiority is not shown as a variable in Table3.2 because of the ambiguous quantitative findings on the relationship between military capacity and mass killings of civilians.

In the post-Cold War period, the Philippines have an average Freedom House score of 2.9 (approximately two points away from complete democracy), while Pakistan has an average score of 4.9 (two points higher than the Philippines and approximately two points lower than complete autocracy along Freedom House's scale from 1 to 7). The Philippines' Freedom House ratings during both of its insurgencies are among the 19 highest-rated (most democratic) of the 89 cases of insurgency in the post-Cold War era, while Pakistan's ratings from its insurgencies are both within the top 49. The Philippines' government-effectiveness rating places it among the top 25 cases, while Pakistan's rating places it among the top 47. Similarly, the Philippines' state-reach score ranks it among the top 14 cases, while Pakistan's is among the top 39. Taken together, these statistics suggest that the Philippines typically has ranked in the quartile of cases with the most-favorable characteristics (and often much higher), whereas Pakistan has ranked roughly in the middle of all cases.

The type of aggression encountered in [low-intensity conflict] is not as blatant as that in war. Subversion, sabotage, assassination and guerilla operations . . . may pose a threat to national interests, but the threat to national survival may be neither imminent nor obvious. . . . The inevitable ambiguity of the proper employment of force demands that weight be given to other considerations. Limited national interests, the presumption against intervention, and lack of feasibility help explain apparent tolerance of some undesirable situations. On the other hand, noninvolvement accepts the piecemeal degradation of security interests and tolerates unnecessary human suffering, both of which might be prevented or alleviated by a more active, if necessarily selective, approach.99   98  Most development funds in Balochistan get siphoned off by provincial officials.See  Lieven, 2011, p. 364; International Crisis Group, 2006b, p. 10.   99  Ata Ur Rehman, "Responsibilities of Pakistan Army in LIC Environment," in Pakistan ArmyGreen Book 2002: Low Intensity Conflict, Rawalpindi, Pakistan: Pakistan Army, 2002,  p. 203.

The Mehsud tribe came to form the core of the TTP, although it was allied with a number of militant outfits across FATA, foreign fighters, and even some Punjabi Taliban. Estimates of TTP force strength have been highly varied due to militant-organization defection, attrition, and the flow of militants between the Afghan and Pakistan theaters. However, in 2009, the Pakistani military estimated Mehsud fighters to number about 10,000, making total estimates of the TTP at 25,000 seem plausible, with upper-end estimates of 53,000 fighters. Over time, what made the TTP-and specifically the Mehsud component-so formidable and threatening was its ability to project power and violence outside of FATA and strike civilian and military targets in Pakistan's core urban centers. This was done through suicide bombings (of which the Mehsud/TTP force was believed to be responsible for about 70 percent) and complex, high-risk attacks, including one on the Army's headquarters.

Since 2001, the Pakistani government has focused on fighting three insurgencies: the TTP in FATA, the TNSM in the Swat Valley/ Malakand, and nationalist/separatist militants in Balochistan. Drawing on numerous detailed accounts, we next provide brief accounts of the conflicts and the campaigns by the GoP and its security forces to counter them.

After the fallout of 9/11 and U.S. military operations in Afghanistan, militants based in FATA who were formerly part of, allied with, or sympathetic to the Taliban began to assert their dominance over local power structures and administrative institutions.

First, assistance to improve state capacity suffered from significant implementation problems. The first major civil-assistance effort, the 2008 Livelihood Development Program for FATA, revealed the difficulties of development in conflict-affected areas. An audit of this program found massive shortfalls between targets and actual results on the ground and highly inefficient use of funds, with very high overhead and operating costs, due to security issues, a lack of local expertise, and some contractor fraud. Subsequent efforts reinforced a belief that civil assistance did not work well in highly insecure environments, nor did it easily complement anemic counterinsurgency operations. 
128
Successful light-footprint U.S. operations such as OEF-P in the Philippines and Plan Colombia have led many in the American defense community to argue that the United States will be able to protect its security interests in conflict-affected countries throughout the world through low-cost, indirect approaches. This report suggests that while such operations can indeed have positive effects, their prospects for success depend critically on the local context and especially on the characteristics of the counterinsurgent regime.
Success stories of U.S.-counterinsurgent partnerships have occurred in countries characterized by relatively inclusive politics and reasonable levels of state capacity. The governments of such countries typically adopt approaches to counterinsurgency that approximate the Western model, often (misleadingly) referred to as the hearts-andminds approach. Unfortunately, only approximately one insurgency in eight occurs in such best-case countries. The majority of rebellions take place in worst-case conditions-that is, in countries that lack both inclusive politics and state capacity. Regimes in this latter category overwhelmingly rely on blunt applications of military force to contain or suppress rebellion.
The quantitative analysis presented in Chapter Three paints a stark picture of the different trajectories that conflicts follow in these best-case and worst-case environments. Whereas only 13 percent of civil wars in the best-case environments fail to reach an outcome that the government finds acceptable (that is, either outright military victory or a negotiated settlement acceptable to both sides), the failure rate
An acceptable decisive outcome is one in which the government either wins an outright military victory or is able to negotiate a formal peace agreement following a military stalemate. Our coding of military victory was derived from a version of the dataset in Connable and Libicki  (2010), updated with data from Watts et al. (2012). Coding of negotiated settlements was derived from the data in Doyle and Sambanis  (2006), updated through 2008 primarily using histories from the Europa World Plus online database, supplemented with additional source material where necessary (e.g., Watts et al., 2012).
Our indicator of indiscriminate violence was derived from data on intentional government killings of civilians assembled by Ulfelder and  Valentino (2008).
