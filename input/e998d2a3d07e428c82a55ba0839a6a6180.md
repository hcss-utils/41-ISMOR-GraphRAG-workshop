Managing escalation for Moscow is taking measures during peacetime and war to either move or prevent Moscow's relationship with an adversary from going from one category to another.
According to Bartosh, the necessity to escalate or de-escalate with deterrence measures comes from the threat that emanates from the United States.
In "Deterrence and Coercion in Hybrid Warfare Strategy," he argues that United States' coercion aims to put Russia under external control.
The United States put in place a system of forceful coercion, "the main goal of which is the preservation of the militarypolitical and financial-economic military control by the United States as the leader of the West over the system of international relations and the military-political situation."
