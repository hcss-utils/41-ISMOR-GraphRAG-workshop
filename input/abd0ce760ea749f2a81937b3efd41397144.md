Moltke wrote and spoke on a diverse number of topics, which demonstrates his intellectual capabilities.
To remain within the boundaries of this study, this paragraph will only investigate Moltke's vision on command, staff composition, the use of technology on the battlefield, and instructions for large unit commanders.
He shaped his vision on two paradigms.
First, Moltke had no faith in any fixed system or set of rules to provide the solution for a problem, and secondly, he accepted the existence of uncertainty when executing a plan.
Despite these directives and guidelines, several commanders did not always comprehend the advantages of the new tactical and operational approach.
Some just failed to obey the regulations by stubbornly conducting frontal attacks.
Prince Frederick Charles, for example, would lose more men in the Franco-Prussian war of 1870 during the battle at Wörth than the entire Prussian force during the battle at Königgrätz.
