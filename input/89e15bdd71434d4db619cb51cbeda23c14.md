The Origins of Russia's Non-Linear Warfare: Relative Weakness to NATO Russia's adoption of what has come to be known in the west as non-linear warfare originates from Russia's overall relative weakness in comparison to the combined military forces of all NATO forces following the collapse of the Soviet Union.
This has been the case for decades; however, it should be noted that the gradual withdraw of US forces from Europe since the fall of the Soviet Union has been significant, and the relative combat power of Russia has increased recently as NATO forces, specifically US forces, have been reduced sharply.
At the conclusion of the Cold War, the US had approximately 300,000 military personnel in Europe, now the US troops in Europe number just 30,000.
Moreover, the US reduced its military presence not just in overall numbers, but in relative "posture" within Europe, meaning the 30,000 personnel are not a cohesive fighting unit that is deployed along key terrain in a heightened state of readiness.
Rather, these 30,000 personnel are spread out across multiple large joint headquarters, with smaller operational forces scattered throughout Eastern Europe and conducting liaison and security cooperation.
