In a significant area of intangible benefits, the broader public opinion of the military appeared to have risen substantially prior to 2022, and particularly following Russia's military campaigns in Ukraine (2014) and Syria.
According to polls reviewed for our study, the military was Russians' most trusted and approved institution as of 2021.
671 This improvement did not go unnoticed by contract personnel, a majority of whom interviewed during surveys reviewed for our study (60 to 70 percent) reported increases in professional prestige between 2012 and 2017.
However, this support does not universally translate into enthusiasm for military service.
Although the percentage of Russians who believe that every "true man" should serve in the Armed Forces reached 61 percent in 2021, this view was significantly more popular among respondents aged 55 years and older (72 percent), and has far less support (36 percent) among Russians aged 18 to 24.
