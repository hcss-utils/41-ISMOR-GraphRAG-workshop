A factor equal in importance to the challenge posed by Germany to the continued evolution of a liberal capitalist world system was the Bolshevik Revolution.
Germany was also at war with Tsarist Russia, a corrupt, tottering regime whose prosecution of the war ruined the peasant agricultural economy, viciously exploited the industrial working classes and sacrifi ced the lives and limbs of millions of soldiers.
The result was two distinct revolutions.
The fi rst was welcomed by the Wilson Administration as a step for Russia away from feudal autocracy and towards what it claimed would become liberal democratic capitalism.
Most importantly, the new Russian government under Alexander Kerensky, continued to wage war on the eastern front against Germany.
When this liberal revolution took power Wilson was able to claim that the war had been redefi ned as one between democracy and autocracy, hence his declaration to Congress that 'the world must be made safe for democracy', re-emphasizing his hopes that the liberal democracies of Britain and France, and now Russia, would prevail and usher in a new age.
Since they would be heavily indebted to the US they would have little choice but to accept American leadership.
