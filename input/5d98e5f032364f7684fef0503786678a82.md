These three examples from WW I demonstrate that mission-type orders were a key ingredient in several of the successful battles fought during the war and shows that it worked as a force multiplier for those units who were able to utilize it.
Furthermore, it shows how missiontype orders can be a tool to solve challenging or disadvantageous situations, hence, it is as relevant today as it was during WW I.
