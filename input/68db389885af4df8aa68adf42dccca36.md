address the twin puzzles raised by the evolution of U.S. airlift. First, why has airlift been generally neglected? Second, how can we explain the shorter periods of intense interest in U.S. airlift? In other words, this study attempts to account both for the U.S. Air Force's relative neglect of its airlift mobility mission (compared to its combat bomber and fighter missions) and for the innovations that have occurred in the airlift arena despite a continuing condition of neglect. Using the competing independent variables drawn from the literatures on bureaucratic politics and organizational cultures, this study tests ten contradictory hypotheses to explain variation in the dependent variable, the U.S. Air Force airlift mobility mission. To do so, the thesis employs longitudinal research on the U.S. airlift mission in five chronically-ordered case studies spanning fifty years, from 1942 to iii 1992, including World War II, Berlin, Korea, Vietnam and the Persian Gulf. Change is measured in terms of U.S. Air Force organization, force structure and basic doctrine. In the final analysis, although this study finds little use for the bureaucratic politics paradigm, it finds that a counter theory, organizational culture, does matter. Based on the empirical evidence of the case studies, implications are drawn for the theories' wider applications to the generalized phenomenon of neglected U.S. military missions. A likely related candidate includes the U.S. Navy's sealift mission, while unrelated candidates include minesweeping and the U.S. Army's special operations mission. The findings of this study should shed some new light on how these missions have come to be neglected and the prospects for innovation in these areas.
The Problem "The nation's highest unfilled priority is airlift" proclaimed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General David C. Jones, in a 1982 speech before the Council on Foreign Relations.

Based on the empirical evidence of the case studies, implications are drawn for the theories' wider applications to the generalized phenomenon of neglected U.S. military missions. In the final analysis, although this study finds little use for the bureaucratic politics paradigm, it does find that a counter theory, organizational culture, does matter.
Airlift certainly isn't the only mission that tends to be neglected by the U.S. Armed Forces.
Other likely related candidates include the logistics transportation arms of the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army, sealift and ground transport, respectively. Other unrelated missions that have a tendency to be neglected are the Air Force close air support mission, the Army's special operations mission, and the Navy's minesweeping mission. The findings of this study should shed some new light on how these missions have come to be neglected and the prospects for innovation in these areas.
Observers have for many years commented that airlift is a neglected mission within the Air Force. A 1990 RAND Corporation study conducted by Kevin Lewis lends support to General Jones' assertion, revealing three disturbing airlift trends between 1946 and 1990.

bureaucratic politics suggest that the Air Force would use the airlift mobility mission as a way of expanding its empire. As Allison and Morton Halperin write:
the health of the organization ... is seen to depend on maintaining influence, fulfilling its mission, and securing the necessary capabilities. The latter two interests lead to concern for ... maintaining or expanding roles and missions, and maintaining or increasing budgets [emphasis added]. 
19
Halperin himself, despite his assertion of the institutional imperative to empire expansion, cited MAC as an example of a organization that does not fit the bureaucratic politics mold.:
the part of the Air Force that has been least effective in challenging the dominant role of [Strategic Air Command] SAC is the Military Airlift Command [MAC], charged with the movement of men and materiel primarily for the Army. 
20
Subordinate has been the Military Airlift Command, a unit that suffers not only from having to fly transport planes instead of bombers but transport planes designed to carry Army personnel to distant battlefields. (By an interservice agreement,... the Army was denied the right to have its own fleet of troop transports). Operating a 'bus service' for the Army is not a highly rewarded task in the USAF. 
21
Organizational culture, in the term used by J.Q. Wilson and others (or essence, in
Halperin's parlance), may provide a more satisfactory answer as to why certain military missions tend to be chronically neglected. Much like the personality of an individual, Wilson defines the culture of an organization as "those patterned and enduring differences among systems of coordinated action that lead those systems to respond in different ways to the same stimuli." Organizational culture is primarily the byproduct of:
the predispositions of members, the technology of the organization, and the situational imperatives with which the agency must cope [which] tend to give the organization a distinctive way of seeing and responding to the world. 
22
23
The culture of the United States Air Force for a long time expressed the primacy of flying combat aircraft capable of carrying nuclear weapons. The Second World War brought glory and power to bomber pilots; after the war, the USAF became culturally a fraternity of bomber pilots. Bomber pilots rose to most of the top jobs in the service. This meant that officers who flew other kinds of aircraft -fighters, transport planes, or infantry-support tactical aircraft -discovered that they were not part of the dominant culture [emphasis added]. 24 21 James Q. Wilson, Bureaucracy (Basic Books, 1989) 105.
Organizational culture not only accounts for the neglect of the airlift mobility mission, but it also accounts for both core and peripheral learning that has transpired over the course of this fifty-year chronology. Wilson acknowledges that "innovation is rare," because it requires "qualities that are rare among government executives" such as "exercise of judgment, personal skill and misdirection." Nevertheless, his theory does allow for learning to take place. Wilson defines innovation as "any new program or technology ... that involve[s] the performance of new tasks or a significant alteration in the way in which existing tasks are performed." 
25
Halperin elaborates that "the bureaucratic system is basically inert; it moves only when pushed hard and persistently. The majority of bureaucrats prefer to maintain the status quo." 
26
27
28
Methodologically, this case conforms to Allison's "organizing concepts" for studying bureaucratic politics and organizational processes by answering the following four questions about policy-making for airlift: Who plays? What determines each player's stand? What determines each player's relative influence? How does the game combine players' stands, influence, and moves to yield governmental decisions and actions? 
29
Though trends are identifiable, budgetary allocations and the composition of the airlift force structure fluctuate on an annual basis. Roles and missions, doctrines and organizations also continue to evolve to reflect changing international and domestic political circumstances. Objective comparative measures include official documentation (i.e. roles and missions, doctrine), monetary resources (i.e., budget), tangible resources (i.e., force structure), and organizational composition (i.e., ATC, MATS, MAC, AMC).
Chapter Two, entitled "Theory and Methodology," begins with a literature review of the relevant bureaucratic politics and organizational culture theoretical material. From these two models, ten competing testable hypotheses are derived. Measures of the dependent variable include changes in airlift doctrine, organization and force structure.
Chapters Three through Six cover the individual crises which illustrate in detail the extent of airlift's neglect throughout its history. Each chapter begins with an introductory section which explains the organizational, force structure and doctrinal status of airlift prior to the onset of each conflict or crisis. Chapter Three, "Air Transport Command," (ATC) charts the historic proving ground of the China-India-Burma (CBI) theater in which the converted airliners of the ATC overflew the Himalayan (Hump) mountains to Introduction This chapter begins by examining the primary assumptions underlying Graham Allison and Morton Halperin's bureaucratic politics theory.

The Bureaucratic Politics Paradigm Graham T. Allison introduced the notion of three conceptual models: Model I (Rational Actor); Model II (Organizational Process); and Model III (Bureaucratic Politics), to explain social scientific phenomena in his 1971 landmark book, Essence of Decision.

\A1 -162. 8
Allison noted at the time of his writing that "most analysts explain (and predict) the behavior of national governments in terms of one basic conceptual model, here entitled Rational Actor or "Classical" Model (Model I)." In particular, for the purposes of this study, "theorists of international relations focus on problems between nations in accounting for the choices of unitary rational actors." In this process, "predictions about what a nation will do or would have done are generated by calculating the rational thing to do in a certain situation, given specific objectives." 
9
However, in the face of the contrary evidence already revealed, other forces must be at work which have the political power to disrupt the unitary rational actor.
Allison notes that "although the Rational Actor model has proved useful for many purposes, there is powerful evidence that it must be supplemented, if not supplanted, by frames of reference that focus on the governmental machine -the organizations and political actors involved in the policy process: Model I's implication that important events have important causes, i.e., that monoliths perform large actions for large reasons, must be balanced by the appreciation that (1) monoliths are black boxes covering various gears and levers in a highly differentiated decision-making structure and (

He introduces the organizational theories of Models II and III to "provide a base for improved explanations and predictions" because "Model I's grasp of national purposes and of the pressures created by problems in mter-national relations must confront the z«/ra-national mechanisms for which governmental actions emerge." 
11
Events in foreign affairs are understood, according to this model, neither as choices nor as outputs. Rather, what happens is characterized as a resultant of various bargaining games among players in the national government.

bureaucratic politics paradigm, which primarily explains specific governmental policy decisions as the byproduct of "pulling and hauling" between hierarchically-ranked government officials. Their stated purpose was to develop a new hybrid theory of first and second images broad enough to account for the actions of the majority of advanced western societies, that focuses upon the bureaucratic politics within nation-states as a way to explain international relations. 
15
They point out that because information is usually gathered and analyzed by large organizations (i.e., CIA or USAF), options are inherently finite. Because these options are a byproduct of organizations with established cultures, the "repertoire" ultimately selected usually reflects these organizations' biased aims and measures. Because these repertoires are formed by relatively autonomous organizations with their narrow parochial interests in mind, the "standard scenarios" that the organization adheres to and the resultant courses of action are often inadequate to accomplish the task. Finally, and most importantly, they argue that because implementation is governed by SOPs of large organizations, the resultant action may distort the intent of the decisions made by the senior players.

aggregated effects of these decision, policy and action games. Bargaining advantages come from:
formal authority, control over resources necessary to carry out the action, responsibility for carrying out the action, control over information that enables one to determine the feasibility of the action and its consequences, control over information that enables senior players to determine whether the decision is being implemented, and persuasiveness with other players, particularly those responsible for implementation. 
19
Members of an organization, particularly career officials, come to believe that the health of their organization is vital to the national interest. The health of the organization, in turn, is seen to depend on maintaining influence, fulfilling its mission, and securing the necessary capabilities. The latter two interests lead to concern for maintaining autonomy and organizational morale, protecting the organization's essence, maintaining or expanding roles and missions, and maintaining or increasing budgets. 
20
[the] budget" of the air mobility mission. There is an inherent contradiction within the bureaucratic politics paradigm, because in the process of protecting its dominant combat culture, in a relative sense, the Air Force comes to neglect its subordinate mobility culture. There is a fundamental tension between these competing cultures, which bureaucratic politics fails to address.
Donald MacKenzie points out that in principle the "theory" of the military-industrial complex it is a "similar relative" to bureaucratic politics: in an analytic sense, all that this theory does is to shift the emphasis to another set of organizations, the producers of weapons technology, and to their intimate relations with the armed services. The theory of the military-industrial complex is of course subject to precisely the same empirical criticism as bureaucratic politicsthat it grants too much importance to the particular set of organizations it chooses to focus on. 
21
In the councils of government we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex [emphasis added]. 
22
the armed services that use them; the defense industry that profits from building them, and Members of Congress who gain constituent favor by landing military installations and defense factories for their districts [emphases added]. 
23
24
Contractors are approached by defense procurement officials, and they jointly work out the specifications to be met when specific weapon systems are planned. Members of Congress who are interested in a weapons system -usually because pieces of it are manufactured in their states or districts -are kept abreast of such discussions and negotiations. They are given the privilege of announcing awards of contracts in their states and districts. 
2
In such an environment, costs are diffused among the general taxpayers and concentrated benefits are accrued by the members of the triangular relationship. The chummy relations among these three parties result in "a great deal of momentum for an expanded arsenal." 
26
In sum, the theory of the military-industrial complex sheds some light on noticeable trends within the weapons systems acquisition process as a whole such as:
why some weapon systems are bought rather than others, why a particular contractor is chosen rather than another, why a weapons system is bought at a particular time rather than another, and why it is so difficult to control the costs of weapons systems. 27
Although these are noteworthy trends, they do not account for the fact that transport aircraft are procured at a noticeably slower rate and in smaller quantities than bomber and fighter aircraft. Therefore, the theory of the Military-Industrial Complex has limited applicability for the purposes of this study.
As early as 1971, Stephen Krasner hailed Allison's Essence of Decision as the "definitive statement" of the bureaucratic-politics paradigm. Moreover, he conceded that "the bureaucratic interpretation of foreign policy [had] become the conventional wisdom." 29 Krasner attributes strength of the "bureaucratic web" to two factors:
(1) Organizational Necessity: the costs of coordination and search procedures are so high that complex organizations must settle for satisfactory rather than optimal solutions; (2) Bureaucratic Interest: bureaucracies have interests defined in terms of budget allocation, autonomy, morale, and scope which they defend in a game of political bargaining and compromise within the executive branch. 
30
misleading because it obscures the power of the President; dangerous because it undermines the assumptions of democratic politics by relieving high officials of responsibility; and compelling because it offers leaders an excuse for their failures and scholars and opportunity for innumerable reinterpretations and publications. 31 28 See Krasner, "Are Bureaucracies Important?"; Art, "Bureaucratic Politics and American Foreign Policy"; Bendor and Hammond, "Rethinking Allison's Models"; Welch, "The Organizational Process and Bureaucratic Politics Paradigms"; and Edward Rhodes, "Do Bureaucratic Politics Matter?."
29 Krasner, "Are Bureaucracies Important?," 419. 
30
Because he believes that ultimately "the behavior of states is still determined by values," Krasner is concerned that Model III excludes assumptions of values or rationality from its analysis. 
32
Neither organizational necessity nor bureaucratic interests are the fundamental determinants of policy. The limits imposed by standard operating procedures as well as the direction of policy are a function of the values of decision makers. The President creates much of the bureaucratic environment which surrounds him through his selection of bureau chiefs, determination of 'action channels,' and statutory powers. 
33
political leaders can only with great difficulty overcome the inertia and self-serving interests of the permanent government... administrative feasibility, not substance, becomes the central concern. 
34
"intragovernmental balance of power" is inaccurate. He contends that at a minimum it is "a loose hierarchfyj." 
35
31

34
determinants solely on the requirements determined by complex bureaucratic interactions suffices only during relatively stable times when policies largely remain in tact* 
6
before the niceties of bureaucratic implementation are investigated, it is necessary to know what objectives are being sought. Objectives are ultimately a reflection of values, or beliefs concerning what man and society ought to be. 
37
First, rather than co-existing as one sovereign organization among many in an ever-changing intergovernmental balance of power, the airlift organizational apparatus is embedded within a hierarchical arrangement with a clearly delineated military chain of command. MAC, like SAC and TAC, is a major command which is beneath the pecking order of the Air Staff, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the President. Second, as Krasner indicates, bureaucratic politics tends to account for a static condition which exists during periods of relative calm. However, it fails to account for the changes which have transpired in the airlift organization in the aftermath of five major crises which have occurred during its fifty-year history.
Two years later, in 1973, Robert Art denounced the second wave theorists for ambiguously stating their propositions and backtracking in many instances. According to Art, these theorists had "waffled" on the very propositions that supposedly distinguished their approach from the first wave. He argues that only by "tightening up" their 
35
36
37
propositions as follows can the second wave's bureaucratic politics theory be a useful, accurate and distinct paradigm:
(1) Organizational position determines policy stance; (2) In foreign policy governmental decisions and actions do not represent the intent of any one figure, but are rather the unintended resultant of bargaining, pulling and hauling among the principal participants.; (3) Organizational routine, standard operating procedures, and vested interests can affect the presidential implementation of policy much more than they can its formulation. 
38
(1) When senior executive players are split on their policy stances, the President by virtue of the division, has considerable leeway to choose that which he wishes to do, or that which he thinks he ought to do, or that which he reasons he must do.;
(2) When senior executive players are split on their policy stances, the President, to the extent that he reasons he must take account of bureaucrat's pressures, will respond to those demands that he thinks will damage him politically if he does not respond [emphasis added]. 
39
Moreover, he intends for his corollaries to elevate the "nation-state-as-unitary-actor" paradigm above bureaucratic politics, as he sees foreign policy not as the byproduct of Art, "Bureaucratic Politics and American Foreign Policy," 439 -443. 
39
To Art, Presidential intent is the key component for ascertaining the relevance of the bureaucratic politics model. The President anticipates both the Congressional and public reactions to determine which of the bureaucrats' position to choose. 
40
(1) it undervalues the influence (weight) of both generational mind-sets and domestic politics on the manner in which top decision makers approach foreign policy; and (2) it is too sloppy, vague, and imprecise as presently constituted to make its use worthwhile [emphasis added]. 
41
Nearly 20 years later, in 1992, Jonathan Bendor and Thomas Hammond critiqued Graham Allison's Model III on four points. 
42
40
4! Ibid.,
454. 42
They differentiate collegial decision making from bargaining by pointing out that it entails determining the rationale for and attempting to alter others' contradictory opinions rather than logrolling [emphasis added]. 
43
Second, like Krasner, they argue that Allison's model overlooks the impact of the hierarchical organizational structure of the government and its impact on policy-making.
Borrowing their ideas from Shilling, the authors contend that the fundamental ideas surrounding hierarchical decision-making are that it entails comparing detailed information and implementation options, and that the organizational chart determines
In the case of airlift, this translates into having to work within a clearly defined military command chain. For example, it would be a violation of protocol for the CINC of the Air Mobility Command to lobby the Secretary of the Air Force or Defense without first having consulted with the Chief of Staff of the Air Force.
Third, they argue that the basic assumptions of Allison's Model III are unclear and that a large proportion of its propositions appear to be "ad hoc observations not derived in any rigorous sense from the assumptions." They point out that a scientific proposition should be "an empirically testable hypothesis" that can help establish the validity of a purported theory. However, pointing to Allison's famous quote "where you stand depends upon where you sit," they note that Allison himself includes many other factors besides organizational status (i.e., baggage andor personality) to help determine the likely stand of various actors [emphasis added]. 
45
44
45
top. Thus, he will be more likely to advocate continued emphasis upon the aerial combat missions rather than mobility.
Finally, the authors argue that Model III is "simply too complex,... [so] that virtually no propositions can be rigorously derived from it at all."

(1) Students of international politics have largely failed to take up Allison's challenge to build and to test theory at the intra-governmental level of analysis; (2)  Despite the dearth of rigorous tests, there are convincing reasons to believe that... Model III is as useful as, let alone analytically superior to Model I; (3) Allison's motivating intuition that bureaucracies are important may yet be vindicated since there are strong prima facie grounds to believe some paradigm concentrating the analyst's attention on organizational characteristics or processes other than those on which Model Ill's focus might yield significant analytical gains [emphases added]. 
50
51
First, concerning stances, although Welch finds that Model Ill's political maneuverings can account for some departures from pure rationality, he points out that Allison's contention that "where you stand depends on where you sit," is much more complicated than it sounds. Allison complicates this seemingly simple concept with the qualification that each participant "pulls and hauls" with his vested power in the pursuit of policies to advance his concept of "national, organizational, group, and personal interests." He confuses matters further by stipulating that government officials bring their 
50 Ibid.,

[116]
52
(1) bargaining advantages; (2) skill and will in using bargaining advantages; and (3) other players' perceptions of the first two ingredients. 
53
34
55
In the final analysis, Welch concedes that the bureaucratic politics paradigm does have some usefulness in that it enables one to better understand the events leading to particular governmental policies. However, he concludes that in and of themselves, "concrete descriptions do not constitute theoretical progress:
To date it would appear that the bureaucratic politics paradigm, which more than twenty years ago promised to bring order and insight to an untidy field, has not lived up to expectations, because the project it heralded never got off the ground. 
56
Intragovernmental games can be so intricate and have rules so difficult to predict a priori that virtually any outcome can, ex post, be rationalized in Model III terms. Much of the criticism of Model III over the years has been limited to its logic, rather than empirical verification, for precisely this reason."
Rhodes performs what he calls an Ecksteinian "critical" test on the bureaucratic politics paradigm by examining naval budgets, acquisition, and force structure composition, a subject that he contends actors, spectators, and academics usually portray as being strongly affected by the self-regarding bureaucratic political pulling and hauling.
Specifically, he tests whether results can be accurately predicted strictly by taking into account the comparative authority of players driven by their selfish ambitions and viewpoints predicated on their bureaucratic roles. 
58
The issue -what kinds of military capability the U.S. Navy will possess -strikes not only at the heart of the Navy's essence by defining what kinds of missions the organization can perform but determines what and how resources will be distributed within the Navy, which Navy unions and bureaus will flourish or wither, and which naval careers will survive or perish. At the same time, the issue is not a politically salient one and, except for occasional debates over the acquisition of new aircraft carriers, rarely even makes it to the President's desk or troubles his relations with Congress. Thus, it is exactly the sort of issue that the literature suggests should be heavily influenced by bureaucratic politics. 
59
60
In sum, an examination of the Navy procurement budget, the Navy ship construction program, and annual shifts in fleet composition fails to reveal any statistically significant impact of the type predicted by Model III. Surface sailors do not shift force posture in favor of the surface fleet; aviators do not shift it toward naval air forces; and, to the extent we can tell, submariners do not shift it toward the undersea fleet. Insight into the Navy's well-known bureaucratic politics does not seen to permit us to explain the variations in naval force posture we observe. 
61
62
63
The concept of an organizational culture has its roots imbedded within the early bureaucratic politics paradigm articulated by Graham Allison and Morton Halperin in their 1972 article "Bureaucratic Politics: A Paradigm and Some Policy Implications."
Allison and Halperin originally coin the phrase "organizational essence," contending that "in pursuing what its members view as the essence of the organization's activity, e.g., 
62
flying for the Air Force,... organizational interests are often dominated by the desire to maintain the autonomy of the organization." 
64
63
66
(1) An organization favors policies and strategies which its members believe will make the organization as they define it more important; (2) An organization struggles hardest for the capabilities which it views as necessary to the essence of the organization. It seeks autonomy and funds to pursue the necessary capabilities and missions; (3) An organization resists efforts to take away from those functions viewed as part of its essence. It will seek to protect these functions by taking on additional functions if it believes that foregoing these added functions may ultimately jeopardize its sole control over the essence of its activities. The Air Force, for instance, insists on performing the troop transport role for the Army; (4) An organization is often indifferent to functions not seen as part of its essence 64 Allison and Halperin, "Bureaucratic Politics," 49.  or necessary to protect its essence. It tends not to initiate new activities or seek new capabilities even when technology makes them feasible. For example, the Air Force has devoted limited resources to airlift techniques while insisting on performing the transport function; (5) Sometimes an organization attempts to push a growing function out of its domain entirely. It is chary of new personnel with new skills and interests which may seek to dilute or change the organization's essence [emphases added].

Although he wishes that his book "could be set forth in a way that proved, or at least illustrated, a simple, elegant, comprehensive theory of bureaucratic behavior," after three decades of grappling with the topic, he now has "grave doubts that anything worth calling 'organization theory' will ever exist.:
Theories will exist, but they will usually be so abstract or general as to explain rather little. Interesting explanations will exist, some even supported with facts, but these will be partial, place-and time-bound insights.

(1) tasks that are not part of the culture will not be attended to with the same resources as are devoted to tasks that are part of it; (2) organizations in which two or more cultures struggle for supremacy will experience serious conflict as defenders of one seek to dominate representatives of the others; (3) organizations will resist taking on new tasks that seem incompatible with its dominant culture. 
Tl
Operating a TJUS service' for the Army is not a highly rewarded task in the USAF." This is because:
after the [Second World] War, the USAF became culturally a fraternity of bomber pilots. Bomber pilots rose to most of the top jobs in the service. This meant that officers who flew other kinds of aircraft -fighters, transports, or infantry-support tactical aircraft -discovered that they were not part of the dominant culture.

organization's essence. Because organizations resist core task alterations, real innovations tend by necessity to be engineered by "outside forces: academic scientists, industrial engineers, civilian theorists, members of Congress, and presidential aides -all helped induce the military to embrace programs that initially seemed irrelevant to (or at odds with) their core tasks. 
79
Moreover, he suggests that "it is for this reason, I think, that little progress has been made in developing theories of innovation" (i.e., they are so heavily dependent on executive interests and beliefs). For all these reasons, although he concedes the possibility exists,
Wilson concludes that organizational "innovations are rare." 
80
Besides it's initial establishment in World War II, core changes have occurred only twice.
The first transpired during the midst of the Vietnam War with the Kennedy and Johnson
Administrations' implementation of the flexible response strategic doctrine. The second core change occurred in 1992 as part of Secretary of the Air Force Donald Rice's "Global Reach -Global Power" strategy. During both of these episodes major changes occurred in the doctrine, force structure and organization of airlift forces. Other changes have been more peripheral in nature, usually only affecting one of the measures at a time.

Jack Levy admits that "the concept of learning is difficult to define, isolate, measure, and apply empirically, and scholars have only recently begun to investigate these questions in a rigorous and systematic way." 81 However, he cites the 1970s publications by Ernest May, Robert Jervis and Lloyd Etheridge as "path-breaking work on foreign policy learning."

fundamental," and usually comes about as the result of a "crisis or major event."
Furthermore, learning can either be "dialectical" (cyclical pendulum effect) or "linear" (irreversible and unidirectional). He attributes cyclical learning to three potential causes:
(1) advocates of lessons learned overstate their case; (2) there may be a prevalence of "uncommitted thinking" among high government officials; and (3) the uncommitted are greatly influenced by competing views among advisors or organizations which leads to "an oscillation between competing belief patterns."

to the extent that it involves changes in central beliefs, is expressed in behavior ... and is institutionalized by changes in organizational missions, operating procedures, and personnel, i.e., changes in organizational culture or structure, or patterns of promotion, or power of organizational factions and leaders [emphasis added]. 
88
This is reflected by the fact that since 1990, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force has been a fighter pilot, whereas before this decade, this position was held nearly exclusively by bomber pilots. In fact, Wilson notes that "from the creation of the Air Force until 1982, no fighter pilot ever had become Air Force Chief of Staff."

"Ibid., 26.

Levy defines organizational learning as "the institutionalization of individually learned lessons into organizational routines and procedures." w John Lovell posits that "organizations learn from experience to the extent that policy experiences become assimilated into organizational doctrine, structures, decision-making procedures, personnel systems, and organizational commitments."

Thus organizational learning involves a multistage process in which environmental feedback leads to individual learning, which leads to individual action to change organizational procedures, which leads to a change in organizational behavior, which leads to further feedback.

if we study only learning that is followed by policy change, we cannot understand when individual learning gets translated into policy and when learning gets blocked by institutional or political constraints. This is important for normative or policy purposes as well as for the scientific study of foreign policy.

This case traces in detail the many attempts that General William Tunner made to call attention to the neglect of the airlift mission during his reigns as the commander of the CBI Hump airlift during the Second World War, the Berlin Airlift and the Korean airlift. Despite his early failures to convince the Air Force hierarchy otherwise, nevertheless, his persistence and proven mission successes were able to overcome cultural indifference and eventually led to tangible improvements to the airlift mission.
Joseph Nye argues that ultimately "shifts in social structure and political power determine whose learning matters." 
98
As a result, Levy poses that the "key question is how intellectual and political processes interact to shape policy."
Changes in political conditions that facilitate the implementation of policies are not exogenous. Political leaders actively promote their ideas among key governmental elites and social groups to create a coalition around those ideas, so that policy entrepreneurship plays a key link between learning and policy change, this involves political maneuvering as well as persuasion." Although learning is primarily an endogenous phenomenon, Levy contends that there may be a significant correlation with external variables, which accounts for the fact that "external events are the primary source of learning about international politics:
The success or failure of past policy is particularly important. One hypothesis that emerges from the literature in... organizational theory is that people learn more from failure than from success. A corollary, framed in terms of policy impact, is that past success contributes to polity continuity whereas failure leads to policy change [emphasis added]. 
10
Levy warns of a possible pitfall every researcher should attempt to avoid when constructing a foreign policy organizational learning research project. A potential shortcoming of the learning approach is the failure to consider other causes as an explanation for empirical evidence that tends to link policy failures with organizational changes. Just because a country's foreign policy changes, does not necessarily mean that learning has occurred. To the contrary, it could be a manifestation of the interplay between international and domestic politics.:
Policy failure might lead to a regime change. It might also lead to a determination of political leaders in power to recover past strategic, economic, or reputational losses or to regain domestic support through diversionary behavior. Each of these processes can lead to policy change, but the primary causal explanation would derive from turnover or changes in the international or domestic political situation rather than from learning. 
101
our understanding of the role of learning in foreign policy and of policy change more generally will be best served if we abandon the attempt to construct an analytically distinct 'learning model' and focus instead on integrating learning processes into more comprehensive theories of foreign policy.

Therefore, far from being more stagnant than civilian society, Rosen contends that "military organizations have this political character to a greater degree than other bureaucratic organizations because they govern almost every aspect of the lives of members of the community." Four theoretical implications emerge:
(1) innovation requires an "ideological" struggle that redefines ... a new theory of victory, an explanation of what the war will look like and how it will be won; (2)  this new theory of victory must be translated into concrete new tasks that are performed everyday in peacetime and in war; (3) the new theory of victory must be reflected in a change in the distribution of power within the governing class of the community; (4) these new career paths can only be created by senior military officers who have political power within the service. 
110
111
(1) the initiative for reform [comes]  
In sum, Rosen finds that mavericks tend to be less successful in fostering innovation, even with powerful civilian allies, because they kindle the rancor of the entrenched military establishment, which becomes more resistant to change. 
113
( As was alluded to before, General Tunner can genuinely be called the father of U.S. military airlift. Beginning with an organization without a doctrine that was patched together with converted airliners in the heat of the Second World War, he managed to convince the Secretary of the Air Force of the need for an aircraft designed from the ground up to be an airlifter (e.g., the C-124 Globemaster). He was later the driving force "must fit a theory, but have a good chance of not doing so." This is qualified by the fact that "nothing that suggests a theory... can also test it" because "anything giving rise to a theory will certainly not falsify it." 118 Therefore, the distinct trait of a crucial case is that it is: a case that must closely fit a theory if one is to have confidence in the theory's validity, or, conversely, must not fit equally well any rule contrary to that proposed. The same point can be put thus: in a crucial case it must be extremely difficult, or clearly petulant, to dismiss any finding contrary to theory as simply 'deviant,' and equally difficult to hold that any finding confirming theory might just as well express quite different regularities. " 9
Important for the purposes of this study, Eckstein emphasizes that "must-fit cases...
will not commonly occur" because they must have the attributes of a "well-designed experiment," in that their outcomes must be as precise and measurable as experimental observations. Therefore, given their rarity, another option is to probe "most likely" or "least likely" cases -"cases that ought, or ought not, to invalidate or confirm theories if any cases can be expected to do so."

The slogan of proliferation of theories is much more important for sophisticated than for naive falsification. ... For the naive falsificationist a 'refutation' is an experimental result which, by force of his decisions, is made to conflict with the theory under test. But according to sophisticated falsification one must not take such decisions before the alleged 'refuting instance' has become the confirming instance of a new, better theory.

it is also desirable to have multiple theories that predict mutually exclusive outcomes. In such a situation, prediction 'success' has a much clearer meaning than it does when only one theory is being considered, or when multiple theories are being considered, but the theories are complementary rather than competing explanations. 13 °
In case studies particularly, researchers are often concerned with in a pattern of actions over a period of time.:
The process tracing approach attempts to uncover what stimuli the actors attend to; the decision process that makes use of these stimuli to arrive at decisions; the actual behavior that then occurs, the effect of various institutional arrangements on attention, processing, and behavior; and the effect of other variables of interest on attention, processing , and behavior. BI In other words, as George and McKeown explain it, process tracing consists of an effort to reconstitute players' understandings of their own predicaments and then try to establish a theory based on their actions.

that which supplements hypothesis testing based on the overall evaluation of the case with a close processual analysis of the unfolding of events over time within the case.

( Who Plays?
First, the criteria for an individual to count as a "player in the national security policy game" is to "occupy a position that is hooked on to the major channels for producing action on national security issues." 
139
The second step entails identifying the players' individual interests, "principally dictated by parochial priorities and perceptions associated with the position the player occupies. However, these propensities are filtered through the baggage that players bring to positions." 140 This equates to the "where you stand depends on where you sit" analogy, qualified by the "baggage" one brings to his seat. This study seeks to determine which has more influence over the airlift mobility mission, seats or baggage. Bureaucratic politics reflects seats, whereas organizational culture reflects baggage.
The President is uniquely qualified to reflect the national interest. His concerns encompass the entire spectrum of national and international political, military, economic and social issues. His primary driving force is re-election during his first term and a respectable place in history during his second term. More than likely, he is able to devote little, if any, attention to the matter of the airlift mobility mission during his time in office.
However, if he does, change is most likely to occur.
The Secretary of Defense is the sole cabinet member directly responsible to the Carter Administration. Whatever the case may be, all service secretaries are the President's men and therefore are players on the same team. Nevertheless, they all have an incentive to out-shine the others if they have aspirations to higher office in the future.
Therefore, each should want to be perceived as a go-getter with a vision for the future.

Magazine, May 1995, 58. l42
143 See the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act (Public Law 99 -433, 1 October 1986) in the Congressional Record, vol. 132, no. 119, proceedings of the 99th Cong., 2d sess, p. H 6856. Title II, Part A, 17. states "requires the JCS Chairman and Vice Chairman to be from different services."
Continental interests (e.g., if the Chairman is from the Navy or Marines, the Vice will be from the Army or Air Force, and vice versa). Moreover, these positions are supposed to rotate, if the President concurs, from one service to another, although this does not always happen. The tenure for the position is normally two two-year terms (with a third term allowable), beginning 1 October of odd-numbered years. The position is usually followed by retirement from the service.
The Chief of Staff of the Air Force is the embodiment of the reigning culture within the Air Force officer corps. Unlike the Secretary, the Chief of Staff is a careerist whose loyalty is tied most closely to his service. He will have served approximately thirty years climbing the rungs of power before finally reaching the pinnacle of Air Force command, his most recent command having been one of the Major Commands in the Air Force (i.e., ACC, AMC, USAFE, PACAF, etc.). From the position of Chief, he plays a dual-hatted role as both the blue-suited head of the service as well as the purple-suited member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In his seat, the only position to which he can still aspire to climb as an active duty military officer is to the Vice or Chairmanship of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Otherwise, this four-year position is usually followed by retirement from the service.
The Commander in Chief of Air Mobility Command is usually a newly pinned four-star general officer who has served approximately twenty-eight years by the time he becomes a CINC. Not unlike the CSAF, he most likely embodies the dominate culture of the Air Force. However, unlike the CSAF, in most cases he can still aspire to command K 62 another position in the Air Force after this assignment if he leaves within two years, including the Chief of Staff position itself Otherwise, the CINC would retire after a four-year tenure at the helm of the Air Mobility Command.
The third question surrounds the relative influence of each of these players. As Allison notes, "power is a function of resources associated with position, the player's effectiveness in exploiting these positional resources, and the player's reputation for doing so."
144
145
The fourth and final question concerns the "rules" of interaction among the designated players. Again, according to Allison, "action channels structure the game by preselecting the major players, determining their usual points of entrance into the game, and distributing particular advantages and disadvantages for each game." 146 A President rarely, if ever, is directly involved with strategic airlift mobility issues. Rather, he normally establishes, with the advice of the Secretary of Defense, the strategic doctrine for his administration, which has an indirect, but substantial effect on U.S. Air Force doctrinal treatment of the strategic airlift mobility mission. The Secretary of the Air Force is not in the formal chain of command as part of the National Command Authority, which stretches from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commander-in-chief of the applicable unified or specified command. 
147
However, his expertise is heavily counted on as the sitting member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, where he has the direct ear of the Chairman, who in-turn is the designated principal military advisor to the President, National Security Council and Secretary of Defense. 
148

It states in Ch. 5, Sec. 151, "(d) Advice and Opinions of Members Other than the Chairman. -(1) A member of the JCS may submit to the Chairman advice or an opinion in disagreement with advice or an opinion in addition to advice presented by the Chairman to the President, NSC, or the SECDEF. If a member submits such advice or opinion, the Chairman shall present the advice or opinion of such member at the same time he presents his own advice to the President, NSC or SECDEF, as the case may be."
I4s lbid., the terms "unified command," "specified command" and "combatant command" are defined in Ch. 6, Sec. 161, (c) definitions (1) The term 'unified command' means a military command which has broad, continuing missions and which is composed of forces from two or more military departments; (2) The term 'specified command' means a military command which has broad, continuing missions and which is normally composed of forces from a single military department; (3)  
Having identified the major players, the second task is to specify the "elements," (i.e. dependent variables) to be used to investigate this case study. 
151
152
153
Besides combat experiences, doctrine has been subject to change due to new technologies or national security policies. The postwar planners neglected airlift in their postwar force structure because of their doctrinal focus upon strategic bombing, which had been used to justify the U.S. Army Air Corps' case for autonomy.
Roles and missions are determined by formal interservice agreements, approved by the Secretary of Defense. These agreements specify the primary warfighting responsibilities of each individual service. In addition, the services may be assigned combat support missions to assist another service in performing its role.
Mission neglect tends to arise when one military service is held responsible for providing a combat support function for another militarily service. Pointing to the Key West agreement in 1948, Morton and David Halperin argue that it has "contributed to some of the most glaring failures and shortcomings of American military policy in the postwar era," including strategic airlift. 
156
157
Comparing the annual budgetary outlays for airlifters, fighters, and bombers is a tangible measure of the emphasis placed upon air mobility, relative to air combat missions. As Lawrence Korb and George Brown point out, "the outcome of the budgetary process ultimately shapes the character of American military forces. Its importance cannot be overstated." 
159
161
162
The trend as to whether or not more resources are being devoted to airlift is deduced by measuring the portion of the Air Force budget allocated to airlift procurement over time.
Graham Allison and Frederic Morris depict the weapons system development process as rife with bureaucratic politics. They posit that "no single authority can make all the important [procurement] decisions" because of the large number of complicated decisions that must be made during the long duration required in the development of any new weapons system. Because of the complexity involved, "organizations play a major 161 Ibid., 584. 
162
role in weapons development." In particular, they identify the "services and their subunits
[as] the primary actors" in the weapons system developmental process. The resultant force structure is determined by the "goals and procedures and especially the missions and weapons systems to which services (and subunits) are committed." Finally, although politicians may "disturb this process; only rarely do they control it." 
163
particularly if "the mission is essential not to the service performing it but to a sister service." Allison and Morris cite airlift as an example of such a mission. They note that weapon systems which must be developed through the coordination between "services and missions will be poor and will develop slowly." Finally, they conclude that "organizational interests and missions are better predictors of weapon characteristics and uses than are appointed officials' pronouncements."  the average age of the weapons systems, and resultant technological sophistication is directly compared between the bomber, fighter and transport fleets. Technological development is measured by the number of new weapon systems researched, developed and deployed. In addition to new aircraft, technology includes any modifications made to existing airframes to enhance their capabilities to handle more complex tasks.
Organization Throughout airlift's short history, its relative importance to the Air Force has always been manifest by its placement within the hierarchy of major flying commands.
The overall organization of the Air Force is continually evolving, but generally speaking, it is composed of combatant commands and supporting commands, including air mobility.
The organization of military airlift forces has evolved from a non-combatant transport service to its new plateau as an ostensibly co-equal major combatant command which is a key component of the unified command structure. This study reveals, however, that due to culturally induced personnel constraints, airlift's organizational stature has never attained the status of its sister bomber and fighter commands. The relative emphasis placed in each of these commands is measured in terms of the rank of their commanders (i.e., four-star versus three-star) as well as the background of the various commanders (i.e., fighters and bombers versus transports).  First, the two theories offer different possibilities for organizational learning.
Bureaucratic politics posits that organizations are stagnant and resistant to attempts at innovation and change because it increases organizational uncertainty. Halperin contends: the bureaucratic system is basically inert; it moves only when pushed hard and persistently. The majority of bureaucrats prefer to maintain the status quo, and only a small group is, at any one time, advocating change. Time and resources or any one person in the bureaucracy are limited, and when a participant does desire change, he must choose carefully the issues on which to do battle. 
166
Wilson agrees that "organizations resist innovation." In fact, he contends that "they are supposed to resist it:
The reason an organization is created is in large part to replace the uncertain expectations and haphazard activities of voluntary endeavors with the stability and routine of organized relationships. The standard operating procedure (SOP) is not the enemy of organization; it is the essence of organization. 
167
168
Innovation in these cases requires an exercise of judgment, personal skill, and misdirection, qualities that are rare among government executives. And so, innovation is rare. 
169
Second, these theories make different predictions concerning organizational behavior during crisis situations. Allison uses the Cuban missile crisis to illustrate his models because he observes that in a situation of "ultimate danger to the nation," a closed circle of advisors considered all the possible courses of action and made a decision, independent from their bureaucratic seats. : Such central, high-level, crisis decisions would seem to be the type of outcome for which Model I analysis is most suited. Model II and Model III are forced to compete on Model I's home ground. The dimensions and factors uncovered by Model II and Model II in this case will therefore by particularly suggestive. 
170
171
(B2) the Secretary of Defense usually has to resolve inter service parochial disputes over airlift roles and missions during times of relative calm, and rarely following the use of force.
On the other hand, organizational culture predicts that a crisis situation should intensify parochial competition because it enables each service to exhibit its effectiveness at the expense of the others. Halperin observes that: in periods of crisis, career officials calculate how alternative policies and patterns of action will affect future definitions of roles and missions. Participants have learned over time that changes in roles and missions frequently occur during crises. Thus an organization concerned about its mission and desiring either to expand it or prevent other from expanding theirs at its cost will be particularly alert to both challenges and opportunities during a crisis. 
172
The third set of propositions tests the tendency of organizations to expand their turf, as opposed to shunning opportunities at expansion in order to maintain autonomy by sticking to the knitting they know best. In their 1972 article, "Bureaucratic Politics: A Paradigm and Some Policy Implications," Allison and Halperin contend that: members of an organization ... come to believe that the health of their organization is vital to the national interest. The health of the organization ... is seen to depend on ... securing the necessary capabilities [which include] maintaining or expanding roles and missions, and maintaining or increasing budgets. 
173
172
50. 173
The bureaucratic politics proposition posits that: (B3) the Secretary of the Air Force should seek to protect and or expand the turf of the airlift fleet by branching out into other functions that require more diverse aircraft (i.e., helicopters for special ops).
By 1974, Halperin is the first to submit that "organizations are often prepared to accept less money with greater control rather than more money with less control." This is because "even with the smaller funds they are able to protect the essence of their activities." 174 Fifteen years later, J.Q. Wilson agrees that the apparent "imperialistic" nature of governmental bureaus is a naive simplification and he expands upon this notion to propose that "budget increases that threaten to reduce agency autonomy are often but not always resisted." 172 Instead of empires, organizations strive for autonomy, or "relatively undisputed jurisdiction," because:
to a government executive an increase in the autonomy of his or her agency lowers the cost of organizational maintenance by minimizing the number of external stakeholders and bureaucratic rivals and maximizing the opportunity for agency operators to develop a cohesive sense of mission. Foregoing certain new tasks and their associated budget increases seems like a reasonable price to pay for these benefits. 
176
a strong sense of mission implies an organizational jurisdiction coterminous with the tasks that must be performed and the resources with which to perform them. 
177
178
Fourth, bureaucratic politics contends that players' stands tend to reflect the positions they hold in the bureaucratic structure. In Essence of Decision, Allison borrows the saying originally used by Don K. Price that "where you stand depends on where you sit:
For large classes of issues -e.g., budgets and procurement decisions -the stance of a particular player can be predicted with high reliability from information about his seat. 
179
Organizational culture, on the other hand, holds that sometimes people are given certain seats based upon the viewpoints they already espouse, or the baggage that they hold. Allison himself admits that "each person comes to his position with baggage in tow." 180 Therefore, although "propensities and priorities stemming from position are sufficient to allow analysts to make reliable predictions about a player's stand in many cases," nevertheless he concedes that:
these propensities are filtered through the baggage that players bring to positions. Some knowledge of both the pressures and the baggage is thus required for sound predictions. 
181
182
In other words, if his formative experiences were in the fighter or bomber communities, then he should be more likely to favor the acquisition of fighter and bomber aircraft rather than airlift aircraft. 
183
Halperin asserts in Bureaucratic Politics and Foreign Policy that:
the civilian heads of the three military services, ... especially if they have had little previous personal involvement in a particular issue, are likely to come to reflect the interests of their organization. ... The pressures on Cabinet officers from thensubordinates, as well as from outside pressure groups, is so great that they often come to see themselves as their department's representative to the President. For example, James Forrestal when Secretary of the Navy explicitly saw his job as maintaining the autonomy of the Navy. 
184
185
Taken together, these ten competing hypotheses can be depicted as follows:
NEGLECTED MISSIONS MODEL It is important to note that these testable hypotheses are not meant to be all-encompassing. On the contrary, they are supposed to be illustrative in nature. 
The third task is to select the historical case studies to be used to measure the influence of these two disparate theoretical frameworks. 
186
McKeown:
the most distinctive feature of case studies is what we have termed a process-tracing approach to analyzing behavior. Such an approach represents a break from orthodox quasi-experimental logic, both in its emphasis on the hypothesis-formation process and in its approach to supporting claims for the existence of some causal process in a given situation. 
187
This longitudinal comparative case study method conforms to an important analytical criterion that Alistair Johnston uses for his study of "strategic culture":
The content analysis of strategic cultural objects begins at the earliest point in history that is accessible to the researcher, where initial strategic culture -derived preference rankings may reasonably be expected to have emerged. From this point one moves systematically forward. This way one can determine whether later strategic culture is a direct descendent of a formative strategic culture, a return to earlier patterns, a break from more recent ones, a reflection of a particular subculture, or non-existent. 
188
an integrated system of symbols (e.g., argumentation structures, languages, analogies, metaphors) which acts to establish pervasive and long-lasting strategic preferences by formulating concepts of the role and efficacy of military force in interstate political affairs, and by clothing these conceptions with such and aura of factuality that the strategic preferences seem uniquely realistic and efficacious. 
189
190
,89 Ibid., 
45. 190
used to justify the supremacy of the strategic bombing mission was the theory of mutual assured destruction (MAD). Nuclear strategy was couched in various symbolic terms during the 1960s and 1970s, such as "counterforce," "first-strike / second-strike," "nuclear war-fighting," "systems analysis," "thinking about the unthinkable," "shot across the bow," "limited nuclear options." All these terms were developed by the "strategists of the [Air Force's] RAND Corporation in the 1950s." These "defense intellectuals," or as Fred Kaplan calls them, "Wizards of Armageddon:
move [d] freely through the corridors of the Pentagon and the State Department rather as the Jesuits through the courts of Madrid and Vienna, three centuries ago, ... by the 1970s and especially into the eighties, the ideas of these thermonuclear Jesuits would have so thoroughly percolated through the corridors of power -and through their annexes in academia -that, at least among fellow members of the congregation, their wisdom would be taken almost for granted, their assumptions worshipped as gospel truth, their insight elevated to an almost mystical level and accepted as dogma [emphasis added]. 191
The fourth phase concerns the presentation of the case study results. George and
McKeown note that many studies tend to neglect a discussion of any problems with methodology that may have been experienced during the course of the investigation.
Another trend is to resort too often to an unscientific chronological description as a framework for organizing the case study narrative:
We see no reason why presentation of the case must always follow a chronological narrative. As theory becomes better developed and as research focuses on more tightly defined targets, there will be less point in presenting long narratives. to analyze the content of a sample of objects from the period under study, compare these with a sample from a past period, and assume that if there is congruence in preference rankings, a strategic culture exists and has persisted across this historical time. The longer the period across which this congruence stretches, the more powerful and persistent the strategic culture [emphasis added]. 
193
The second step entails testing "for the presence of and congruence between preference rankings found in a sample of say, policy documents taken from the decision 'Johnston, "Thinking About Strategic Culture," 49.
process in the period of interest, and between these documents and the original objects of analysis." Moreover, "these documents should be taken from different times, across different strategic contexts." If organizational behavior is influenced by strategic culture,
"it must at least appear to have an effect on the action-oriented perceptions of key decision-makers." For the purposes of this study, the Air Force preference for the strategic bombing mission will be shown to be the case in both the context of massive retaliation and flexible response.
Third, one must "test for the effects of decision-makers' preferences rankings on politicio-military behavior." This may be done in three different ways. First of all, "strategic culture may provide a limited range of choices or tendencies, but an intervening variable (e.g., leadership change, elite transformation, bureaucratic politics, technology cycles, internal debate or external crisis) determines which tendency kicks in and when."
In this case, the period following each of the crises case studies is shown to spawn doctrinal, force structure and organizational adjustments to airlift capabilities in order to compensate for the neglect that became evident during the preceding conflict. Secondly, "strategic culture ... may appear as a consistent set of ranked preferences which persist across time and across strategic contexts." In this case, although airlift may experience improvements after each of the crises, it nevertheless remains on the lower rung of the Air Force pecking order. Third, "strategic culture may mediate or moderate the effects of another independent variable." In this case, the Air Force's organizational culture of Strategie bombing may dampen the effects of airlift bureaucratic politics, so that it never achieves parity with the offensively-oriented fighter and bomber missions. In summation:
The key issue is how to measure the separate effects of a potentially constant or slow-to-change variable like strategic culture, on an outcome that is supposed to vary like strategic choice. 
194
The fifth and final task is to consider the way that differences in the hypotheses can be explained to "further the assessment or refinement of existing theory." 195 George and McKeown believe that the "critical" goal is to glean valid lessons from the case results. As they point out, a researcher may succeed at predicting, yet in the process determine that the paradigm must be reconstructed or modified so that it can predict with greater precision and specificity:
This can occur when the case study uncovers causal processes hitherto undetected or leads to a reformulation of previously postulated causal processes likely to be more intensive in situations where existing modes seem to be performing poorly.

Service commands." 1 ' According to LaFarge, the establishment of the Air Transport
Command transcended the mere expansion of the Ferrying Command. Instead:
It was the establishment of a powerful concentration of related functions in a single body, and for the first time brought the whole process of moving supplies by air, which had grown up experimentally and haphazardly, into line with proven doctrines. The function thereby ceased to be an interesting airmen's experiment and became a solid part of the Army's logistical equipment.

LaFarge points out that "his appointment is an indication of the importance of the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces ascribed to the command:

carriers, and as a result, "the transport fleet thus obtained was far from impressive." 2i
Moreover, the production of transport aircraft had to compete with the overriding priority granted to bomber and fighter aircraft. Needless to say, few military cargo aircraft were produced during the war. Instead, the transport command had to rely primarily upon converted passenger and bomber aircraft. Because of these shortcomings, there were several points of contention between the airlines and ATC. Among the most notable for the purposes of this study were the following:
1. Air lines men contend that the military was negligent in not foreseeing the need for a planned air transport system. They point out that production of transport planes, even of Douglas DC-3s, was ordered discontinued in January, 1942, after Pearl Harbor, when the need for tremendous numbers of such planes should have been obvious. Army officials insist that priority had to be given the production of fighters and bombers [emphasis added].

It was these men who became the seed corn for the development of the huge services of the Air Transport Command and the Naval Air Transport Service, which, before the day of final enemy collapse, was the largest operation by air ever to fly.

Airlift Doctrine: Pre-W.W.II
Although at the start of the Second World War the USAAF was materially ill-equipped to undertake a major airlift operation, it was not at a loss of dynamic leadership which ultimately was responsible for "the beginning of the air transport system:
It was America's good fortune that in the years immediately before Pearl Harbor the key positions of our Air Staff were filled by a remarkable group of men, of whom General H.H. Arnold is the archetype. They were airmen, ... they knew aviation through and through, they fully foresaw its possibilities, they were courageous thinkers and daring planners. ... As America began to rearm they came into their own. They gave us the nucleus of the Air Force. 
37
38
The men at the top, as well as the men in the aircraft and on the bases, had no time for doctrine. They were too busy making airplanes fly usefully and batting down new emergencies as they cropped up. They went by trial and error, inevitably, until sound practice was evolved. ... The men who established the theory had no time to formulate it. 
39
In 1941,... the concept of air transport as one of the principal channels of supply for the military forces in the field had not been fully grasped. Probably no one then foresaw that the network of long-range transport routes, supporting the daily movement of hundreds of tons of supplies and thousands of passengers, would spread over the world and that daily flights to such remote areas as ... India, and China would become commonplace.

The new policy effectively limited the theater commanders from forming any subsidiary airlift units without the authorization of ATC. This centralization of the command and control functions over all AAF scheduled airlift curtailed the formation and growth of such entities.

Air Force and XX Bomber Command supplied and equipped solely by airlift. James Huston says of the operation that "the long and often seemingly futile effort to fly supplies into China received more public attention than any other ATC operation." 55 Clayton Knight says that being "the most distant theater from the nerve center in Washington, this action of the war has still, for most of us, as it had for those fliers, more the quality of that such operations be delayed until security will permit resumption of operations." See Memorandum No.  W 95-18-42, Brig. Gen. H.B. Lewis, acting Adjutant General, War Department, to distribution A, subject:  Air Transport Operations, 21 September 1942, cited in Miller, 37.  52 "The assignment of cargo transport aircraft to agencies other than the Air Transport Command and I Troop Carrier Command will be limited to those essential for staff administrative purposes, training, maintenance of flying proficiency, and for local transport services operated for emergency maintenance, reclamation, and emergency delivery of supplies and equipment. In no case will these local services duplicate the services of Ar Transport Command, which command is primarily responsible for the operation of all military air transport conducted under the jurisdiction of the Commanding General, Army Ar Forces." See AAF Regulation No. 20-44 A, Responsibilities for Air Transportation, 11 November 1944 cited in Miller  66 -67.  "Given that by the war's end "the theater air forces were so strongly recognized as 'in charge' of air matters," Miller posits that "the fact that an AAF regulation had such a limiting influence on the theaters was something of a doctrinal coup in itself."

American planners realized that, given the overriding demands of the European campaign, Chiang's requirements were unrealistic as "three U.S. divisions were not available, plane production lagged behind commitments, and the Hump route had all the C-47 transport aircraft the U.S. could provide." 101 Following General Marshall's advice, President Roosevelt announced in October 1942 that he had: rejected entirely the demand for U.S. combat troops because of lack of shipping, but promised to build the air force in China and India as rapidly as possible, and to make transports available for the [Hump] airline in regular monthly increments until the goal of 100 in regular operation M>as reached [emphasis added].

The British engineers had failed to finish construction of facilities at Sookerating and Mohanbari, "in spite of reminders by Bissell and Stilwell." 142 Craven and Cate point out that "given all the handicaps which existed, it is perhaps not surprising that the Hump lift fell far short of even the 4,000-ton objective during the first eight months of ATC control." 143 Nevertheless, ICWATC managed to improve upon 10th AF's performance.

,x In India alone, eight new airdromes needed to be completed and 9,918 tons of equipment needed to be delivered as soon as possible. During July alone, the operation would require 7,000 tons of petroleum, 7,000 tons of cargo, and 200 tons of aircraft parts and base supplies. See Craven and Cate, Services Around the World, 126. In June 1943, with a total force of 140 airlifters, including 12 C-87s and 46 C-46s, Alexander was able to deliver just 2,200 tons, less than half of the target objective. See Weaver and Bowen 443.
157 On 22 June, General Wheeler estimated that by 1 July progress would be 25% behind schedule, with 60 out of a projected 80 hardstands (aircraft parking spot) having been erected. At the beginning of July, Alexander had projected a total lift of 5,100 tons, which he was forced to reduce by 1,900 tons on 11 July. Although the achievement of 3,451 tons was the highest yet delivered in a single month, it was still less than 50% of the 7,500 objective for the month of July. See Romanus and Sunderland, StihveU's Mission to China, It was determined at the Quebec QUADRANT Conference, held in August 1943, that unless major changes were implemented in CBI, the situation would not improve.

161 Instead of Headquarters, India, "which was always more oriented toward the Middle East." See Griess, 218. Shortly after QUADRANT, Roosevelt forwarded the following cable to Marshall: "I am still pretty thoroughly disgusted with the India-China matter Everything seems to go wrong. But the worst thing is that we are falling down on our promises every single time. We have not fulfilled one of them." See Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Mission to China, 382. In response to the President's personal concern, the JCS established a policy that "any decision by SEAC or the India Company affecting the airlift must be presented to the CCS for approval in light of'political implications' of Roosevelt's promises to Chiang." See Griess, 510.
162 Roosevelt emphasized that "the ATC had been a great disappointment which was regrettable because the 14th Air Force was the only specific contribution the U.S. could make in China in the coming To get the root of the problem, the President sent General Somervell to the CBI on a fact-finding expedition. On 20 October 1943  The tonnage continued to rise after Hoag took command of the ICWATC. In November, the airlift operation was divided into an eastern sector, overseeing all Hump traffic, and a western sector, in charge of all intra-India air traffic. Colonel Thomas Hardin took command of the eastern sector and introduced nighttime aerial operations. 167 months. SeeGriess, 510.

165 "While the number of aircraft assigned to the ICWATC had increased from 100 in April to 230 in September, only 50% of them were operational, because of mechanical troubles with the new C-46 type aircraft, lack of spares and mechanics, bad working conditions, inexperienced flight personnel, and bad weather." See Romanus and Sunderland, Stitwell'sMission to China, 381.  106 General Alexander had "literally wore himself out [and had become] weary and sick." See LaFarge, 124. During Hoag's first month in command, the ICWATC airlifted 7,240 tons over the Hump. Supplemented by CNAC and others, it reached a combined total of 8,632 tons. Although this was an improvement, it could not mask the fact that the "Hump backlog of tonnage accumulated in Assam was 48,410 tons, of which 40,998 tons was ordnance." See Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Mission to China, 382.  By December his airlifters delivered a staggering 12,594 tons, not only reaching the President's announced 10,000 ton goal, but exceeding it by 2,500 tons by launching an aircraft every eleven minutes, twenty-four hours a day. Chennault wrote a personal letter to Hoag, thanking him for the invaluable contributions that the airlift's "gasoline, ammunition, bombs, and other supplies" were making toward the 14th AF war effort.

172 LaFarge, The Eagle in the Egg, 126. Early in the conflict, estimating the U.S. could airlift a maximum of 1,000 tons per month, Japanese forces had not made a concerted effort to attack the airlifters. However, after enduring a growing number of bombing raids, during the last half of 1943 they changed their tactics as eleven airlifters were "known to have been shot down" flying over the Hump, 175 mostly C-46s and C-87s. 176 Brigadier General C.R. Smith said of the situation, "we are paying for it (increased tonnage over the Hump) in men and planes."'

the American effort should be concentrated on building up the air supply route to China and air bases in China, using the airlift entirely for the latter purpose. The effort should be continued to seize and hold Myitkyina in order to shorten the air route and to place forces in a position to exploit a road to China should the opportunity develop [emphasis added]. 183 178 "A pursuit plane has six 50-caliber guns in front of him and 400 mph in his engine. We fly the same country with a pistol and a Tommy gun." See Launius, 127.
179 "In fun, their tormentors swore that the initials ATC stood for Allergic To Combat and in good humor they sang, 'Take down your service flag, Mother. Your son's in the ATC." See Ulanoff, MATS, 19.
180 By the next month the number had fallen to 207 aircraft, as the delivery of C-46s was temporarily delayed in order to allow necessary structural modifications to be made. The gap was partially compensated for with the delivery of extra C-87s and the temporary assignment of 25 retired B-24D bombers from the CBI theater. See Craven and Cate, Services Around the World, 128. In December, a considerable number of newly modified C-46s and C-87s, along with spare parts, arrived from the United States. By year's end there were 93 C-46s, 25 C-47s and 24 C-87s assigned to the Hump. See Launius, 127.

183 According to a policy paper written by Brigadier General Frank Roberts, Chief of the OPD Strategy and Policy Group, "air support of the Pacific advance from bases in territory already under Chiang's control would be the probable limit of the CBI's contribution." See Coakley and Leighton, Global Logistics and  Strategy 1943 -1945, 516-517. After SEXTANT, President Roosevelt changed his outlook toward the role of China. From thenceforth he pressured Chiang to attack the Japanese forces in Burma with his (Yoke)
Marshall relayed to Stilwell that his overriding concern should still be to: increase the combat efficiency of the Chinese Army in accordance with current plans for equipping 33 divisions and that, while primary emphasis 'for the present' should go to the Hump airlift and its security and to the development of maximum effectiveness of the 14th Air Force, he should be prepared to 'exploit the development of overland communications to China [emphasis added].

156 According to an Air Force historian: "the results obtained in the strategic missions did little to justify the lavish expenditures poured out in their behalf. The tactical missions were of more value but of hardly enough to justify the drain. MATTERHORN inevitably imposed on the limited logistical facilities of the CBI. MATTERHORN logistics proved to be a nightmare. It was impossible to make the force self-sustaining as originally visualized, for the B-29 could not, in their shuttle runs between Calcutta and Cheng-tu, bring in enough fuel, bombs and other supplies to support more than a minimum of missions. ... The B-29s were soon competing with Chennault's 14th Air Force and Chinese ground forces for the capacity of the Hump airlift. See Coakley and Leighton, Global Logistics and Strategy 1943 -1945, 521.  As was soon evident, "the presence of the B-29's in China stirred the Japanese in mid-1944, to launch a campaign to overrun the airfields in east China to which they feared the bombers would ultimately be deployed."

19 ' Because of this airlift diversion, Hump tonnage dropped below 10,000 tons in March, but by April it had risen back to 11,000 tons and it continued to grow to 16,000 by June. See Coakley and Leighton, U.S. Army in W. W.

Almost simultaneously, the Japanese assault extended to eastern and southern
China and appeared to be aimed directly at the airfields of 14th Air Force and the ICWATC Kunming airdrome. The strategy of retaking Myitkyina and enough of the surrounding area to protect it was seen as a key component of strengthening air power in China.

nevertheless the airlift was never able to grow at a rate which could satisfy the demands of all of its customers. The Japanese onslaught through east China could not be halted and it forced Chennault to relocate his operations further westward, out of range from coastal China. Moreover, his supplies had depleted to the point where only tactical strafing missions could be flown.

Second, he developed a comprehensive safety program whereby a "statistical tracking
program" was used to determine the most common reasons behind aircraft accidents, the airdromes where most of the accidents occurred, the weather conditions involved, and the types of accidents the various aircraft were most apt to experience due to common maintenance deficiencies. This information, together with more stringent flight evaluations, pilot physicals, and an efficient safety awareness program proved most useful in combating accidents. Third, by introducing PLM, Tunner was able to generate "greater aircraft reliability while decreasing maintenance time." PLM required aircraft to be towed through a series of seven maintenance stands where specialists executed detailed maintenance procedures. Because each base in Assam repaired only one aircraft type, in 21s LaFarge, The Eagle in the Egg, 127. As for the wider CBI campaign, the Japanese assault on east China "was the main influence shaping American strategy on the Asiatic mainland in the last year of the war."

Chiang to give Stil well command of the Chinese Army.

222 "The average number [of aircraft] in commission for the Hump service in December 1944 was 249.6; in January 1945, 287.4; in February, 336.8; in April, 325.9; in July, 332. Personnel assigned to the Hump bases, likewise, increased ... from a total of 17,032 military personnel in December, ... to 19,025 in January and reached a peak of 22,359 in April." See Craven and Cate, Services Around the World, 141.
225 "The Hump operation delivered 44,098 tons in January 1945; by July this had been increased to 71,042 tons. All the while the accident rate dropped, from 23 accidents and 36 fatalities in January to only eight accidents and 11 fatalities in the last full month of the war." See Launius, 128. General Tunner reported that in the CBI, PLM was an "overall success, largely responsible for the rise in the average percentage of assigned aircraft in operation from 78% in January to 85% in July. PLM was responsible for a 25% reduction in the time required for 100-hour inspections and increasing the daily utilization of "C-54 aircraft at Tezgaon from an average of 5.51 hours in April to 11.65 hours in July."

The Japanese Air Force was ineffective as "the enemy could muster barely 50 planes for the defense of Burma."

"The campaign for the reoccupation of Burma was now over, except for mopping-up operations, as those Japanese isolated in western Burma tried to break out. " See Griess, 229. Goldberg notes that "the 14th Air Force and the transport pilots of the Hump route kept China in the war. A high-ranking Japanese officer stated after the war that 'had it not been for the 14th Air Force we could have gone anywhere we wished in China.' See Goldberg, 83. The mopping up operations were directly supported by the ICD airlift of 1945. ATC was able to support the move of Chinese troops beyond the periphery and into more distant areas, such as Shanghai. See Craven and Cate, Services Around the World, 149.
244 These units were the 7th Bombardment Group, the 308th Bombardment Group, the 443 Troop Carrier Group, and the 3rd and 4th Combat Cargo Groups, plus two combat cargo squadrons of the 1st Combat Cargo Group, with the support of the twelve airdrome squadrons (468 additional aircraft).

Even though it never became routine, by August of 1945 the Hump airlift at least was more "normal" in that air superiority had been firmly established so that the Japanese forces were no longer a threat.

250 Griess explains that "Anglo-American control of the air denied the Japanese strategic mobility, isolating a crippling their offensives against the British. The Allies, on the other hand, could fly a division to the scene of action. Perhaps more important, the Japanese tactic of encirclement was no longer the menace it had once been. Development of effective air-ground coordination made possible resupply of forward units entirely by air." See Griess, 222 -223.  General Tunner orchestrated this masterful performance by increasing the number of aircraft assigned to the ICD from 108 in June to 250 by December 1944. In conjunction, he increased the average monthly sortie rate from 3,702 in June to 7,612 in December,

The tonnage could have been hauled in approximately 70 Liberty ships, if the requisite ports had only been available, or in 6,500 American freight cars, if only a railroad had existed.

Most important in the long run, no doubt, the Air Transport Command's crowded airways to China were the proving ground, if not the birthplace, of mass strategic airlift. ...In military and civilian circles alike men were forced to modify their thinking regarding the potential for airlift [emphasis added].

Roosevelt wrote, "I have directed the citation of the Wing and desire that my personal thanks be communicated to every officer and man concerned." The narrative read: "The goal has been high, the air route exceedingly dangerous, both as to mountains and enemy action, and the weather treacherous.

264
265
As this analysis demonstrates, during the course of World War II, airlift developed on all three fronts: organizationally, structurally and doctrinally. Organizationally, it evolved from a ferrying service to an air cargo and passenger operation. Structurally, beginning literally from scratch, thousands of airline frames were converted to military use. Doctrinally, a new aerial mission was introduced to the profession of arms.
Airlift Organization: Post-W.W.II As the war was dying down in the middle of 1945, ATC was sending fifty-two flights per day across the Atlantic to destinations in Paris, Frankfurt and Berlin. On the Pacific side, twenty-one flights per day departed from west coast bases.

267
265 Knight, Lifeline in the Sky, 126. 266 At its peak, ATC had 205,000 officers and enlisted members and 108,000 civilians assigned. ATC crews pioneered over 35,000 miles of domestic routes and 148,900 miles of foreign routes. The peak month for aircraft ferries stood at 2589 foreign and 9205 domestic deliveries. Tonnage transported peaked in July of 1945, when 124,637 tons were airlifted (more than half over the Hump alone), along with 274,934 passengers, resulting in the astonishing figure of 174 million ton-miles and 619 million passenger miles flown in one single month. See Knight, 264.  buildup was, the demobilization transpired even more quickly. LaFarge noted after the war that there was "a danger that the desire for conformity for its own sake and the absence of men who remember why the Command had to be so ornery and so different may lead to a loss of essential flexibilities." 268 Within one-year of V-J Day, "consolidations and inactivations had cut the number of transport divisions [from nine] to three -Pacific, Atlantic and Europe." Goldberg points out that "demobilization at this rate threatened complete disruption of the ATC organization [emphasis added]."

208 LaFarge, The Eagle in the Egg, 36.
Goldberg points out that although "Arnold's thinking set the pattern for the future development of ATC," budgetary limitations did not initially permit the realization of his program. 
271
To my mind, this is one of the important aeronautical lessons we have learned in World War II. Fighters, at 400 miles an hour, and bombers, even the gigantic B-29s, are not enough. It is a certainty, however, that the Army Air Forces will maintain within its own structure a small but efficient Air Transport Command.
The wisdom of such a course, in my opinion, is obvious since air transport is an important component of air power [emphasis added]. 
272
the ideal shaping the whole development of ATC was that of a strategic air transport service. To the achievement ofthat ideal nothing was more important than a centralized control exercised in conformity with the highest considerations of national strategy. 
273
272
273
Airlift Force Structure: Post-W.W.II
As previously shown, every airlifter used in the Second World War by U.S. forces was either a modified bomber or passenger aircraft. LaFarge notes that "in a sense all of our military transports were makeshifts." 274 He contends that:
We paid dearly for the comfortable fallacy that a well-developed merchant air industry would answer our needs in time of war. We might well have failed to produce the ocean-spanning fleet which was so important a factor in victory. 
275
the change which has taken place could not have occurred in three and a half years of peace. The imperatives of war forced, twenty years, at least, into three. The egg hatched, and it was an eagle. 
217
276 "Under ordinary circumstances, if there were foreseen a possible need for using twin-engine aircraft to carry payloads of several tons at altitudes of 20,000 feet or higher, one or two planes would be set aside for experimental use until the many problems involved could be learned and solved. In the war, several hundred DC-3s and C-46s were kept doing just that for all they were worth, over the Himalayas. The result was a mass knowledge about performance and efficient air lift under extremely unfavorable conditions which ordinarily it would have taken a decade or more to gather." See LaFarge, 6.
277 LaFarge, The Eggle in the Egg, 76. The transport command had the following number of aircraft assigned after each year of the war: 782 in 1943 ; 2,292 in 1944; and 3,090 in 1945. See Craven and Cate, Services Around the World, 40. The AAF accepted delivery of over 10,000 "DC-3 type" aircraft, "which was nearly half the transport planes it received between 1940 and 1945. By comparison, the AAF accepted delivery of a grand total of 3,144 C-46s by August 1945, the majority coming into service after 1944. See Craven and Cate, Men and Planes, 224. The number of aircraft ferried was 30,000 in 1942, 72,000 in 1943,  108,000 in 1944 and 57,000 in 1945. See Craven and Cate, Services Around the World, 19.  At its zenith in February of 1945, the AAF had "nine air transport divisions and 32 troop carrier groups with a total of 10,13 8 aircraft. " 
278
279
Army Air Force flying missions prior to U.S. direct involvement in the Second World War. Moreover, although its strength grew at a higher rate than the other two missions throughout the course of the conflict, its end strength never approached those of the bomber and fighter forces. Please note that these numbers do not include the specialty aircraft such as reconnaissance, communications and trainers. In sum, Craven and Cate claim that: the importance of the transport plane to the operations of the AAF, whether as a carrier, troop transport, or long-range cargo carrier, is illustrated by the growing inventory of these planes. In July 1939 the AAF had only 118 transports, and on the eve of Pearl Harbor it had only 216. Thereafter the inventory rose steadily; by August 1944 the AAF had more than 10,000 transports on hand. 
285
Airlift Doctrine: Post-W.W.II According to LaFarge, the Air Transport Command was "something unusual in American military history, a major subordinate command based in the Zone of the Interior, operating and establishing its personnel and bases in all theaters under its own, direct command." He elaborates that:
The Air Transport Command was now truly the War Department's agency. In fact, although it was a lower echelon of a major subdivision of the Army, it was an agency of the whole government as oriented towards waging war, excepting always the area reserved for the sovereign Navy [emphasis added]. 2 * 6 ATC was founded as a "strategic air transport system" based on the principle of "centralized control in conformity with the highest considerations of national strategy." 
287
289
ATC, 26 November 1945, cited in Miller, 69. 291
292 Arnold elaborates that "simultaneously with our entry into World War II, overwhelming demands came pouring in to Washington from the four corners of the earth, for U.S. military aircraft. Everybody, everywhere wanted our planes, and wanted them NOW. Since neither ground nor sea transportation could be expected to cope successfully with the time element of these demands, there remained but one other alternative: air transportation." See LaFarge, 34f. organizations encompassed within that title, met this challenge, is an everlasting glory to its personnel, and to the country that fathered a breed of their kind. 
293
We must not forget the great difficulty now almost forgotten, of deploying and establishing our Air Force in the areas in which they are to fight. During times of peace, we are apt to retain our combat units and sacrifice the essentials to their successful deployment and immediate operation. We must retain our bases and our means of deployment [emphasis added]. 
294
I have long felt that the Air Transport Command has a unique value which had never been fully appreciated throughout the Air Forces. The contribution which it has made and can make to national security, and to the autonomy of the Air Forces is little understood but of vital importance. As a result of my experience as a member of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Combined Chiefs of Staff, / firmly believe that an essential component of American airpower is an integrated autonomous single Air Transport Command, reporting directly to the Commanding General, Army Air Forces [emphases added]. 
295
296
297
Finally, General Arnold addresses the sensitive issue of ATC's independence from theater commanders' command authority:
Finally, I want to reemphasize a strong personal conviction. In time of war the authority of the theater commander in his area is paramount. This is as it should be.... The ATC has always been an exempted agency operating into and through the various theaters. This principle should be retained. 
298
(1) Strategic airlift is a function of airpower that supports the entire defense establishment, not just the air component. Its scope is also broad enough to serve as an agent of diplomatic and economic policies of the nation in its own right.
(2) Strategic airlift is a vital element of airpower and the national military strategy. Its potential contributions are so important as to justify exemption of these forces from day-to-day control of the theater commanders and concentration of their control at the highest possible level of strategic decision making.
(3) Strategic airlift is separate from troop carrier aviation, but has such flexibility as to be available for scheduled airlift services within the theaters upon common agreement of all concerned. In unique circumstances, strategic airlift may perform combat supply by air, both air landing and air dropping, but again only upon agreement of all concerned.
(4) Strategic airlift will exist in peacetime at a militarily acceptable minimum strength to be prepared for extensive expansion during wartime. Strategic airlift will rely overwhelmingly on civil aviation for its initial wartime capabilities. In However, aviation matters are of growing importance in our foreign policy. Since the ATC will always enjoy free entry into foreign circles, and particularly since that Command will exercise military authority in the territories of several foreign countries, it is mandatory that maximum cooperation and assistance to the State Department for the furtherance of our American objectives be firmly charged to the ATC as the field agent of the Air Forces and the War Department. This will require understanding and strong support within our own Air Force Headquarters." See 
Miller,
71. 298
(5) Strategic airlift is a complex logistical operation that depends on an extensive system of bases, intensive management by air transportation experts, and a tightly controlled program of user priorities. While aircraft specifically designed for military air transportation may be desirable, they are not required for effective mission accomplishment.
(6) Strategic airlift can be routinely relied upon to execute extremely demanding missions on a sustained basis, once it is given sufficient resources. 
299
300
The basic planning, development, organization and training of the Air Force must be well rounded, covering every modern means of waging air war, and the techniques of employing such means must be continually developed and kept up to date. The Air Force doctrines likewise must be flexible at all times and entirely uninhibited by tradition.

By the end of the war the U.S. Army Air Force had an established organization, Air Transport Command, with an inventory of several thousand transports. Furthermore, aviation pioneers such as Hap Arnold, wrote of the importance that ATC, in partnership with the airline industry, would play in providing for the country's future national security.
In closing, General Arnold wrote the following to Secretary of War Stimson:
we have learned and must not forget that from now on air transport is an essential of air power, in fact, of all national power. ... We must have an air transport organization in being, capable of tremendous expansion. 
306
After the Second World War, given that airlift had proven itself to be a viable military instrument, the Air Transport Command remained intact with a small fleet of aircraft leftover from the war. In 1948, a year after the U.S. Air Force was formed, ATC was joined with the Naval Air Transport Service (NATS) to form the Military Air Transport Service (MATS), thereby consolidating all the nation's strategic airlift resources into one unified command. The tactical airlift aircraft assigned to the Navy, TAC and the various overseas commands remained exclusively under their own jurisdictions. What few technological improvements there were came in the form of the tactical transport, the C-l 19 and the strategic transport, the C-124. Rather than being designated as a major combatant command, such as TAC, SAC and ADC, MATS was designated as a support service and was commanded by a two-star, rather than a four-star general. This was a direct result of the comparatively low priority the Air Force put on its airlift fleet and was commensurate with its paltry budget and stagnant doctrine.

The Navy has to some extent surrendered command control over its long-range transports to the Air Force, but it has done so in such form that if the opportunity should arise, the Navy could take them back. The personnel from the Navy remain Navy personnel, in Navy uniform. Their aircraft remain Navy property, and can be serviced and maintained only by Navy crews. So little has the old NATS been 'unified' into MATS that it was headline news when Navy transports joined the Air Force ones on the Berlin air lift! 6 Secretary Forrestal ordered that MATS be held responsible to, and its commander be appointed by, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Major General Kuter was appointed as the first commander. The vice commander came from the Navy. So, rather than having a four-star general in command of the entire DOD strategic airlift force composition, the position was filled by a two-star general. In comparison, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) was commanded by a four-star general. This was indicative of the relative priority given to airlift during this time frame. According to General Tunner: MATS' mission, by direction of the JCS, is to provide airlift for the Department of Defense, both on a routine and emergency basis. In order to do this, its planes, crews and ground personnel must be in a constant state of readiness. In accordance with U.S. national strategy, MATS moves men, weapons and material within the United States and from one continent to another. // must be able to furnish immediate resupply of both bomber and missile bases of SAC [emphasis added].

The seeds of American Cold War policy were planted in a 16-page cable from the U.S. Embassy in Moscow to the Department of State written by George Kennan in February of 1946. Kennan's argument provided the catalyst for the U.S. policy of "containment," which called for the need to "imprison communism, politically, economically, and socially, within its existing boundaries." 
13
To counteract this threat, on 12 March 1947, President Truman proclaimed that "it must be the policy of the United States to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures." Furthermore, he stated the support should be in the form of "economic and financial aid, which is essential to economic stability and orderly political process."

"Given that it would have necessitated tripling the defense budget, NSC-68 would have imposed a much higher tax burden on the American public. Although no definitive price tag was attached to this open-ended project, it did assume that the U.S. was wealthy enough to dedicate "20% of its GNP for arms without suffering national bankruptcy," which equated to $50 billion in 1950. Truman believed that "without a major crisis, there was little chance of selling the program to Congress or the public." See Ambrose, 183 -184.
Not surprisingly, at the beginning of the Berlin Airlift USAFE, rather than MATS, was called into action. Only at the urgent request of Army General Wedemeyer and others would an airlift task force be formed under the command of General Tunner.
Tunner's combined operation would be able to accomplish its mission more effectively than USAFE had done, and with less support. Probably the most important outcome of that airlift operation would be the realization of the military importance of airlift, especially in the Cold War era. With this new importance would come the impetus, led by Secretary of the Air Force Symington, to develop the C-124 Globemaster, the first four-engine, long-range airlifter designed to specifications and able to deliver outsized cargo. It was to serve as the backbone of the strategic airlift fleet until the 1960s.
Avi Shlaim views "crisis as a situation which involves change in the normal interaction patterns between states or in the international system as a whole." 23 Glenn Snyder and Paul Diesing define an "international crisis," in particular, as "a sequence of interactions between the governments of two or more sovereign states in severe conflict, short of actual war, but involving the perception of a dangerously high probability of war." 24 Shlaim finds specifically "that the imposition of the Soviet blockade on the

The Department of Army next urged Clay to evacuate the military dependents from Berlin. Clay held to the view that the dependents should stay, as "we could support the Americans in Berlin indefinitely with a very small airlift" 2 * Therefore, rather than capitulate, the "U.S. occupation authorities organized the Little Airlift" in which "goods and personnel" were flown between Wiesbaden and the western garrison in Berlin.

Our remaining in Berlin, dependent on air supply and cut off from the rest of the world by land and water, was soon taken for granted. The small airlift we started to meet our needs did not have the dramatic appeal of the great airlift that later supplied all the civilian population of western Berlin [emphasis added].

April the German police in the Soviet zone were integrated with the Soviet police force.
A week later Allied barge traffic was restricted and barely two weeks after that "additional documentation requirements were placed on all freight shipments." On 10
June, as Soviet soldiers were trying to take locomotives and rolling stock from the U.S.
sector, they were forcefully stopped by U.S. Army military police. In response, the U.S.S.R. stopped all rail movement between Berlin and the Allied sectors in Germany for the next two days. Moreover, this same day the Soviets shut down the Berlin-Helmstedt j2 Clays wrote: "Why are we in Europe? We have lost Czechoslovakia. We have lost Finland. Norway is threatened. We retreat from Berlin. ... After Berlin, will come western Germany and our strength there relatively is no greater and our position no more tenable than Berlin. If we mean that we are to hold Europe against Communism, we must not budge." See Top Secret Teleconference TT-9341, General Lucius Clay  and General Omar Bradley, 10 April 1948, reprinted in Jean Edward Smith, ed., The Papers of General  Lucius D. Clay: Germany 1945 -1949,vol 2 (Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1974)  As all of these events had been transpiring, the Soviets were printing counterfeit U.S. dollars and circulating them in the Berlin market, thus artificially inflating U.S.
currency in Germany. To guard against inflation, on the 18th of June, the Kommandatura (minus the Soviet Commandant who had walked out) announced that the Western sectors in Germany would be undergoing currency reform, but that Berlin would be unaffected.
In response, the Soviets severed all passenger movement to Berlin and stopped all freight transport leaving Berlin, except for the return of empty boxcars. Shortly thereafter, on 23
June, the Soviets announced that they would be implementing their own currency reform, which would apply to the Soviet-occupied territory of Germany, including all sectors of Berlin. Generals Clay and Sir Robertson jointly responded that the previously announced currency reform would now apply to the Allied sector of Berlin as well.

"Clay had previously been advised by Washington on 29 April that: "if we failed to obtain agreement for the use of a common currency in Berlin, separate from that used either in west or east Germany, our government did not view the use of the Soviet currency as acceptable politically. Our acceptance would mean Also on 23 June, the City Assembly attempted to convene at City Hall to take action to resolve the conflict over the two competing currency reform measures.
However, given that City Hall was located in the Soviet sector, the police had allowed thousands of Communist demonstrators to gather in front of the entrance, blocking the Assembly from convening. This situation continued until the demonstrators were signaled to leave by members of the Communist SED delegation. Finally able to convene, the Assembly voted to restrict the Soviet currency reform measures only to the Eastern sector of Berlin.

At 6:00 AM on 24 June 1948 the Soviet Military Administration instituted a full blockade on West Berlin. All surface access to Berlin was frozen due to what the Soviets only described as "technical difficulties." 39 General Howley, the U.S. Commandant in Berlin, notes that militarily "we had only two battalions of troops, which would have been powerless against the Soviet panzer divisions."

Clay notes that "later, the Soviet representatives claimed that the blockade had been imposed to prevent the currency reform undertaken in western Germany from having an adverse effect on the economy of the Soviet zone."

44 Clay describes a "minimum economy" as follows: "This minimum would not maintain industrial output or provide for domestic heating and normal consumer requirements. ... The [electrical] capacity which remained could provide electricity for essential purposes only a few hours each day, and even these hours of use had to be staggered for the various parts of western Berlin." See Clay, Decision in Germany, 365.

General LeMay immediately ordered his maintenance personnel to ensure that all of his assigned aircraft (including B-17 bombers) were preflighted for the next day's mission. Given that the airlift force in USAFE consisted almost exclusively of the 3-ton capacity C-47s, both Clay and LeMay knew that "an adequate airlift would require bigger planes" Therefore, if they could at least demonstrate with the C-47 that it was possible to operate 400 sorties per day into Berlin, with a fleet of 10-ton capacity C-54s deployed to Germany, it would be possible to airlift 4,000 tons per day [emphasis added].

In Germany, on the other hand, the field at U.S. Air Force base at Rhein Main had been constructed as a Zeppelin base and later converted by the Luftwaffe to a fighter base.
Given that the runway was built of Marston matting (steel mesh), it would be very tough on tire wear. The fields in Berlin, on the other hand, were much better designed for transport operations, especially the American sector's Tempelhof, which had been designed to be the major passenger terminal in Berlin and was supposedly one of the largest buildings in world.

Secretary of the Army Royall and Under Secretary of State Robert Lovett stayed behind following the Cabinet meeting held on Friday, 25 June, to urge President Truman to exercise "caution and restraint" in this crisis. However, the next day, Truman came down decidedly on Clay's side, so that "at the President's personal order, every available plane in the European Command was pressed into service and the airlift to Berlin put on a full-scale basis." 61 Lovett reflects on the decision that the NSC was "confident that we could do the job ultimately by the same techniques that we had used in lifting approximately 70,000 tons in one month over the Hump from India to China at very high altitudes. 62 However, even if strict conservation measures were able to curtail Berlin's imports by 75%, "it would still require more lift than the Hump operation ever achieved."
In addition to the higher demands posed by Berlin, the U.S. Air Force's airlift force structure of "the same C-47s and C-54s" had been drastically reduced from "3,088   aircraft in 1945 to 511 aircraft in 1946 [emphasis added]."

"Lovett elaborates: "After discussion with the military services ... and ... throughout the National Security Council and finally with the President and the appropriate committees of Congress to whom I reported, we decided to stand firm in Berlin." See Eichhorst, Military Airlift, 13-14.
o3 Eichhorst points out that Lovett had made a faulty comparison between Berlin and Burma given that "the 70,000-ton figure ... was never sustained and ... Berlin imported 465,000 tons per month before the blockade!" See Eichhorst, Military Airlift, 14.
"Smith, The Defense of Berlin, 109. Those in attendance included Secretary of Defense Forrestal, the making,... when it finally broke, the response was this ad hoc meeting at 4:00 PM on a Sunday afternoon in the Pentagon, which ... incidentally overlooked the potentialities of the airlift"^ Davison confirms that "as far as one can determine, the meeting in Secretary Royall's office was the first time Washington had faced squarely the question of counteraction to the Soviet blockade attempt.:
Even then, relatively little attention was given the airlift, whose potentialities were still not appreciated. But this was not surprising, in view of the skepticism that still prevailed even in U.S. Air Force headquarters in Europe about the degree to which the airlift could be expanded [emphases added].

The following Monday 12:30 PM meeting at the White House left no doubt where the President stood on this issue when asked to consider whether the U.S. should remain in Berlin. Truman replied that "the United States is going to stay. Period." 69 General Clay concurred with the decision via telecon from Berlin.

Concerning the airlift, Marshall stated that "it has been found that the tonnage of foodstuffs and supplies which can be lifted by air is greater than had first been assumed."
The entire concept of an airlift was now perceived in a different light than it had been just a week prior.

On 8 July, Generals Clay and Robertson instituted a "counter-blockade" against the Soviets whereby "all shipments of goods between West Berlin and the Soviet zone halted." 79 By the 9th of July, after two weeks of airlift operations, "the results had begun to convince the more optimistic elements in the U.S. Air Force that the blockade could be overcome with air supply." 80 However, by the middle of the month, U.S. and U.K. pilots were beginning to feel the stress of the airlift, caused by a shortage of aircrews.

Their roar is deep, good, and has a quieting effect, when one knows that from the bellies of these aircraft there come raisins, canned goods, and white flour.

As these events had been transpiring, Brigadier General William Tunner, the Deputy Commander of MATS for Air Transport, soon recommended to his commander, Major General Lawrence Kuter, that MATS take charge of the airlift operation. He felt that the operation could stand improvement, as none of the airmen in the European theater had any prior airlift experience. Moreover, he realized that the capabilities of airlift were largely unknown throughout the military and the men running the operation were combat, "The Tusa's reflect that "Americans ... had to weigh the needs of Berlin and the city's political and strategic importance against their commitment to supply bases in the rest of the world and the danger that the Russians might strike somewhere other than Germany.

102 According to General Tunner, his first inspection of the airlift operation revealed that it was "a real Serving in this new capacity, the first thing General Tunner did was to introduce three-minute intervals for takeoffs. Even though there were not yet enough airframes on hand for an around-the-clock operation, he wanted to ensure that when they went to that, the "cadence" would already be established.

" u Monro MacClosky, The U.S. Air Force (New York: Frederick and Praeger Publishers, 1967) 70. "* When the First Airlift Task Force was activated, it had a force structure of 54 C-54s, and 105 C-47s, capable of airlifting 1,500 tons per day. See Miller, 177.
,06 Tunner figured that with 1,440 minutes in a day, with three-minute takeoff intervals, his planes could realize 480 landings per day, enough to keep Berlin afloat. According to his plan, an aircraft would either takeoff or land every 90 seconds. See Tunner, 174.
107 Over the course of the month they had flown a total of 6,482 sorties delivering 32,136 total tons, consisting of "24,908 tons of food, 6,814 tons of coal, and 414 tons of other supplies." See Harty, 9. Moreover, MATS had "trebled its frequency on its transatlantic routes to increase the supply support for Vittles from the States." See Kuter, "Vittles -Air Supply of Berlin," 9. the 4,500-ton winter requirement. To compensate for this shortfall, Generals Clay and LeMay requested that Washington send 71 more C-54s, together with their own maintenance support. Subsequently, at the direction of the National Security Council, the Air Force ordered MATS to deploy a total of 72 C-54s. As of 10 August, the U.S. and U.K. combined forces had attained the capability to meet the city's 3,800-ton daily summer requirements. However, they still fell 700 tons short of the daily winter requirement.
On 9 September, a mass demonstration of over 300,000 Berliners was held in front of the war-damaged ruins of the Reichstag. After the rally, several teenagers climbed the Brandenberg Gate and retrieved the Soviet flag and set it on fire. Soviet guards subsequently fired upon the crowd that was gathered around the flag, killing two and wounding several others. Smith observes that "the action of the Russian soldiers ... ended any hope of compromise in Berlin." 
109
9 British military police were able to eventually restore order. See Smith, The Defense of Berlin, 123. Smith observes that during the early fall, "the Western planners ... grossly underestimated the effectiveness of the airlift" 
112
113
On 10 September, General Clay sent a memorandum to Generals Bradley and LeMay concerning the details of the airlift. 
115
"""The mere inception of the airlift, long before it became clear that the planes actually could bring in sufficient supplies for the city, convinced many people that the Western powers were serious about remaining in Berlin." Early on, the airlift served to dispel German anxieties that their Western Allies might desert and leave them starving. Moreover, given that the airlift was a nonviolent way of circumventing the Soviets, it also helped to quell the fear of war. See Davison, 139.
'""Our original airlift studies were based on British performance of 1,500 tons a day. However, they cannot add to present lift and winter operations will cut their lift to 950 tons per day under winter conditions. This will require U.S. to lift an average of approximately 3,515 tons per day. This will require 69 additional C-54s. Fifty operating from Fassberg will average 26 tons each, giving daily lift of 1,300. One hundred thirty-nine C-54s operating from Rhein/Main will average 16 tons each giving daily total of 2,215 tons. Total both airports will be 3,515 tons and with British lift added about 4,500 tons per day. This is absolute minimum and provides no coal for space heating. The desired level which would absorb our maximum "50 additional C-54s were being made available from Japan."

General Bradley replied to General Clay's memorandum on 30 September, indicating that "request for additional airlift has been referred to the Joint Chiefs of capacity would increase lift from Rhein/Main to 2,969 tons per day utilizing 186 aircraft. Adding Fassberg and British lift gives us about 5,200 tons a day which should be our target. British lift will hold up for several months depending on weather. Therefore, I recommend we make available by 1 October 60 additional C-54s to ensure minimum needs and that we plan to make 47 additional C-54s available by 1 December if lift is still continuing at that time."

1M General LeMay departed to become the CINC of Strategic Air Command. See Tunner, 191. According to Tunner's Chief of Staff, Brigadier General Ross Milton, Cannon possessed a "love of detail, even trivia, and a desire to know everything that was going on." Tunner, on the other hand, had "a proprietary attitude toward the airlift and having built up his own empire intended to keep running it." See Tusa and Tusa, 251.
rules and regulations. To make matters worse, "Cannon was a former instructor at Kelly Field, Tunner his quondam pupil; Cannon was a combat officer and Tunner a transport expert. The heat between them only lessened when they could keep out of each other's way."^2 General Tunner took his instructions not to deal with MATS as a personal affront, one that he felt "had no place in a military operation of the scope of the Berlin Airlift." In essence, General Tunner felt that the Airlift Task Force was not being given the authority by USAFE to accomplish its task. The General, voicing his opposition to the arrangement, stated that:
an airlift command, as a command in any other large and vital operation, should always have some control of replacements, promotions, awarding of medals, and selection of its key officers. It should have, if it is to last more than a few weeks, administrative and logistical control as well as operational control.™ Despite these obstacles, General Tunner was able to get the CALTF to perform its mission because "of goodwill and common sense not because its institutions were perfect,... like so many other features of the airlift [emphasis added]."

Airlift pilots were confronted with such obstacles as "buzzing by Soviet aircraft, bombing 152 It took just as much time to get the request through the bureaucracy of USAFE Headquarters as it used to take to have the entire transaction completed under the previous system.

or air gunnery practice in or near the corridors and antiaircraft practice." Despite this harassment, U.S. and U.K. personnel continued to operate normally, so as to avoid a disruption of the airlift daily tonnage rate. Davison points out that the Soviets "did not need to stop the airlift altogether... to bring about a critical situation in the west sectors." However, the Soviets were not even successful in curtailing the airlift operation.

Airlift operations were dramatically curtailed during the month of November, when aircraft were socked in by dense fog and unable to fly missions for half of the month. 
159
Nevertheless, our worst air weather based on the record comes in November and December. We have met this challenge by carrying our minimum essential tonnage in both months." 160 Nevertheless ,despite their best effort, "conditions did not improve materially in December," so that by January, Berlin was on the verge of a coal shortage, with an inventory of just one week's worth in stock. However, due to corrective measures taken by Generals Clay and Howley, a shortfall was averted.

agreement was reached and an announcement was made that the blockade would be lifted effective 12 May m
For all intents and purposes, the Soviet Union had lifted the blockade without being able to extract any major concessions from the West. Smith recounts the words that were spoken in recognition of the men who had flown the heroic airlift during the ceremony which took place in Berlin the day the blockade was lifted:
Franz Neumann, Chairman of the SPD, then read the names of the airmen who had been killed and introduced a resolution that the plaza in front of Tempelhof airfield be renamed Platz der Luftbrücke (Plaza of the Airlift) in honor of them. The resolution was passed unanimously.

(2) All the restrictions imposed since 1 March 1948 by the Governments of France, the U.K. and U.S., or any one of them, on communications, transportation, and trade between Berlin and the Eastern zone and between the Western and Eastern zones of Germany will also be removed on 12 May 1949." See Smith, The Defense of Berlin, 129 -130. General Clay was notified of these provisions by a teleconference message transmitted on 30 April 1949 from Assistant Secretary of the Army Voorhees. Clay says that "I cabled to the Department of the Army immediately that we should continue the airlift until Berlin had adequate reserves of coal and food to carry it through another winter if the blockade should be resumed." See Clay, Decision in Germany, 390. Clay's memo was worded as follows: "There is one important thing to remember. The blockade was broken by air power, and the air power should be maintained in full until the Council of Ministers has completed its deliberations. Subject to the continuation of the airlift, I would urge that the lifting of the blockade and counter-blockade be defined as just that and not elaborated into a minutiae of detail." See Top Secret Memorandum CC 8467, General Clay to Secretary Voorhees, 1 May 1949, reprinted in Smith, Papers of General Clay, 1138.
I8 ' "When Mayor Reuter rose to address the assembly he spoke of the 48 American and British pilots who had lost their lives in air crashes during the blockade. As he spoke, all those present rose to their feet in a moment of tribute." See Smith, The Defense of Berlin,, 130.
Clay later reflected that "the use of the airlift to sustain the city had proved the firmness of intent of the Western Powers." 187 As Clay had demanded, throughout the month of May, the airlift continued to be "the biggest transporter of goods for the city." 
188
189
190 Clay elaborates. "This seems to me to be the only acceptable alternative. It has been proved that Berlin can be supported by airlift; and, in fact, in recent months more tonnage has been carried in each day by air than by rail and water prior to the imposition of the blockade. Utilizing larger planes, the cost of the airlift and the personnel required for its operation can both be reduced materially." See Top Secret Memorandum, General Clay to Lt. General Gruenther, 25 May 1949, reprinted in Smith, Papers of General Clay, 1168 -1170.  Much like the experience of the Hump crews in World War II, despite the fact that the Berlin Airlift had decisively disarmed a major international crisis, the U.S. Air Force was not originally going to submit its strategic air transport crews for a medal. The Tusas point out that "/'/ was only thanks to a campaign by the journalist Walter Winchell that members of the U.S. Air Force who had labored so valiantly were awarded a medal." m General Clay forecasted that "volumes can be written, and perhaps will be written, to cover in detail the work of the airlift, though I doubt if they will do it justice." 192 To U.S. Army Brigadier General Howley, the Berlin Commandant, the greatest "military lesson of the airlift" was that "although it was conceived primarily as a humanitarian project to defeat a political purpose, it taught us the practical importance of supplying an army by air."

21,1 Because the JCS had earlier decided in 1947 that "Korea was not vital to American security," the President had to weigh the alternatives. There was a strong case to be made for nonintervention, given that Secretary of State Acheson had "very pointedly excluded South Korea from our main perimeter of defense in the Far East," in a speech he had given the previous January. Furthermore, based upon the Euro-centric U.S. foreign policy of containment, it had been assumed that the next war would be a "total war waged largely with nuclear weapons," so that U.S. conventional forces had been dramatically downsized. See Guttmann, 1.
202 The Soviet representative was boycotting in protest of Communist China's not having been allowed to take Nationalist China's seat. Kim II Sung refused to abide by the Security Council edict, and continued his advance southward claiming that his country had been "attacked by the puppet Syngman Rhee." See Guttmann, 1.
203 "The attack upon Korea makes it plain beyond all doubt that communism has passed beyond the use of subversion to conquer independent nations and will now use armed invasion and war. It has defied the orders of the Security Council of the United Nations issued to preserve peace and security. ... The Security Council... called upon the invading troops to cease hostilities and to withdraw to the 38th parallel. This they have not done, but on the contrary have pressed the attack." See Harry S. Truman, "Statement on the Korean Conflict," 26 June 1950, cited in Guttmann, 2. 22 -Miller, Airlift Doctrine, 196.

-Jl With 7,500-foot mountain ranges, Korea's terrain was quite jagged with considerable variations in field elevation. Moreover, with the moist climate, there tended to be a lot of cloud cover which many times hid potentially lethal mountain peaks from view. Furthermore, the flight from Japan to Korea was almost entirely over water, so that if an aircraft developed an emergency while en route, there were no readily accessible divert fields. There were no electronic aids to navigation, so that the pilots had to fly strictly by visual reference to the ground. This system worked quite well as long as there was sufficient sunlight and the visibility was clear. However, operations had to be severely curtailed during periods of darkness or instrument conditions. There was always the threat of being attacked by enemy fighters or ground sniper fire. Although most aircraft were damaged while on the ground, there were a few instances early in the airlift of aircraft being attacked: "A Skymaster was attacked in the air and badly shot up, landing at Ashiya with most of its controls inoperative. Some C-47s and C-46s picked up bullet holes flying in and out of Taegu and Pohang, particularly during the period when enemy troops were fighting on one end of the Pohang strip. See

"A man who has heard relatively few shots fired in anger, Tunner is far more akin in outlook and operation to the Detroit executive, the industrial leader who makes mass production tick. Like most such executives, he is preoccupied with costs and time-study." Tunner reveals his executive mind-set with the following statement made during a Time interview: "The cost of an airlift compared with surface transport is really formidable on the face of it, but when you compare the cost of Established on 26 August 1950, CCC was responsible for "airborne assault, airdropped resupply, and airland missions carrying cargo and personnel." 256 Futrell points out that having one fleet of aircraft responsible for such a flexible assortment of airlift missions (i.e., tactical and strategic) was "a new concept in transport aviation."

To furnish broad logistical support for a U.N. campaign calculated to [dislodge] the [Communists] and take [back] all of Korea." Operational airlift units reporting directly to CCC were the C-54s and C-47s of the 374th Troop Carrier Wing, stationed at Tachikawa Air Base, Japan; the C-l 19s of the 314th Troop Carrier Group, which had deployed from Sewart Air Force Base, Tennessee, to Ashiya Air Base, Japan; and the C-46s of the 1st Provisional Group, based at Tachikawa, which was composed of aircraft that had been assigned to various units throughout the Pacific theater; finally, the 437th Troop Carrier (Reserve) Wing from O'Hare International Airport, Chicago had been activated and was scheduled to arrive in November. See Thompson,  11-12. In December 1950, the C-47s of the Royal Hellenic Air Force Flight 13 were assigned to the 21st (Gypsy) Squadron of the 374th Wing for "operational control and logistic support." See Thompson, 337.

Not only CCC, but its parent organization, the FEAF, was "determined that airlift was not to be abused, since /'/ was limited in capacity by the number of transport planes available."

Following this initial assault, for the next three days C-l 19s continued to airdrop hundreds of tons of sorely needed supplies. When it was finally able to link-up with elements of the 8th Army, which had fought its way north from Pyongyang, the 187th RCT was no longer reliant solely upon airdropped supplies.

Two days later, the Commanding General of the G-4 (Logistics) Directorate of the 8th Army contacted Tunner directly to emphasize that "airlift had furnished practically all of the supplies used by 8th Army north of Pyongyang." Moreover, he stated that 8th
Army, which had been forced to stop its advance at Sinanju, urgently "needed 1,000 tons of air resupply daily." These direct communications to Tunner had violated the rules of the system of allocation. Transgressions had occurred because "in the crisis, the respective commanders of 8th Army and 5th A ir Force personally tried to work out solutions." Although Tunner was able to get some units to cutback their requests, "the airlift shortage was nevertheless irreconcilable.:
5th Air Force needs remained high -on a few days tonnages airlifted for the 5th exceeded those lifted for 8th Army. The latter accordingly received far less than the requested 1,000 tons daily.

Tunner's men guessed that the troops could use mixed loads of rations, winter clothing, small arms, and ammunition." See Bowers, 65. For nearly a two-week period, from 28 November to 9 December, 1,483 tons of cargo was airdropped by C-l 19s and 4,700 casualties were evacuated by C-47s. See Eichhorst, 16. During this low-altitude airdrop operation, the C-l 19s were subjected to enemy ground fire from Chinese guerrillas situated in the surrounding hills. Although many aircraft were hit, miraculously no aircraft went down and no crewmembers were wounded. See

Most military men agreed that greater reliance on direct air supply would be a vital supplement to sea and land transport in any major future war. The most extreme advocates of air supply maintained that it was already possible to fly combat forces to any point in the world and keep them supplied. No one had argued along these lines more persistently than Combat Cargo Command's General Tunner w»P££. £E2.Sr "~* a,r<irop,,<!11 -sp,n " measurins5b " 6f -™ d «w4 ''" "The Moving Man " 27 overlooking to, from the surro " nding """""^ ^ Z^U "" """^ ^ ""The Moving Man," 27.

Thompson puts the significance of this operation in perspective: "It was the first time airdrop had given complete logistic support to a major military unit for any length of time, a milestone in military history of which Combat Cargo crew members were very proud. This operation was very costly in terms of human life, as the 1st Marine Division and the 7th Infantry Division experienced close to 5,000 casualties and many more cases of frostbite and illnesses during the course of the retreat."

For example, the CCC Headquarters had to confront routine problems such as "aircraft maintenance, cargo handling, airfield repair, communications, load rigging, air traffic control, and living and work facilities." 332 Bowers argues that this system was "attained as a result of the lessons learned from Berlin and China." Based upon his successful experiences in both of these formative operations, Tunner "created a centralized command able to devote full attention to the single mission of producing effective airlift [emphasis added]." 333 330 Thompson suggests that: "without the supplies and equipment saved by Combat Cargo, the U.N. might have been pushed completely out of Korea. As it was, 8th Army troops still had the will to fight, and enough materiel with which to fight to hold off the Chinese until substantial reinforcements arrived." See Thompson, 68.  "' Says Bowers: "Heroism in airlift generally lay in foreseeing problems rather than trying to overcome them by extraordinary efforts. Seldom did mission urgency justify gambles beyond reasonable margins of safety." As a case in point, "Tunner ... personally intervened against the practice of overloading the patient-evacuation C-47s in early December at Hagaru-ri." See Bowers, 65.
33 -The following statistics support the claim that CCC was a success: "Tonnage lifted per flying hour increased from .95 in September 1950 to 1.62 in the critical month of November; flying hours in the same months rose from 3.0 hours per aircraft to 3.35 [per day]. Yet the major accident rate remained half the FEAF average. See Bowers, 65.
The Korean airlift broke new ground in the fields of aeromedical evacuation and combating guerrilla forces. Korea was the first conflict where wounded soldiers were routinely evacuated by aircraft. As most of the airlift was directed towards delivering logistical support to Korea, the aircraft were usually lightly loaded or even empty on the return flight so that there was available capacity to accommodate the sick and wounded.
It was estimated that thousands of lives were saved due to the utilization of airlift to transport patients. 
334
335
,34 Medical technicians assigned to the 801st Medical Air Evacuation Squadron estimated that patients could be airlifted at an average cost of "two-cents per patient mile" compared to sealifting them at a cost that far exceeded this amount. Thompson explains that after this new concept had become widely accepted: "air evacuation went on around the clock, and ... regardless of weather. Nurses and medics ... assumed all the risks of the aircraft crew members, taking their chances with the rugged terrain, weather, inadequate landing strips, possible enemy air attack, frequent ground fire, and possible sabotage from the patients [i.e., North Korean POWs] " As of 30 December 1950, the 801st MAES had airlifted 68,873 patients, most of them wounded in combat. In the month of December 1950 alone, which was the single highest month for air evacuations, 28,140 patients were airlifted. See Thompson, 54.

to an "asset of convenience." 354 On 1 July 1951, the North Koreans agreed to begin negotiations for an armistice agreement, so that for the remainder of the war, airlift operations, though substantial, had become more "routine in nature." 
355
Although this was a significant increase, it had been accomplished slowly and methodically by applying lessons that had been learned from the World War II Hump operation, "operating a good route structure, increasing the airplanes available, and managing the system efficiently [emphasis added]."

Both Tunner and Henebry recommended that the new jumbo C-l 24 Globemaster should undergo an extensive evaluation to see whether it could be utilized "effectively and economically" on the Korean airlift's "long hauls between Japan and the islands, and between Tokyo and Seoul, mainly on the high density runs where every mission could be carried out at maximum or close to maximum capacity." 
359
361
The C-124 has performed brilliantly on the Korean airlift. It has proved its ability to land safely at all major Korean airstrips with loads as high as 50,000 pounds. We would like to have a lot of them here. We can use them [emphasis added]. 
362
""Futrell, USAF in Korea, 557 -559. '""In April 1951, General Henebry had made the case to the Air Staff that if he had C-124s assigned to his inventory, he would be able to "accomplish his mission with fewer planes, crews and less congestion." See Futrell, 563.
361 With a maximum capacity of "200 passengers, 25 tons of cargo or 136 litter patients," one Globemaster mission would be able to transport the equivalent of four-to-five C-54, C-46, or C-l 19 missions, resulting in less congestion and reduced stress on the runways. See Thompson, 163. The September test entailed 26 separate flights into Korea by a single C-124, with an average payload of 34,400 tons, two times as much as the C-54 was capable of handling. See Miller, 200. Furthermore, it demonstrated the feasibility of airlifting "25 tons of payload cargo, 167 air evacs for a world's record, and more than 200 people in a single flight." See

Nevertheless the 315th AD calculated that even with a 160,000-pound weight restriction and a five hour per day utilization rate, the capability of the new C-l 24 fleet still far-exceeded that of the C-54s. 
369
360
368 By April 1953, the 483d Wing had finally reached its authorized unit strength of 96 C-l 19s. The combination of newer airframes and sufficient replacement parts enabled the wing to improve its in-commission rate to 67.2% during the first half of 1953, and even surpass standards by achieving a 78.8% in-commission rate in June 1953. While the aircraft was technically designed to carry 15 tons, because of its defective landing gear, cargo loads to Korea were restricted by 60%, to just six tons. Furthermore, the propellers were prone to failure in flight, so that the aircraft was restricted from carrying passengers other than paratroopers, who could egress in an emergency situation. See Futrell, 565.
" m Fifth AF airfield engineers oversaw the construction of a new runway, completed on 27 October 1952, at the Seoul Municipal Airport which would be able to withstand sustained operations by the heavy C-l24 transport. Even with the airfield restrictions and the new re-inforced runway, C-l24 operations were limited to a gross weight of 160,000 pounds, meaning that it could carry a 50,000 pound (25-ton) payload, which was three tons short of its design specifications. Fifth Air Force, "in order to keep the Globemasters off its more important tactical fields," restricted C-l24 Korean operations to only Kimpo, Taegu, Suwon and Osan-ni. See Futrell, 566.
soon receive "increased supply support," as of November "the C-124s were [still ] not able to fly enough to make up for the lost C-54 capability [emphasis added]." 370 That December, the most recently delivered C-124s of the 22nd Squadron were found to have fuel leaking from their wing tanks, which meant that the entire squadron had to be grounded approximately two months while the leaks were sealed by maintenance. 
371
372
371 As this would take approximately two months, the personnel and supplies of the 22nd Squadron were used to temporarily augment the efforts of the 6th Squadron, which flew its aircraft beyond the normal utilization rate in order to compensate for the grounding of its sister squadron. See Futrell, 567.
""However, starting on 29 May, a series of unexplained Globemaster engine fires began to occur. On 11 June General McCarty requested that an Air Materiel Command engineering team be sent from the U.S. to investigate the cause of the fires. Although the team was able to isolate the source of the problem to faulty generators, the worst disaster in aviation history occurred before any corrective measures were taken See Futrell, 567.
,7j Subsequently, the Globemasters underwent rigorous inspections in which a significant portion of the fleet was found to have faulty generators which would not be able to be repaired until after the war had ended. Despite this setback, nevertheless, "most C-124s were released for flight on 8 July." See Futrell, 567.
The shortcomings of the C-124 fleet adversely impacted C-47 and C-46 operations as well. These smaller aircraft had to compensate for the failure of the C-124 to live up to its expectations, which in-turn disrupted the entire air transport system.

An exception was the 5th Air Force, General Tunner referred to Korea as a "proving ground in combat air transportation," (i.e., airdrop, aeromedical evacuation, guerrilla resupply, etc.). Yet, in light of what had been achieved in Burma and Berlin, he was concerned that airlift had been underutilized. 
384
Pointing to the future, Tunner wrote that "air transportation must take its proper place in the military family [emphasis added]. " 386
given that "95% of aircraft support items for units in Korea traveled by air, and the air wings in Korea were held to small stock levels." See Futrell, 573. In terms of total tonnage, "sealift, controlled by the Navy's Military Sea Transport Service, moved most of the property from Japan to Korea and from the CONUS to Japan and Korea." See Gary F. Hollums, "A Push-Pull Combination Struggles Through," in Rutenberg and Allen eds., The Logistics of Waging War, 140. For the record, MATS accomplished the following during the course of the Korean War: MATS, using its fleet of C-47, C-54, C-97, C-l 19 and C-124 aircraft, airlifted 214,000 passengers and 80,000 tons of cargo to the combat area during the three-year conflict. Within the combat area, airlift forces airdropped 15,000 tons of supplies. ... In addition, the command airlifted about 386,000 patients, 320,000 within the combat theater and 66,536 to the U.S. The swift evacuation resulted in the lowest death rate from wounds experienced by U.S. forces in any war to date. See Richard J. Burkard,  Military Airlift Command: Historical Handbook 1941 -1984 (Scott AFB, IL: MAC Command Historical  Office, 1984) 4. 3M Tunner, Over the Hump, 261. 
385
380 "Air transportation ... must be considered and planned for as necessary to support a given campaign under a given set of circumstances. It should be an integral part of the overall transportation system. We must plan for it to do the job for which it is best suited such as evacuation of medical patients; movement of critical items of supply and equipment; fast deployment of forces; movement of all the expensive and important material to avoid wasteful stockpiling of these materials, [and] air supply of isolated units." See Tunner, 263.
Tactical, as opposed to strategic, airlift made the most valuable contribution to the war effort in Korea. As justification for his assertion that airlift was militarily important, Tunner made the following observation concerning the role that tactical airlift had played during the Korean War:
The ability of the 8th Army to move farther and faster than any previous army in history was due in large part to air transport. Aerial resupply allowed the 8th to drive up the west coast of Korea without regard to lines of ground supply.

ATA proposed three solutions. First, they suggested cutting the number of aircraft and personnel assigned to MATS. Second, they suggested that the forces assigned to MATS 400 Ibid., 287. 401 Ibid., 290. * : The ATA employed three smear tactics: (1) ATA persuaded Congress to investigate the efficiency of MATS, with the hope of getting legislation to curtail their operations; (2) ATA elicited the support of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Legion to fight for their cause; (3) ATA recruited the press and had articles written supporting their proposition in such leading journals as Time, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal as well as all the leading aviation magazines. See Tunner, 291.
40 " The ATA claimed that MATS was the largest airline in the world and that its aircraft were extravagantly plush and serviced by 480 beautiful stewardesses. ATA claimed that MATS flew many of the same routes that the airlines flew. ATA said that because of their strategic support mission, MATS had been "riding on SAC's coattails." See Tunner, 292. should drastically reduce their flying time and stay current in simulators instead. Third, they suggested that when MATS flew their aircraft, they should fly them empty. 
404
First, because of the attacks, both the administration and DOD were reluctant to spend any money to purchase new equipment for a command which could very well be inactivated.
In fact, during the latter half of the 1950s, MATS did not have a single aircraft in design or on order. Second, the nature of the attacks took a toll on the morale of the MATS personnel [emphasis added].

General Tunner believed that as the commander of what he considered to be an important military organization with a wartime strategic mission, it was his duty to fight back. He acknowledged that civilian pilots could perform many important functions, but felt that only military personnel, trained in the art of war, were capable of performing in a combat environment. Moreover, he pointed out the fact that during the Lebanon and Taiwan crises there were ten separate incidents where MATS could not get enough civilian carriers to augment its routine missions. The airline rationale for noncompliance was that they were overloaded with summertime vacationers. Additionally, many of the carriers made contract bids which were much too high to consider seriously. His point was that although the ATA was pushing to takeover MATS' peacetime mission, many carriers had turned their backs on MATS in its moment of need. 
408
Eisenhower had pledged to keep taxes low, and his new look force structure fit perfectly with his goal to strengthen the economy. His slogan was the "biggest bang for the buck."
Since nuclear forces cost much less to build and keep than a balance between nuclear and conventional forces, "the economic ax fell hardest on the Army and the conventional commands of the A ir Force. " 
409
He called for procurement of new aircraft for the MATS fleet, charging that the backbone of the fleet, the C-124 which he had sold to Symington during the Berlin Airlift, had become obsolete. He suggested that if MATS had new jet aircraft added to its force structure (like the airline industry had), it could increase its payload, increase its range and lower its operating costs. He pointed out that a replacement aircraft was already long overdue, but there was nothing on order or being researched and developed.

Tunner explained the difference between the military airlift mission as compared to the civilian airline mission.

To make his case, General Tunner conducted the largest peacetime airlift exercise every attempted. Operation "Big Slam" went on for 15 days, beginning on 14 March 1960. Even though the press had no expertise in airlift, General Tunner was convinced that anyone observing would be able to discern the inadequacies of the MATS airlift fleet.
So the press was invited and 352 correspondents came to Puerto Rico to witness the event for themselves, 4 "' as did several interested Congressmen.

Straws in the wind during that period indicated a turning point in our military planning, our entire strategic concept. One criteria Kuter purposely neglected to mention was the speed of such an aircraft. He believed that 250 knots was adequate, emphasizing that "in this era of jet and supersonic speeds it is important, 1 think, not to transfer this emphasis on speed to the field of air transport, where it is in fact a secondary consideration." Surprisingly, the Commander of all U.S. strategic airlift forces was not advocating the development of a jet-powered airlifter.

Fundamentally, Kuter believed that the Berlin Airlift had the effect of telescoping "years of education ... into months." So that "standing beside the great diplomatic victory of the Airlift, [was] the gratifying realization that strategic air transport is recognized and respected in the thinking of those who are most concerned with the formation of national aviation policy." He elaborated that:
No longer, I feel, is there the danger that the U.S. may develop a first-rate combat Air Force, Army and Navy, which might he hamstrung by inadequate support by second-rate air transport. If Vittles has eliminated this danger then our great inveshnent in that operation will have been repaid in full [emphasis added].

434 On 20 August 1950, less than two months after hostilities initially erupted, General Douglas Mac Arthur initiated this course of action when he transmitted a formal request to the Department of the Army. Futrell points out that upon its receipt of this request in Washington: "the Department of the Army not only ordered substantial numbers of utility helicopters for assignment as organic aviation, but it also planned the activation of several transport helicopter companies which were to be equipped with light-cargo helicopters."

Shortly after the Korean conflict the Army began to build its own fixed-wing tactical airlift aircraft because it claimed the Air Force was not devoting enough to the airlift mission. The Air Force protested and published a memorandum in 1956 entitled "Memorandum for Members of the Armed Forces Policy Council," which stated that the Air Force "presently provides adequate airborne lift in light of currently approved

strategic concepts (i.e. massive retaliation)." The rationale was that an Army operating under that doctrine would have little need for a massive airlift capacity, since in the event of war, "the bomb would beat them to the action." The 1957 Department of Defense Directive #5160.22 prohibited the Army from procuring any fixed-wing aircraft which weighed more than 5,000 pounds and specifically prevented it from developing its own airlift capability except within the combat zone [emphasis added].

By the mid-1950s, new tactical transports appeared with payload and forward airstrip capabilities far beyond those of the CCC's. Cargo hauling methods of 1950 became grossly obsolete within a decade. But these developments merely strengthened the already incontestable conclusion to be drawn from Korea -that air transport, centrally organized and strongly managed, was an instrument of vast tactical and logistical application [emphasis added]. 
442
Virtually all Air Force funding went toward strategic bombardment or support thereof.
General Duane Cassidy, while serving as Commander in Chief of MAC, noted that: the airlift forces the United States had available in the late 1950s came as a result of the [strategic] doctrine established in the early years of the Eisenhower Administration ... airlift's primary mission under massive retaliation was the support of the nuclear strike forces. Tactical airlift forces stood by in Europe and the Far East for the prestrike movements of weapons and strike aircraft.

The original version of Air Force Manual 1-2, USAF Basic Doctrine, was published in 1953. This manual stated that there were "two broad aspects of air operations, heartland and peripheral actions." It described heartland operations as those that attack the "vital elements of a nation's war sustaining resources, including the enemy's long-range air force." This would equate to long-range strategic bombing. It described peripheral actions as including "the tasks of reducing the enemy's air and surface efforts and are not necessarily limited to specific geographic areas." This meant, in essence, the interdiction mission of fighter aircraft. The manual elaborated that the heartland mission would "require the priority commitment of air forces" because of the "conclusive effects obtained by attacks on the heartland targets, which represent the greatest threats." It also expanded further on the peripheral mission as having the "task of gaining and maintaining control of the air" and "to neutralize the deployed enemy forces." Air defense was also mentioned as a primary mission of the Air Force. The doctrine stated that "the establishment and maintenance of an effective operational air defense force is mandatory." The 1953 Air Force doctrine also established the preeminence of the Air Force over the Army and Navy by stating that "measures to gain control of the air ... are a prerequisite to the commitment of armies and navies to battle." Finally, the doctrine confirmed the widely held view that warfare was now to be total in nature. It stated that:
the effect of the advent of this force in the conduct of war is to make modern war more total-its threat more imminent, its impact more sudden, its expanse more extensive, and its destruction exceedingly more devastating.

in the division of resources among forces of different types, the priorities must be established so as to insure allocations which provide the maximum return in military capabilities. The capabilities must be related to the forms of conflict and the threats projected by those forms of conflict, with emphasis in the allocation of resources being placed at all times on the provision of the means to meet the primary threat. 
45
Another mission was added to the Air Force in addition to the original three, that of air reconnaissance. It stated that "air reconnaissance is one of the major sources of information requisite to successful military operations." Finally, this edition posed that airpower was the most potent military force, stating that "of the various types of military The 1959 edition brought in a new emphasis on space after the satellite launches.
The term air was replaced with aerospace to include the space environment as a natural extension for the Air Force. To quote the text, it concluded that:
the aerospace is a medium in which freedom to operate during war will be of vital military significance. That nation, or group of nations, which maintains predominance in the aerospace-not only in its military forces but also in its sciences and technologies-will have the means to prevail in conflict. 
452
The decade of the 1950s can be considered the "dark ages" of airlift, as stagnation occurred on every measure. Organizationally, MATS stayed in place as a peacetime-oriented support service commanded by a lieutenant general. Furthermore, its very essence came into question later in the decade. Structurally, the airlift fleet was allowed to deteriorate due to neglect, as only the C-124 and C-l 18 (a commercial derivative) were procured in any significant numbers. Doctrinally, airlift was not even mentioned as a footnote in the first four editions of Air Force Manual 1-1, spanning the years 1953 -1959.
In large measure, this neglect can be attributed to the Eisenhower Administration's New Look force structure which placed primary emphasis on strategic bombers in support of its doctrine of massive retaliation. Nonetheless, by the end of the decade, airlift stood poised for a revolution that would take it to new heights under flexible response. From the original mission statement drafted by Secretary of Defense Forrestal in 1948, it is clearly evident that "MATS was originally envisioned as a non-combatant airlift organization."

11 Secretary of Defense McNamara testified before the House Armed Services Committee in 1964: "The distinction between troop carrier and strategic airlift operations based upon difference in equipment will no longer be significant once the C-130Es and C-141's are acquired. Both of these aircraft are suitable for either mission. Indeed, the C-141 may open up entirely new vistas in troop carrier operations. For example, it might prove to be entirely feasible to load troops and their equipment in the U.S. and fly them directly to the battle area overseas, instead of moving them by strategic airlift to an overseas assembly point and then loading them and their equipment on troop carriers. Thus, the line of demarcation between the strategic airlift mission and the troop carrier or assault mission may, in time, become less important." This viewpoint was reiterated by General Joseph W. Kelly, Tunner's replacement at MATS, who testified at the same hearings that "the words strategic and tactical should not be used to describe airlift. Rather, terms such as deployment, employment, assault, and resupply are more descriptive of the role of airlift in combat" See Walker, 50-51.
7 "Headquarters MATS establishes the mission directives I AW priorities developed at the top levels of military authority. The operating air forces, EASTAF and WESTAF [Eastern & Western Transport Air  Force], are assigned specific missions, and they control the strategic airlift aircraft operating within their geographic areas of responsibility. MATS strategic airlift is global. EASTAF's area extends from the east directive, MATS implemented several initiatives which further institutionalized combat capabilities into its mission orientation." Shortly after his retirement, Tunner wrote:
Like Strategic Air Command and Tactical Air Command, MATS is combat ready, maintaining a strategic airlift task force always at runway alert in support of the initial deployment of the aerospace striking forces [emphasis added]. 
12
13
Moreover, he claimed these other commands were usually commanded by "combat officers who do not understand airlift " u Although the Air Force had the lion's share of airlift assets, he was dissatisfied by the fact that "within the Air Force, they tended to be scattered among different commands, a violation of basic organizational principles that in part contributes to the deficiencies in airlift existing today [emphasis added]." 15 involvement in this operation was tremendous. Missions included a series of airlifts of essential battle equipment, ammunition and supplies to Florida. This was followed by a massive 48-hour airlift of battle-equipped Marines from the West Coast to Guantanamo. In addition, large numbers of dependents were evacuated to the U.S. mainland by air." See Walker, 52.
"These initiatives included: (l)The Applied Tactics Group was established on 1 January 1963 to "develop a coherent program of combat airlift crew qualification and currency, equipment requirements, improved employment tactics, and integration of new equipment into the MATS force"; (

12 Tunner, "Strategic Airlift," 108. Tunner elaborates that "the wartime mission of MATS is established by the JCS. Similarly in peace, MATS is directly concerned with DOD instructions. The Secretary of the Air Force is the 'single manager' of airlift service for the DOD. MATS is his operating agent to provide airlift to all U.S. armed forces." See Tunner, "Strategic Airlift," 112. 
13
The result was that aircraft with great potential were sitting idle on flight lines all over the world. Tunner maintained that MATS had developed a separate expertise within the military run by professionals dedicated solely to airlift and proposed that the solution to the problem would be to consolidate all the airlift functions under "one senior commander and an experienced staff whose whole thinking is devoted to the airlift mission, such as we find in MATS today." 
16
Tunner suggested that the new command should be named the "Military Airlift
Command" and that it should be charged with sole responsibility for all the transport Command, SAC and even TAC, which are used for specific airlift tasks. During limited or all-out emergencies some of the capability of these units is wasted or engaged in secondary or low-priority missions at the time the primary airlift system is accelerated to the maximum on the top-priority jobs." See Tunner, "Strategic Airlift," 113. '"Tunner writes: "in order to achieve a stronger defense, and to reduce costs, I strongly recommend the consolidation of all transport aircraft into a single command."

2a Originally designated the CV-2, the U.S. Army placed the first order for these transports, ordering 159 aircraft. Deliveries began in 1959 and by 1967 there were still 134 in service, which were transferred to the Air Force and redesignated the C-7. With a maximum payload of 8740 pounds, it could fly 242 nautical miles at an average cruise speed of 182 MPH. Its maximum speed was 216 MPH. Empty, it could fly 1307 nautical miles. See Thomas E. Eichhorst, Military Airlift: Turbulence, Evolution, and Promise for the Future (Maxwell AFB, AL: Air University Press, 1991) 94 -95. The C-7 could carry 32 passengers, 28 combat troops, or 20 medical evacuees.

27 Derived from the Chase Aircraft Company's XCG-20 glider, two underwing engines were mounted along with various other modifications to come up with the XC-123 design. In its production form, TAC began accepting deliveries of approximately 300 C-123s from the Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation in 1955. Relegated primarily to "logistics tasks in support of strike aircraft units," by 1957 the C-123s were being transferred to Reserve status. See Raymond L. Bowers, U.S. Air Force in Southeast Asia: Tactical Airlift, (Washington, DC: Office of Air Force History, 1983) 29.

29 Eichhorst, Military Airlift, 30. 3u According to Tunner, "until this equipment is available, the force will be provided a degree of interim modernization by limited purchases of aircraft now in production, or in the advanced stages of development. These purchases will include a number of C-130Es, the long-range version of the C-130B medium troop-carrier aircraft. Not only will modernization strengthen the airlift force, but larger capacity, greater speed and a quicker turnaround time will also reduce the total number of aircraft needed for the assigned strategic airlift mission." See Tunner, "Strategic Airlift," 109 -110. Estes adds that: "the interim modernization of MATS, initiated by Congress in the wake of Big Slam, was stepped up with accelerated deliveries of the C-135 and C-130E. ... The C-135 jet resolved the problems of speed and range/payload to some extent, since it can carry 19 tons 3600 miles at high subsonic speeds. As a cargo aircraft, however, it has disadvantages: it is loaded from the side to a high cargo floor, is not stressed for sustained maximum-load operations, requires long runways of high weight-bearing capacity, and lacks the important airdrop capability." See Estes, "The Revolution in Airlift," 6.
It is essential that this Nation maintain in being a strategic airlift force compatible with the aerospace-offensive forces it must support. To be compatible with the strike forces, the strategic airlift force must be modernized and equipped with jet-powered aircraft [emphasis added].

"""'We must strengthen our military tools ... in the past, lack of consistent, coherent military strategy ... [has] made it difficult to assess accurately how adequate or inadequate our defenses really are. I have, therefore, instructed the Secretary of Defense to reappraise our entire defense strategy." See James A. Nathan and James K. Oliver, United States Foreign Policy and World Order (Boston: Little, Brown and  Company, 1976)  41 See Henry Kissinger, Nuclear Weapons and Foreign Policy (New York: W.W. Norton & Company, 1957), 144 -145, cited in Nathan and Oliver, 252.Henry Kissinger, the head of a nuclear strategy think tank at Harvard University, called for the need to develop a military force capable of fighting at any level of conflict from insurgency to general nuclear warfare. He stated that "limited war is thus not an alternative to massive retaliation, but its complement. It is the capability for massive retaliation which provides the sanction against expanding the war."
42 See Maxwell D. Taylor, The Uncertain Trumpet (New York: Harper & Row, 1960), cited in Nathan and Oliver, 251. This widely-read book articulated the point that nuclear weapons may be good for preventing full scale wars, but they were of no use to counter guerrilla-type warfare, especially in light of the Soviet's nuclear retaliatory capability. Because of massive retaliation's shortcomings, General Taylor called for a reassessment of U.S. strategic doctrine.
'The President proclaimed that "we are moving into a period of uncertain risk and great commitment thus we must be able to respond with discrimination and speed, to any problem at any spot on the globe at any moment's notice." See Nathan and Oliver, 288.

Yet in less than two decades strategic airlift forces have demonstrated time and again their diverse capabilities." He made the point that "strategic airlift is more than aircraft and communications, centralized command and control, and responsiveness to airlift priorities. It is the flesh and blood of men, the cumulative know-how of succeeding crises met and calmed as the concept of strategic airlift grew to maturity in the aerospace age:
It is the man who flew the Himalayan Hump as a first lieutenant, captained a C-54 into Berlin, flew aircrew check rides as a major across the lonely Pacific to Korea, threats so that the United States would not be faced with the choice of either using nuclear weapons or foregoing vital interests abroad because it lacked nonnuclear options. ... In order to achieve a flexible response, the forces would be designed to fight a total thermonuclear war, limited nuclear war, conventional war in Europe or Asia, or unconventional warfare anywhere in the world. With this sequence of events in mind, the general posed that "the airlift doctrines which were tested, refined, and adopted with the passing years have never been static. They are as dynamic as the air vehicle itself. The salient features of today's airlift doctrine can be simply stated:
(1) Airlift forces enhance the inherent mobility of aerospace combat elements and ensure their sustained striking power by expediting the mobility portion of the logistics function; (2) The greatest flexibility of airlift forces is attained by consolidating all military elements within the aerospace force and organizing the function within a single worldwide command to provide airlift to all armed forces within priorities established only at national Governmental policy levels, in consonance with the national global strategy; (3) Since ton-mile costs are the vital consideration in the economics of airlift forces, the airlift vehicle must be economical to build, economical to operate, easy to maintain, and easy to load, with sufficient versatility to accept various types of cargo.

Chapters Four, Five and Six incorporate the role of the airlift mission in their combat planning scenarios dealing with tactical nuclear, conventional and counterinsurgency warfare, respectively. Chapter Four, Employment of Aerospace Forces in Tactical Nuclear Operations, states that "performance of the airlift mission depends on the limits observed in the use of nuclear weapons." 52 Chapter Five, Employment of short-range theater airlift forces under control of the theater commander." See Tunner, "Strategic Airlift" 104.
51 Tunner elaborates that: "Though the nature and form of the combat forces will exert profound influence upon the composition and origin of strategic airlift forces, the capabilities of global strategic airlift are too vast to be relegated to a minor role." He also acknowledged the responsibility of airlift planners to consider "the demands of surface forces, both land and water." See Tunner, "Strategic Airlift," 105.
On the evening of 2 August 1964, three fast North Vietnamese "Swatow" PT boats fired upon the Maddox, a U.S. Naval destroyer which had been conducting surveillance operations from international waters, 28 miles off the North Vietnamese coast. The Maddox and fighters from the Ticonderoga retaliated immediately in self defense.' 7 The next day, President Lyndon Johnson relayed a "note of protest" to the government in Hanoi. In the early morning darkness of the 4th of August, the Maddox again reported that it was "being fired upon" by North Vietnamese patrols.

Then would come the 'limited pressure' phase lasting through the rest of the year, to maintain the morale of the Khanh government without risking escalation. This phase would witness covert operations against North Vietnam, training of Vietnamese pilots to fly jet aircraft, moves across the border into the Laotian panhandle, reinstatement of naval patrols in the Gulf of Tonkin, and 'tit for tat' reprisals. Finally, more serious pressures were to start on 1 January 1965. Initial measures to destroy enemy infiltration routes and facilities would progress to the bombardment of military targets in North Vietnam.

Additional airlift assets were received from the Royal Australian Air Force, which deployed a detachment of six Caribous to Tan Son Nhut on 10 August 1964. These aircraft and crews were integrated into the Air Force's centralized airlift control system. The U.S. Army Caribous, on the other hand, were not. See Futrell, 236. The Australians were able to bolster the monthly airlift effort by 600 tons per month, "proving that all the Caribous could be scheduled and used within a centralized system." See Futrell, 246. The U.S. Air Force Reserve began deploying the fourth squadron of C-123 s on 23 September, when eight C-123s departed Hurlburt Field, Florida for Vietnam. Effective 1 October 1964 the 19th Air Commando Squadron (Troop Carrier) was activated at Tan Son Nhut. See Bowers, 146. The 19th ACS was assigned to the 315th Troop Carrier Group. See Futrell, 236.

The "Fast Fly" program was another MAC initiative which entailed "extending the workweek from 40 to 48 hours" and "expanding the forward supply system from 45 to 57 forward supply points." 80 Another strategic airlift Fast Fly initiative included changing maintenance intervals from one based upon flying hours to one based upon prior scheduling, called an "isochronal system (ISO)." 81 Finally, MAC also instituted two crew arrival at an APOE. In 1966 a variant of this program, 999, was applied to all kinds of cargo. See

S! The ISO system enabled MAC to manage the number of aircraft available at any given time. The previous system, based upon flying hours, caused many aircraft to become due for periodic maintenance concurrently, causing a backlog in maintenance and a shortage of aircraft in the system. By scheduling aircraft in advance, based on 70-day, 35-day and 7-day home station inspections, except for unscheduled maintenance, there was more continuity in the maintenance pipeline and on the flightline.

In a similar fashion, MTMTS coordinated its strategic airlift requests from MAC through the 8th Aerial Port Squadron.

Although the C-133 had increased range and payload capabilities, it too was "marginal for 8: The Quick Stop approach enabled an aircraft to transit a station and be flying again within an hour of touchdown (instead of two), assuming there was no change of crews.

"In May 1965 CINCPAC merged the control of sealift and airlift within the Southeast Asian theater into the West Pac Transportation Office (WTO), which had previously dealt exclusively with airlift matters. In addition to the facilities located at numerous sites throughout the region, in November CINCPAC set up a WTO liaison office in Saigon to "coordinate sealift and airlift problems with MACV Traffic Management Agency." Thus, says Rutenberg and Allen, "the mission of the WTO evolved from managing airlift to control of all theater airlift and sealift resources and determination of movement priorities." See Rutenberg and Allen, 157.
strategy at the Honolulu conference to a ground war meant that the principal role of air power in South Vietnam in the future was support for American andallied groundforces."
This would soon translate into an ever-growing demand for airlift. Fundamentally, this strategy meant that the Air Force had to adapt its nuclear force structure to an unconventional environment: two decades of doctrine, force procurement, and training had ill-prepared it. While continuing to maintain its worldwide strategic posture, which had claimed most of its attention since World War If the Air Force was now directed to support a ground war.

93 Subsequently, when the Army proposed a further expansion to 120 Caribous in Vietnam, the Air Force was firmly opposed, viewing the "turboprop aircraft as a costly duplication of the jet-modified C-123."
One of the war's most contentious airpower issues concerned the U.S. Army -Air Force controversy over the employment of the airmobile division. General McConnell claimed that the concept of the airmobile division was "untested" and that it should not be employed until it's organic supportability had been proven. Underlying McConnell's argument was a long-held contention between the Air Force and the Army over "the role and control of tactical support aircraft." Since it had become a separate service, the Air Force had perceived the steady growth of the Army's organic aviation capabilities as a threat.

The implications of the fairmobile] division going to Vietnam reached far beyond the war in that country; the success or failure of the experiment could have an important bearing on the future force structure of both services [emphasis added].

A fundamental tenet of Air Force doctrine is the belief that: "air power [is] an indivisible entity, with a life and rules of its own, which [is] most effective and economical when planned and controlled rationally from one central place." As such, the Army's insistence on assigning "globules of single-purpose aircraft" to South Vietnam was anathema to Air Force doctrine, which deemed it "wasteful and inefficient." See Schlight, 62.

Based upon the total projections made for the ground force deployment, "by the end of 1966, there would be the equivalent of 30 jet squadrons of 18 planes each in the country, flying close to 20,000 sorties a month to support 72 non-Vietnamese battalions." 101 Schlight points out the difficulties involved with finding enough replacement aircraft:
Unlike the situation immediately before the Korean conflict, when the U.S. had been producing 35 different types of planes, there were now only seven coming off the assembly lines. None of these were bombers, and only the F-4 and F-5 were fighters [emphasis added].

See Schlight, 70.

The tables had turned. During this war, transports were being produced, with the C-130 continuing strong, the C-141 just becoming operational and the C-5 still being developed.
Nevertheless, the overall "aircraft production base was weak."

The Air Force would have two-thirds (53 of 83) [64%]of its tactical fighter squadrons committed overseas, nearly one-fourth of them (20)  These findings indicated to the JCS that "the increase in forces being sent to the Pacific was cutting severely into the force structure that was coming perilously close to being unable to handle all its responsibilities." It was estimated that in order to uphold the two and a half war strategy (Vietnam = half-war), the Air Force would need to procure "eleven new fighter squadrons" and "five more troop carrier squadrons" by the end of 1965 [emphasis added].

exposure to the enemy. General McConnell "doubted this would be the case," and thus ordered PACAF to:
keep detailed statistics on every phase of the operation, including the amount of nonorganic air support requested by the division, both for strike and airlift; the order of battle of both friendly and enemy forces; and the enemy losses of soldiers and equipment, particularly to tactical aircraft and B-52s [emphasis added].

November. This operation proved to rely heavily upon U.S. Air Force close air support 110 as well as B-52 air interdiction missions. 111 Most significantly, "Air Force airlift had proved to be even more important than had the fighters" During the course of this battle, 110 "During the month-long action, strike planes flew 753 sorties, 330 of them during the critical 7-day period in mid-November. These sorties supported only two battalions in the field and averaged, during the most important week, 23 sorties a day for each battalion. See Schlight, 106.
'"B-52 operations were heavily utilized and Westmoreland was delegated authority from the JCS to approve his own bomber missions, "subject to monitoring and possible veto by higher authority." B-52s executed "96 sorties and dropped close to 5,000 bombs on enemy positions and supply routes." Silver Bayonet had been "the first time in the war the huge bombers were used in direct support of the fighting on the ground." See Schlight, 104-105. 
112
The division lacked the ability to airlift supplies to the battlefield from 150 miles away. Any time major quantities of fuel and supplies had to be airlifted over ranges beyond 25 miles, the airlift requirement would start cutting into [the] division's operational capabilities. ... Airmobile doctrine should call for Air Force, not organic Army, planes to fly supplies from the depot to the brigade bases. This is the only way [we] could be certain of having enough planes for tactical operations [emphases added]."

1:1 It flew scheduled flights over predetermined routes. There were stage crews available along the routes. There was nothing to prevent a normal logistics lift. There was no en route threat, staging bases were not being bombed, and the destination airport was relatively secure. See Miller, 333.  122 "The C-141 proved its combat airlift capability, and the recovery base concept was validated. The C-141 took over the role of some of the C-124s and all C-130s with a fourfold increase in airlift capability, taking approximately one-third the time it took a C-124 or C-133." See 
Miller,

the agreement was that "the Army relinquished claims to future fixed-wing aircraft, transferring the CV-2s to the Air Force, and the Air Force renounced the helicopter airlift role." 125 Bowers attributes this "resolution of doctrinal differences... [to] events in Vietnam." In particular, the gross deficiencies of the Army's airmobile division concept which came to light during operation Silver Bayonet "capped the continuing controversies over Army air mobility."

127 By Air Force standards, the CV-2s were grossly underutilized. Each company flew an average often missions per day, which equated to a little more than one mission every other day per aircraft. It was not possible to support an airmobile division with this low utilization rate. As these aircraft were outside the SEAAS, they were primarily used by the 1st Air Cavalry Division, Special Forces and "higher" U.S. Army Headquarters for "battlefield supply and to carry passengers, mail and medium cargo."

McConnell did not want to allow this to transpire. 12y A worse possibility would have been to allow the two service staffs to handle the matter by themselves, given that "the controversy had taken on deep doctrinal overtones."

General William W. Momyer, became the Commander of 7th AF, replacing General Moore, who been reassigned as Vice CINCPACAF. The defining feature of Momyer's doctrinal emphasis was his strong belief that "air power was most efficient when it was centrally controlled." When he assumed command, airlift was the worst violator of this precept and, in Momyer's estimation was in desperate need of "tighter organization and direction." In Momyer's view, all of the fixed-wing airlift assets in Vietnam (i.e., C-130, C-123, C-7) should have been under a common centralized mechanism of command and control. This was even more important in Vietnam than it had been in the previous conflicts in Burma and Korea, given the "unprecedented reliance on the Air Force's tactical airlift fleet "

However, in Vietnam this was not the case.

'"This was true for two reasons: "(1) Congestion at the few Vietnamese water ports often forced ocean-going vessels bearing cargo for Vietnam to deposit their loads at outlying ports in Okinawa or the Philippines, from which they were flown to Vietnam; (2) Once inside the country the cargo once again had to be moved by air, since the inadequacy and insecurity of road and railroads ruled out the more normal and less expensive surface distribution." See Schlight, 140. belonged exclusively to the U.S. Air Force, nevertheless each type of aircraft had a different chain of command. The fact of the matter was that "separate airlift systems remained, with different, and at times, conflicting priorities and schedules." Momyer was adamant that all of these aircraft should be brought under the jurisdiction of 7th Air Force because in its present state "the projected increase in airlift sorties would strain the system beyond the point of efficiency [emphasis added]."

In addition to his 96 newly-inherited C-7s, Momyer had a force of 60 C-123s and 140 C-130s. Used to fly to unimproved strips and for airdrop, the Provider was very versatile. The C-123s each flew an average of five one-hour sorties per day. These airlifters were so heavily utilized that they were employed in nearly every major land battle.

!4! Jones and Lindbo, "Tactical Airlift," 13. As of mid-1966 there were 12 squadrons located in the Philippines, Okinawa, Taiwan, and Japan. Forty of these aircraft operated in Vietnam on a rotating basis. They operated out of Tan Son Nhut, Da Nang, Nha Trang and Cam Ranh Bay Within a year's time, the C-130 in-country force structure had grown by a factor often, from four to forty and was now transporting 67% of the country's total tonnage. See Schlight, 144.
14: They cited the inefficiency of shuttling the planes back and forth between the islands and the mainland, usually empty on the return trip. They also argued that flying the mission in Vietnam required pilots with an intimate knowledge of the challenging terrain and often treacherous airstrips -knowledge that could not be acquired on two-week tours in the country. See Schlight, 144.
143 According to PACAF and the Air Staff, "the C-130s had to serve the entire Pacific and must be ready for missions outside Southeast Asia if they were needed. PACAF also pointed out that Vietnam was crammed with airplanes and support units and keeping the C-130s there permanently would require maintenance and support elements that would further tax an already saturated situation." See Schlight, 144.

Although officially the ALCC was "subordinate" to 7th AF's TACC, requests for airlift normally came through MACVs Traffic Management Authority. So, in practice, the ALCC was more responsive to MACV than to 7th AF. See

That airlift remained a problem was primarily correlated, in my mind, with the failure to assign a C-130 wing to the Air Component Commander. We violate our own principles. We complain about the Marines not coming in wholeheartedly with us. We complain about the Navy not doing it. We don't even do it in the Air Force [emphasis added].

159 Two months later, though the aircraft remained assigned to the Army units, the 834th ALCC took over C-7 scheduling. ALCC still lacked the power to determine Caribou itineraries. Airlift allocations still originated in the MACV J-4 Directorate, where they were forwarded to the ALCC which in-turn made up an operational schedule for the C-7 airlift wing at Cam Ranh Bay. See Schlight, 238.
160 Although the Caribous' home bases were Cam Ranh Bay, Vung Tau, and Phu Cat, the squadrons would disperse their aircraft in groups of 3 or 4 to various other locations such as Da Nang, Pleiku, Nha Trang, An Khe, and Don Muang in Bangkok, Thailand. In this way, there were always some aircraft readily available in nearly every major quadrant of the country. See Schlight, 238.
11,1 "Averaging 50 missions a day (450 sorties), the planes flew into 188 of the 300 primitive strips in Vietnam. The missions included support to Special Forces camps, medical evacuations, radio relays, emergency resupply, and tactical emergencies, as well as airdrops of paratroopers, ammunition, building supplies, gasoline, rations, and live animals." In performing these missions, the Air Force flew "20% more hours and 26% more sorties and the planes carried 33% more passengers and 10% more cargo" than the Army had done in 1966. To compare these figures to something tangible, this was the equivalent of "squeezing an additional squadron's payload out of a slightly smaller number of airplanes." See Schlight, 238.
As of 1 January 1968, "combined C-130 and C-123 accomplishments monthly exceeded by two-thirds those of 15 months earlier."

On 21 January 1968, Khe Sanh, a 6000-man Marine outpost in the northern region of South Vietnam, suddenly fell under an intensive and extensive "mortar, rocket and artillery" barrage as a prelude to an assault by a force of 15,000 to 20,000 Viet Cong in four regiments.

Waivers of individual monthly flying limits were common in all units. The average daily C-130 utilization rate of the 314th Wing was more than 5.0 hours, whereas other units flew at a rate of approximately 3.0 hours per day. See Bowers, 249 -250.

Miller compares the campaign with "the classic combat airlifts of Stalingrad, Burma and Dien Bien Phu:
The success at Khe Sanh reflected the application of lessons drawn from past campaigns, the improved technology for tactical airlift now at hand, and the absolute allied air superiority. The outcome of the struggle was a triumph of tactical defense used in intelligent combination with heavy firepower and air lines of communication [emphasis added].

The North Vietnamese, who were dug-in throughout the surrounding hills, began to employ "automatic weapons and antiaircraft fire" against the inbound airlifters. The transports employed passive defensive measures to avoid these hazards as much as possible. Although the post was adjoined to a 3,900-foot airstrip, because of a combination of fog induced by the surrounding mountainous terrain and enemy ground fire, it's average utilization rate was just three hours per day, which was not enough to support the Marine force indefinitely.

•' The first week's bombing campaign consisted of more than 3,000 fighter-bomber sorties and 200 B-52 sorties, which "destroyed scores of trucks, gun positions, bunkers and structures."

On 6 March, "A C-123, bringing Marine reinforcements from Phu Bai was waved off final approach because a [South] Vietnamese plane was on the runway. As he circled the field, the pilot called that he was receiving heavy ground fire. His escort observed a fire and then an explosion on the plane's left wing as it was turning to final. The aircraft rolled into a vertical dive, crashed into the jungle, and all forty-eight aboard died." The same day, a C-123 tire blew on landing as it rolled over mortar shrapnel and while being towed off the runway it took a direct hit from mortar fire and burned to the ground.

As soon as the weather cleared, C-130s flying CDS missions became more vulnerable to enemy fire. Furthermore, "due to a shortage of LAPES rigging items," the C-130s were forced to resort to a third mode of delivery, GPES (ground proximity extraction system). This method involved the use of an arresting cable which would "hook and pull loads from extremely low-flying C-130s." 182 Supported by an air and artillery barrage, the Marines prevailed over the enemy on 8 April 1968.

From 1965 to 1968 the average number of monthly aeromedical evacuation sorties skyrocketed from "12 sorties with a handful of patients to 158 flights with 8,000 patients." Because of this program, the average percentage of wounded soldiers which would die after being admitted to a hospital fell to one percent, compared to four and a half percent during the Second World War.

This was a significant achievement, considering the inadequacy of the airlift infrastructure, which had unpaved airstrips, overcrowded airspace, unreliable navigational aids and poor facilities.

A task force of eight C-130s at Nha Trang ceased operations in April 1968, while one of three C-130 squadrons temporarily deployed to Vietnam departed later that spring, and another followed-suit in August.

23 "The first C-5 missions were flown in support of a MACV emergency order to move six MK-48 tanks from Yokota AB, Japan to Da Nang AB, South Vietnam. As each tank weighed 49 tons, only the C-5 was capable of airlifting such heavy equipment. To minimize exposure to hostile fire, offload procedures were expedited to the point where the tanks were driven off the airlifter within 7 minutes and the C-5s were back in the air within a half hour. One thing that significantly reduced its ground time was its ability to "arrive at off-load stations with sufficient fuel to recover to an offshore base for refueling, maintenance, and crew change." See Miller, 339.  ^Lavalle, Airpower and the 1972 Spring Invasion, 56. All told, the C-5 fleet conducted "201 missions in SEA during the last quarter of FY 72, compared to 102 missions during the first nine months of the year." See Miller, 339. Having proven its potential by moving the heavy MK-48s, the C-5s were next given the task of airlifting forty-eight 24-ton M-41 tanks and eight 7.5-ton M-548 tracked recovery vehicles to Da Nang and Cam Ranh Bay. In this instance, offloading took an average of 32 minutes. Again, the C-5 successfully flew 15 missions to accomplish this MACV tasking. See Miller, 340 Vietnamese backed away from their intransigence and entered into serious negotiations to conclude a peace settlement." 240 By the middle of October 1972, the North Vietnamese had shown a willingness to conduct serious negotiations, so that Nixon again called a halt to the bombing campaign, announcing that "peace was at hand."

As this analysis will demonstrate, an airlift revolution occurred during and after the Vietnam War. Organizationally, during the war, airlift was elevated from a support service to a major command, and soon after the war was upgraded to specified command status. As far as the force structure, during the war MAC transitioned into the jet-age with the introduction of the C-141 and C-5 and soon after the war, it inherited the C-130 fleet from TAC as well. Doctrinally, during the course of the war airlift was included as one of the missions described in the Air Force's basic doctrine for the first time. Later editions noted the overlap of tactical and strategic airlift, thus lending support to the eventual consolidation of the two fleets under MAC's umbrella.

-^ During the mid-1970s, the USAF combat commands were the Air Defense Command (ADCOM), Strategic Air Command (SAC), Tactical Air Command (TAC), U.S. Air Forces Europe (USAFE) and the Alaskan Air Command (AAC). MAC was categorized as a support command along with Air Force Logistics Command (AFLC), Air Force Systems Command (AFSC), Air Training Command (ATC), Air University (AU), Headquarters Command (HQ COMD USAF) and the U.S. Air Force Security Service (USAFSS). See U.S., Department of the Air Force, Contrails: Air Force Academy Cadet Handbook, Vol. 22 (1976-77), 55.

2 " The CJCS had four strong reasons. First, MAC would become more of a factor in planning for combat operations now that they had sole responsibility for DOD airlift. Therefore, he felt it was important that CINCMAC receive his directives from the JCS. Second, making MAC a specified command would enhance the stature of CINCMAC in relation to the other CINCs, since this would serve as an official acknowledgment that airlift was a combat mission. It would also further the unification principle. Third, designating MAC as a specified command would be a "logical and progressive action which would strengthen the unified command structure and enhance the management of airlift forces in support of the combatant forces of the United States." Fourth, he felt that in wartime airlift would be confronted with competing demands from not only different U.S. commands, but also with allied requests. These allocation decisions would be the responsibility of the JCS, and could "best be accomplished under a command arrangement with CINCMAC reporting directly to the JCS along with other unified and specified commanders." See JCS, MA C Specified Command, 2.

Although in 1964 the Air Force had been wedded to the doctrine that "strategic nuclear forces provided the best instrument to prevent wars at all levels," by 1968, "the Southeast Asian experience" had demonstrated that: strategic force alone may not be a credible deterrent against hostile acts by small powers.

The President based his 1 1/2 war strategy on four assumptions: (1) Simultaneous attacks against both Europe and Asia were unlikely; (2) His long-term interest in Asia resided in the Northeast quadrant; (3) The Asian allies could and were willing to increase their indigenous conventional forces; (4) U.S. Air Force and Navy forces would remain in the Western Pacific region. See Kahan, 147.
292 Realistic Deterrence was announced after "nearly two years of foreign policy and strategic studies by the Nixon Administration. The Secretary's 191-page 'Defense Report' of 15 March 1971 provided many additional guidelines and explanatory details." See Moll, "Realistic Deterrence and New Strategy," 2. Because of the "domestic pressures to reduce defense spending and overseas commitments," according to Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird, "in deterring nuclear warfare, primary reliance will continue to be placed on American forces, but at the local warfare level the primary defense burden will have to fall on the country threatened." " (1) The United States will keep all of its treaty commitments. (2) We shall provide a shield if a nuclear power threatens the freedom of a nation allied with us or of a nation whose survival we consider vital to our security. (3) In cases involving other types of aggression we shall furnish military and economic assistance when requested and as appropriate. But we shall look to the nation directly threatened to assume the primary responsibility of providing the manpower for its defense." See Melvin R. Laird, Statement of the Secretary of Defense before the House Armed Services Committee on the FY 73 Defense Budget andFY 73-77 Defense Program, 17 Feb 72, cited in Endicott and Stafford, 78.  The Nixon Administration used the guiding principles of realistic deterrence, which placed utmost emphasis on nuclear modernization programs, in shaping the U.S. military's force structure of the 70's.

295 AFM 1-1 (1971) 2-3. 29 ~ "Aerospace forces may be employed to influence the economic, psychological, political and social fabric of other nations and thus contribute to the attainment of national objectives. These objectives are well served by rendering assistance in the form of humanitarian missions, disaster assistance, search and rescue operations. ... In times of crisis when armed conflict is threatened, national will and intentions may be communicated through increased alert, show of force, reserve mobilization options, force deployment and reconnaissance flights." See AFM 1-1 (1971)  movements of units, personnel, and material in support of all DOD agencies; between area commands; between the CONUS and overseas areas; within an area command when directed. Strategic airlift resources possess a capability to airland or airdrop troops, supplies and equipment for augmentation of tactical airlift forces when required." Tactical airlift was defined as follows: "Tactical airlift is the immediate and responsive air movement and delivery of combat troops and supplies directly into objective areas through airlanding, extraction, airdrop, or other delivery techniques, and the air iogistic support of all theater forces, including those engaged in combat operations." See AFM 1-1 (1971) 1-4.
2Vh " In the forward area and combat zone, airlift increases the battlefield mobility of military forces by providing the means to rapidly mass friendly forces and to provide the means for sustained, selective, or emergency air delivery of personnel, supplies and equipment as far forward as necessary " AFM 1-1 (1971) 3-2.
29J The lessons learned in Vietnam had a profound impact on tactical airlift doctrine, as opposed to strategic airlift. A Corona Harvest paper written in 1969 analyzed the role tactical airlift was playing in Vietnam. The conclusion was that it should perform the following roles: "forward, lateral and rearward movements of ground combat units, high volume air resupply of mobile ground forces, routine distribution from strategic airheads or seaports, resupply to remote sites, logistics support of tactical air units and aeromedical evacuation." See Bowers, 649 -651.

In 1975 an updated version of AFM 1-1 was published. In strict compliance with the strategic doctrine of realistic deterrence, this Air Force doctrine stated that: although the rapid deployment capabilities of U.S. forces are substantial, the U.S.
goal is to diminish the need for such deployments in the future by helping its allies build their own military capabilities against localized aggression

While executing deployments, TRANSCOM would continually keep all the forces abreast as to what resources were available for use. In addition, it would keep tabs on the amount of fuel, ammunition and equipment available in the different combat zones. Once in the midst of the conflict, TRANSCOM would direct the resupply function.

Consequently, the airlift enhancement program "suffered... as a result of the low priority it received in the Air Force [emphasis added]."

25 USCINCRED, Army General Volney Warner, testified in March 1980 that the U.S. was lacking a "strategically deployable, tactically employable outsize cargo aircraft such as the CX." As proof, he pointed out that the C-141 could only operate into 43% of the Middle East airfields, whereas the CX would be able to operate into 70% of the airfields with the same cargo capacity as a C-141. Besides the limited airfield use, because of the Army and Marine Corps acquisition of heavier battle equipment, he projected that the "requirement for airlift of outsize equipment will grow during the next decade." See U.S. House Appropriations Committee, Statement of General Volney F. Warner, 5.

Although President Carter had cited the CX as one of the "prime defense initiatives ... in his FY81 budget," given that "there were few, if any, telephone calls to the Hill... left an aura that the President had floated his CX balloon and then let it drift." The reason for the negative vote, according to Rep William Dickinson of the R&D Subcommittee, was that "not a good enough case was made, ... arguments for the CX are the same ones used to sell the C-5." The bottom line was "do we need to build a new airplane to operate on X number of small fields, or can we use what we've got?" See "Rebuff to CX," Aviation Week, 7 April 1980, 9.  that the "Air Force had done less than an adequate job at justifying CX."

43 Defense analyst William Kaufmann estimated that if the U.S. were confronted with a two-front war, airlift would be tasked to fly 800,000 tons of men and equipment during the first month of conflict. Yet, even after the last C-5B became operational in 1989, the U.S. was still only be capable of delivering 270,000 tons; far short of the requirement. See Stubbing, 39. Addressing the shortfall of strategic airlift, CINCCENT, General Crist testified that it was: "not new,... [and] has faced all U.S. forces for some time but is a more glaring deficiency in the USCENTCOM area because of our limited access, the lack of forward deployed forces, long distances and the time critical requirement for credible forces once the decision is made to deploy." See DOD Authorization for Appropriations for FY87, 743. The USCENTCOM airlift plan, which covered 7,000 miles and 15 hours of flying time from the East Coast, called for the following breakdown of sorties: C-5/273, C-141/8205, CRAF/1003. The combined airlifted tonnage would be 205,650. This equated to 46 MTMD. See DOD Authorization for Appropriations for FY87, 665. USCINCRED, Army General Mahaftey, testified "as provided for in the U.S. Air Force Airlift Master Plan, ... the importance of maintaining the C-17 acquisition program, even in an increasingly austere fiscal environment, cannot be overemphasized from my perspective." Mahaffey, testified in 1986 that "despite improvements, significant shortfalls remain in our strategic deployment posture and will persist into the next century." DOD Authorization for Appropriations for FY87, 559.
44 Russell, "Deployment: Will TRANSCOM Make a Difference?," 40. The function of CRAF is as follows: "(a) DOD provides for utilization of aircraft committed to CRAF by contractual arrangement with U.S. certified civil air carriers that own or otherwise control such aircraft, (b) DOD uses the contractually committed capability of the air carriers to augment the organic airlift capability of MAC in a declared defense-related national emergency or in defense-related situations short of a declared national emergency and to satisfy DOD airlift requirements based on plans approved by OJCS. See The Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mobility System Policies, Procedures and Considerations, JCS Pub 15 (15 September 1983), pp. III-l. Military Sealift Command (MSC), the naval component of USTRANSCOM has 51 ships set aside in case a joint deployment becomes necessary. These 51 ships consist of 9 empty cargo ships, 22 oil tankers, 8 "fast" sealift ships and 12 pre-positioned maritime ships located in various strategic locations worldwide. Much like MAC'S CRAF, MSC has a Ready Reserve Fleet of 116 ships available on short notice during periods of crisis. Military Traffic Management Command, (MTMC), the Army's component of USTRANSCOM plans and executes the U.S. transportation routes, whether by truck or rail, to the nearest ports to load their equipment and supplies aboard the MSC ships. MTMC personnel are in charge of all loading and unloading operations at home and abroad. The MTMC assets are a fleet of rail cars which were specifically designed to carry with ... enhancements, we get about 50 million ton-miles per day. What gets me from 50 to the 66 million ton-miles goal is going to be a new transport of some type,... in my mind, I need an aircraft which operates like a C-130 and has the capacity of a C-141. If I can get something like that, I've got it made.

An attempt by any outside force to gain control of the Persian Gulf will be regarded as an assault on the vital interests of the United States of America, and such an assault will be repelled by any means necessary, including military force. 49 Faced with regional instability in Southwest Asia without any military forces designated to defend the region, the President pressed for the United States to develop a rapid deployment force.

Concerning force structure, during the war in the Gulf, the C-141 proved itself to be an "aging lift aircraft," in dire need of replacement. Kitfield points out that "with pilots 'flying the pants' off of every strategic airlifter in Desert Shield rotations, MAC officials fearfed] that stress cracks already plaguing some C-141s [would] be aggravated." 64 Yet, going from 234 C-141 s to [120] C-17s will actually precipitate a "net loss of airlift capability." Bottom line:
The American airlift system [is] shrinking in all quarters: the numbers and types of aircraft needed for strategic lift are decreasing. The commercial air fleet will have fewer carriers and its makeup is changing. Some commercial carriers are swapping out their larger Boeing 747 aircraft for smaller, more commercially economical aircraft. The strategic transportation picture is better now than it will be.

"CINCTRANS: "USCENTCOM established the requirements and made the final decisions on priorities. USTRANSCOM then directed its components to provide the lift.

The idea was to rely on an enclave strategy to hold key ports and airfields or, in essence, trade space for time while U.S. combat forces deployed to Saudi Arabia" See U.S. The term "surge" is military parlance used to describe the process of "using all resources at full capacity to get the job done on time."

See Menarchik, 77.  108 On 6 August 1990, MAC Headquarters briefed that it had on hand 234 C-141 s, 110 C-5s, 410 C-130s and 57 KC-10s, plus the aircraft available in the CRAF, if activated.

To make matters worse, the "ad hoc TPFDL" (time-phased force deployment list) was "Now, fighter aircraft would fly in before their ground crews and maintenance equipment had arrived, and combat troops would fly in not only before requirements like food, water and accommodations had been arranged, but while the bulk of their ammunition and heavy equipment was still at sea " See Duncan Anderson, "The Buildup," in John Pimlott and Stephen Badsey, eds., The Gulf War Assessed(London-Arms  and Armour Press, 1992)83.

See Menarchik, 53.  " "To try to fool the Iraqis, Schwar2kopf ordered that the deployment of combat forces be given precedence over the dispatch of ammunition, spare parts, and logistics." See Gordon and Trainor, 59 -60.

135 "MAC had over 20 loads scheduled for 10 August and 20 loads scheduled for 11 August, averaging four hours for the C-141 s and seven hours for the C-5." As had been done at Langley, "MAC slowed the flow to the 82nd to one aircraft per hour." See Menarchik, 51.  because of a lack of specific movement guidance, it was left to unit commanders on the scene to designate what was to be moved when.

On 14 August, CENTCOM managed to come up with an initial TPFDD (time-phased force deployment data) which "set its estimated deployment requirements."
Based upon the CENTCOM requirements, it was apparent to CINCTRANS that the additional services provided by volunteer reserve and contract carriers alone could not generate the requisite number of aircraft or crews to accomplish the mission.

On 24 August, the Air Force activated two Reserve C-5 squadrons and three C-141 squadrons. On 31 August, the Air Force activated three C-5 Reserve Associate squadrons; on 4 September, two additional C-5 Reserve Associate squadrons and on 9 September, two additional C-141 squadrons.

General Johnson recounts that:
Torrejon AB never worked like it should have as a strategic hub. Spanish authorities helped work problems, but Tactical Air Command focused on TAC problems, at the expense of the airlift mission. Support for strategic airlift suffered™ The Spanish commander moved his forces before the U.S. commander moved his to give us more space.

International politics also was a detriment to obtaining a MAC staging base.
Although MAC sought the use of Jidda as a strategic airlift hub, the Saudi government wanted to limit the number of U.S. military personnel stationed at its bases, especially close to the "holy sites of Mecca and Madina." Because "Schwarzkopf rank-ordered combat air units: fighters, bombers, tankers and airlift, [this] precluded MAC [from]   attaining a staging base" in the Gulf theater. As a consequence, MAC crews were forced to turn around and fly back to Europe after offloading and refueling in Saudi Arabia.

Phase III: Desert Storm. 17 January -28 February 1991   Upon the outbreak of hostilities, on 17 January Secretary of Defense Cheney "declared an airlift emergency" 210 and activated Stage II of CRAF, also for the first time in history. 2U Stage II put an extreme burden on the airlift support apparatus. According to MAC system analysts, "en route ground times were higher than normal, with onload times missions from 834 to 1,977. ... Airlift again hauled over 99% of the passengers in Phase JJ, with 20,500 passengers in November, 118,000 in December and 115,000 in January. Commercial lift hauled the bulk of the Phase II passengers, 13,100 in November (64.2%); 85,100 in December (72%); and 69,800 in January (60.7%). Airlift hauled 205,713 passengers, up from 185,891 in Phase I. Tonnage almost doubled from 1,513.7 tons per day in November to the end of December 2,949.3 tons per day. After a Christmas-New Year holiday lull, it remained at 3,558.6 tons per day in January. In November, commercial airlift hauled 20.6% of the cargo, 29.9% in December and 30.6% in January. . See Menarchik, 146 -147. Approximately 40% of MAC's airlift missions flew relief supplies necessary for the sustainment of the forces which were already in-place. See Winnefeld, Niblack and Johnson, 33. This amounted to 181,241 tons, compared to 178,358  tons during Phase I. Significantly, rather than flying 5% of the sustainment tonnage, as originally planned, MAC flew 15.3% of the entire dry sustainment cargo: 14.2% in November, 16.2% in December, and 11.4% in January. See Menarchik, 147. During the nine-week Phase II (8 Nov 90 -16 Jan 91) period, the buildup grew to 359,000 tons and a total of 391,000 troops with 10,693 missions. See

The three phases of the Gulf War should really be seen as part of a whole. Together, they comprised a war that was fought less on the battlefield and more in the LOC, more along the main supply routes and less in Washington and Riyadh. It was months of logistical preparation that allowed our forces to wrap up the air and ground wars in 1,012 hours.

At bottom, America was not the master of its own logistical fate, and theater access problems complicated joining the strategic lift system into the theater reception system.... The military and political 'system'had prevented the logistics structure from working properly. ... Such a logistical blind spot was not an aberration but was the American way of war, and it was strategy affecting. ... High risk resulted.

As Desert Storm showed, America had plenty of bombs, bullets, planes, tanks and troops, but barely enough lift for timely deployment to meet its declared strategy.

Nadel claims that "two factors permitted this enormous logistical feat: technology and complete freedom of movement.

strategic mobility and sustainability were the essential successes of the Gulf Warwithout detracting from the deserved accolades given to high-tech weapons, the training of our forces, and a greater degree of jointness in command and operations. The indispensable ingredient of victory was getting there -quickly and in force -with the capability to support high-tempo operations.

255
Given what we consider the preeminent role of logistics (including force deployment), it strikes us as remarkable that few of the official or popular monographs on the Gulf War give the subject much attention. Rather, the attention has been on the strike plan [emphasis added]. 
256
Logistics affects military strategy, military strategy affects grand strategy, and grand strategy affects political outcomes. It raises important issues for America's security policy in the post-Cold War era and is worthy of leadership interest to ensure America's logistics is in order. America and the international community need to pay more attention to logistics infrastructure, doctrine and its effects on strategy, tactics and military-political outcomes.
258
In a highly uncertain world, sound planning, forces in forward areas, and strategic air and sea lift are critical for developing the confidence, capabilities, international cooperation, and reach needed in times of trouble Three major combatant commands based in the U.S., SAC, TAC, and MAC, will merge into two commands. Fighters, bombers and ICBMs ... will be in one command, along with reconnaissance aircraft and command, control, communication, and intelligence platforms. This command has been designated Air Combat Command. It will also possess some tanker and airlift aircraft. Air Mobility Command will include the bulk of airlift assets as well as a considerable portion of the tanker force. This integration of lift with tankers will better enable us to supply global mobility and reach. 
273
273
274 Rice based this arrangement upon two assumptions. First, the Desert Storm experience had blurred the distinction between strategic and tactical missions, as bombers sometimes struck tactical targets, whereas fighters struck many strategic targets. Second, there was a recognized need to "ensure that theater commanders' requirements received paramount attention." See Kennedy, Global Reach for America, 2.

Our new strategy must provide the framework to guide our deliberate reductions to no more than the forces we need to guard our enduring interests -the forces to exercise forward presence in key areas, to respond effectively to crisis, to retain the national capacity to rebuild our forces should this be needed.

The description of airlift's role within the force enhancement category is as follows:
a. Sufficient strategic and theater airlift must be available to respond quickly to worldwide threats and to sustain deployed aerospace and surface forces. When time is a critical factor, airlift is often the only means of transporting forces rapidly enough to the point of crisis. Airlift may be the only practical method of sustaining those forces with critically needed supplies and equipment. In addition, airlift must be able to clandestinely insert and extract small numbers of personnel in denied territory.
(1) Airlift's key enhancement of the campaign is its ability to place properly concentrated combat forces where and when needed. Aerospace power's flexibility allows the commander to deploy forces within theater or from the United States and other theaters.
(2) Because strategic and theater airlift capacities are finite, the air component commander must recommend priorities for their use. Strategic and theater airlift must be systematically coordinated with each other and with other transportation means to achieve the proper concentration of aerospace and surface forces at the proper time. 
309
Airmen face formidable obstacles in designing and structuring appropriate strategic and theater airlift capabilities. The most pervasive problem is the requirement to strike the appropriate balance between airlift and other types of aerospace forces. Experience has demonstrated that shortchanging airlift forces can lead to serious consequences [emphasis added].

313
In the post-Gulf War era, primarily two external factors have been responsible for the substantial changes which have taken place in Air Force organization, force structure and doctrine. On the one hand, because of the end of the Cold War, there are fewer forward deployed forces, thus airpower is needed more than ever to maintain the nation's ability to exercise global reach and global power. Second, the U.S. budget deficit has led to drastic defense cuts, which has forced a reexamination as to how the U.S. organizes, trains and equips to fight its wars. In sum, "just as the post-World War II environment led to the establishment of the Air Force, world events in the late 1980s and early 1990s drove the Air Force to undertake a massive and far-reaching reorganization.

Using the neglected missions model on page 81, this section tests the five competing pairs of hypotheses of bureaucratic politics and organizational culture to see which most adequately accounts for the neglect which has been illustrated in the five case studies.
The first test examines the dependent measure of doctrine, to see whether it has stagnated, as bureaucratic politics contends, or whether it has changed due to learning Rather than being a minor peripheral change of performing the same mission, this was a fundamental shift in the mission of the Air Force, which now gave greater emphasis to the conventional warfighting mission, while at the same time continuing to place primary importance upon the nuclear deterrence mission. Although this transition to flexible response was induced by external forces (e.g., President Kennedy) and was not the product of internal Air Force entrepreneurship, nevertheless, the outcome conforms to the organizational culture hypothesis that significant learning is indeed possible. If the bureaucratic politics hypothesis held true, Air Force doctrine would have continued to espouse the preeminence of the nuclear mission to the exclusion of airlift. Instead, the Air Force adapted its doctrine to accommodate conventional missions such as airlift.
The recent adoption of Global Reach -Global Power was internally imposed by the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the Air Force. Although the Air Force initiated proactive measures to adapt, the changes it instituted were driven by external international as well as domestic political factors. Internationally, the dramatic ending of the Cold War necessitated the return of much of America's forward deployed forces, requiring a greater need for airlift modernization. Domestically, the need to get the budget deficit under control led to a drastically reduced defense budget and downsizing of all military forces, aircraft possible should be diverted to supplying Berlin. This example demonstrates that organizational culture continues in crises, while the President can overrule parochial bureaucratic politics in crises.
Finally, in the Gulf War, originally led by the Chief of Staff, General Dugan, the Air Force position was that it could independently prosecute the war with precision-guided conventional munitions carried by tactical fighter and attack aircraft.
However, reflecting the advice of his principal advisor, Chairman Powell, Secretary Cheney advised the President, who concurred, that airlifting deterrent, defensive and then offensive ground forces to the Gulf was paramount to success. This was the purest example of organizational culture in that General Dugan ultimately sacrificed his career by pushing his organization's culture to such an extreme that he ultimately went against the wishes of his fellow JCS members and Secretary of Defense.
The dependent measure of the airlift force structure is examined to see whether it conforms to the forces of bureaucratic politics of amassing more turf by acquiring different types of aircraft (i.e., helicopters) and branching out into other mission areas (i.e, special operations), or whether it clings more closely to the organizational culture hypothesis of sticking to the knitting by continuing to procure fixed-wing military airlifters to perform the same basic mission. Given his position as the appointed civilian head of the service, the Secretary of the Air Force would be the single-most influential player in the relative allocation of resources among Air Force missions.
Throughout this entire 50-year study, the only time that the airlift mission became an interservice point of contention was in the midst of the crisis of the Vietnam War. As the case study illustrated, the Air Force used the results of Operation Silver Bayonet as evidence that it was best able to conduct the tactical airlift resupply mission in support of Army airmobile operations. Prior to this setback, the Army had been intent upon building its own indigenous fixed-wing tactical airlift fleet.
Given that the Secretary of Defense was a major proponent of the Army's airmobility mission, the Air Force had every incentive to find a mutually-agreeable This interservice dispute between the Army and the Air Force concerning the tactical airlift mission serves to illustrate the forces of organizational culture at work. The Air Force chose to reject the helicopter resupply mission so that it could acquire exclusive jurisdiction, or autonomy, over the fixed-wing resupply mission. The Army, on the other hand, was willing to relinquish its role in fixed-wing airlift so that it could maintain an independent organic rotory-winged airlift fleet able to conduct intraservice combat aerial resupply missions.
continue posing a threat to the Air Force tactical airlift mission. However, this ploy was more than mere bureaucratic politics, as the general willingly relinquished the rotary-wing transport mission to the Army in return for autonomy in the fixed-wing tactical airlift realm. Thus, rather than building turf, this move served to protect the essence of the Air Force's predominance in land-based, fixed-wing aviation.
Thus, depending on the forum, the Chief of Staff of the Air Force will either protect or neglect the tactical airlift mission. In his role as a member of the JCS, the CSAF protects the essence of the airlift mission from Army infringement. Yet, as the head of his service, the CSAF allows the airlift mission to continue to be neglected, relative to the combat aviation missions. This intraservice neglect has been apparent both during times of budgetary contraction or growth. An example of relative neglect during times of budget cuts occurred in 1949 when the Senior Officers Board of the Air Force met late in December to "consider in closed sessions the procurement program of the Air Force ... anticipating the severe cuts in existing force strength which the President was determined to make:
The Board decided to concentrate the limited resources of the Air Force upon strategic bombing aircraft (i.e., long-range and heavy bombers), in order to make sure that the Air Force could at least fulfill what they regarded as their first responsibility, retaliatory capability. It recommended to the Secretary of the Air Force on January 6 that the procurement of medium bombers (B-45, RB-49), troop transports (C-125), and ... fighters (F-93) be cut back and the money thus saved transferred to purchasing B-36s and B-50s [emphasis added]. 9 ^Paul Y. Hammond, "Super Carriers and B-36 Bombers," 489 -490, cited in Halperin, 32.  forum of the JCS, so does CINCAMC become airlift's chief advocate in an intra-Air Force forum. As the CSAF personifies the Air Force in the forum of the JCS, so does CINCAMC personify the airlift mission to Headquarters Air Force. This is his primary role, to advocate the airlift mission. As an example, in 1960, before testifying the before a special subcommittee of the House Committee on Armed Services, General Tunner, who was the Commander of MATS at the time, conferred with General Thomas White, the CSAF:
Tunner AS you know, I am a strong believer in the fact that we need an air transport force, and that we need more money for the modernization ofthat force.
We need to hold on to what we have, and to go forward with modernization. But I want to make sure that my testimony to this effect before the Congressional committee will not run counter to the wishes of the Air Force.
White: Bill, some people here on the staff don't approve of your position, it's true. But the fact remains that you are the boss of MATS, you have been with it for many years, you see it more closely than anyone else, and I think you will come up with the right answers. When you go before Congress, you say what you think and you will be all right [emphasis added]. 
10

As a final test, using Ikenberry's empirical, aesthetic, and analytic criteria, this study rates bureaucratic politics' and organizational culture's relative ability to account for airlift's neglect. 
11
In the first case of the Hump airlift, 10th Air Force, a combat organization, was not managing its airlift resources properly to maintain an adequate aerial pipeline to keep So it was that Congressmen Rivers entered his name in the Congressional Record as "Mr.
Airlift" upon his retirement.
Having examined the case of airlift mobility neglect, like J.Q. Wilson:
I have come to have grave doubts that anything worth calling 'organization theory' will ever exist. Theories will exist, but they will usually be so abstract or general as to explain rather little. Interesting explanations will exist, some even supported with facts, but these will be partial, place-and time-bound insights. 
13
Posen and Stephen Rosen's theories of military innovation are applicable to this study. Although this tendency may be true, nevertheless, what prompts civilians to intervene?
According to Posen's organization theory, if the military organizations are left to their own devices, their doctrines tend to remain "offensive, disintegrated and stagnant."
Therefore, some sort of external, intervening variable must be responsible for innovation to occur. Posen identifies this intervening variable as balance of power theory, or systemic, third image factors.

and / or contracting with civilian carriers, or even activating the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (CRAF). Thus, in the aftermath of each of these major crises, these recognized shortcomings served as an impetus for the Office of the Secretary of Defense to dictate that improvements be made to the airlift force structure. Nevertheless, once the shortfalls were addressed and the Air Force was left to its own devices, airlift again was neglected in favor of the offensive combat missions so that when the next crisis arose, again there was a shortage of airlift assets.
Over the course of this fifty-year study, a recognizable pattern has emerged whereby during the course of normal peacetime operations the airlift force structure is allowed to deteriorate due to neglect spawned by organizational cultural forces.
Periodically, this normal state of affairs is interrupted by an external crisis event which presses the limited capabilities of the airlift fleet and demonstrates its state of neglect to civilian authorities. Thus, in the aftermath of the crisis event, the civilian authorities intervene in the airlift policy-making process so that innovation occurs, as Posen's theory predicts. A case in point occurred during Vietnam in the mid-1960s when "the Air Force did accept procurement of a large number of C-5A troop-carrying airplanes, but only because the move was forced on it by civilians. When given their own way, the priorities of the Air Force officers have always been clear. ... In sum, says Paul Hammond, "in taking stands on many strategy and policy questions the Air Force has been guided by the effort to protect its role in the strategic delivery of weapons by air [emphasis added].' n20 ^Hammond, "Super Carriers and B-36 Bombers," 485, cited in Halperin, 32.
[Tunner] viewed his airlift mission not in static relation to organization charts or tables of equipment but as one of the dynamic forces soon to reshape our postwar world. 
27
Are we to become the Roman Empire of the Twentieth Century? Are we Americans, together with our allies, going to be forced to man the frontiers of the free world against the Communist Huns and Vandals? ... If this is to be our future, then we are going to need airlift forces of a size and capability we can't even conceive of today. How else can one nation lead its allies in policing the world except through a superior technology that will give our military forces unquestioned flexibility and mobility?
28
Further in conformance with Rosen's theory of innovation, Tunner accomplished Despite the fact that he had served a broadly-based career, Raymond Towne points out that "Tunner... must have felt the effect of seeing his immediate successors at U.S.
Air Forces in Europe and at MATS put on four stars to do a job he had been doing with only three." Described as a "hard-driving, coldly brilliant, and known for the unusually penetrating quality of his displeasure," his brazen personality had apparently already become legendary by 1946. A colonel who experienced his wrath reflects that:
If General Tunner were running the lion-taming act for Barnum and Bailey, the lion would put his head in Tunner's mouth -so watch out. 
32
33
If there is anyone in America today who has justly earned the title of'Mr. Airlift,' I am sure it is you. When we realize that the airlift over the 'Hump' in World War II, the Berlin Airlift, and the Korean Airlift were all under your command, and owe the greater part of their success to your leadership and endeavors. ... By the very nature of things, it has not been easy in recent years to carry the banner of MATS.
Crosscurrents both within and without the military services have made your voyage rather stormy. And I know it has been a matter of concern and keen disappointment to you to see the MATS fleet age into obsolescence. But you have fought a good fight and, at long last, it looks as if the help which has been so elusive in the past is about to arrive in the form of interim modernization for MATS as well as a firm program for the future. ... I am not one to count dividends before they are declared. But I sincerely believe that the Congress is going to provide the relief which is required, and I sincerely hope that the Executive Branch will join us in our attempt to solve the airlift problems. That is the result which both you and we earnestly seek. 3 * Thus, entrepreneur Tunner, allied with Congressman Rivers, was responsible for the birth of military air transport as a separate and distinct career path within the U.S. Air Force.
Having provided supporting evidence for both Posen and Rosen's theories of military innovation, given that they both focus on different intervening variables, how can they both be accurate? On the one hand, Posen posits that innovation is externally imposed by civilian intervention driven by systemic factors. On the other hand, Rosen contends that innovation is internally driven by senior military officers allied with civilian sponsors.
I propose that the difference lies in the nature of the learning which is taking place, be it core or peripheral. As the names themselves imply, core learning is driven from within whereas peripheral learning originates outside the boundaries of an organization. Reiterating what Wilson pointed out earlier, "peripheral changes often are a response to a demand in the agency's environment":
Outside forces -academic scientists, industrial engineers, civilian theorists, members of Congress, and presidential aides -all helped induce the military to embrace programs that initially seemed irrelevant to (or at odds with) their core tasks. 
35
36
... Innovations are ... heavily dependent on executive interests and beliefs. ... It is for this reason, I think, that little progress has been made in developing theories of innovation. ... Innovations differ so greatly in character that trying to find one theory to explain them all is like trying to find one medical theory to explain all diseases. 
37
President John F. Kennedy called for an improvement in the Army's ability to fight guerrilla wars, the task was given (reluctantly) to a new 'special forces' unit that, owing to strong leadership and presidential support, acquired its own sense of mission but that for many years was treated as a peripheral (and trivial) activity in the army as a whole. 
40
Rosen's theory accounts for the formative era of airlift, what I refer to as "the Tunner years," during which time General Tunner played the role of the entrepreneur who first introduced the notion of airlift mobility to the repertoire of Air Force missions.
Given that this constituted a totally new element of airpower, it was truly innovative, requiring that core learning take place. This required that an initial cadre of airlift professionals had to be developed from a pool of Air Force pilots, formerly trained to fly bomber and fighter aircraft.
Once the Air Transport Command had been established, there was no longer any need for an entrepreneur, as the profession of airlift had already been established. Thus, Rosen's theory was no longer applicable. However, given that airlift did not constitute a new "dominant" culture within the Air Force, as this study has shown, it has tended to be neglected. Given that organizational cultural forces within the Air Force led to its neglect, external forces had to come into to play to keep it afloat. This is where Posen's theory of innovation becomes relevant.
As Posen implies, once civilian leaders perceive that the military's cultural tendency to promote combat capabilities at the expense of support functions is impairing the national interest, they intervene, not to establish new modes and orders, but to bolster the capabilities of the support missions that are being neglected. As the case studies have shown, neglect is usually evidenced during a major crisis. Moreover, it can become manifest during major exercises or in conjunction with the establishment of new doctrine, such as flexible response or the Carter Doctrine.
In the case of airlift, since the Tunner years, besides the transition to flexible response and more recently to global reach, only peripheral changes have occurred. Most noteworthy, as part of the Goldwater-Nichols DOD Reorganization Act of 1986, the U.S.
Transportation Command was established. This, in combination with empowering all unified CINCs with greater command authority and a larger role in the procurement results of numerous "Gallant Knight" computer simulations the FSS should have been capable of sealifting the heavy armor equipment of the 24th Infantry Division from Savannah, Georgia, to the Gulf in 14 days, assuming that the ships could be fully loaded within 24 hours and then cruise at a speed of 30 knots. However, given that these ships had been floating since the late 1970s, they were incapable of performing as planned. A naval officer states:
Imagine taking a 1978 car, draining the gasoline and all the fluids and putting it up on blocks for twelve years. Then you get a call saying the car has been taken off the blocks and has to be ready for a long trip in one week. 
42
43
The cases of sealift, minesweeping and special operations all exhibit similar attributes to the case of airlift. They do not conform to the dominant culture of their parent services. Thus, each of these missions had been neglected and as a result, were unable to accomplish their tasks in an satisfactory manner during the Gulf War. As a result, they have all been flagged for increased Congressional appropriations in the aftermath of the crisis.

organizational hypotheses of neglected military missions which offer "novel, excess information compared with [their] predecessor[s]."198  As this cannot be specified until the outcome of the research, "a judgment on this matter often is subject to revision as the empirical work proceeds." In fact, George and McKeown caution that "basing design decisions on a priori judgments may be risky and unproductive." Therefore, they recommend an "iterative procedure for determining how best to describe variance."199    Finally, this study promises to go beyond the empirical fruitfulness of the illumination of the neglected U.S. Air Force strategic airlift mobility mission.Specifically, it suggests that the organizational cultures of the other services have led to the neglect of other military missions, such as the U.S. Navy's treatment of its sealift and minesweeping missions.s Lakatos, "Falsification and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes," 117.'George and McKeown, "Case Studies and Organizational Decisionmaking,

Several factors made for this: "Stilwell was theater commander; if he expressed a wish, would ATC be politic to refuse? ATC depended on Stilwell for its logistical support, and any wise commander stays on good terms with those from whom he draws his beans and bullets." See Romanus and Sunderland, 267.
LaFarge, 77K? Eagle in the Egg, 109. The previous October, Stilwell had established a goal of 5,000 tons for the month of February 1943, based upon the logistical requirements that Alexander had drawn up in July 1942. To achieve such a figure, Washington had authorized a fleet of 75 airlifters. See Romanus and Sunderland, Stilwell's Mission to China, 268.
LaFarge, 77K? Eagle in the Egg, 109. Besides these six DC-3s, Alexander was still awaiting the initial delivery of 75 C-47s he had been promised. Moreover, ATC indicated that it would soon deliver 12 C-87s and, later in 1943, 50 C-46s. The first three C-87s arrived at the beginning of January 1943, followed by the rest in mid-March. Also by March, 76 DC-3s had been assigned to the Wing. See Craven and Cate, Sen'ices Around the World, 121.
Casablanca confirmed "an over-all strategic plan to give first call on Allied resources to operations against Germany, plus the tentative conclusion that operations against Japan in the Pacific Ocean areas might be prosecuted on a larger scale than heretofore had been considered possible, left very little indeed for the CBL" See Weaver and Bowen, 437. Roosevelt had the CCS attach an addendum concerning air power which promised "additional aircraft for the Hump, build-up of the U.S air force in China to the maximum extent that logistical limitations and other important claims will permit, and more sustained air operations beginning in the spring of 1943.

Chennault's rationale was that 10th AF's location in New Delhi, India, was too far from Kunming, China, to effectively oversee Chinese air operations. Moreover, given his pass successes and the increased importance his group was to be given in the Chinese war strategy, Chennault maintained that CATF should become a separate air force.

(87%) of which were while flying the Hump, resulting in 168 fatalities. Partly because of the introduction of night operations in October, the November accident rate rose suddenly to 38 Hump accidents. Surprisingly, the accident rate actually fell off to 28 during the following record month of December. The accident figures for January 1944 was one crash per every 218 sorties, which equated to a death-rate of one American life for every 340 tons delivered over the Hump. In other words, for every 1000 tons delivered, it cost the U.S. nearly three lives (2.94 to be exact). See Craven and Cate, Services Around the World 128 -132.177 C.R. Smith, "The kids here are flying over their heads ... we are asking boys to do what would be most difficult for men to accomplish; with the experience level here we are going to pay dearly for the tonnage moved across the Hump ... with the men available, there is nothing else to do." See Launius, 127.
'"The organizational arrangement for the XX Bomber Command further complicated matters. It bypassed the theater commander altogether and reported directly to 20th Air Force Headquarters, based in Washington. Even the theater commander could not use supplies allocated to MATTERHORN without approval from Washington. Despite the fact that General Stilwell continued to maintain nominal control over Hump allocation prioritization, nevertheless "he was under constant pressure to be as generous as possible with the XX Bomber Command."

Truck convoys from India began arriving in Kunming on 4 February, now that the Ledo Road was open. Moreover, work was begun to extend the oil pipeline from Myitkyina to Kunming. See Griess, 227.
In sum, Griess says that "with an increased air supply and a road and pipeline from India, the blockade of China was over." See Griess, 228.
The JCS paper stated: "It now appears that the Pacific advance to the Formosa-Luzon-China Coast area cannot, except for air support, be materially aided by the SEAC and CBI theaters. ... It would seem logical then, that all efforts in that area should be directed toward nourishing the air forces in China so that they, by an all-out effort, can support our assault from the Pacific."

The British 14th Army, with air support provided by both the 10th AF and the RAF, "captured Mandalay in March 1945, Rangoon in May, and drove the remnants of the Japanese forces out of Burma." The B-24 Liberators "pounded Japanese depots and installations" as "the tactical air forces were deadly in close support, harrying the enemy and slaughtering thousands of Japanese soldiers." See Goldberg, 83.
The military personnel assigned to ATC dropped from 209,201 to a total of just 42,000 officer and enlisted members shortly after the war. In order to continue providing needed operations and services, the command was forced to resort to contractual arrangements with civil air carriers, which were able to provide "airlift as well as civilian technicians for maintenance, communications, and weather services." See Goldberg 147.
"The size of the ATC should be such that, together with its reserve in the airlines themselves, it can pick up and carry one Army Corps to either Alaska or Iceland. With this concept of airpower, the Air Force must, at all times, be ready to utilize civil aviation -personnel, aircraft and facilities. This, therefore, requires that civil aviation be kept as strong as possible and coordinated with the Air Forces." See General Arnold toLt. Gen. Harold George, letter, 5 December 1945, cited in Miller, 70.

This aircraft had a wider fuselage, stronger wings and more powerful engines than the C-82. Used primarily by troop carrier wings, this aircraft had large, rear-mounted "clamshell" cargo doors which were conducive to airdrop operations and simplified loading and unloading operations on the ground. The C-l 19G model was able to transport 62 soldiers, 40 paratroopers or 30,000 (15 tons) pounds of cargo. See Eichhorst,

The Commander of 8th Army, General Walton Walker, was tragically killed in a jeep accident on 23 December 1950. General Matthew Ridgway assumed command of 8th Army on 26 December 1950, and soon thereafter inspected the various U.N. forces along the 38th parallel, which was outnumbered by the Chinese by a ratio of 2-to-l. SeeThompson,[67][68] 
Ridgway's force consisted of 125,000 Americans; 100,000 Koreans; 25,000 other U.N. troops, including British, Turks, Australians, New Zealanders, Dutch, French, Greeks, Thailanders, Filipinos, and Canadians. In support of this four-day evacuation, CCC airlifted 2,297 patients, 4,757 tons, and flew 114 C-l 19 airdrop missions in support of allied troops as Kimpo, Seoul and Suwon fell in succession. SeeThompson, 68.   
Eichhorst, Military Airlift, 17.  38S Tunner, Over the Hump, 263.  389  Once in Japan, the CCC operated the tactical airlift operation shuttling troops and equipment to Korea. See Tunner, 9.390 Tunner elaborates on these points: "(l)Aerial resupply allowed the 8th to drive up the west coast of Korea without regard to lines of ground supply; (2) The C-47 was the only plane capable of routinely landing on short, rough, dirt landing strips to evacuate the wounded, but it was incapable of carrying or dropping the large cargo loads the C-l 19 could handle." See Eichhorst, 17.
Despite the fact that there was initially a shortfall of airlift assets, given the nature of the problems that General Tunner encountered, the FEAF report concluded that "even more airplanes would not necessarily have solved this problem."See Miller, 202.  397  Bunker, "Organization for an Airlift, "31.

The airlift force continued to remain "outside the fighter-bomber system" and was exclusively controlled by the 834th Air Division. See Schlight, 165.
'4  The airfields used to support Khe Sanh were Camp Evans, Ca Lu, Quang Tri, Lavang, Hue Phu Bai, Hue Citadel, Dong Ha and Khe Sanh. However, McLaughlin makes the case that "the airlift effort expended into Khe Sanh was an extreme example of the effect of a particular operation on the entire system." From January until March 1968, the average monthly airlift tonnage in this sector grew by 14,533 tons, for a 310% increase over the preceding six-months. SeeMcLaughlin,[67][68] 
Despite this merger with the 7th AF, the ALCC remained separate and distinct from the TACC as a "division of the newly created 7th AF Directorate of Airlift under the Operations Deputate." MACV continued to function as it had in the past, with its Traffic Management Agency responsible for scheduling routine airlift and the Operations Directorate maintaining responsibility for "emergency requests." During the inactivation ceremony conducted at Tan Son Nhut on 1 December 1971, the 834th Air Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation. SeeMiller, 315.   
In November 1970 it was estimated that a "surge requirement" of "68 C-130 equivalents" was needed, predicated upon the ability to fly 689 sorties to deploy a "Vietnamese division from the Saigon area to Da Nang in five days."See Miller, 315.   
The A-models ceased flying as of 28 December 1970, while the B-models flew until25 October  1971. See Bowers, 473.   
The 21st, 50th, 345th and 776th squadrons were all assigned to the 374th TAW, headquartered at Tan Son Nhut while the 774th TAS was based at Clark AB, Philippines. The C-130 home base facility at Cam Ranh Bay ceased operations in February 1972.See Miller, 473.   
All that remained was the 310th TAS, which was relocated to Tan Son Nhut. The C-123 squadron

In this December 1972 "Linebacker II" campaign: "during an eleven-day period, B-52s flew more than 700 sorties against military and industrial targets in the Hanoi-Haiphong area in conjunction with about 1,600 sorties by fighter bombers." See Eade, 7.
"Those eleven days may well prove to be the most decisive period of the entire war; a period that, when the final accounting is taken, should provide unprecedented evidence of the capability of air power to achieve national objectives." See Eade, 7.i44 Militarily, it inflicted serious damage upon North Vietnam's warfighting capacity and politically, it compelled the North Vietnamese to request a cease-fire and return to the bargaining table, this time in good faith. See Eade, 7.245 Soon, all that remained of the U.S. airlift force in South Vietnam were 20 C-130s at Tan Son Nhut. On 12 August the last C-130 was shot down while climbing out of Soc Trang with all of its 43 passengers and crewmembers killed, "the war's last fatalities in C-130 operations." On 13 November the C-130 unit assigned to Tan Son Nhut relocated to Nakhon Phanom, Thailand, though it still flew missions throughout South Vietnam. See Bowers, 605 -606.240  The Accord made provisions for a: "Four-party joint military commission from the U.S., North Vietnam, the Saigon regime, and the Viet Cong to oversee the cease-fire, exchanges, and withdrawals, supervised by an international commission from four nonbelligerent powers." According to the terms of the agreement, all "American POWs were to be released and the last 23,700 American troops withdrawn within 60 days." The POWs were subsequently flown to the U.S. by C-141 Starlifter crews in an operation named "Homecoming." The prisoners were released incrementally between 18 February and six additional dates in March until the final 67 POWs were repatriated on 29March 1973. See Bowers, 608-613.

2Sft Secretary Clements, with concurring recommendations from the CJCS and the OSD for P&E and I&L, agreed on 6 April 1976 that making MAC a specified command would be an improvement. Preparations included making an amendment to the United Command Plan, an implementation plan, and a message to notify Congress of the intended action. See JCS, MAC Specified Command,3.  257  The Deputy Secretary of Defense testified that "the 1973 Israeli airlift operation or even the Berlin airlift operation are examples of airlift doing a logistical mission, that is clearly a military operation in support of national goals; and as such is well within the intent of Congress in passing the National Security Act" See JCS, MAC Specified Command, 3.^ The mission statement is as follows: "To accomplish military airlift missions during wartime, periods of crisis, JCS exercises and as necessary to ensure operational support to other unified and specified commands. The service logistic functions of MAC remain under the Secretary of the Air Force." With this distinction made, both the Navy and OSD General Counsel agreed with the legality of establishing MAC as a specified command. See JCS, MAC Specified Command, 3.
25i'Burkard, Military Airlift Command, 12. General Moore, CINCMAC, testified at the 1977 House Armed Services Committee hearings on the recent designation of MAC as a specified command. He stated that specified command status: "means that we have a dual reporting structure: During wartime or conditions that approximate war, strategic guidance comes from the National Command Authority and the JCS. During peacetime, our lines of direction for airlift service come through the Secretary of the Air Force. This arrangement streamlines the wartime chain of command, makes MAC directly responsive to the authority that decides airlift priorities, and gives MAC a seat at high level conferences that plan and coordinate activities in which MAC is a participant." See U.S., Congress, House, The Posture of U.S. Military Airlift, Hearings Before the House Committee on ArmedServices, HR 2637, 95th Cong., 1st sess., 1977, 7.  260  General Estes wrote: "The Military Airlift Command combat airlift is now an essential factor in the detailed limited-war plans of the unified and specified commanders. ... In effect then, MAC, as the global airlift command of the Air Force, has become the key element in a far-reaching change in national policy: to a strategy of multiple options for flexible, measured response to any situation in the spectrum of war."

Although "LeMay preferred to have C-123 assault transports used in tactical operations rather than as logistic carriers," because the railroads and roads were vulnerable to sabotage and ambush, airlift forces came under "great stress" Moreover,
Westmoreland "regarded all air operations as support for ground troops and of necessity responsive to ground commanders." The 315th TCG Commander, Colonel David Fleming, described this system of airlift as "a hodgepodge of badly tacked-together elements, saturated with requirements" 66
Because the Joint Airlift Allocation Board was a one-man operation, user requests could not be checked for authenticity. As a result, "cargo that should have gone by surface transportation was airlifted." Moreover, the items that were supposed to be airlifted were usually either late or missing when aircraft arrived to transport them.
Consequently, "aircraft frequently left bases empty or partially loaded" Communications were so poor that it was difficult to keep track of the various aircraft movements.
Because of these inefficiencies, "the C-123s were pushed above their programmed sixty hours of flying time a month per aircraft" As a result, "they were wearing out, stressed by landings and takeoffs at rough fields" 61 Reminiscent of airlift operations in World
War II and Korea, in spite of these organizational and equipment problems, "the system did quite well [emphasis added]." 68 66 Futrell, USAF in SEA: Advisory Years, 245.

Further inspection at Tan Son Nhut disclosed visible damage on all thirty-seven C-123s that had been in Vietnam for nearly three years. Eleven required extensive repairs. Those at Da Nang in the theater for a year had minor damage. Airlift further declined when three C-123s went to Thailand in July to join the two on station there " See Futrell 246.
68 "Over the first half of 1964, the C-123s bore the bulk of the airlift load. They airdropped 1,270 tons of supplies, moved 1,252 paratroopers and 115 tons of material in assault missions, and flew 239 flare sorties Strategie airlift" because it required the same amount of time to perform its mission as the C-124, given that it was also propeller-driven. For its part, the C-135 was considered an "interim measure."

^'DOD agreed to increase the U.S. troop strength to 82,000, supplemented by 8,000 allied troops by September. The Air Force contribution to the buildup would consist of 997 logisticians and 3,900 others who would man: "two new F-100 squadrons on Taiwan and another in the Philippines; an F105 squadron on Okinawa; F-4, RF-101, and C-130 squadrons in Japan; and another troop carrier squadron in the Philippines SeeSchlight, 31.
Silver Bayonet was the code name given to the "first full-scale combat test of the Army's new airmobile tactic," which incorporated the use of "organic Army aircraft for both close air support and logistic airlift." Schlight highlights the fact that:
More was riding on the outcome of this operation than the immediate improvement of the tactical ground situation in Vietnam. General McConnell remained skeptical of the airmobile idea and believed that the best force for fighting a ground war was a regular Army division with Air Force tactical support. ... All eyes were now riveted on the Army's attempt to prove that it could sustain itself. 
107
For different reasons, the Air Force and Army both scrutinized every aspect of Silver Bayonet as a "key to future requirements." In the case of the Army: Secretary McNamara was leaning toward converting another of the Army's 16 divisions into an airmobile force and increasing the number of Anny aviation companies during the next few years from 78 to 109.

Air Force when compared to SAC and TAC. Nevertheless, given that MAC was now a major command, it was commanded by a four-star general, giving the airlift community a stronger voice in the budget allocation process.
The long-standing division of U.S. strategic and tactical airlift resources among various, non-related commands had always made little sense and was a very controversial topic. In June of 1970 the Lindsay Committee made a unanimous recommendation that "steps be taken to achieve a single airlift command as soon as possible."

2M Secretary of Defense Schlesinger approved the proposal with "the expectation that duplication would be ended and flexibility improved. The wings and squadrons preserved their 'tactical airlift' names, and the AF Airlift Center was opened at Pope AFB to centralize development of tactics and equipment." See Bowers, 650. Secretary Schlesinger's decision had three major points of emphasis. First, it called upon the Air Force to consolidate the entire strategic (C-141, C-5) and tactical (C-130) airlift fleets into MAC, which would then be designated as a specified command reporting directly to the JCS. Second, all Navy and Marine Corps funds for airlift procurement were canceled as of FY76. In addition, their entire airlift operation was to be phased out and taken over by MAC by the end of the 1977 Fiscal Year. Third, the Air Force was vested with the responsibility of providing airlift for the entire DOD, including the Navy and Marine Corps. See The Joint Chiefs of Staff.

23 CINCMAC, Gen. Robert Huyser, stated in December 1979 that he "has never seen such concerted support for a wide-ranging production and deployment program." The CSAF, Gen Lew Allen, assigned the Chief of Staff of MAC, Maj Gen Emil Block, to "head a task force on early development of the CX concept ... to acquire the new aircraft as soon as possible." See "Airlift Focus," Aviation Week, 10 December 1979, 15. SecDef Harold Brown testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee that "the first CX could be ready in 1983 ... or perhaps by 1982." See "CX Schedule," Aviation Week, 31 December 1979, 11. "In response to a high level government and industry consensus," the Air Force moved the IOC forward a year to FY85. The expected buy was for 130 to 180 aircraft for an estimated total cost of $6 -9 billion. See "USAF Accelerates CX Program Plans," Aviation Week, 10 March 1980, 16-18.  24 "Airlift Focus," Aviation Week, 10 December 79, 15. In March of 1980 President Carter approved a list of items to improve U.S. mobility capabilities. He formed the Rapid Deployment Joint Task Force; stated his intention to buy a new CX strategic airlifter; committed to purchase eight fast-sealift ships (FSS); and established a six-ship flotilla of maritime pre-positioned ships (MPS), anchored at Diego Garcia, loaded with MAC's Airlift Master Plan, by the following March, the Air Force had managed to obtain a DOD commitment 39 to reallocate $27 million in the FY 83 budget for C-17 R&D.

39 "Air Force Develops New Plan for Funding C-17 Transport," Aviation Week, 14 March 1983, 259. A 1984 DOD study entitled "Improvements in U.S. Warfighting Capability FY 1980-84," supported the Air Force's contention that it needed airlift relief beyond the C-5B. According to the study, strategic airlift capacity had expanded 28% since 1980. It was calculated that U.S. intratheater capabilities had increased approximately 67% as well. The increase was attributed to stretching the C-141 fleet 23 feet and adding an air-refueling receptacle, extending the life of the C-5A by 22,000 hours by modifying its fragile wing, adding two squadrons of KC-10s. The study projected that before the end of the decade, airlift would be further enhanced by the addition of fifty new C-5Bs, forty-four KC-10s and CRAF enhancements. However, even with all these improvements, MAC would still be 17.

(2) Will we commit sufficient resources to win?; (3) Will we sustain the commitment?; (4) Are the objectives clearly defined?; (5) Is there a reasonable expectation that the public and Congress will support the operation?; (6) Have we exhausted our other options?" Correll poses that this test "struck a harmonious chord with a generation that had learned hard lessons in half-hearted adventures from the Bay of Pigs to Vietnam to the Desert One fiasco in Iran." See "The Lake Doctrine," Air Force, May 1996, 3.
""Between 1980 and 1983, Congress approved $435 million for the Central Command to replace a former British installation at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. Between this base and the Persian Gulf waters, naval and merchant supply ships carried military materiel for the Central Command which was based in Florida. By 1990, these pre-positioned ships could provide arms for over 300,000 Army troops, a Marine brigade, and high-tech equipment for the Air Force." See Lester H. Brune, America and the Iraqi Crisis,  1990 -1992 (Claremont, Regina Books, 1993) 54.
58 "Should such an invasion seem imminent, our two sister divisions, the 82nd Airborne and 101st Air Assault, would rush to the Middle East aboard giant C-5 and C-141 transport planes. Then our division's troops would fly in while our tanks and heavy equipment followed aboard high-speed cargo ships." See H. Norman Schwarzkopf, It Doesn't Take a Hero (New York, Bantam Books, 1992) 239 -240. making a clear distinction between airlift's combat, combat support, and peacetime missions:
The airlift mission is performed under varying conditions, ranging from peace to war. As a combat mission, airlift projects power through airdrop, extraction, and airlanding of ground forces and supplies into combat.... As a combat support mission, airlift provides logistics support through the transportation of personnel and equipment. In peacetime, airlift provides the opportunity to enhance national objectives by providing military assistance and civilian relief programs [emphasis added].

In theory, all I had to do was push a button. Hours after Desert Shield began, our divisions should have been inundated with thousands of pages of [schedule] printouts. ... However, there was a big problem. Since we'd been in the middle of revising Central Command's battle plan when the crisis broke, we hadn't yet entered the data into the computer banks -a painstaking process that under normal circumstances takes a full year. Our only alternative was to schedule the airlift and sealift by hand [emphases added]."

Airlift sometimes arrived at locations where neither troops nor equipment awaited lift. 'Planes went where nobody was!' The wrong type of aircraft arrived for a load not appropriate for the lift -a larger C-5 for a smaller C-141 load for example. The notational data in the inchoate war plan created more problems by confusing bogus 'planned' requirements with actual requirements. 114 112 CENTCOM's force package included 224 ship loads for combat units' equipment and 395 C-141 loads for three fighter wings, all with a closure in about 110 days. The first days of'front loaded' deployment, however, required 16,000 to 19,000 short tons of airlift per day. [The problem was] logisticians knew MAC's organic capacity to be 2,750 short tons of cargo and 2,500 passengers per day. See Menarchik, 58 -60.

The Air Force is now ready for different organizational schemes, and it is busily looking at them. At a time of great turbulence, there is an opportunity and a need for us to look again at the way the Air Force is -at all the things we came to accept about the Air Force as lieutenants or captains or colonels. 263 Dugan had previously served as the Air Force DCS/Plans and Operations before assuming command of USAFE in the spring of 1989. In his previous Pentagon post, the general had "advocated taking fresh organized, or equipped to fight a conventional war."

McPeak's briefing, his slides had originally read that MAC would get some tankers, and Secretary Rice personally intervened to change the wording to reflect that MAC would get most of the tankers, while TAC would get some tankers and some tactical airlift. 
271
Gen. Robert Linhard, SAC DCS/Plans, indicated that "TAC had most of the tankers because it would get the bases." General Johnson recounts that Brig. Gen. Griffith, TAC 268 "Thus, the situation in the Commonwealth of Independent States and General Butler's statements led General McPeak to press ahead so that the Air Force was postured to respond effectively." See Kennedy, Global Reach for America, 6.
269 "Rutherford told Maj Gen James McCombs, MAC DCS/Plans, to be 'positive' and to 'lean forward' like [the tanker acquisition] would happen." The planning group "recognized that SAC's reorganization of its numbered air forces by missions facilitated the transfer of air refueling aircraft to MAC. They also knew that the potential existed for forming a new command." Johnson replied via phonecon to McPeak on 8 August, stating that "the assignment of tanker forces, in particular the KC-10s, provided MAC with a "significant enhancement." The command would have little difficulty absorbing the KC-10s and those KC-135s dedicated to conventional roles." In this conversation Johnson temporarily convinced McPeak that "MAC should not give all of its C-130s to the Air Combat Command and the overseas commands." Based upon Johnson's and the other CINC's inputs, "McPeak's staff composed the 13 August briefing on reorganizing the Air Force combatant commands." See Kennedy, Global Reach for America, 7-8.
270 "Gen. McPeak announced his plan to form an 'Air Command' that would serve as the Global Power tenant of the Air Force by providing the offensive forces. Although SAC would lose its bombers, ICBMs, tankers and reconnaissance assets, it would still remain in existence and retain an advocacy role. Similarly, MAC would lose some of its tactical airlift assets but still retain advocacy responsibilities and gain some tankers." See Kennedy, Global Reach for America, 8-9.
271 Gen. Johnson originally believed that "Gen. McPeak desired to break up MAC." See Kennedy, Global Reach for America, 12. It was not until years later, at the end of FY 94, that "ACC transferred almost all of its tankers to AMC." See See Betty R. Kennedy, "Evolution of Roles and Missions Authorities Vested in AMC and USTRANSCOM, 1941 -1994," Background Paper (Scott AFB, IL: HQ AMC/HO, 30 November 1994) 10.
On 18 September 1991, at the same AFA Convention, General McPeak elaborated on Rice's groundbreaking speech the previous day. Pointing to the fact that the Air Force was already being funded at a level equivalent to the hollow force of 1980, he estimated that it was still to be cut an additional 25%:
Secretary Rice and I have absolutely no intention of presiding over the decline of the Air Force. Therefore, we will instead press for a top-to-bottom restructure as the best way to sustain our combat capability as we get smaller. 
275
Nevertheless, looming budgetary constraints made reorganization a necessity all the same. Combat Command (ACC), which also took command of SAC's former bomber force of 275 "Guiding the restructuring initiative would be maintaining 'simplicity' in command relationships. The Air Force would therefore, organize along mission versus functional lines with air power being employed as an 'integrated whole' as it had been during the early years. The AMC mission would provide the Global Reach aspect of air power. As the U.S. reduced its forward presence, but not its commitments, in the post-Cold War setting, possessing the means to transport mobility forces rapidly assumed a larger importance." McPeak attributed the changes to "the international environment as well as the declining support for defense."

While one must always be cautious of defining any single example as 'the way of the future,' the sudden Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was exactly the kind of security threat forecast by Global Reach -Global Power: a sudden, unpredictable action by a well-armed rogue state that directly threatened U.S. interests.

In response, as outlined in Global Reach -Global Power, our force planning calls for an increased emphasis on force projection capabilities -even more flexible, rapidly responding forces with global reach. 2 * 3 Furthermore, written in the midst of Desert Storm, the report acknowledged that "while the media was filled with headlines about the importance of airlift, history indicates that sensitivity may dull with time."

The FY 1993 DOD Budget made provisions to procure "8 C-17s in FY 1993 and 66 additional C-17 purchases through 1997." Plans were for the C-141s to be "transferred from the active force to the reserve component -or be retired -as C-17s are delivered."
Of the C-141s retained, they would be in need of "maintenance and repairs to achieve the 45,000-hour service life required by this plan," as the aircraft was originally designed to fly for 30,000 hours. 
298
299 "Eight C-130Hs are slated for procurement in FY 1993 with eight per year funded in FY 1994 and beyond. These aircraft will be used to replace E-models in the active force." See DOD, 1992 Annual Report of SECDEF, L31-21. Effective 1 October 1993, all AMC C-130s were transferred to ACC. The rationale was that it allowed "ACC to better integrate combat forces in support of theater commanders, and it enable[d] AMC to concentrate its assets to support the mobility portion of'Global Reach -Global Power." The same date ACC transferred its KC-135 aircraft (except for the aircraft at Mountain Home AFB, ID) to AMC in order to consolidate air refueling assets under one command." See Walter S. Hogle, Jr., "Force Structure Changes," in Policy Letter from the Office of the SECAF, July 1993, 4.

Whereas the Eisenhower Administration had placed almost sole reliance upon nuclear retaliation as part of the New Look force structure, the Kennedy Administration pursued active measures to bolster U.S. conventional, as well as nuclear, capabilities in order to have more flexibility than unleashing a nuclear strike in the event of deterrence failure. Fundamentally, this call for change had begun during the decade of the 1950s with leaders in the academic and military communities, such as Henry Kissinger and Maxwell Taylor, 5 pointing to the limits of nuclear weapons in dealing with brush-fire conflicts or insurgencies on the periphery. Another problem with nearly sole reliance on nuclear weaponry was the fact that the Soviet arsenal was gradually increasing to the point where it would inevitably reach parity with the U.S. Thus, a nuclear first-strike would become literally a "MAD" option as both sides would assuredly be destroyed in the process of retaliating with second-strike forces.
Under the strategic doctrine of massive retaliation, the U.S. Air Force stood as the primary caretaker for two legs of the nuclear triad with its long-range strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBM). Given this was the case, the Strategic Air Command (SAC) was the dominant culture within the service, as Halperin and Wilson have alluded to earlier in this study. As a result, during the decade of the 1950s, there was no mention whatsoever of the airlift mission in the Air Force's official basic doctrine. As including the airlift fleet. Thus, the decision was made to continue with the C-17 modernization program, but at reduced levels.
Conforming to organizational culture, in relative terms, the combat element of the Air Force made out much better than mobility. In rough numbers, in 1991, the year prior to the merger, TAC had approximately 1100 fighters and attack aircraft, SAC had approximately 300 bombers and 550 tankers, while MAC had approximately 300 strategic and 500 tactical airlifters. In 1992, the year of the merger, ACC initially had approximately 1100 fighters, 200 bombers and 75 tankers while AMC had approximately 300 strategic and 400 tactical airlifters and 100 tankers. By the end of the following year, ACC had approximately 600 fighters, 125 bombers, 135 tactical airlifters and 12 tankers, while AMC had approximately 300 strategic airlifters and 250 tankers. Thus, while combat air forces became more centralized by putting fighters and bombers under the same roof while at the same time adding additional enhancement elements, such as tactical airlift and tankers; airlift forces actually became more decentralized, as the tactical airlift mission was surrendered to the ACC in exchange for a vast majority of tankers. Thus, their has been a distinct culture shift in the transition from MAC to AMC.
Whereas MAC was the single manager of all DOD military tactical and strategic airlift, AMC remains the single manager of strategic airlift and tanker support in a newly emerging mission of mobility.
The second test examines the dependent measure, roles and missions, to see whether it became contentious under normal conditions of relative calm, as bureaucratic politics contends, or whether it was disputed during the heat of crisis, as organizational culture predicts. Because questions of roles and missions concern multiple services, the Secretary of Defense is usually the final arbitrator in such matters.
Crises precipitated the three instances in which interservice roles and missions became the most contentious during the Hump, Berlin and Gulf case studies. During the early days of the Hump airlift, U.S. Army General Stilwell did not believe that by itself, airlift could provide enough equipment and supplies to support the Chinese Army.
Instead, backed by General Marshall, he continued to advocate a massive ground campaign to open the Burma Road. The airman, General Chennault was confident that the Hump airlift would succeed. With Chiang Kai-Chek's backing, Chennault pushed for, and won over, Roosevelt's confidence to resort to an air campaign as a force multiplier to inflict massive damage upon the Japanese Air Force.
In the case of Berlin, at the beginning of the airlift the Air Staff, led by Chief of Staff of the Air Force, General Vandenberg, was reluctant to divert its few airlift resources from supporting its strategic bomber fleet. 6 U.S. Army General Clay, on the other hand, was adamant and President Truman concurred, that the maximum number of
The fourth test examines the measure of airlift force structure, to see whether the Chief of Staff of the Air Force has attempted to keep it as modern as the fighter force, or has allowed it to deteriorate from neglect. According to the bureaucratic politics hypothesis, by virtue of his seat as the head of the service, he should take a stand which is in the best interest of the organization as a whole, and thus ensure that the needs of the airlift community are properly tended to. The organizational culture hypothesis, on the other hand, predicts that the chief should be heavily influenced by the baggage that he brings to his seat. In other words, if his formative experience in the service was in combat aircraft, then he should supposedly be more inclined to tend to the needs of the combat force structure, rather than the airlift force structure.
From FY 62 -FY 86 the airlift budget has remained relatively stable, accounting for approximately 5% of the Air Force budget. It fell to a low of 3% in FY 74 and rose to a high of 7% in FY 85. In other words, it has never varied by more than 2% from the norm. The budget drop in FY 74 can be attributed to the fact that this was the year following the acquisitions of both the C-141A and then the C-5A, which had been ongoing from the beginning of FY 62. The budget spike in FY 85 can be attributed to the Reagan Administration's purchase of an additional 50 C-5Bs, which was deemed necessary to uphold the Carter Doctrine's commitment to deploy the newly-formed CENTCOM forces to the Middle East in the event of a Soviet (or Iranian) threat to the oil fields of the moderate Arab states.
Using the indicators of numbers of airframes procured, average age of the fleet, and combat utilization rates, airlift has been shown to be in a continual state of relative neglect since its inception. Procurement-wise, between FY 52 -FY 56 the Air Force acquired more transports than it has from FY 57 to the present. Even during the FY 52 -FY 56 buying spree, the Air Force procured just 1238 transports, compared to 1787 bombers and 8671 fighters during the same time frame. Today, the Air Force owns a total of 4688 aircraft, of which 1878 are fighters, 183 are bombers, 606 are airlifters, and 376 are tankers.

In view of the fact that no airlift pilot has ever risen to the position of Chief of Staff of the Air Force, this trend would not be unexpected. For that matter, airlift pilots rarely rise to command their own command, thus conforming to organizational cultural tendencies as well as bureaucratic politics, given that the dominant air arm in terms of budget and personnel dominates the service as a whole.
The bureaucratic politics contention that where you stand depends on where you sit does not consider the fact that players do not always sit in the same seat. In other words, some positions are dual-hatted. In the case of the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, he serves both as the head of service as well as a member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In his capacity of the head of the service, intra-service cultural forces come into play as he promotes the combat arms above the support missions. Yet, as a member of the JCS, each chief protects the interests of his service, no matter which component, combat or support.
This became evident in the dispute over tactical airlift roles and missions, which Captured vs. Capture
In this test, the dependent measure of airlift organization is examined in terms of whether the organization captures its commander in chief, as the bureaucratic politics paradigm predicts, or whether it becomes captured by the CINC, as organizational culture hypothesizes may sometimes be the case. Based upon the findings of this study, it depends upon the organization's stage of development.
During the formative stages of the airlift mission, General Tunner was able to capture and leave his indelible imprint upon the airlift organization as no other single individual throughout its formative history. Tunner was to the art of airlifting as LeMay was to the art of strategic bombardment. Thus, in this case, the CINC captured the airlift organization. However, after the doctrine was written and the SOPs were put into play, subsequent CINCs have been less influential and have been captured by the airlift organization. Just as the CSAF becomes an advocate of all Air Force missions in the Feed Service." When it became apparent that Berlin would not be able to ride out the winter unless the airlift was expanded to the point where approximately a month's worth of coal and food could be stockpiled, Tunner was again called upon. This time he formed the Combined Airlift Task Force, which also included British and Commonwealth support. Once Tunner's men instituted the processes they had used in China, the Berlin Airlift became a viable lifeline to the free world. Finally, in Korea the airlift began with 5th Air Forces ad hoc scheduling of the widely scattered airlift assets throughout the Pacific theater. Again, as soon as it became apparent that airlift was not delivering the punch, Tunner's services were called upon once more. This time, the Major General was "temporarily assigned" to Korea from his position as the Vice Commander of MATS.
Bringing his own men, Tunner quickly instilled the proven techniques from China and Berlin and the exploits of his Combat Cargo Command soon became legendary within the airlift world. Once Tunner had turned things around by establishing a bonifide airlift system, the Provisional CCC was elevated to permanent divisional status as the 315th Air Division. Soon thereafter, after Tunner had gotten the 315th AD up and running, he relinquished the reigns to his understudy, General Henebry, so that he could return to his more powerful position as the Vice Commander of MATS.
Each of these three aforementioned cases, the Hump, Berlin and Korea, followed a similar pattern of organizational development. Furthermore, Rosen contends that civilian intervention is limited to "support[ing]... the senior officers pursuing the two-part strategy described above."

The first installment toward reducing the sealift shortfall will be made up of standard, 25-knot diesel transport ships -not 30+ knot 'fast' sealift, but in sufficient quantities to move two heavy divisions with sustainment anywhere in the world in 30 days or less."
Using an organizational culture explanation for this neglect, Time writes:
The explanation of the logistical shortfall is simple enough: the armed services are not interested in spending money on programs that do not produce weapons. 
The authors of the DOD Report also note that "after the need for strategic sealift, perhaps the next most prominent is in the area of mine countermeasures:
The Gulf War was the second indication of a major shortcoming -in the Persian Gulf reflagging operation in the late 1980s In sum, drawing upon the general theory of organizational culture, I have devised this partial subset of propositions which describe some of the characteristics of U.S.
military missions which tend to be neglected. This is not to say that all neglected missions exhibit all of these traits. However, by and large, they most likely exhibit some of these tendencies as well as others not included in this generic list often propositions.
Using these propositions as a guide, testable hypotheses can be developed to test whether any of the aforementioned mission elements (i.e., sealift, minesweeping, special operations) exhibit some of these tendencies. Neglected military missions are not limited to these four mission elements. Many other possible military mission areas exist, such as close air support and air defense. Finally, although this dissertation pertains strictly to the neglect of military missions, the general concepts could potentially be applied to research projects in other government agencies as well. For example, it recently became apparent that the mission of counter-espionage has been neglected by Central Intelligence Agency after an earlier period in which it was over-emphasized to the point that it became debilitating to the whole organization. It may be that this mission neglect has been driven by the dominance of the Operations Directorate in determining the CIA's organizational culture.
In closing, over the course of the past fifty years, the organization of airlift forces has evolved from Ferrying Command to ATC to MATS to MAC to AMC, the air service component of the unified USTRANSCOM, thus bearing out "General Twiner's expectation." John Correll asserts that airlift forces have become so essential for other military missions to perform that "it is the airlifiers, not the shooters, that are the limiting factor in national military strategy" Moreover, Correll asserts that beyond supporting other forces, airlift has become "an instrument of national power in its own right" being that it is "a primary element in the Air Force's operational concept of Global Reach -
However, just two years ago the tale of airlift was not so rosy, as the C-141 fleet was seemingly on the verge of retirement, having outflown its original expected life-cycle, and the C-17 program was at risk of being canceled, having been placed on a two-year probation by the late Secretary of Defense Les Aspin.

historically, airlift has had "trouble holding its funding priority," because it "does not stir the passions [emphasis added]." 65 However, in less than a year there was "an amazing reversal of fortunes" when, in November 1995, "DOD authorized the Air Force to proceed with the procurement that will eventually reach 120 aircraft." Furthermore, the C-141 modernization program is to be "aggressively managed" so that the Starlifter remains productive until being retired in 2006. Yet, Correll warns that "there are already signs from some corners of the Pentagon 65 "Anything, Anywhere, Anytime," 3. 66 Ibid. 67-7 This assertion is supported by the fact that whereas "in 1981 the Congressionally mandated Mobility Study set the official requirement for airlift at 66 MTM/D, the computed requirement was understood to be higher, but that was essentially academic since the capability peaked below 50 MTM/D. After the Cold War ended, a 1992 Mobility Requirements Study adjusted the goal downward to 57 MTM/D. The current goal, set in 1995, is stated as a range: 49 to 52 MTM/D, depending on the stock of equipment and supplies prepositioned abroad. Present wartime airlift capability, counting activation of the Guard and Reserve and mobilization of the CRAF, is approximately 49 MTM/D." See Robert C. Owen, Airpower Journal, 1995, cited in "Anything, Anywhere, Anytime," 3.
