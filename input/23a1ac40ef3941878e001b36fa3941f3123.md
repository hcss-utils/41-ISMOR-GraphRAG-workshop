The area not addressed in this endeavor is the materiel aspects of electronic warfare equipment required to support multi-domain operations.
Currently, the Army is equipped with only residual ground-based electronic warfare equipment repurposed for the C-IED threats during operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.
Comparatively, the Army's electronic warfare equipment is outnumbered and outmatch by adversaries such as Russia and China.
Despite a short-term disadvantage a long-term opportunity exists, if acted upon in the near term.
To seize the advantage, the Army potentially achieves a generational leap by fielding advanced electronic warfare systems instead of incremental improvements of legacy systems.
If the Army pursues this option, the adversarial systems would instantly become obsolete in relation to the capability of US electronic warfare systems.
