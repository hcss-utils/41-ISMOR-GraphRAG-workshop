At the same time, the February report of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to the U.S. Congress recognizes the existence of "approximate nuclear parity between the Soviet Union and the United States."
Even President Reagan himself announced in a moment of frankness to a delegation of American young people in autumn of last year: "As far as forces are concerned, we (the United States and the USSR) are almost equal."
Nevertheless, such evaluations of the general balance of forces between the USSR and the United States do not prevent the three authors from appearing in the pages of a respectable American publication with truly fantastic assertions that "in response to one launching by us (the Americans), the Russians could make three launchings" of strategic nuclear warheads.
The authors required such falsifications in order to "prove" that the United States is now supposedly faced by the choice: "Either die or submit to nuclear blackmail."
The third way out offered by Kampelman and the two other experts, and the "only acceptable" way for the United States, consists, predictably, in the deployment of a large-scale antimissile system with space-based elements, in accordance with Reagan's "star wars" plan.
