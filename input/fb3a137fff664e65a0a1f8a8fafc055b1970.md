China, Russia, and Japan and the Competition to Create a New World Order To win the civil war, the Bolsheviks leveraged their central position in St. Petersburg and Moscow to use the railway system that fanned out from these two hubs.
They paired each military commander with a party member, connected with the secret police, who could eliminate uncooperative commanders as well as their families.
Likewise, it paired party members with experts in the civil bureaucracy.
This assured Communist Party control.
The Bolsheviks also had a strong social program promising land to the peasants and literacy education for recruits.
Land gave peasants a reason to fight, but in a classic bait and switch strategy, after the civil war, the new government deployed its battle-hardened army to take back the land from the peasants.
It did so out of communist principles and financial necessity.
