For Germany, a 20-year gap in combat air capabilities could undercut aspirations for a leadership role in European security.
Germany's current lack of fifth-generation aircraft, technologies such as the AESA radar, or long-range missile arsenal would constrain German offensive combat contributions in a high-intensity conflict with Russia, likely circumscribing the Luftwaffe's role to defensive counter-air missions beyond the range of Russian surface-to-air missiles.
Germany's contribution would not be negligible in light of the extensive NATO infrastructure on German soil, but the implications of German absence from a forward combat air role, and uneven distribution of operational risk across the alliance, merit further discussion.
Furthermore, while it is beyond the scope of this paper, further analysis should consider the implications for NATO nuclear burden sharing of a Germany unable to credibly perform NATO nuclear missions in a denied and degraded environment.
