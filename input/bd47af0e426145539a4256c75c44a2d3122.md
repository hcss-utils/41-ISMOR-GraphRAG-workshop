RUSSIA has long declared Central Asia to be its privileged sphere of influence.
Because of history, economic ties, a colonial lingua franca, the Russified culture of the elite, and since Crimea and Ukraine, and because of a tsunami of propaganda on the Russian broadcast media that blanket Central Asia, Russian near-absolute dominance there should be a foregone conclusion.
However, it's not.
Each Central Asian state jealously guards its independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity, and ever more so since Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine, which was a quiet game-changer, even a wake-up call, for each of the Central Asian governments.
Central Asian leaders who already consider stability as a sine qua non for continued rule don't really need regular sermons from Moscow about the evil of so-called color revolutions, supposedly plotted in Washington -the unconstitutional changes of government in Georgia (the Rose Revolution of 2003), Ukraine (the Orange Revolution of 2004 and, more recently the Maidan of 2013), and Kyrgyzstan (the Tulip Revolution of 2005) -but such warnings are part of the regular Russian liturgy in Central Asia.
In short, Moscow demonizes democracy and trumpets authoritarian rule in the service of stability but also to try to herd the Central Asian sheep into its own, and exclusive, pastures.
