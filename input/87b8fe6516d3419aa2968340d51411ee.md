Â  Headnote ABSTRACT: The war in Ukraine has refocused Western attention on Russia and its ability to project power, particularly in terms of "hybrid warfare" through the so-called Gerasimov Doctrine. At the same time, Russian military thinking-and actions-are rapidly evolving. This article reflects on the increasingly prominent role of conventional force, including the use of high intensity firepower, in Russian war fighting capabilities, and advocates the need for a shift in our conceptualization of Russian actions from hybrid warfare to state mobilization.
