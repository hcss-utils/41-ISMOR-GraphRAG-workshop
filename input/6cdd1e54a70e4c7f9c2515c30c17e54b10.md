The purpose of this work is to answer the following questions: As Russia reasserts itself within Eastern Europe, employing its military in unique ways that are challenging to defeat, how should the United States adjust to prepare for, deter, and potentially respond to a crisis caused by Russia's Non-Linear Warfare?
Despite the military draw-down and fiscal constraints the US needs to support its NATO allies by preparing to respond to further Russian aggression in Europe.
Due to their strategic location, historical relationship, and an ethnic Russian minority, the Baltic States (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania) are at risk to Russian aggression in the form of non-linear warfare.
For example, if Russia were to apply a similar model to Latvia as it did in Crimea, first Spetsnaz and other "little green men" 6 would arrive in Latvia's urban areas; within 24 hours additional motorized, mechanized, and helo-borne forces (all undeclared) would arrive in force.
This undeclared force would seize all key government buildings and, significantly, all key infrastructure-such as port facilities, airfields, rail heads, bridges and power plants within 48 hours.
