Strategic Studies Quarterly â™¦ Winter 2013 [ 6 ]   Ever since it first tested nuclear weapons in 1964, China has professed that it will never be the first country to use them against any nuclear weapon state and that it will never use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against any nonnuclear weapon state or nuclear weapon-free zone.
This so-called no-first-use pledge has become a routine staple of practically every official Chinese pronouncement on nuclear policy.
Moreover, Chinese officials routinely criticize the United States and Russia for not explicitly declaring a no-first-use policy of their own and for allegedly retaining a "nuclear warfighting" posture, including the capability to conduct a first strike.
