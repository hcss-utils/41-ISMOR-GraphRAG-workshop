When military personnel are deployed to an area without Russian insignia, and their presence in the area is officially denied, matters of "response" from outside nations are severely complicated and stalled.
But in Ukraine one observes that conventional military responses from within the affected conflict area proved capable of denying Russia the terrain and the ability to dominate the sphere of IO.
Russia's non-linear warfare relies on a high ratio of non-military to military actions-4 to 1 as professed by Gerasimov; however, events in Ukraine demonstrate that an opposing conventional military force inhibits the effectiveness of both non-military, and military actions.
