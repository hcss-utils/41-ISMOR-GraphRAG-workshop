A strategy of partial withdrawal from Syria or the Ukraine may actually allow for better future negotiations.
The springtime drawdown of Russia from Syria allowed negotiation space for Putin, and even Assad.
It ceded contentious spaces to Russia for making the first moves, and allowed them more time and diplomatic maneuver room for future moves.
For example, what if the US decided that what was lost in Ukraine isn't worth expending more efforts for?
Would the US be willing to further backtrack with a post-Cold War ally?
How would this be perceived by other allies?
What might the US do to guard against further Russian exploitation?
While we might distance ourselves from Erdogan and his policies, we do not want to abandon a key ally like Turkey.
How might we work with all parties to give Russia some recognition, while correcting their belligerence?
Is this even possible?
Note how Russia and Israel, Russia and Afghanistan, among others, have warmed as the US relations with these have chilled; this kind of activity can harm long-standing relationships, and must be weighed before a new strategy pursued.
