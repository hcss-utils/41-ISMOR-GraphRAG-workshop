The approach to hold soldiers longer in reserve positions is not new in the German military organization, but it faces the same challenges in order to maintain their profession.
After the war of 1870/71, many foreign countries adopted the Prussian mobilization system and a veritable mobilization race arose.
In view of the looming two-front war, it was important for Germany to achieve a qualitative and quantitative mobilization advantage that would allow France to be defeated before Russia had ended its mobilization and employment of forces.35 On the recommendation of the General Staff, against the resistance of the Ministry, inactive Landwehr regiments were increasingly used for the establishment of reserve divisions with previous conscripts but without the requirement of mandatory training.36 This led to an inadequate maintenance of capabilities and to tragically collapsed replacement divisions at the beginning of the First World War.
