Even if the United States chooses to delay a response to China, the United States must develop a concept for preemption in the event China's continued aggressive behavior, military positioning, and/or threatening rhetoric require the United States to take action to defend itself in the future and perhaps near future.
In this vein, the United States should develop a whole of government preemptive approach.
The United States must make a formal declaration that any attacks on the sovereignty of the United States or its citizens, to include cyber and information operations, are no longer considered below the threshold of war.
After all, if countries like China, Russia, and Iran seek to fight the United States and gain significant advantage in this area, it is already a battleground, and China and the United States are already at war.
By setting this expectation and defining a hard line publicly, China and others will be forced to rethink their current activities or accept the risk of a now-justified US response.
In this way, the threat of a US preemption of China could serve as a strong deterrent.
