Third, Russia aims to be able to engage in out-of-area expeditionary operations to respond to terrorism, instabilities, and humanitarian disasters and, thus, bolster Russia's role as a great power.
It is important to note that Russia's ambition for expeditionary operations is quite limited, especially in comparison to the United States, which is part of the reason Russia seeks collaboration for future expeditionary operations.
Russia lacks a strong network of bases and allies to support expeditionary operations, it has a very small expeditionary logistics capacity, 31 and there is little in Russia's strategic documents to suggest that expeditionary operations are a priority.
Nevertheless, Russia's engagement in Syria, its efforts to cultivate its expeditionary capabilities through the development of a merchant marine, and other procurement priorities indicate that Russia does seek to develop the potential to use its military overseas in the future.
While these activities are expected to be largely in the MENA region, they may also occur on the Korean peninsula if there were instability in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) or, potentially, other regions.
