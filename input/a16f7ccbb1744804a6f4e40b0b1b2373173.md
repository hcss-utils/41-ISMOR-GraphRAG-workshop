The Second Lebanon War exemplified a state sponsored non-state actor conducting a modern hybrid war.
By contrast, Russia, through a series of conflicts in Chechnya, Georgia, and Ukraine, has developed a modern hybrid war strategy being employed by a state under the auspices of non-state actors.
This development demonstrates a dangerous and powerful evolution of the concept of modern hybrid warfare as the full technological, diplomatic, informational, military, and economic powers of a state can be applied in a variety of ways to meet Russia's political and military objectives.
By concurrently fighting with conventional forces, irregular forces, and guerrilla forces, modern hybrid warfare provides a wide range of dilemmas to opponents of Russia.
The varied tempo, threats and tactics in operations allows them to overwhelm their opponents and achieve their objectives.
General Valery Gerasimov, Chief of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces, stated in 2013, "Wars are no longer declared and, having begun, proceed according to an unfamiliar template."
