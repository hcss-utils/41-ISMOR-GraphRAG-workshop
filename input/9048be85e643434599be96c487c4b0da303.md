The second scenario (II) presupposes three conditions: continuing U.S. engagement; a Korea that is either unified or at peace with North Korea as a result of improved inter-Korean relations, whether through a peace treaty or significant confidence-building and arms control measures; and the advent of hostile regional actors (e.g., China as a regional spoiler, Japan's remilitarization, and/or the revival of Russia's Far East military power).
Korea will not encounter the development of this scenario in the immediate future.
But in the medium-to-long term, its possibility cannot be entirely ruled out.
