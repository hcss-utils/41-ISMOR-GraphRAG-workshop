The Franco-German Rivalry emerged as a helpful makeweight to the Russians in 1892, and then to the British in 1904.
The timeless lesson is clear.
A power eclipsed by another is not disarmed; on the contrary, it can use military deterrents, alliances, finances, trade, and levers of the media and public opinion (soft power) to improve its relative situation and thwart the "winner."
How did this strategic competition end?
The French won.
But in their own efforts to win the peace, they antagonized a Germany that was really only lightly wounded by the Treaty of Versailles.
True, the Germans surrendered 13 percent of their pre-war territory (25,000 square miles) and 10 percent of their population (6.5 million subjects), and their army and navy were reduced to 100,000 troops and a dozen lightweight ships, but the Germans remained the most potent power in a Central European space that had become a contested vacuum with the breakup of Austria-Hungary and the retreat of Soviet Russia.
The advantage in "optics" would flip again, the Germans after 1919 becoming a victim of French pride and revengeand merely trying to reclaim areas that were "rightfully theirs"-the French an overweening victor.
Germany would rebound to defeat France in 1940.
