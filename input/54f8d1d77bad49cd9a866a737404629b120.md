Three major adversaries, Russia, China and Iran, make the gray zone a war.
Any target of a war cannot rightfully be denied the ability to wage it, regardless of the weapons used or the theories invoked.
Since all of the attempted definitions of the gray zone are true, all of the elements ending in "warfare" are applicable to this fight, such as political warfare, hybrid warfare, cyber warfare, etc.
This reality forces the United States to engage in a protracted gray zone war.
