This report has two objectives. First, we consider what factors seem associated with the U.S. decision to form coalitions and explore the factors that drive the decisions of partner states to join coalitions. We examined both qualitative and quantitative evidence in conducting this analysis, which builds on, updates, and extends past work on this topic. Second, we consider the question of which factors shape the success of coalitions. We examined the conditions under which U.S. coalition operations are more successful than unilateral ones at achieving U.S. political objectives. For this analysis, we used a broader set of objectives than most existing work on this topic has done, and so we provide a more complete view of factors that could support coalition success.
The report will be useful to policymakers and defense planners seeking to gain a better understanding of why coalitions form and when they are successful. The analysis and recommendations in the report can inform planning for future contingencies by providing insight regarding when states are most likely to join a military coalition and when these coalitions are most likely to advance U.S. interests. The report might be able to guide decisions about when to pursue the support of a coalition and when the United States might benefit from operating alone. This report also could help policymakers and planners make choices about coalition recruitment and participation by identifying which types of states might be most willing to join a given coalition and which might make the most-meaningful contributions to coalitions of different types.
For the purpose of this report, we define a U.S. coalition intervention as any ad hoc military intervention including the United States and at least one other country (in addition to the host) in pursuit of a common action. This definition follows the one outlined in Joint Publication 3-16.

xvi Building Military Coalitions: Lessons from U.S. Experience post-Cold War period as providing the most-relevant historical experience and consider what our findings might mean for future operational contexts.
We asked three research questions and used a combination of qualitative and quantitative analyses to explore each of 15 hypotheses derived from the literature across the three questions. Most hypotheses can be assessed using both qualitative and quantitative methods, providing two lenses on the same question. Others can be assessed using only one of the two approaches. Table 
S
Box S.1 summarizes the key findings for each of our 13 hypotheses. We discuss these findings and resulting recommendations for the Army in this section.
We found strong support for two of our hypotheses regarding why the United States chooses to use coalitions, and we found mixed support for the other three. The United States has tended to use coalitions to offset the operational burden of an intervention and to build the coalition or legitimacy needed to carry out an intervention. These findings are consistent with existing literature. We found that logistical concerns related to geography are not irrelevant to coalition decisions but that the United States can often overcome the challenges associated with distance without entering into formal coalitions that involve the provision of forces. Domestic considerations related to the political support of the general public and of the political elite appear to matter in some situations-but not others, and not systematically. Finally, although the United States has tended since the end of the Cold War to use unilateral interventions when the immediate threat to the United States is high, our broader analysis suggests that operational burdens and considerations of legitimacy often mean that the United States is forced to rely on coalition support. Furthermore, we observed situations in which the United States expressed a willingness to intervene unilaterally if the costs of forming a coalition were too high.
These findings have implications for the planning of future interventions-and the future of coalitions, specifically. As the United States shifts to a focus on competing with and defeating near-peer adversaries, defense planners and policymakers must also consider what these conflicts might look like and how the United States will prepare for them. There are at least two possible directions, and each suggests something different about future trends in coalitions. First, if future conflicts are likely to be larger-scale confrontations with such adversaries as Russia and China, then the United States will likely be forced to rely more heavily on coalitions to help meet the operational demands of a major-power war. In such situations, the United States might wish to operate unilaterally because it faces a direct threat to national interests but be required to rely on partners because of operational requirements that exceed capacity. However, our analysis also showed that, during the Cold War (a period when the United States faced a major power adversary), conflicts tended to be fought through proxies, coalitions were used less often (with exceptions), and the United States more often intervened unilaterally (though carefully to avoid directly engaging with the Soviet Union). In the post-Cold War environment, political legitimacy has been paramount in driving the trend toward coalitions, but will this trend continue in a more severe threat environment? Importantly, one way that legitimacy might continue to matter is through questions of access: Having regional partners and support can ease access and logistical challenges that are manifold in both U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and U.S. European Command. Still, a changed threat environment might alter the way the United States uses coalitions.
Our analysis of coalition contributors suggests that states are more likely to join U.S. coalitions when they have close ties with the United States, when the intervention occurs in their own region, and when they can leverage membership to increase their status or standing. We found that having shared interests with other coalition partners can support membership, but there are plenty of instances of states joining coalitions to pursue their own objectives, which can differ from those of the United States or of the coalition. Finally, we found mixed support for the argument that IGO sponsorship drives membership. IGO sponsorship does seem relevant at the aggregate level, but our case studies identified clear exceptions. Planners and policymakers can leverage the insights here to identify specific states that might be willing to join a coalition or are at least open to joining with the right incentives. We offer some thoughts on this here.
When it comes to building coalitions, establishing strong ties prior to a conflict or crisis can be beneficial. The Army should seek to build and strengthen these ties with potential partners along political, military, economic, and cultural dimensions.
Our analysis found that states with longstanding close ties to the United States tended to be more likely than other states to join U.S. coalitions. This was true across different types of relationships: military, political, economic, and cultural. Although the strongest relationship was found for military alliances, we found that military assistance and cultural ties (e.g., the percentage of the country's population that speaks English) also mattered. To build relationships that encourage coalition partnerships, the U.S. government generally and the U.S. Army specifically have several options. First, military and diplomatic leaders could seek to expand the number of formal partnerships of which the United States is a member. That is a high bar and could be challenging in such places as East Asia, where potential partners have avoided bilat-eral relationships and are concerned about angering China. However, there are less formal options, such as unofficial partnerships and even close military or political ties built through interpersonal relationships, joint training and exercises, and personnel exchanges. Another option would be to capitalize on military assistance to establish ties that could build a different type of military and economic relationship while also building partner capacity in ways that can support future operations. Economic ties can also matter. Increasing trade relationships with a country, for example, appears to increase the likelihood of that country joining a coalition. Equally important to the observation that closer ties can encourage potential partners and allies to join U.S. coalitions, our analysis suggests that even allies do not universally join U.S. coalitions. As a result, the United States cannot and should not assume partner or ally support when conducting contingency planning.
Where does the United States stand on building the relationships it needs to support future coalitions? The answer varies by region. In Europe, the United States has strong political and military ties, formal alliances, deep trade relationships, and strong cultural connections, though there are questions about whether even these ties will be enough to guarantee support in the event of major war. In the Pacific, the U.S. position is more fragile. The United States has several key military alliances in the region, but many other states have stringently avoided formal military relationships. Even close allies have shown hesitancy to anger or provoke China by drawing closer to the United States. Economic ties are strong, and the United States is a major economic player in the region, but it is overshadowed by China in most instances. Had the United States joined the Trans-Pacific Partnership, such a multilateral relationship would have built a strong set of economic ties that could have increased the odds of future coalition support. Finally, cultural ties are limited and dominated by China in some places.
There is some evidence that states seeking greater international status or influence might be primed for recruitment to a coalition, even if initially resistant. When forming coalitions, the United States should consider whether there are status-seeking states that might be willing to join without explicit or implicit payments or side payments.
We found some evidence in several of the intervention situations we considered of a state joining a coalition to advance its own status or standing. In most of these situations, the partners in question were smaller states seeking to advance on the international stage. This was true in the coalitions formed in the Gulf War and to fight the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). In other situations, even larger states, such as Canada in the case of the war in Afghanistan (in 2001), have used participation in a coalition to advance national standing and reputation. Participation can be motivated by a desire to win the favor of the United States or to solidify relationships on which states are economically or militarily dependent-but it can also be motivated by hopes of getting a place at the table and a larger voice on the international stage. This notion that the United States might be able to leverage the desire of some states to advance their international status when building coalitions is one that deserves additional research, given the potential implications. Specifically, if the relationship observed in our case studies is one that can be generalized, then identifying those states most vulnerable to such appeals could be a useful means for the United States to extend and diversify future coalitions without significant costs. When thinking about possible future conflicts and the coalitions that would be needed to fight them, the European, Pacific, and Middle East theaters are very different. In each case, however, there are both smaller states that might seek more influence and rapidly rising states that might see coalition membership as a pathway to greater international political influence. Additional research in this area should seek ways to test this relationship between status-seeking and coalition membership empirically and in a wider set of situations, as well as to explore whether certain types of states are more likely to have status objectives.
IGO sponsorship or leadership might not be required for the formation of strong coalitions, but it can increase the willingness of potential contributors to join.
Our analysis shows that states seem more willing to join coalitions when they have the approval of an IGO, such as the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United Nations (UN), the European Union, or the African Union. But our case studies also show that IGO sponsorship is not a requirement and that coalitions have been successfully formed without having an IGO involved. For the United States, building and working through IGOs might be one way to support the formation of diverse coalitions. Importantly, IGOs formed in one region can serve as powerful legitimacy providers for interventions in other regions. For example, NATO has led interventions across the globe, and interventions supported by the UN are similarly widely dispersed. IGOs can serve as the core foundation of an intervention and motivate wider participation. The United States does not have a NATO-like multilateral IGO in the Pacific that can support coalition formation in this way; furthermore, it is unlikely that the United States will be able to build a multilateral organization in the region. Instead, the United States has a series of bilateral alliances that it must work through to achieve its aims. This could pose a vulnerability should a conflict in the region require a coalition-led response, but informal relationships could fill the gap. Exercises that bring multiple East Asian players together could be one way to foster these types of multilateral ties, although perhaps not formal alliances. When thinking about and planning for future interventions, the United States should consider more carefully (and earlier) how it will leverage IGO support to build strong coalitions. IGO sponsorship should be incorporated into operational planning and exercises. IGO support Having some kind of shared interest, such as a perceived or real threat or desired end state, is important to coalition formation and success, but states also can-and do-have their own national objectives.
In our case studies, coalitions were generally formed around a shared set of interests or desired end states but very often had partners that also had divergent objectives. Shared interests, such as a shared threat or overarching desired outcome (e.g., defeating ISIS in the early 2000s, removing Saddam Hussein from Kuwait in 1990), are important to coalition formation but even more central to the ability of coalitions to achieve that outcome (not to be confused with the separate national-level objectives-such as status-seeking, building ties with the United States, or operational experience-that also might exist). In particular, we found that coalitions that shared a common threat and common view of that threat tended to have several advantages in terms of cohesion, communication, and commitment; those that lacked such a shared threat tended to suffer from conflicting motivations, communication challenges, and failure to coordinate. For example, one reason the Global Coalition Against ISIS, formed in 2014, was successful was because coalition partners shared a perception that the threat posed by ISIS was severe and immediate, which overrode partners' varied and conflicting individual motives. This shared sense of the threat allowed the diverse coalition to hang together for an extended period. By contrast, coalition partners in other interventions considered here did not share a common threat-or, at least, a common view of that threat. In the instances of Afghanistan in 2001 and NATO's deterrence of Russia in Europe in 2014, coalition partners differed in their experiences and perceptions of the threat's severity. These different perceptions created cracks and fissures that undermined coalition success.
Our findings suggest that, when working to form coalitions, the United States should focus on recruiting partners around a shared threat or desired outcome. Our findings also suggest that coalition partners can have some number of different-and, in some situations, even conflicting-national objectives and motivations. Considering current threats, the United States faces challenges in both Europe and the Pacific in building a coalition with a common perception of the threat. In the Pacific, different Asian allies have different views of the threat posed by China, and this might be an impediment to forming closer partnerships in the region. One way to work toward stronger partnerships and to support the development of a future coalition might be to foster a common view of the threat posed by China. The U.S. Army might be able to play a role through military exchanges and talks, and it could foster longer-term information-sharing efforts to build that common narrative about the threat posed by China.
Experience with fighting as a coalition can support success at achieving U.S. political objectives. The U.S. Army should continue efforts to train and exercise with potential future partners but emphasize innovation over routine.
Our analysis shows that past experience with training or fighting as a coalition can provide advantages that support success in future operations. This is not a surprising finding; we would expect that past experience operating as a coalition would yield better interoperability and communication and that past experience would also support the development of processes and procedures that can make coalitions function effectively. Although our quantitative analysis showed ambiguous results, our qualitative case studies provide examples of the benefits of experience. The best example is perhaps the Gulf War in the 1990s-past experience in coalitions and exercises supported ground, air, and naval operations and contributed to the achievement of key objectives. Past experience in this case also helped overcome the challenges created by the diversity and size of the coalition. We also have examples where lack of coalition experience undermined an intervention-specifically, the new partnerships in the post-World War II occupation of Japan. However, it is also clear that past experience does not guarantee success and can even serve as an impediment if past practice stifles innovation, as was the case among NATO partners in Afghanistan.
Still, it seems that, on net, the benefits of experience outweigh the downsides. The United States should not assume that past shared practices or exercises will guarantee favorable outcomes, but it should continue to invest in training and exercises with allies, partners, and potential partners. It is worth noting that past interventions have benefited not only from experience with formal allies but also from exercises conducted with frequent partners. As the U.S. military faces increasing financial pressure and potential cuts, the value of training and exercises should not be overlooked or downplayed. Investments in this type of experience today can pay off in the future. At the same time, training should be structured to ensure adaptability to multiple operating environments, which means training guidance will likely need to be revised and updated often to factor in unexpected challenges and demands. The United States is already working toward developing better training to support future operations with such events as the Defender series in Europe, Pacific Defender, and Pacific Pathways. These types of exercises are the type that our analysis suggests would be useful to future coalitions, and our analysis encourages their continuation despite resource pressures.
The decision to use a military intervention to try to achieve a political goal is inherently risky. Although sometimes necessary, the use of military force abroad can bring with it large monetary costs, loss of life (civilian and military), the potential for shortor long-term regional instability, and the possibility of backlash (political or violent) in the form of retaliatory attacks on the homeland. To offset some of these risks, states sometimes seek to build coalitions made up of partner states that have similar objectives, can share some of the cost (in terms of personnel, materiel, and resources), and can increase the perceived legitimacy of the intervention. Coalition partners can also be useful in providing access and facilitating the transit of goods and personnel, especially in interventions that occur far from the United States. The United States, for example, has used coalitions in Afghanistan and Iraq and has joined coalitions for operations in Bosnia and Rwanda.
From the perspective of the United States, coalitions can provide several benefits. They can supplement and complement U.S. forces, providing additional personnel, logistical support, access, and financial resources. They can also increase the political legitimacy of the intervention by affirming the cause to be a necessary and justified one. Possible partner states might vary in their ability to provide burdensharing and legitimacy: Larger states, such as the United Kingdom or France, can often make substantial contributions in terms of capability and funding; smaller states might contribute in other ways-for example, by providing access to key ports or military installations, logistical support, niche operational capabilities and specialized military units, or (in some situations) increasing the perceived legitimacy of an operation. However, working with partners can also bring significant challenges. Interoperability, communications, command and control (C2), and integration of forces can be difficult, even for partners that have fought together in the past. Partners might also differ in ways that make cooperation difficult. They might have different objectives, different rules of engagement, or different operational processes that make communication and joint combined operations a challenge and could undermine intervention success.
Despite the challenges, the United States has relied on coalitions more frequently in the post-Cold War period than it did in earlier periods, including the majority of its major military interventions of the past 20 years. Since the end of the Cold War, for instance, about 75 percent of U.S. interventions (not including disaster relief operations) have been conducted in coalitions.

Given that coalition warfare is likely to remain relevant, military planners would benefit from greater understanding of the dynamics that govern coalition formation and the factors that shape coalition outcomes. There is a fairly robust literature that considers the question of coalition formation-both the reasons why a state, such as the United States, might seek to form a coalition and the reasons why smaller partner states might choose to join. But most existing work is limited in any of several ways. First, much of the literature on this topic is qualitative, relying on situations that might not be fully generalizable. Second, quantitative work on U.S. decisionmaking uses data from before 2001 and so misses several formative recent interventions. Third, quantitative analysis focused on the decisions of other states is often focused on the NATO context, which limits generalizability or understanding of the decisionmaking of a wider group of states.
With all this in mind, we have two objectives for this report. First, we revisit the topic of coalition formation. Using updated and expanded data, we consider what factors seem associated with the U.S. decision to form coalitions and explore the factors that drive the decisions of partner states to join coalitions. This analysis builds on, updates, and extends past work on this topic and considers both qualitative and quantitative evidence. Second, we consider the question of which factors shape the success of a coalition by examining the conditions under which U.S. coalition operations are more successful than unilateral ones at achieving U.S. political objectives. This analysis uses a broader set of objectives than does most existing work on this topic (which tends to focus narrowly on combat victory, economic trajectory, or democratization) and so provides a more complete view of factors that might support coalition success. Our approach to answering these questions combines quantitative analysis with a diverse set of case studies to capture both generalizable insights and nuance relevant to only specific types of interventions. This report will be most useful to policymakers and defense planners seeking to gain a better understanding of coalition warfare-why coalitions form and when they are successful. The analysis and recommendations in the report can inform planning for future contingencies by providing insight regarding when states are most likely to join a military coalition and when these coalitions are most likely to advance U.S. interests. The material in this report might be able to guide decisions about when to pursue the support of a coalition and when the United States might benefit from operating alone. It also might help policymakers and planners make choices about coalition recruitment and participation by identifying which types of states might be most willing to join a given coalition and which might make the most-meaningful contributions to coalitions of different types.
For the purpose of this report, we define a U.S. coalition intervention as any ad hoc military intervention including the United States and at least one other country (in addition to the host) for a common action. This definition follows that outlined in Joint Publication 3-16.

The report considers many types of coalitions. Coalitions might differ in their membership. Coalitions can be made up of treaty allies (e.g., NATO), long-standing strategic partners, temporary partners that join together for a single operation, contributors that join for the status benefits but provide only token support, and even adversaries that find common ground to operate jointly in a narrow context. Coalitions can also vary in their command structure and leadership. Although the United States tends to play a pivotal and leading role in most of the coalitions it forms, our analysis also includes coalitions in which the United States was a more marginal contributing partner to operations led by another nation or by an international government organization (IGO), such as NATO or the United Nations (UN). Moreover, the United States might occasionally join a coalition it did not form.
Within a given coalition, member states vary in their contributions. Some states make sizable contributions that last the duration of the intervention; small contributors can play an important role if their contributions fill specific gaps or provide niche capabilities. Other states make only minor contributions-small numbers of forces for shorter periods of time. Our analysis captures two types of contributors: major and minor. Major contributors are states that meet the 100 person-year deployment threshold, make up a minimum of 5 percent of total non-U.S. forces, are deployed for at least 25 percent of the coalition duration, and have their deployed forces engaged in one of the qualifying activities.

The foundation of our analysis is a dataset of 37 U.S. military interventions between 1946 and 2018 that met our definition of a U.S. coalition. 
6
Our dataset included detailed information about each of the interventions, the partners involved, and the activities conducted. As described in more detail in in Chapter Three, we collected information for each major coalition partner on the number and types of forces committed, the activity types conducted, the extent of naval and air force contributions, the duration of involvement, and any caveats or restrictions on the use of force (that we could uncover using unclassified sources). This dataset served as the universe of interventions for our qualitative analysis and was then also used in our quantitative analysis. Our conclusions consider both qualitative and quantitative analyses relevant to a set of hypotheses derived from existing literature, and we use these findings to make a series of recommendations to guide decisions about coalition warfare going forward. We describe our methods in more detail in Chapter Three.
The remainder of this report proceeds as follows. In the next chapter, we survey existing literature relevant to the topic of this report and use it to derive a set of testable hypotheses. In Chapter Three, we describe our dataset and approach in more detail-the data collection process, how we selected case studies for the qualitative analysis, and the details of our quantitative analysis. Chapters Four, Five, and Six consider our three research questions, combining quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate each hypothesis. Chapter Seven presents recommendations and conclusions. In Appendix A, we provide a detailed codebook expanding on our data collection process and coding decisions described in Chapter Three. Appendix B contains a full list of U.S. coalition and noncoalition situations. Appendix C provides additional technical details about our quantitative analysis and the full regression results.
This report addresses three research questions. First, what factors appear to influence the likelihood that the United States chooses to intervene with partners rather than intervening alone? Second, what factors influence the decision of potential partners to join coalitions involving the United States? Third, under what conditions do coalitions advance the achievement of U.S. objectives and when do they form an impediment? In this chapter, we review past research on these and related questions to explore what is already known, describe existing gaps, and identify the set of hypotheses that we will explore in the remainder of the report.
Past research suggests that states seek to join or form coalitions for a variety of reasons, and different drivers determine whether states lead or simply take part in coalitions. Such decisions depend on the size and capabilities of the state, its international status, the threat perception, the operational requirements, the region, and political objectives. For larger states, coalitions might not be strictly necessary. The United States, for instance, might choose to act unilaterally or to act with partners, depending on the circumstances. In contrast, smaller states might always have to act in concert with others, simply to ensure sufficient military capabilities and resources.
In this section, we explore what past research says about why large states that could intervene on their own choose to rely on coalitions in some instances but not others. Past research has identified four main rationales for why such states as the United States would prefer to work through a coalition: burden-sharing, geography, international legitimacy, and domestic public support.
Arguments about burden-sharing play a major role in understanding the decision of the United States to intervene with a coalition rather than unilaterally. The basic premise of the rationale for burden-sharing is that interventions are resource intensive and costly, so states use coalitions to share the military burden with allies or other states willing to fight for the same set of causes.

Related to burden-sharing, geography can also play in whether states choose to form coalitions. Specifically, the United States might form coalitions not for personnel or monetary reasons but because partners might offer access to key territories or resources, such as ports or airfields, and provide support or contributions in the form of transportation and sustainment that ease the logistical challenges of an intervention.

17
Notably, however, countries can provide access to basing or ports or transit rights without joining the coalition itself. For example, when the United States intervened in Afghanistan in 2001, Central Asian countries provided important support in the form of access and transit rights, but they did not provide troops for the intervention itself. In contrast, for U.S. activities in Iraq both in the Gulf War and in operations to counter the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), regional partners provided both access and military personnel. To explore the extent to which considerations of geography and the logistical support associated with it motivate U.S. coalition decisions, we must focus on those instances in which logistical support came from a partner that also provided troops.
When thinking about interventions in the future, particularly those to counter such adversaries as Russia and China, the importance of this geographic component of coalitions becomes even more apparent. In the case of either of these adversaries, the United States would likely need to intervene far from its own territory. So, even in situations where the operational demands could be shouldered by the United States alone, coalitions would likely be required to meet the logistical demands of getting troops and equipment to the fight and sustaining those forces after arrival.
A third set of arguments for why the United States forms coalitions focuses on the fact that multilateral interventions better adhere to international norms and are more likely to be granted international approval because they are supported by a larger group of nations and sometimes also an international organization. In other words, coalitions might grant an intervention a degree of international legitimacy or approval from the international community. One version of this line of reasoning maintains that states pursue coalition interventions because they strictly prefer the international legitimacy that is bestowed on an intervention when it is conducted by multiple countries together or through an international organization.

A final set of arguments about why the United States might form a coalition focuses on the use of multilateral coalitions to overcome resistance from domestic audiences-not only the general public but also military and civilian elites. First, there is evidence that coalition participants' publics might be more willing to back a military intervention in situations in which that intervention involves a multilateral coalition. This could be because of the perceived benefits of partnerships, reduced commitment from the United States, and the perception that the intervention must be justified because it is supported more widely. This argument has been supported with research looking specifically at the U.S. context and appears to apply to NATO allies as well. Past research has clearly demonstrated that executives are sensitive to public opinion when they are making military intervention choices and that, in many situations, having the support of a coalition can bolster domestic support for the operation.

Past work has provided a relatively robust set of explanations for why such states as the United States might choose to form coalitions, but there is little quantitative empirical examination of patterns in U.S. intervention behavior to assess which of these motivations best explains that behavior. In part, this might be because of the relatively small sample size and issues of endogeneity. Case studies can provide nuance about how these different factors shape U.S. decisionmaking, but it remains difficult to generalize across interventions. To fill this gap, in the analysis that follows, we use an expanded and updated quantitative dataset and a diverse set of case studies to consider the following hypotheses.
H1. The United States is more likely to form coalitions when operational demands are high. 
31
If geography and considerations of access to ports, airfields, basing, and other logistical resources drive coalition decisionmaking, then coalitions should be more likely in situations in which these types of resources are most essential-for example, interventions that are far from U.S. borders.
. The United States is more likely to form coalitions when having international partners is important.
If coalitions are most valuable for the legitimacy they provide, then the United States should be most likely to use coalitions when legitimacy is most important and valuable. Since the norms of state sovereignty and nonintervention have increased over time (and since the end of the Cold War), we consider how the frequency of coalition use has changed over time.
We expect that domestic political considerations (both public support and the need to build support from political elites) will drive decisions about the formation of coalitions. As a result, coalitions might be most likely when domestic publics or other constituencies demand coalition support or when there is an electoral advantage to the use of a coalition.
. The United States is less likely to form coalitions when the threat is high and/ or national security is at stake.
We expect that coalitions will be less likely when the threat created by an overseas conflict or crisis is high-meaning that it poses a more severe threat to U.S. interests (e.g., regional stability, international norms)-because the United States will choose to act quickly and independently, prioritizing speed over perceptions of legitimacy (at least in situations in which it can bear the operational demands alone).
For smaller states, the decision to join a U.S. coalition is best thought of as a two-stage process. First, states must choose whether to join the coalition. Second, they choose how much and what types of support to contribute, as well as whether to place caveats or restrictions on what their contingent of forces will do. The literature about why states choose to join coalitions proposes a wide variety of possible rationales and a mix of quantitative and case study evidence in support of these reasonings. Some explanations of why large states, such as the United States, decide to form coalitions can apply equally well to small states' decisions to join them. For example, multilateralism and burden-sharing are relevant to both for the same reasons. However, other factors do appear more directly applicable to smaller states choosing to join coalitions than to larger ones deciding to form them-such as the bilateral relationship between the joining state and the coalition leader and the role of financial, reputational, and political incentives.
One reason that states might choose to join coalitions is that they and the coalition leader share a common set of interests or seek to uphold a common norm. Interests can be goals, objectives, or desired end states. Although larger states are more likely to see military force as a feasible way to achieve strong preferences, smaller states might turn to membership in international coalitions to support a key objective or address a key security threat in a way that they cannot if acting alone.

Existing research on coalitions also suggests that states will be more likely to join coalitions that are led or backed by IGOs that can provide legitimacy and backing to the intervention. Kreps, for example, finds that NATO's backing of the coalition operation in Afghanistan gave leaders of partner countries political cover and allowed them to remain in the coalition even as public opinion shifted. 
36
37
Past work has also shown that domestic factors might play a large role in whether and when states choose to intervene unilaterally or with a coalition. Specifically, reluctant domestic publics might be more willing to support a military campaign when they know that support is widespread or that it has the backing of a large international coalition. Although some institutional domestic political variables-such as electoral timing and party affiliation-seem not to influence the decision to join the coalition, 41 others seem to matter more. To understand how domestic public opinion shapes coalition decisions, a broader assessment about what we know about it-and about the use of force more generally-is relevant. This body of work is too vast to review in full here, but it has been reviewed extensively elsewhere. To summarize, domestic public attitudes toward use of force appear to be shaped by the nature of the objectives being pursued and by the costs, both in monetary terms and in terms of loss of life. Past work suggests that domestic publics are willing to sacrifice substantially for objectives 36 Sarah Kreps, "Elite Consensus as a Determinant of Alliance Cohesion: Why Public Opinion Hardly Matters for NATO-Led Operations in Afghanistan," Foreign Policy Analysis, Vol. 6, No. 3, July 2010.

Other domestic conditions might act to suppress the likelihood of a state joining a military intervention. Economic recession in a potential partner state might reduce the likelihood that it will join a military intervention, as might domestic unrest-especially where domestic military resources might be required to support domestic stability. 50
We already discussed the concept of burden-sharing in the context of U.S. decisionmaking. Just as larger states, such as the United States, might seek to use coalition military interventions to defray intervention costs, smaller states might be likely to see coalitions as a way to increase the military feasibility of an intervention that they could not otherwise carry out on their own. For joining states, the rationale is more likely to be one of capability aggregation and necessity. Although coalition support might be a desire for larger states, it is a necessity for states that have smaller militaries and cannot act on their own. Cimbala and Forster describe how one of the key lessons of World War II for European states was the benefits of working through coalitions for achieving things they could not achieve alone, because of both the greater resources and the united front. 51 Some joining states might require the combined capabilities of a coalition to conduct a military operation or pursue a strategic objective. Zyla, for example, finds that many NATO states seem to commit more forces to a coalition when the threat is high. 
52
54
Finally, it is worth noting that the more relevant question for smaller joining states might not be whether to burden-share but, rather, how many forces to contribute. This is not a question we tackle directly in this report.
A would-be partner state also might enter a coalition with the United States because of its specific existing relationship with the United States, formal or informal. Formal alliances or military partnerships appear to drive coalition formation. For example, NATO allies might choose to enter coalitions (even non-NATO ones) because of a close relationship or feelings of obligation to the United States.

An extension of arguments about the role played by ties to the United States is the view that states join coalitions explicitly for the payoffs of incentives, in formal and informal quid pro quos. Henke emphasizes the importance of these side payments and agreements as a kind of currency that allows coalitions to form and endure, noting that coalitions should be considered as constructed in this way more than as spontaneous formations.

Aside from explicit or implicit benefits from more-powerful states or the coalition's leader, states also might join coalitions for other intangible status benefits within the international system. Past research on coalitions indicates that states might join a coalition to raise their national status, signal an ability and willingness to operate (and cooperate) on the international stage or in the process of global governance, or note a commitment to an important international norm or ideal.

Existing work, then, presents a variety of reasons why states might choose to join U.S. coalitions or find themselves coerced into joining: relationship with the United States, financial position, military capabilities, and international ambitions, among others. Based on this research, we identified a set of hypotheses that we believe are worth investigating further. Our analysis of these hypotheses builds off past work in a few key 
75

States in the region of an intervention can provide significant legitimacy to a coalition military operation and might also provide valuable resources, such as access to ports and facilities or transit and overflight rights. Understanding the propensity of these states to join a coalition might be particularly valuable for policymakers seeking to establish the legitimacy of the operation. These states might be particularly likely to join a coalition intervention in their own region because such an intervention is more likely to have meaningful implications for national security, trade, and other issues. They might also be more likely to share a threat perception or set of objectives with an intervening set of states.
Past work seems to differ on whether having shared interests is required for states to be willing to join a coalition. On the one hand, having at least some overlapping objective or shared threat might be important; on the other, existing research suggests that states might also have their own self-interested or narrowly defined objectives.
There are many aspects of coalition operations that policymakers cannot control, but they can often influence whether an operation occurs under the auspices of an IGO or under ad hoc national control. Thus, we examined how the ease of coalition formation varies depending on who is leading the operation. H10. States are more likely to join U.S. coalitions when they seek status in the international system or to gain a reputation.
There is already evidence from past work that states join coalitions to receive explicit and implicit incentives from the coalition leader. However, if there are states willing to join simply for the reputational and status gains that might come from participation in the intervention, this would provide the United States another way of expanding a coalition-and without additional costs or investments. This hypothesis is difficult to test quantitatively, but we explore it qualitatively.
The third question tackled in this report focuses on the conditions for coalition success. Success itself can be conceived of in many ways and depends in part on the goals of the coalition. For example, a coalition aimed at peacekeeping might measure success by considering the years of peace achieved. In contrast, a coalition with a humanitarian mission might consider other metrics to assess success, such as persons fed, homes built, or lives saved. The United States might also have its own objectives and measures of success for any given coalition. As a result, in addition to considering coalition success relative to achievement of coalition objectives, we can also explore how coalitions fare in achieving U.S.-specific objectives. This latter question is the focus of our analysis in this report. We consider narrowly whether and when coalitions help the United States achieve the political objectives that it defines at the start of the intervention.
There are competing arguments and expectations about whether coalitions will contribute positively, negatively, or not at all to the outcomes of a given military intervention. On the one hand, coalitions combine the resources of many countries in ways that should favor success. On the other hand, they can be riddled with problems, such as poor communication, complicated C2 structures, slow decisionmaking, lack of interoperability, conflicting objectives or levels of resolve, and differing rules of engagement (ROE) and/or operational restrictions. 
79

81
Past research suggests that coalition-level factors might play the greatest role in shaping coalition outcomes; furthermore, the literature identifies several different coalition characteristics that might be required for success. First, coalitions tend to perform better when made up of members that have more experience working together (for example, in past operations). This is not surprising. Past experience might support interoperability and might facilitate the development of processes and protocols that favor cooperation and collaboration.

A fourth issue has to do with C2. An effective coalition will require unified control and a clear command structure, but coalitions might sometimes face disagreements about who is ultimately in charge. Hybrid or joint command structures can be

In addition to coalition-level factors, characteristics of the states involved in the coalition are also relevant to coalition success. A common argument is that coalitions are more successful when they involve democratic states. One reason for this might be that better civil-military relationships allow for easier delegation of authority in a democracy, and this delegation of authority provides the flexibility needed for success in coalition military operations.

There is also evidence that the success of coalition interventions depends, in part, on the operating environment in which the intervention happens. Research on intervention outcomes and the characteristics that make interventions generally successful, regardless of intervener, stress the role of the operational environment. Past RAND Corporation research, for instance, found that the key correlates of successful outcomes for U.S. interventions generally (combining unilateral and multilateral) varied depending on the operating environment and the primary activity type. 
98
99
100
Operational environment and the nature of the intervention might also define the shape of the coalition-and thus the outcome of its activity. Specifically, states forming a coalition are likely aware of the political and military gaps they will need to fill to execute the intervention and might seek out the partners required to fill those gaps. The requirements for a combat mission might differ from those of a stabilization mission on these dimensions. For a combat mission, success is likely to depend more heavily on the military capabilities and integration of partners; success in a stabilization or peacekeeping operation might require a different set of resources and perhaps greater legitimacy.

Literature on what makes coalition interventions more or less successful at achieving their political objectives is more limited that than on coalition formation. The research that does exist is largely qualitative in nature, relying on case studies, and the quantitative work that exists typically examines interventions only up until 2001, thus missing some of the most-recent and most-significant coalition operations that the United States has undertaken. The discussion in this section-which relies heavily on the literature on military interventions writ large rather than coalition interventions specifically-highlights the continuing gaps and contradictions in understanding of when coalition interventions are more successful than unilateral operations in achieving key political objectives. From the perspective of policymakers, this is also the more important question. States seeking to form coalitions would benefit from knowing what types of coalitions are most likely to be effective and from being able to identify the operational environments in which coalitions should be preferred to unilateral action. Based on the literature we have cited, we define the following hypotheses that we explore in the rest of the report. As already stated, we focus on those hypotheses most relevant to policymakers and military planners and leaders.
The first question of interest is whether coalitions are more likely than unilateral interventions to achieve stated political objectives. We expect to find that they are more likely to be successful only in certain instances and under certain conditions. The remainder of the hypotheses explore these conditions in more detail.
Policymakers would benefit from knowing whether coalition interventions are only successful in certain operating environments or for certain types of military activities. Previous work has identified postconflict stabilization missions as one area in which multilateral interventions might be more likely than unilateral missions to achieve stated political objectives.
H13. Coalitions are more likely to achieve U.S. objectives when partners have a shared interest.
Policymakers would benefit from knowing whether coalition interventions are only successful in certain operating environments or for certain types of military activities. If coalitions are most effective when a shared interest unites coalition members and prevents differences from being divisive, then policymakers might want to focus on coalition-building activities in these situations.
H14. Coalitions with past experience partnering (e.g., members of an alliance) are more likely to be successful.
Countries in formal alliances with the United States-for example, NATO members-conduct training missions together and typically have previous experience fighting as an allied force to achieve objectives in combat, stabilization, and deterrence missions. If past experience and training do matter to coalition outcomes, we should find that coalition interventions that consist only or primarily of formal alliance members are likely to be more effective than ad hoc coalitions that do not share this experience.
If coordination and communication problems undermine coalition effectiveness, we would expect coalition success to diminish as the number of partners increases. On the other hand, if aggregation of capabilities is the key to coalition effectiveness, then larger coalitions (especially those with advanced capabilities) might be most effective. Knowing how size affects the likelihood that coalition interventions achieve political objectives could inform U.S. coalition formation processes and decisions about whom to invite or include.
Coalitions appear to be becoming more common, especially with strengthening norms against the use of force abroad and increasing concerns about the cost of lengthy military interventions. Significant effort has already been spent on the question of coalition interventions, why they form, and when they are more or less successful. Research on why coalitions form, why large states choose to work through them, and why smaller states seek to enter them is more robust than research on correlates of success, likely in part because the latter question is significantly harder to answer. Identifying the correlates of success is complicated by small sample size and endogeneity that affects both qualitative and quantitative analysis.
Despite this strong foundation of knowledge, gaps in our understanding remain. As noted, the majority of quantitative work on this topic focuses on interventions prior to 2000. Existing data on coalition warfare is limited in the detail and information it provides. Much of the case study research focuses on large operations, such as those in Bosnia, Afghanistan, Iraq, or the Gulf War. Although certainly the most-significant instances, these do not accurately represent many smaller coalition operations that make up the bulk of the U.S. experience with such operations.
The analysis in the remainder of this report evaluates the 15 hypotheses outlined in this chapter using a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis and seeks to address the limitations identified here with an updated and more comprehensive dataset and a more diverse set of case studies.
In this chapter, we describe our definitions, data sources, and approach. We also discuss our qualitative and quantitative methodology.
For the purpose of this report, we define a U.S. coalition intervention as any military intervention including the United States and at least one other country (in addition to the host) for a common action. This definition follows that outlined in Joint Publication 3-16.

to provide detailed information on each of the interventions in the database. We also wanted to keep the data unclassified. For these reasons, including interventions below the 100 person-year cutoff would be challenging-not only because verified information about smaller operations is sparse but also because these operations are often partially or completely classified.
In addition to the size threshold, forces must have been participating in a qualifying activity for us to count them as a military intervention. We list ten qualifying activity types (also see Box A.1). Notably, we exclude forward presence-that is, forces stationed forward but conducting routine duties without one of the operational missions included in our list.

Collecting granular data on historical force deployments across more than 100 countries over nearly 80 years of operations in the ground, air, and naval domains is a difficult proposition for several reasons, as discussed in fuller detail in the dataset codebook contained in Appendix A. Official coalition statistics are generally readily available (and, presumably, relatively accurate) from self-reporting IGOs (specifically, the UN and NATO), but official data on ad hoc coalitions and coalitions conducted under the auspices of other multilateral organizations are typically more elusive. This is particularly true of older coalitions, especially those in the immediate post-World War II era. At the same time, our research efforts were partly confounded by lack of access to primary source documents from partner nations (although there were exceptions among some major contributor countries, such as Canada, Australia, and the United King-dom). More generally, we discovered surprisingly few statistical reference resources on coalition sizes and compositions.
Because of these data limitations, circumscribing the preliminary universe of U.S. coalition situations proved more challenging than earlier RAND efforts to build the broader U.S. intervention case universe. 8 Therefore, we identified reputable primary and/or secondary sources specific to each coalition and major partner. These sources included official military histories, factsheets, and press releases published by the U.S. government, other partnered armed services, and IGOs; they also included declassified intelligence estimates and analyses from the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), DoD, National Security Council (NSC), and State Department. When official government or declassified primary source materials could not be found, we drew on secondary data sources, such as multiple volumes of the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)'s The Military Balance,

This report considers many types of coalitions. First, coalitions might differ in their membership. Coalitions can be made up of treaty allies (e.g., NATO), long-standing strategic partners, temporary partners who join together for a single operation, contributors who join for the status benefits but provide only token support, and even adversaries who find common ground to operate jointly in a narrow context. Coalitions can also vary in their command structure and leadership. Although the United 8 Although the full list of publications used to construct the original dataset of U.S. interventions since 1898 is too numerous to cite, the RAND research team found many to be particularly relevant as general references. For example, see W. Eugene Cobble, H. H. Gaffney, and Dmitry Gorenburg, For the Record: All U.S. Forces' Responses to Situations, 1970-2000 (with Additions Covering 2000-2003)  Navy and U.S. Marine Corps Crisis Response Activity, 1946-1990, Alexandria, Va.:  Center for Naval Analyses, CRM 90-246, February 1991; U.S. Air Force, One Hundred Ten Years of Flight: USAF Chronology of Significant Air and Space Events, 1903-2012, Maxwell Air Force Base, Ala.: Air University Press, 2015;  and Timothy A. Warnock, ed., Short of War: Major USAF Contingency Operations, 1947-1997, Maxwell Air Force  Base, Ala.: Air Force History and Museums Program and Air University Press, 2000.  States tends to play a pivotal and leading role in most of the coalitions it forms, our analysis also considers coalitions in which the United States is only a contributing partner to operations led by another nation or IGO, such as NATO or the UN. The Enhanced Force Presence Deployment in the Baltics is one example of such a coalition. This is a NATO-led operation in which the United States is only one of many contributing partners. U.S. operations alongside NATO operations in the Balkans are another example of this type of arrangement. Additionally, we note that the leadership role played by the United States often changes over the life cycle of a coalition, with ad hoc U.S. C2 often strongest early on (i.e., during initial entry into impermissible environments and/or early kinetic activities) and leadership eventually transferred to an IGO (sometimes still headed by a U.S. commander).
Within a given coalition, member states vary in their contributions. Some states make sizable contributions that last the duration of the intervention. Others make only minor contributions, providing small numbers of forces perhaps for shorter periods of time. Still others might not provide military forces at all but instead offer money, access, or other types of support. Our analysis focuses primarily on partners that contribute some kind of military forces to the intervention, even if largely in a logistical or support role. Of course, simply observing the number of military personnel committed to an operation is not always a good way to judge the nature of the contribution made by a given coalition partner because it does not take into account the specific services provided or role occupied, nor does it take into the account the relative size of the partner's military. For a country with a small military, even a minor contribution of forces might be significant. Our analysis identified many instances in which small countries contributed disproportionately to their size compared with other partners and often provided niche and specialized units not available elsewhere. We use number of forces as a proxy here; in our case studies, we consider the many diverse ways that states might contribute to coalition operations.
As already noted, our analysis captures two types of coalition partners: major and minor contributors. Major contributors are defined as states that meet the 100 personyears ground force deployment threshold, make up a minimum of 5 percent of total non-U.S. (and non-host) ground forces, are deployed for at least 25 percent of the coalition duration, and have their deployed forces engaged in one of the ten qualifying activity types we have identified. 
10
11
Distinguishing between major and minor contributors was, in part, methodologically necessary to build a manageable set of coalition partners. Consider, for instance, the challenge of coding very large coalitions, such as the U.S.-led occupation of Afghanistan, in which some 50 countries contributed military troops to ISAF and OEF and dozens more provided support in other forms (e.g., civilian and police training, military equipment and sales, economic and humanitarian aid, and diplomatic and political support). Coding each of these partners in full detail would have been infeasible given RAND project resources. Additionally, distinguishing between major and minor contributors was methodologically desirable because it allowed us to focus more closely on the historical subset of nations assuming the lion's share of military, economic, and political burdens in U.S. coalition interventions.
After we defined the universe of U.S. coalition situations, our second step of the data-collection process was to define the major contributors in each case. Doing so with rigor and consistency arguably proved the biggest methodological challenge in constructing the U.S. coalition data universe. The process entailed, for instance, detailed annual calculations of every troop contributor's force numbers relative to total non-U.S. (and non-host) troop numbers. In many instances-particularly for older coalitions and for non-UN, non-NATO ad hoc ones-troop data availability at monthly and/or annual levels was sometimes limited, as described in more detail in Appendix A. Locating quantitative data on non-U.S. naval and air force contributions (i.e., peak or average number of naval vessels and fixed-and rotary-wing aircraft) was typically even more challenging.

13
Our resulting dataset consists of 37 U.S. coalition interventions (Table

1946 and 2018. 14
As described in more detail in the dataset codebook in Appendix A, we set a standard of inclusiveness when winnowing the universe of all U.S. military interventions between 1946 and 2018 to a circumscribed list of U.S. military coalitions. Although we erred on the side of inclusion, borderline instances were typically excluded from the final coalition universe for a few common reasons. First, in several instances, we found evidence of cooperation between U.S. and partner forces, but the latter were of an insufficient size to meet our definition of a military intervention per se. This was especially common in several humanitarian assistance missions.

Many of the hypotheses could be assessed using both qualitative and quantitative methods, providing two lenses on the same question. Others could only be assessed using one of the two approaches.

To explore the determinants of coalition formation, we begin by constructing a novel dataset using both the RUCID and the RUGID. As previously discussed, the resulting dataset contains 115 U.S. interventions spanning 1946 to 2018, of which 37 constituted U.S.-led coalition interventions. We tested the three hypotheses related to the research question simultaneously in a multivariate model. The dependent variable (i.e., outcome) is binary and takes the value 1 when an intervention is a coalition and 0 when it is not. We modeled the likelihood that the United States will form a coalition using a logit model and estimated the parameters using iterative maximum likelihood.
The model specification factors in several independent (explanatory) variables; some serve to explicitly test hypotheses while others are used as covariates to mitigate omitted variable bias. The first hypothesis posits that high operational demands will increase the likelihood of a coalition. In the model, we proxy for high operational demands in several ways. First, we consider which types of interventions are likely to have the highest operational demands. We expect that interventions that involve kinetic activities (such as stabilization, COIN, and combat) are more likely to have  • The United States is more likely to form coalitions when operational demands are high (burden-sharing) X X
• The United States is more likely to form coalitions when the logistical challenges are significant (geography) X X

• States are more likely to join U.S. interventions when they have a close relationship with the United States (U.S. relationship) X X
• States are more likely to join coalitions in their own regions (home region) X X
• States are more likely to join coalitions when they have shared interests (shared interests-formation) X X
• States are more likely to join U.S. coalitions when the intervention is sponsored or led by an international government organization, or IGO (IGO) X X
• States are more likely to join U.S. coalitions when they seek status in the international system or to gain a reputation (status-seeking) X What factors favor the success of coalitions at achieving U.S. political objectives?
• Coalitions are more likely than unilateral interventions to achieve U.S. political objectives (success) X X
• Coalitions are more likely to achieve U.S. political objectives in stabilization missions (stabilization) X X
• Coalitions are more likely to achieve U.S. objectives when partners have a shared interest (shared interests-success) X X
• Coalitions with past experience partnering (e.g., members of an alliance) are more likely to be successful (experience) X X
• Coalitions with more partners are less likely to be successful because of coordination challenges (number of partners) X X large operational demands than, for example, humanitarian or train-and-assist missions (which might be difficult but require fewer forces, on average). We find that the kinetic indicator is closely correlated with the actual operational demand of an intervention, measured in terms of average number of U.S. forces deployed in each year of an intervention. The average number of U.S. forces is an ex-post measure that can only be observed once the intervention has started while the kinetic indicator can be observed before. Second, we turn to past research on factors that make interventions and military occupations more difficult. The intervention target's land area and topography have been proposed as possible factors that shape the challenge that state actors face in seeking to assert authority or successfully control a country. 
20
20
To test whether a need for international legitimacy drives coalition formation, we draw on the fact that the norm of territorial sovereignty and the emphasis on international legitimacy have expanded since the end of the Cold War, and we consider how the likelihood of U.S. coalitions changes over time.
We considered several measures to assess the effect of domestic public support on the likelihood of coalitions. The ideal variable in this case would be some measure of public support for each intervention. If we had such data, we could consider how coalition use has varied depending on public attitudes toward a given intervention, but, unfortunately, such data do not exist. Polling, although frequent and reliable today, was much less consistent on these issues if we look all the way back to the 1940s. We also lack consistent, reliable information on the attitudes of military leaders toward military interventions. Collecting such information would not be impossible, but it was outside the scope of this effort. Instead, we rely on several other measures that have been used in past work that focused on assessing the relationship between foreign policy and domestic politics. First, we consider a measure of years to the next presidential election, under the logic that political leaders might be more restrained, and thus more likely to join coalitions, when they are closer to an election. Second, we consider a measure of presidential approval. Presidents who are less popular might also be more likely to rely on coalitions as a hedging strategy, to avoid bearing the costs of a failure. Finally, we consider whether control of the executive and legislative branches matter, using a variable that captures when both are controlled by the same party. We expect that when control is divided, the use of coalitions to win consensus might be more likely. 
21
22
The controls are as follows:
• a U.S.-target country alliance (U.S. alliance) variable that assesses whether the United States is intervening on behalf of an ally • a major power-target country alliance (major power alliance) that measures whether the target is allied with another non-U.S. major power • regional indicators • time dummies for the periods after the September 11, 2001, terrorist bombings (9/11).
The control for U.S. alliances is included because we know from past work that the United States is significantly more likely to intervene in allied countries under threat. 
23
3
Our second research question focused on understanding when states are more or less likely to join coalitions involving the United States. As previously described, we established comprehensive lists in the RUCID of all major and minor partners that joined each historical U.S. coalition. To better understand factors that influence state involvement in U.S. coalitions, we compare characteristics of states that join with those of gested that presence of territorial claims is associated with likelihood of conflict, making it a reasonable metric, especially when supplemented with qualitative instances. states that abstain. Although identifying and categorizing actual coalition partners is relatively straightforward, selecting an appropriate set of potential partners is less so.
To those ends, in the primary quantitative approach, we first consider all states in the international system as potential contributors and compare the characteristics of states that join with those that do not. However, there are many states in the international system that are unlikely to ever join a U.S. coalition, either because they do not have military capabilities to make a meaningful contribution or because they have traditionally been U.S. adversaries (or, at least, not allies). Including a large number of countries with essentially zero chance of joining a U.S. coalition might create noise that prevents us from observing relationships between country characteristics and coalition membership. For robustness, we created a second data specification, where states are categorized as potential contributors only if they satisfy one or more of the following conditions:
• They are members of the international organization under which the coalition is formed (e.g., UN, NATO, EU). • The state is in the same region as the target intervention state.
• The state is a major power (i.e., the United Kingdom, France, China, or Russia). 
24
We tested the hypotheses using two different dependent variables and the corresponding empirical models and estimation techniques appropriate for each outcome type. In the first version of the analysis, the dependent variable is binary and separates states that join the coalition from those that abstain. In the analysis of the binary dependent variable, we estimated the effect of a change in an independent variable on the likelihood of a state joining the coalition. For this outcome, we used a logit model (a nonlinear model in which the parameters are estimated using iterative maximum likelihood). But our extensive data collection allowed for further distinction; the RUCID categorizes states as major contributors, minor contributors, or nonpartners. This variable is not binary-it is categorical. When modeling a function for which the outcome is categorical, the logit model is no longer appropriate. Instead, we used the multinomial logit. In the multinomial logit, we estimated the effect of an explanatory variable on the likelihood of minor partnership separately from the effect of the same explanatory variable on the likelihood of major partnership. The ability to parse an aggregate effect of an explanatory variable can be useful. For illustrative purposes, consider the case in which estimation of parameters in the logit model finds no effect of an explanatory variable on the likelihood of a state joining the coalition. Although this estimate alone suggests the independent variable is unimportant, it is possible that the explanatory variable significantly increases the probability of a state joining as a major contributor but also reduces the odds that the state joins as a minor contributor. Analysis of the categorical dependent variables through the multinomial logit regression can provide a more nuanced insight into the relationship between the hypothesized determinants and the outcomes. Despite slight differences in the dependent variables and statistical approaches used to estimate the two models, specifications (i.e., the independent variables used to explain the outcome) were identical across the analyses. In both models, we captured closeness of the relationship with the United States using three different measures. First, we captured the extent of the political and military ties using a variable for alliance with the United States. Second, we captured economic ties using extent of bilateral trade between the potential contributor and the United States. Finally, we used a proxy measure of cultural closeness, specifically, the percentage of the population that speaks English. This captured linguistic and cultural similarities between the United States and a potential collaborator. Similarly, to assess the effect of region, the model contains a dummy variable that indicates whether a potential contributor is in the same region as the target intervention state.
Developing a proxy for shared interests was more difficult. The ideal variable would be based on a review of the objectives of each possible partner and a consideration of how those objectives overlap with U.S. objectives and the objectives of other partners. We did not have these data, so we relied on two substitutes. First, we considered trade flows between the potential partner and the target state. We knew from past work that the United States is more likely to intervene when it has economic ties with the target state, when measured as trade flows. 
25
26
Measuring the involvement of IGOs, another key hypothesis, is straightforward. We used a dummy variable that indicates whether a coalition takes place under an IGO. The final hypothesis for this second research question was tested qualitatively. Finally, we qualitatively tested the hypothesis that status-seeking states are more likely to join coalitions-the underlying concept is difficult to observe, measure, and identify.
In addition, we considered several relevant covariates in the model to mitigate concerns of omitted variable bias. We chose controls that proxy for other key factors identified as relevant in past work on coalition contributor decisions, as described in Chapter Two. Polity score controls for the level of democracy of the potential collaborator's political institutions. Lagged per capita income and a recession indicator are included in the model specification because a country's economic condition might make it more or less able to provide resources (military or otherwise) to a military coalition. We define a recession as an extended period (between one and three years) of nonpositive percentage growth of per capita income. Activity type and the target region likely play an important role in the decision of states to contribute or defer, so we include both sets of indicators in the specifications. For example, states might be more willing to join humanitarian missions than combat missions. They also might be more interested in intervening in regions of strategic importance (e.g., the Middle East). Lastly, we were concerned that time trends and structural geopolitical breaks would confound the empirical strategy. In response, we included indicators to identify coalitions that occurred after the Cold War and those that occurred after 9/11, and we controlled for the time trend. All these variables are defined further in Table 
3
This final research question posed the most-significant quantitative challenges, because testing hypotheses related to the success of coalition interventions from the U.S. perspective and based on U.S. objectives requires comparisons to be drawn between coalitions. The United States undertook 37 coalition interventions throughout the sample period, which is too small a sample for any type of regression analysis. We could no longer use sophisticated multivariate models because the paucity of data constrained the number of parameters in any empirical model we designed. Instead, we relied primarily on descriptive and summary statistics to shed light on the relationships between coalition characteristics and the success of political objectives.
There is, however, at least one hypothesis that we could test quantitatively. When we compared the success of coalitions with that of unilateral interventions, we used an intervention-level dataset (N = 115). The dependent variable is the average degree of success for U.S. political objectives on a given intervention; the independent variable of interest is the coalition dummy variable. The political objectives and degrees of success used in this analysis were taken from previous RAND work.

With these data and both outcome measures, we still face constraints on model complexity and must choose parameters judiciously. To address this challenge, we use a statistical procedure, called post-double-selection lasso, which performs model parameter selection and estimates the appropriate test statistics for the variable(s) of interest. Belloni, Chernozhukov, and Hansen introduce, derive, and explain the double-selection technique;
31
The variables used in this technique and their sources are described in Table

We augment this analysis with two additional model specifications. The first is a simple univariate regression of average objective success on the coalition indicator (i.e., 
Because our statistical analysis has shortcomings and because we cannot evaluate all of the hypotheses using quantitative methods, we supplement our regressions with five in-depth case studies to further assess the research hypotheses. Specifically, we use the case studies to collect and evaluate additional evidence on each of the hypotheses, to supplement the quantitative analysis where such analysis exists, and to fill gaps for hypotheses that cannot be tested with the statistical analysis. Case studies are useful in this instance because they can provide the nuance and rich contextual detail that statistics lack. Our case studies do not attempt to cover all details about a given intervention but instead focus on a specific set of questions in each case:
• What was the purpose of the intervention?
• What was the composition of the coalition? What activities did partners participate in? • Did partners adopt U.S. objectives or have their own? • Why did the United States choose to act through a coalition? Why did other states choose to join the coalition? • What states chose not to join the coalition? • What were the challenges and successes of the coalition?
We used the information collected about each case to address the hypotheses we have outlined.
To select our material for analysis, we considered several criteria. First, we wanted to choose a set of interventions that were reasonably diverse in terms of period, activity, region, and size. Based on our review of existing literature and past analysis, we expected that coalitions would face different dynamics and operate differently depending on the operational environment and demands and the number of coalition partners. Different types of operations that involve different numbers of players are likely to present different challenges and to have different strengths and weaknesses. Our first step was to break all 37 coalitions along these dimensions and into categories based on the number of contributors and the activity type of the intervention. We focused our attention on four different activities, the four most common across the coalition situations in the dataset: stability operations, combat, deterrence, and train-and-assist missions. We also considered three coalition sizes: small (those with fewer than five partners), medium (those with 5-15 partners), and large (those with more than 15 major contributors). These categories were drawn by observing and making use of the natural cut points in the data. Table 
3
Based on this initial binning, we observed that very few U.S. coalitions have had fewer than five major contributors. An interesting observation in itself, this led us to focus on medium and larger coalitions. We then selected from among the coalitions in our dataset to capture as much of the analytical space as possible. Although seeking regional and temporal diversity, we also had a bias toward more-contemporary interventions that would take into account more-recent regional dynamics and challenges to unilateral action and the current status of U.S. alliances and partnerships. We assessed that these situations would provide useful and relevant insights for policymakers. This led us to select five case studies, mapped across the analytical space in Table 
3
One possible limitation of this approach to case selection is that all five case studies are coalition situations, and none is a unilateral intervention that could be used as a comparison to assess the different hypotheses. Although this is a fair critique, we address these limitations in a few specific ways. First, two of our coalition case studies allow us to partially consider the relative value of unilateral action. The initial part of the intervention in Afghanistan involved minimal partnership. The postwar occupation of Japan involved partners from the British Commonwealth, but they played a peripheral role and dropped out of the coalition after a relatively short period. Second, in our case study analysis, we also weave in examples from unilateral operations. We do not investigate these operations in as much detail in this report, but we have explored them to a greater extent in previous work and so draw on these to supplement the indepth case work completed specifically for this report.
Still, the case analysis will have certain limitations. First, drawing on only five case studies, we cannot easily generalize to the full universe of coalition situations. We can assess the hypotheses on the basis of the five case studies we have and other examples, and we can weave our observations alongside our quantitative findings. Second, our case studies are somewhat biased toward recent operations in the Middle East and South Asia. In part, this is intentional. We sought to draw lessons and observations from past U.S. experience and for the past 20 years, this has been the primary U.S. experience. However, this does further constrain the generalizability of the situations. Because the future might be very different from the past, and given the shifts in the geopolitical system, we will need to think carefully about how the observations made here might apply to possible future coalitions.

This chapter summarizes our methodological approach to assessing the three research questions described in Chapter Two. As described, the foundation of the analysis in this report is a dataset of 37 coalition interventions that included the United States, spanning the period from 1946 to 2018. We were able to leverage a larger dataset of U.S. military interventions that also included unilateral interventions conducted over this same period. For each coalition, we recorded information on the number of partners, the size and nature of that partner's involvement, and the duration of involvement. Where possible, we also captured information on national caveats on the use of forces. Our data also included information on whether an IGO sponsored or led the coalition and on the activities conducted by the coalition and by the partner, which often overlap. We discussed the qualitative and quantitative methods that we combined to assess each hypothesis specified in Chapter Two. Although our analysis of most hypotheses draws from both methods, some we could only assess using one approach or the other. In terms of quantitative analysis, each of our research questions requires a different type of model and a slightly different dataset. This chapter also describes each approach, including the variables used in each model. We provide additional detail on the data in Appendixes A and B and on the quantitative methodologies in Appendix C. Finally, we discuss our approach to case selection and then the ultimate selection of case studies for the qualitative analysis. We chose a broadly representative set of data that could provide a diverse set of insights to address our research questions.  1945-1952   Following the Allied victory in World War II, Allied forces occupied Japan from 1945 to 1952-concluding with a final peace treaty. The mission of the occupation primarily focused on the democratization, demilitarization, disarmament, and economic reconstruction of Japanese society. Under the leadership of U.S. forces, the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF)-composed of the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and India-administered roughly 49,000 square kilometers in southern Japan. (This is one of only three instances in our dataset in which every partner qualified as a major contributor.) At its peak in 1947, the BCOF boasted roughly 37,000 troops, including air, naval, and ground assets, though the size of this non-U.S. contingent dwindled to only a couple thousand in the final years before BCOF withdrawal (Figure

Having gone on for nearly two decades, ongoing stability operations in Afghanistan represent not only the largest U.S. coalition in history (measured by the number of troop-contributing nations) but also the fourth longest-running U.S. coalition in history (behind only peacekeeping operations in Sinai/MFO, Bosnia, and Kosovo). This is significant because the United States and its partners did not anticipate staying in theater for as long as they have; repeatedly, the coalition has watched its progress reverse. (At the time of this writing, the group was negotiating again with the Taliban.)
In the early days of the war, the United States was able to build a coalition because it signaled wide support for the U.S. invasion and helped political processes. Of the 48 non-U.S. and non-host nations to contribute troops, ten easily qualified as major contributors based on ground criteria (Canada, France, Georgia, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Turkey, Romania, and the United Kingdom); two minor contributors barely missed our ground size thresholds as major contributors (Australia and Spain); 22 other minor contributors provided between 100 and 1,000 troops; and 14 minor contributors provided token contingents of fewer than 100 troops. In 2011, total non-U.S. and non-host contributions peaked at around 43,000-compared with nearly 100,000 U.S. forces (Figure 
3
The United States, in addition to its own post-Crimea unilateral and bilateral efforts to deter Russian aggression in Eastern Europe (such as Operation Atlantic Resolve), has supported and participated in several multinational missions led and organized by NATO and intended to enhance the alliance's deterrence posture. These were the EFP‚ consisting of multinational battalion-sized ground forces based in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland-and stepped-up air policing missions in the same countries plus Romania and Iceland. These missions enhance deterrence, signal alliance solidarity, and provide participants with opportunities to improve their interoperability and other military capabilities.
The rotational nature of national contingent deployments under enhanced air policing missions (since 2014) and EFP (since 2017) present some challenges for data analysis, but we found that, of 21 non-U.S. troop-contributing nations providing some 2,000-5,000 foreign-deployed troops, 11 qualified as major contributors based on troop size deployments (Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom); six relatively smaller contributors barely missed the major contributor size threshold (Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia); and four other token partners have provided fewer than 100 troops at any given time (Albania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, and Slovenia). Although we simultaneously consider the 20,000-to 30,000-strong forward-deployed U.S. footprint deployed under bilateral basing agreements in Europe as part of the coalition effort to deter Russia, we note that the narrower U.S. contribution to EFP and air policing has been one of relative parity, especially compared with most U.S. coalition experiences (Figure 
3
The Global Coalition Against ISIS is the international umbrella for the U.S.-led effort to defeat ISIS. At peak, the coalition encompassed more than 80 members providing some type of support, including 29 countries directly providing ground troops, aircraft, or ships. The coalition's military contributions began with airstrikes in 2014 but quickly expanded to include training and advising local ground forces and providing key enablers, such as intelligence and surface fires. Coalition members worked through Iraqi and Syrian partners rather than engaging in high-risk ground combat. Using available unclassified data, we estimate that the total number of non-U.S. and non-host coalition forces deployed to Iraq and Syria ranged from a low of less than 3,000 in 2014 to upward of about 7,000 by 2018, compared with some 2,000 to 9,000 U.S. boots on the ground throughout these years (Figure 
3
Notably, of the 29 U.S. military partners involved, 16 qualified as major contributors-the most of any case between 1946 and 2018. Of these, seven non-U.S. and non-host countries easily qualified as major contributors based on their ground force contributions (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom); three qualified as "borderline" major contributors based on troop size deployments (Belgium, Denmark, and the Netherlands); and five regional partners qualified as major contributors because of kinetic airstrikes, though they did not deploy ground forces abroad (Bahrain, Jordan, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE). Despite some differences in approach, the coalition generally remained cohesive throughout the military campaign. The notable exception was Turkey, which broke with coalition preferences to invade northern Syria on multiple occasions from 2018 onward.

The next three chapters move into our analysis of the three research questions and sets of hypotheses. Each chapter considers a different question: first, the conditions under which the United States joins coalitions; second, the factors that drive partners to contribute to coalitions; and, finally, the factors that make coalition interventions more or less successful.

In this chapter, we consider our first five hypotheses, specifically assessing when and why the United States chooses to work through coalitions, either by joining them or by forming them. We consider the quantitative and qualitative evidence for each hypothesis, working through all five hypotheses. We focus only on evidence for and against one hypothesis at a time; we do not weigh evidence across hypotheses to determine the most strongly supported explanation. In the summary at the end of the chapter, we provide some assessment of which hypotheses seem to receive the most and the least support. However, there is not one relevant explanation for most findings; rather there are several that combine to produce the results we observe. Our approach allows us to consider a wider set of possible explanations but limits our ability to make assertions about the most-important or primary drivers of coalition interventions.
Table

As a starting point, and before moving into an assessment of hypotheses, we consider trends in U.S. coalition use between 1946 and 2018. There are a few notable observations. First, coalition interventions have most often involved stability operations, COIN, or deterrence. There have also been some coalition humanitarian efforts (but few in response to natural disasters). Although coalition combat missions have not been as common, it is notable that almost all U.S. combat operations that have occurred have involved coalitions. In other words, involvement in combat is rare for U.S. military forces overall-but when it occurs, coalitions are almost always involved. This might be because of the operational demands of such missions or because of the higher legitimacy requirements when combat is involved.   1946 1951 1956 1961 1966 1971  1986 1991 1996  2006 2011  in two main regions (and those of high strategic importance), the Middle East and Europe. Additional coalition engagement has occurred in Central Asia and Central America. In contrast, U.S. unilateral missions in recent years have been primarily in East and Southeast Asia and Central America. During the Cold War, unilateral missions in the Middle East and East and Southeast Asia were also common. In short, as the summary statistics in Figures 4.2 and 4.3 reflect, the activity type and regional "profiles" of U.S. unilateral and coalition operations have differed significantly since World War II.
However, even as the United States has increased its reliance on coalition interventions, it has continued to send the lion's share of troops to most interventions in which it is involved.   1946 1951 1956 1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016                     1946 1951 1956 1961 1966 1971 1976 1981 1986 1991 1996 2001 2006 2011 2016   NOTE: Total coalition interventions: 37.  although coalitions certainly might reduce the burden placed on U.S. forces in many ways, U.S. forces continue to far outnumber partner forces in U.S. coalition operations. This has been true across the period with some small exceptions, including in the mid-1990s driven by operations in the Balkans. More recently, the imbalance has been slightly reduced as the number of U.S. and partner forces involved in coalition operations has declined.
In the next section of this chapter, we explore the reasons why the United States might have increasingly gravitated toward the use of coalitions over time.
To explore the effects of the hypothesized explanatory variables (i.e., hypotheses H1-H5), we construct a logit model where the outcome variable is the coalition indicator, equal to 1 if the intervention is a coalition and 0 if the United States acts unilaterally. The explanatory variables are listed in Table 
3
The first hypothesis is that coalitions are more likely where the operational demands are high, or at least where they are higher than the United States can or wants to carry alone. We find strong support for this explanation across the qualitative and quantitative analysis.
We operationalize operational demands by an indicator that identifies the intervention as one involving kinetic activities-i.e., combat, COIN, or stabilization missions-because such missions tend to have the most-significant operational demands. Our analysis finds significant evidence that coalitions are more likely when the intervention involves kinetic operations. The United States is more than 60 percent more likely to build a coalition when faced with kinetic operations (as opposed to nonkinetic types-e.g., deterrence, humanitarian, security), perhaps due to their greater operational demands. There are many reasons why such missions might be more operationally demanding, both in terms of numbers of forces and resources required, and our results suggest that the United States is more likely to turn to coalitions in these types of situations. It is worth noting that all of the most-sizable U.S. interventions have involved kinetic activity. For example, the United States employs approximately 58,000 troops on average in kinetic operations; nonkinetic interventions require only one-tenth (5,000) on average-which suggests that the kinetic variable is a good proxy of the operational burden that the United States will ultimately face in an impending intervention. Box 4.2 distills the quantitative results from Box 4.1 to the relevant rows. However, there are still limits to what we can say with the analysis presented here. An ideal empirical analysis would uncover the causal relationship between perceived burden and the likelihood that the United States builds a coalition to share the burden. But burden, perceived or actual, is not assigned randomly, and we lack the data and quasi-experimental setting to confidently circumvent the confounding nonrandomness. Instead, we should think of the estimated coefficients as conditional correlations. For instance, we can confidently assert that there is a statistically significant correlation between burden as measured by type of activity and the decision of the United States to build a coalition, even when controlling for intervention region, the degree of threat, or political period.
Turning to the qualitative results, we have clear evidence of the ways in which the United States has used coalitions to spread the operational burdens of warfare, stabilization, and deterrence tasks.
The U.S. rationale behind accepting British support in the postwar occupation of Japan rested on the expectation that additional manpower would be needed. Initially, the United States was hesitant about outside influences in a region it viewed as critical to its future interests. The United States fundamentally sought to be the sole and principal power in Asia, which would be reflected in its policies in the occupation of Japan. Nevertheless, given the initial estimates and expectations of a generational and demanding occupation, the United States reluctantly accepted involvement of the British Commonwealth.

In the instance of the EFP, the United States similarly relied on burden-sharing from NATO allies. In this instance, burden-sharing has been central to U.S. participation as President Donald Trump and his administration made it clear to NATO allies that they expected greater allied participation and contribution and that the United States was not willing to carry all the cost to defend Europe without support. For a NATO mission, this one had extensive and equal burden-sharing. Using data compiled from a variety of sources, we estimate the range of non-U.S. NATO forces deployed annually between 2014 and 2018 to be about 2,000-5,000. If we focus more exclusively on those nations that contributed more than 5 percent of the total force, which works out to about 100 in 2016 and 200 in later years, we end up with a list of 11 countries other than the United States that qualify as major contributors: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Six countries were borderline: the Czech Republic, Croatia, Hungary, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia. A few others appear to have deployed fewer than 100 troops at any given time: Albania, Luxembourg, Montenegro, and Slovenia. Iceland has no military but has regularly contributed a Coast Guard officer or a civilian to support the EFP. The multinational character of these missions makes them less resource intensive for both the United States and its partners, given that all contributing countries are paying for some portion of the overall costs.

Finally, in Afghanistan, burden-sharing after the initial phase of the conflict was over was a way to extend the reach of U.S. forces and reduce the personnel requirements placed on the U.S. military. Initially, despite an outpouring of support, the United States chose not to rely on a large coalition, accepting only small contributions of special forces and over-the-horizon air and naval support from NATO and non-NATO allies. This was largely because of the desire of military leaders to act quickly and to keep a narrow set of objectives. As then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld put it, "The mission's going to determine the coalition. The coalition is not going to determine the mission because it will dumb down everything to the lowest common denominator." 
6
Netherlands had a medium naval force and a medium-large air force. The other major contributors-Georgia, the Netherlands, Poland, Turkey, and Romania-had fewer than 1,000 troops. Turkey, Georgia, and Romania did not contribute air or naval forces, and Poland contributed a medium air force but no naval forces.
NATO partners contributed in substantively significant ways to the U.S. intervention. The coalition divided the security mission geographically, and such NATO partners as Germany, Italy, Spain, and Canada took control of key regions, helping to wrest control away from the Taliban and stabilize the country.

Overall, there is strong support in the quantitative analysis and across the five case studies that a desire for burden-sharing is one of the main reasons that the United States chooses to operate through coalitions. Notably, these coalitions often reflect the balance of capabilities, with the United States shouldering the majority of the burden and partners and allies filling in niche capabilities and logistical support. This does not diminish the importance of those partners or the role of burden-sharing in coalition formation, especially if we expand the aperture to consider interventions that occurred prior to 1946 and those that the United States might face going forward in an era of great-power competition. For example, in both of the World Wars, burden-sharing was essential. There is no way that the United States could have singlehandedly defeated the powerful adversaries in either of those conflicts without support from allies. The Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the allied airlift of Berlin are other examples where U.S. resources were stretched to capacity, and the support and burden-sharing of allies was absolutely required. Thinking to the future, a conflict with a near-peer adversary, such as Russia or China, would also be likely to require support from allies. It is hard 7 Timo Noetzel and Benjamin Schreer, "NATO's Vietnam? Afghanistan and the Future of the Atlantic Alliance," Contemporary Security

The second hypothesis is that the United States is likely to form coalitions not only when operational burden is great but also when geography creates logistical and sustainment challenges that require coalition partners and the resources, forces, and support that they provide. We do not find significant quantitative support for this explanation, but there is some evidence in the case studies that geography can matter in certain circumstances. Still, on net, it is less significant than other factors considered in our analysis.
Box 4.3 distills the quantitative analysis from Box 4.1 to the relevant rows. The model estimates that an additional 1,000 km from the target country increases the likelihood of a coalition by 1.6 percent, but the finding is not statistically significant at traditional levels. The p-value, which indicates the likelihood of observing the coefficient under the assumption that distance has no effect on coalition likelihood, is 0.2, too high for the 0.05 threshold required for statistical significance. Thus, we find no quantitative support for the argument that the distance between the United States and the target is associated with likelihood of coalition formation. This would suggest that, despite the myriad challenges that projecting power and sustaining forces over long distances can create, the United States does not consistently use coalitions to overcome these challenges once we account for other factors. We use the case studies to analyze this relationship in greater depth. 
Although we do find some support for the hypothesis that the United States uses coalitions to overcome the logistical challenges posed by geography, this support is considerably weaker than that for the operational burden argument. Because of the flexibility and reach of the permanent U.S force posture, the U.S. military is often able to secure the operational access it requires without needing would-be basing hosts to formally join a coalition by providing military forces. The United States typically has multiple options for securing basing access, overflight rights, and other lines of communication required to sustain a military deployment-thus allowing U.S. defense planners and policymakers to forgo any potential regional coalition member if the concessions it demands in exchange are too steep. Furthermore, defense planners and policymakers are typically able to use access and overflight permissions to facilitate operations without the direct involvement of military personnel from the granting country (although there are certainly instances in which key coalition partners provide both). In other words, the pursuit of access and basing (although vital to operation success) is largely separate from the decision about whether to operate unilaterally or through a coalition.
To these ends, this factor-overcoming geographical logistics challenges-appears to be a secondary one in the U.S. decisionmaking process, often influencing how a coalition intervention is waged more heavily than whether it should be waged unilaterally or multilaterally in the first place. The coalition-building experience at the start of OEF offers a good example. During the first three months of kinetic operations in one of the most-impermissible environments on earth, logistics challenges caused by geography and long supply chains extending from the United States were largely overcome by heavy reliance on allied naval warships and long-range U.S. Air Force bombers and airlift assets-without having to draw Central Asian regional partners into the small coalition footprint, which then consisted mostly of special operators from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. 11 Because Afghanistan was landlocked-and because its neighbors with seaports (specifically, Pakistan) would not allow U.S. military resupply convoys to cross their country, and railway and highway infrastructure was "almost unusable"-new approaches were required to overcome conventional geographical challenges; consequently, the "salient characteristic of the opening phases of OEF was that it required air power."

In the case of NATO's collective deterrence of Russian aggression along Europe's eastern flank since 2014, there were relatively few geographical and logistics challenges for U.S. policymakers and defense planners to overcome, given preexisting U.S. basing agreements throughout Europe and the robust U.S. air and naval presence in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean. The U.S. crisis response to Russian aggression in Crimea and eastern Ukraine thus began with unilateral efforts hatted under Operation Atlantic Resolve, beginning in March-April 2014. Subsequently, on June 3, President Obama called on Congress to provide up to $1 billion in new funding for the European Reassurance Initiative to bolster U.S. demonstrations of force across Eastern and Central Europe-in Poland, Georgia, Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Germany, and the Black and Baltic Seas.

Finally, we note that the case study of post-World War II stabilization and administration of Japan is an outlier. By the time the postwar occupational force had formed, the tyranny of geography had already been conquered, island by island, over the course of the campaign in the Pacific; the occupation forces faced a permissible entry environment (and essentially no resistance) after Emperor Hirohito's surrender; and U.S. forces in Japan were intent on demobilizing (rather than deploying) quickly as the coalition intervention began in late 1945. Throughout the war effort, the BCOF allies were vital in helping sustain lines of communication, particularly via U.S. outposts in Australia. But in the context of this hypothesis, this case study is not likely generalizable to modern coalition decisionmaking. In 1946, the world was not a globalized place-and the U.S. global footprint was brand new. All else being equal, overcoming logistical challenges imposed by geography was arguably much more difficult than it is today. This factor might have thus been relatively more important (thereby providing more support to the hypothesis at hand) for this case study than for the more-recent ones considered in this report.
In summary, our analysis of the case studies finds nuance in the hypothesis that the United States might choose to form a coalition as a response to logistical challenges caused by geography. Strictly speaking, we did not find compelling evidence to support the "strong version" of this argument. Instead, at least in the recent U.S. experience, it appears that basing access permissions are crucial to begin and/or sustain operations, but key hosts often do not become force-contributing coalition members; thus, this factor weighs little on the U.S. decision to act unilaterally or multilaterally. Moreover, the United States typically has multiple country-location options for gaining the basing access, overflight rights, and lines of communication required to begin or sustain a military deployment (even in the most-impermissible locations on earth, such as Afghanistan), so U.S. defense planners and policymakers have negotiating power if would-be hosts attempt to impose overly steep concessions to help Washington overcome the tyranny of geography.
Our analysis finds limited support for this hypothesis about the role of geography in coalition formation. Specifically, although the United States often needs access permissions, basing, or overflight rights to conduct interventions in distant locations, it can usually achieve this end without building a formal coalition and without host states providing forces. This means that logistical considerations and decisions about whether to form a coalition or proceed unilaterally can and do occur separately. That is not to say that coalitions are irrelevant or that having the direct military support of regional allies does not facilitate U.S. interventions in important ways. These factors do matter, but they appear to be largely secondary to concerns of operational burden and legitimacy. In several of our case studies, it appears that, in pursuing coalitions to meet operational demands, the United States also ends up overcoming logistical challenges caused by distance. Although there are available workarounds that allow U.S. forces to overcome the tyranny of geography even without coalition partners, operational demands have far fewer workarounds. This might explain why operational burden seems to matter more directly for state decisions about coalition formation.
In many situations, we observe the United States forming coalitions even when it could handle the operational demands of an intervention on its own. That it continues to rely on coalitions instead suggests the importance of other factors-such as legitimacy, both domestic and international. In this section, we consider international legitimacy Norms of territorial sovereignty and noninterference in the affairs of other states require that when a state does choose to intervene, it justifies its actions. Building a coalition of states supporting the intervention and its objectives can serve this purpose, signifying that the intervention is approved and backed by the international community as a whole. Our analyses find both quantitative and qualitative support for legitimacy as a motivating factor in U.S. coalition formation.
To operationalize legitimacy, we consider changes over time in support for the norms of multilateralism and the international politics of intervention, both of which have changed significantly over the period since 1945 and especially since the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s. As noted in Chapter Two, Finnemore describes two changes relevant to our analysis: first, a strengthening of the norm of territorial sovereignty that began after World War II and continued to consolidate in the post-Cold War period, and second, the norm of multilateralism and the notion that if states seek to legitimately violate a given nation's sovereignty, they should endeavor to do so as part of a multilateral coalition. 
26
We find strong support for this hypothesis, as shown in Box 4.4 (a distillation of Box 4.1). The results suggest that coalitions have been more frequent in the post-Cold War era. The logit model suggests that the end of the Cold War was associated with a 44.8-percent uptick in the likelihood that the United States would intervene through a coalition. Aside from the clear political and military significance, the estimate is also highly statistically significant (p < 0.01).
Notably, however, we also find that the post-9/11 indicator is statistically significant but negative (-19.0 percent), suggesting that coalitions have become less common since the attacks in 2001. This adds complexity to our understanding of how changing norms have shaped the likelihood of a coalition formation. A closer look at the data suggests that this result reflects the fact that, since 2001, the United States has been involved in a larger number of total interventions; therefore, although it has used coalitions frequently, these coalitions have made up a smaller portion of the total than in the period from 1992 to 2001.
In our five case studies, we see logic of legitimacy play a consistent role in U.S. decisionmaking. Even when the United States chose to go it alone (e.g., for parts of the 
26
27
Although this type of legitimacy is crucial, there is another-perhaps, more important-type of legitimacy that the United States often seeks through coalitions: that provided by regional partners whose membership in the coalition provides a type of support and helps diffuse regional pushback against foreign involvement. Such regional support was essential to the Gulf War and again in the Global Coalition Against ISIS. In the case of the Gulf War, the full support of the host nations (Kuwait and Saudi Arabia) and their Gulf State neighbors, all of which perceived Iraq as an existential threat, gave the United States the needed legitimacy to operate in the region. Without the support of regional partners and the involvement of these partners in the intervention, the United States would have faced not only a considerably greater burden and challenge but also, perhaps, the need to take on Iraq and placate regional players unhappy with the U.S. presence. The legitimacy provided by regional support allowed the United States more flexibility in its actions during the intervention and unified the coalition against Saddam's forces. To some extent, the opposite dynamic played out in Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), where the United States has faced a tougher situation with more-hostile regional competitors. In OIR, the participation of Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Jordan, and other Arab states was important in signaling that the Global Coalition Against ISIS was intervening on behalf of-not at the expense of-regional stakeholders. In addition, Arab and Muslim participation in the coalition contested ISIS's framing of the conflict as a sort of western Crusade against local populations. It also eroded ISIS's ability to maintain a narrative that it was building an authentic "Islamic State."
28
Legitimacy seems to have been a lesser concern during the occupation of Japan. Coming right on the heels of World War II, the international community broadly acknowledged that the victors would occupy the adversary countries and work to support reconstruction. In this way, the operation had an implicit level of legitimacy from the start. The presence of Commonwealth states did not really act to increase the legitimacy of the intervention beyond the legitimacy communicated by the World War II victory. International legitimacy, then, was not irrelevant to this operation, but it was derived from a source other than a coalition.
The quantitative analysis and case studies clearly suggest the relevance of international legitimacy to coalition decisionmaking. Coalition partners can provide broad international legitimacy, but-even more importantly-in many instances, they also can provide regional legitimacy that reduces the risk of pushback and undermines the foreigninvader narrative often put forward by adversaries. Furthermore, beyond the qualitative evidence provided in the case studies and the academic literature for the role of coalitions for providing legitimacy for U.S.-led military coalitions (especially post-Cold War UN and NATO operations), we anecdotally note at least three particularly politically sensitive instances from the broader U.S. Cold War experience in which this dynamic was at play: the small Organization of American States (OAS) Inter-American Peace Force following the U.S. invasion of the Dominican Republic in 1965, the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) Caribbean Peace Force following the U.S. invasion of Grenada, and the MFO established in the Sinai in 1982 after peace agreements between Egypt and Israel. In each of these situations, the United States could easily have handled the operational burdens unilaterally (and in the first two instances, the initial U.S. entry force essentially worked independently), but working through coalitions provided legitimacy to mitigate the optics of the U.S. hegemon intervening in the domestic affairs of its hemispheric neighbors or the Arab-Israeli powder keg.
Notably, our results also underscore that there are instances in which the United States is willing to forgo the legitimacy a coalition provides, such as when the threat is so high (and concurrent operational demands relatively low) that it necessitates immediate unilateral action (e.g., the Lebanon Crisis of 1958, the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962, the U.S. invasion of Panama in 1988, kinetic U.S. air and naval maneuvers against Libya in the Gulf of Sidra in the 1980s, U.S. airstrikes against Bin Laden training camps in 1998, and U.S. airstrikes against ISIS in Libya beginning in 2016). Another example would be situations in which the United States was able to derive legitimacy or international approval for its action on some other basis-specifically, permissive operating environments from the host nation to conduct major humanitarian/disaster relief missions (especially post-Cold War), bilateral train-and-assist missions (both during and after the Cold War and post-9/11), and long-term deterrence missions (especially during Cold War). 
29
Our analysis suggests fairly clearly that the United States frequently uses coalitions to build the international legitimacy and the regional support required to execute military interventions. Concerns about legitimacy have been especially important since the end of the Cold War, following the general shift in international norms, and building the necessary legitimacy has become a key part of preparing for military interventions. Notably, not all states are created equal in the quest for international legitimacy. Regional partners and nontraditional U.S. partners might send especially important signals to the international community about support for a given operation and, as a result, might provide the United States with more flexibility of action during the intervention. But it is also worth noting that although having some sort of international legitimacy does seem to be a requirement in many instances, coalitions are only one path to legitimacy. UN approval (without a coalition) might be an alternative. In addition, states responding to direct threats to their homeland might be given more room for unilateral action (as was the case after 9/11), with self-defense serving to build international acceptance even in the absence of a coalition.
Although international legitimacy seems to be a significant driver behind U.S. decisions to form coalitions, domestic political considerations might be another. Specifically, states might use coalitions to build domestic support for an intervention, among both an unwilling populace and other political elites. The rationale is that having backing from the international community can help win over domestic support for a military operation not only because it signals international approval for the operation but also often because of the burden-sharing it implies. This is, however, a difficult hypothesis to evaluate qualitatively. First, it assumes that the public pays sufficient attention to intervention choices to be swayed by the existence (or lack) of a coalition. Second, it assumes that the attitudes of Congress or the general public could be swayed by whether the intervention is multilateral. Third, it assumes that policymakers consider the attitudes of constituents when making decisions about foreign policy (particularly decisions about how to conduct an intervention) and fails to account for the fact that there are types of military activity and inter-ventions that do not require direct congressional approval, allowing a commander in chief to respond without explicit congressional approval. Overall, we find mixed support for the domestic politics hypothesis. There is no evidence of a systematic relationship between domestic political factors and intervention decisions, but we find some limited evidence that these factors matter in our case studies.
To assess the role of domestic politics, we considered two proxy variables: presidential approval rating and number of years to the next presidential election. We suggest that if domestic politics is a factor that drives coalition decisions, then it should matter most when presidential elections are approaching and when presidential approval is low. Of course, the president is not the sole decisionmaker on whether and how the United States intervenes in a military conflict. Military leaders might have influence and Congress ultimately authorizes the major military operations (and the funding of them). Still, an intervention is unlikely to move forward without presidential support, and the president also has an important role to play in building and working through coalitions.
Box 4.5 distills the quantitative analysis from Box 4.1 to the relevant rows. We find no support from this analysis for an argument that domestic legitimacy, at least as measured by our proxy variables, plays a significant role in intervention decisions across situations. This does not mean that domestic legitimacy is irrelevant but does suggest that it does not have the same broad importance as international legitimacy does in decisions about when to form coalitions.
Our qualitative analysis finds some evidence that domestic politics is relevant to coalition decisions but suggests that its relevance is inconsistent and that it matters less than other factors, specifically the pursuit of international legitimacy and considerations of operational burden.
Evidence of the role played by domestic politics and legitimacy is strongest in the case of the Gulf War, in which the formation of a coalition and the approval of the UN were essential to winning the domestic support required for the intervention, both among the U.S. general public and in Congress. Initially, public support for an intervention in Kuwait was low. There was little sense of urgency or sense that U.S. interests were under significant or direct threat. Then-President George H. W. Bush's appeal to the general public and to political elites underscored the strategic importance of the intervention as a defense of international norms and the economic significance of the region. He positioned the United States as a member of a "new partnership of nations" united against the threat posed by Saddam and working toward a new post-Cold War world order. "The crisis in the Persian Gulf," Bush noted, "as grave as it is, also offers a rare opportunity to move toward an historic period of cooperation."

Evidence that domestic political factors mattered to coalition formation are significantly weaker in each of the other three instances. As noted elsewhere, the initial intervention into Afghanistan was conducted with only minimal support from NATO allies and Afghan partners. In part, this decision was possible because the intervention had such widespread domestic and international support in the wake of the September 11 attack. Widespread support for the mission in Afghanistan persisted long after this initial phase-through the beginning of the Obama administration, and even after support for the intervention in Iraq had begun to wane-because of a general public perception of a continued threat of international terrorism emanating from that region. President George W. Bush's approval rating also shot up, from just over 50 percent on the morning of September 11, 2001, to almost 90 percent on the eve of war in October, and this provided further flexibility for policymakers in those early months. The second, stabilization phase of the intervention did rely heavily on a coalition, but it is by no means clear that this was done primarily for domestic audiences and approval. Policymakers might have hoped that coalition support would cast the intervention in a favorable light at home or reduce concerns about the burden of the election, but, in reality, popular U.S. support for the operation in Afghanistan have remained relatively high (i.e., over 50 percent) ever since its initiation, thus creating few electoral problems for members of Congress (unlike the Iraq War). Furthermore, the United States bore the majority of the costs and burden, so it is not clear that the coalition did much to reduce any concerns that did exist. Domestic politics also does not seem to have been a major factor in coalition decisions surrounding the EFP deployment. First, the intervention was small overall, just a supplement in many ways to the existing U.S. presence in Europe. Second, this was not an intervention that captured domestic public opinion or interest. It involved little to no risk to U.S. forces, and the invasion of Crimea and "little green men" in Donbas did little to capture public attention in the way that more-dramatic attacks on U.S. civilians or property tend to do. In this context, it is hard to imagine attitudes of the general public factoring into the decision about how to conduct the EFP deployment. Moreover, the EFP operation was imagined from the start as a joint operation. In other words, it was intended to be a signal of NATO resolve; as a result, it required a multilateral presence regardless of public attitudes. On the other hand, the coalition nature of the intervention might have appealed to one domestic audience-specifically, the audience concerned that European partners were not carrying their weight in the NATO alliance-by providing an instance of NATO partners doing just that. Still, even with this possible exception, it seems hard to argue that domestic considerations played a major role in the decision to use a coalition in this instance.
Finally, there is little evidence that the decision to involve British partners in the occupation of Japan in World War II was based on concerns of domestic support. As noted elsewhere, in the aftermath of World War II and the defeat of Japan, the postwar occupation seemed necessary and important and it seems likely that the U.S. public would have supported this operation regardless of whether British partners were involved. As revealed by our review of the State Department Office of the Historian's primary source document collection on the early months of the "Occupation and Control of Japan," 34 the coalition-building process unfolded by diplomatic correspondence that sometimes went weeks without replies and was seemingly conducted outside public view. The surviving documents contained in the Foreign Relations of the United States primary source detail at length the negotiations that unfolded between the key allied stakeholders-specifically, the United States, British Commonwealth (including, for example, Australia and New Zealand), Soviet Union, and China-as they debated policies between September and December 1945 for establishing "control machinery for Japan"; however, in none of these hundreds of documents do the principals on either side of the Pacific make direct reference to public opinion generally-let alone winning greater support and political capital for the occupation via acting collectively. Instead, the initial plan for the occupation of Japan was evidently designed with two primary, opposing concerns in mind: the need to demobilize as many troops as quickly as possible while simultaneously maintaining a large enough force to "exercise the controlling voice in the occupation authority in Japan" over the United Kingdom, China, and the Soviet Union, which the State-War-Navy Coordinating Committee had decided shared "a responsibility with the United States in the occupation and military control of Japan and the obligation to assume a share in the burden thereof."
35
Overall, then, our case studies suggest instances in which domestic political considerations (either of Congress or of the general public) played a role in the U.S. decision to pursue a multilateral intervention but also seem to suggest that a focus on domestic politics usually comes in second to other considerations-and even then, only in certain contexts. Specifically, coalitions might be more powerful as domestic signals when the President has weak approval ratings and fears that unpopular military action could do further damage, when the public has strong and skeptical views of an intervention (particularly its necessity, benefits compared with costs, and legitimacy), and when public concerns are reduced by the presence of a multinational coalition as opposed to a unilateral intervention.
Our analysis suggests limited support for this hypothesis about the role of domestic politics in shaping U.S. coalition formation decisions. The quantitative analysis finds no evidence that domestic political conditions are associated with coalition decisions and our case studies find that although domestic legitimacy and support do influence policymaker decisions in some situations, they appear to be secondary or mostly irrelevant in others. Coalitions can be a way for policymakers to reduce the concerns of a hesitant population over cost, risk, and legitimacy and can help a President or military leadership to win political backing from political elites with similar concerns. However, our analysis suggests that domestic considerations matter largely on the margins. This could be because the public is largely uninformed about international affairs and has weak preferences on most foreign policy issues. It could also reflect the fact that domestic support for interventions and military action has been shown to be most closely tied to the goal at hand. 
36
Finally, we consider whether the degree of threat implied to U.S. interests is a relevant factor to decisions about coalition formation. Specifically, some past research has suggested that although international and domestic legitimacy are important, the United States has been willing to act unilaterally when faced with a severe threat, assuming that it can resource the operational demands on its own. By this argument, the United States should also be less likely to use coalitions when the degree of threat implied by the intervention is high or when there is a direct threat to U.S. national security.
To explore the extent to which the degree of threat influences coalition formation, we use the number of territorial claims in which the target state of the intervention is the challenger as a reasonable proxy of the threat posed (in general, to the risk of conflict and instability) by a specific crisis or conflict. 
37
37
Our case studies offer only mixed support for an argument that the United States is more likely to use unilateral action in the face of significant threat, and they provide clear reminders of the ways in which operational burden or expected operational burden might force the United States to rely on coalitions even when it might otherwise prefer to act alone. In two of our case studies, the immediate threat to U.S. interests appeared reasonably low. Thus, it is not surprising that the United States chose to rely on coalitions for these operations. First, the EFP deployment was intended to deter Russia, but expert consensus put a Russian invasion of the Baltics as a relatively low probability event, making the overall threat low. Had the threat been high, it is likely that the United States still would have turned to a coalition, given the size of the expected operational burden that would be required to counter Russian aggression. The postwar occupation of Japan was also a relatively low-threat environment, albeit one with reasonably high stakes. As noted previously, the U.S. decision to rely on a coalition in this case was almost entirely based on the operational burden and the desire to bring U.S. forces home.
In our other three case studies, the threat to U.S. interests was moderate to high, but in only one instance did the United States intervene alone or mostly alone. In the case of the Gulf War, the threat to U.S. national security was not direct or immediate, but the threat to economic interests and security was significant. The United States might have preferred to act alone, all else being equal, but it had two concerns in this case: legitimacy in the eyes of regional powers and operational burden. 
38
In Afghanistan, the threat to U.S. interests initially seemed high in the aftermath of 9/11 and the intense fear of another attack on U.S. soil, and the United States initially declined most coalition support in favor of a rapid response. But political and military leaders later found it necessary to turn to allies and partners to continue the intervention in its second, stabilization phase. This, perhaps, is the case that offers the most support for the hypothesis that the United States will choose coalitions only when the time horizon is long and the threat low. It does seem to have been the severity of the threat and the need for an immediate and forceful response that drove the United States away from the use of a coalition in the early months, despite the existence of widespread international support. 
39
Finally, the case of OIR offers limited support for the hypothesis in question. The threat to the United States was moderate and the operational demands relatively low. From the perspective of our original hypothesis, the use of a coalition in this case would seem logical. However, there is evidence, first, that the United States was willing to take some action unilaterally. For instance, as President Obama announced on September 10, 2014, that the United States would begin airstrikes against ISIS targets in Syria and that nearly 500 U.S. military advisers would return to Iraq, the regional coalition had not yet coalesced. 
40
We can further investigate the link between degree of threat and U.S. response by considering the instances in our data with the most-severe and direct threats to national security. We already discussed the largely unilateral response to 9/11, perhaps the most immediate threat to U.S. national security since the end of the Cold War. The United States similarly acted unilaterally during the Cuban Missile Crisis, a period when the threat was perceived to be existential in nature. Accounts of the crisis focus on U.S. decisionmaking and do not mention efforts to build a broader coalition before responding to the pressing and real threat. The United States also acted unilaterally in the late 1980s in Panama. Although the extent of the threat to national security here is debatable, the economic threat presented by the potential loss of access to the Panama Canal and threats to U.S. property and individuals was significant. Finally, the United States has always acted quickly and unilaterally to protect U.S. citizens and respond to attacks made on U.S. citizens abroad. A clear example would be the response to the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which featured unilateral airstrikes on al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and Sudan. In each of these situations, however, the United States did not need significant international assistance, either to resource the operational demands or to win domestic or international legitimacy.
We can gain additional insights if we consider the full set of U.S. interventions since the end of World War II. First, the United States was consistently willing to use force unilaterally during the Cold War, when it intervened to prevent the spread of communism. This was especially true in Central and South America, which the United States has traditionally considered its "back yard," a region where it can intervene without worrying about legitimacy. Its initial intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965, for example, occurred with no coordination with the OAS and reflected President Lyndon Johnson's imminent concern-based on faulty CIA intelligence estimates-that he would "wake up . . . and find out Castro's in charge" of the country. 
42
However, the United States did use coalitions in the Cold War, and these coalitions can provide additional insights into how the United States has historically behaved when considering interventions in the face of a severe threat. If we consider situations in which the United States did use coalitions during the Cold War, we can divide them into two main groups. First, there are situations in which the threat was moderate to high, and extreme operational demands required burden-sharing coalitions: the allied airlift of Berlin, the Korean War and its aftermath, and the Vietnam War. In these instances, the perceived threat was high, and, although the United States might have been willing to intervene unilaterally, it required coalition support given the extreme operational demands and geographic location. The second set of Cold War situations consists of those in which the operational requirements appear lower but the United States had some interest (with lower stakes) and other states were willing to intervene or even take the lead. Examples are U.S. support to UN missions in Congo-Leopoldville in the early 1960s, the multinational intervention in Lebanon in 1984, and the international naval coalition to protect global commerce and trade during the Tanker War and Iran-Iraq War in the mid-1980s.
Overall, our qualitative assessment offers mixed support for an argument that the United States tends to act unilaterally in situations of severe national security threat and rely on coalitions when the threat is low and the time horizon long. Specifically, when the threat to national security is high, the United States prefers to act unilaterally if the United States can reasonably shoulder the operational demands and does not need international or domestic approval to execute the intervention. But if the operational demands exceed what the United States is willing (or able) to commit, or if legitimacy requires partners, the United States does seem to seek partners even in situations of high threat (e.g., World Wars). These caveats severely constrain what the United States is able to do unilaterally, even in situations in which the threat to national security is high. It is possible that there is some ratio between degree of threat and the threshold above which policymakers seek coalition support; a higher threat might have a higher threshold. This would be consistent with Kreps's argument about burden-sharing and time horizons. 
43
Overall, our analysis suggests mixed evidence for the hypothesis that the United States is most likely to use coalitions in lower-threat contexts where the time horizon is long and the urgency low. Our quantitative analysis finds a negative relationship between threat and coalition likelihood, but this relationship is statistically significant in only some specifications. Our case studies and a broader review of material in our dataset suggest that when the threat is severe and the United States wants an immediate response, it does often lean toward unilateral action, especially when the threat is directly aimed at the U.S. homeland. However, when the threat is high and the operational demands are significant, the United States has worked through coalitions out of necessity. A high degree of threat might, then, partially counterbalance the push to form a coalition, especially for situations in which the operational burden is low. However, if the operational burden is high, forming a coalition might be necessary even if the United States would prefer to act on its own. This is an important observation as we look toward a future in which the United States faces the risk of conflict with near-choices. The United States often needs to negotiate access and other permissions, but the countries that grant these permissions do not necessarily need to also provide troops and join the coalition. Similarly, there is mixed support for arguments that coalition decisions are consistently guided by domestic political considerations. We are unable to detect any quantitative relationship between U.S. domestic politics and U.S. decisions to use coalitions for military interventions. However, our case studies suggest ways that domestic politics do matter, specifically in helping to overcome domestic opposition. It seems that coalitions can be effective signals to domestic audiences because they imply burdensharing and international legitimacy, two other key drivers of U.S. coalition formation. In other words, domestic political considerations might be important, but in an indirect way that is secondary to international legitimacy and burden-sharing.
Finally, we find that although the degree of threat is relevant to U.S. decisions to form coalitions, even when the United States would like to intervene unilaterally, it is often constrained by operational demands and considerations of international legitimacy. Thus, although the United States might always prefer to respond to a severe, existential threat with a unilateral action, the reality of an intervention and its requirements in terms of resources and international or regional support are the deciding factors in whether such an approach is possible or strategically desirable.
There is no guarantee that historical patterns will guide future behavior, but policymakers can learn from past experience that underscores the value of operating with allies and partners, especially when those allies and partners are regional members that can provide access; logistical support; and defense from local, international, or U.S. domestic backlash. It is also instructive that, for all the discussion about burdensharing and its centrality to coalition formation, contributions from partners are often small compared with the total force and U.S. contributions. Efforts to increase partner contributions might be required if future threats from more-powerful adversaries emerge and if the risk for major-power war increases into the future. Diversifying coalitions to involve non-NATO partners as major contributors could be another way to bolster the support received from partners and to expand the scope of international legitimacy, but, to the extent that an increasing threat will require large operational contributions, the United States must also focus on building relationships with militarily capable allies and further bolstering the capabilities of existing partners. It will not be enough to modernize only U.S. capabilities. Instead, the United States will need to also help allies, partners, and potential partners build their military capabilities so that these partners can serve as supplements for U.S. forces in the event of major contingencies for which partner support is required. In the next chapter, we consider factors that seem likely to shape partner nation decisions to join coalitions.
The second question we explored is why partner states might choose to join a U.S. coalition. This is a hugely important question: The United States faces challenges from majorpower allies and must consider which partners are most likely to join future coalition operations. In this chapter, we consider evidence for and against each of the five hypotheses about coalition formation outlined in Chapter Two. We consider the evidence for and against each of these hypotheses separately; then, in the chapter summary, we consider how these different factors (and others not considered directly but found to be relevant in the broader literature) might interact to shape state choices about when to join (or not join) a coalition. Importantly, we do not find that any one explanation provides a total answer, and we refrain from ranking factors based on importance because our analysis suggests that the decision to join a coalition is one that varies across interventions for a single state and across states for a given intervention. Instead, we consider how different factors matter, when they might be most relevant, and for which states. Table

Again, it is useful to start with some descriptive statistics that provide a broad overview of partner participation in U.S. coalition interventions between 1946 and 2018. Figures 5.1 and 5.2 offer a snapshot of coalition size for both major contributors (or major partners) and total partners. There is significantly more variation when considering numbers of minor partners (Figure 
5
5
Although the figures do show some variation in coalition size, our analysis suggests commonality across interventions in terms of partner structures for both large and small coalitions. For most coalitions, two to four countries (excluding the United States and the host) provide about 50 percent of all coalition forces' troops, the next four to eight might provide another third, and then all other minor contributions make up the remainder. Most of the true burden-sharing occurs among a smaller group of core countries. Additional partners might add legitimacy but not play a major role in sharing operational demands.
We do observe some variation in coalition size by activity type. Table

In this section, we review our qualitative and quantitative analyses of factors that affect the likelihood of countries joining U.S. coalitions. For the quantitative analysis, we estimate our results using all states as potential coalition partners; in Appendix C, for additional robustness, we restrict the pool to states that satisfy various criteria (i.e., excluding adversaries and other such states that are unlikely to ever join a U.S. coalition). We have already defined those criteria and described why we made this choice (see Chapter Three). Although we focus our discussion on the results from models including all countries in the potential partner pool, the results are substantively similar for a more limited case universe. We show the full results in Table 
5
In our models, we proxy for ties to the United States in three ways. The three measures assess the U.S. relationship with the would-be contributor, but each captures a different aspect of this relationship. First, we provide a variable for whether the United States has an alliance with the potential contributor as a measure of political and military ties. Second, we consider the percentage of the state's population that is English-speaking, which proxies for cultural similarities between the United States and the potential contributor. Last, we measure economic ties by considering the lagged total trade between the United States and the potential contributor.
We find quantitative evidence that the political, cultural, and economic closeness between the United States and a potential contributor plays a significant role in shaping the willingness of states to join U.S. coalitions. Table 
5
5
First, consider the estimated effect of the U.S. alliance indicator, which captures political and military ties, in the multinomial logit model, where results are presented in the second two columns. In the multinomial logistic regression, we estimate how each independent variable affects each possible outcome (i.e., minor partner and major partner) separately. Our empirical model predicts that preexisting alliances slightly increase the probability that a country will join a coalition as either a minor contributor (+1.3 percent) or major one (+2.0 percent); the latter estimate is statistically significant at the 1-percent level. Estimation of the effect in the logit model-found in column 4 of Table 
5
Next, we consider the effect of economic ties on the probability of coalition participation, measured by the logged sum of imports and exports between the United States and the potential coalition partner in the year preceding the intervention. The results again provide support for the hypothesis. Estimates from the multinomial logit model predicts that a 1-percent increase in trade between a country and the United States increases the probability of the state joining as a major contributor (0.9 percent) but not as a minor one (0.2 percent). The logit model estimates the effect of the independent variables on the likelihood of coalition participation in any capacity. The estimates suggest that trade entices potential partners to join a coalition and predict that a 1-percent increase in lagged trade with the United States leads to a 1.3-percent increase in the likelihood that a potential partner joins the coalition. Overall, we can say that trade does seem to increase the likelihood of coalition membership, but this relationship is weaker and less robust than the one between political ties and military contribution to U.S.-led coalitions. Last, we consider the effect of cultural ties, looking at how the likelihood of joining a coalition varies depending on the share of the population that speaks English. In the multinomial logit model, we find no evidence that the size of the English-speaking population has an effect (17 percent) on the likelihood of a state joining as a minor partner relative to the base outcome of abstention. However, we observe a statistically significant and positive effect of cultural ties on the likelihood of a state joining a coalition as a major contributor. If the share of English speakers in a state increases by 1 percent, the model predicts that the state is 2.1 percent more likely to contribute as a major coalition partner. Next, we assess the effect of cultural ties on the binary outcome variable in the logit and linear probability models. In the logistic regression, we continue to observe strongly significant estimates. A 1-percent increase in the share of a country's English-speaking populace increases the likelihood that the state joins the coalition in any capacity by 4.6 percent. These findings indicate a strong relation- ship between cultural ties and the likelihood of coalition participation. In our data, language does not vary over time. Language, like all other time invariant observed and unobserved characteristics, are effectively removed when we use the state-level fixedeffects model. In other words, we cannot compare state X having a high number of English speakers with state X having a low number of English speakers because, in our data, the percentage of English speakers is fixed over time. Cultural similarities greatly increase the likelihood of participation. The effect of cultural ties seems to drive attraction of major partners exclusively; we find no evidence that that cultural ties entice states to join as minor partners.
The expectation that states with closer ties to the United States will be more likely to join coalitions is also largely supported by our case study analysis. But our case studies also underscore that, although relationships with the United States can play a role in coalition formation, states often join coalitions without such ties. We find that NATO members and other close U.S. allies are consistently major contributors to the five coalitions that we considered and that ties with the United States clearly play a role in coalition formation for these states, but we also observed many states without traditionally close ties to the United States that have been willing to join U.S. coalitions for reasons ranging from security to side payments. In some instances in our five case studies, we observed countries that joined coalitions and contributed forces as part of an effort to improve their ties with the United States or to build political capital. This is true not only of nontraditional partners but even for some close U.S. allies. Finally, a relationship with the United States clearly does matter for those deciding not to join a coalition. In Afghanistan, for example, the major contributors were largely (1) NATO allies with close trade, security, and political ties to the United States and (2) aspiring NATO members, such as Romania and Georgia, that used the intervention as a way to "audition" or demonstrate commitment to the alliance. These countries contributed out of obligation under NATO Article 5 but also to demonstrate visibly their support of the United States and to build political capital for the future. Notably, they made contributions despite having almost nothing at stake in terms of their own direct national security interests vis-à-vis the designs of Osama bin Laden. This lack of investment in the outcome seems to have affected the extent of member states' contributions but not their willingness to participate. This willingness was very much conditioned on their ties to the United States and what was required to maintain those ties over the longer term. As Mattelaer has explained, "Europeans, at least by their own calculations, have hardly anything at stake in Afghanistan, apart from providing the minimum required to satisfy American expectations." 1 Relationship with the United States can also explain who did not join the coalition. Major U.S. adversaries, such as Russia and China, have been active in Afghanistan but did not join the U.S. coalition. Neither did such countries as Pakistan and India, although they did support U.S. efforts in more-symbolic ways. This is an important reminder that, although coalition membership itself might be more common for close U.S. security and trade partners, the United States often receives other types of support from noncoalition members that share U.S. objectives but cannot officially join a coalition for political or other reasons.
The Global Coalition Against ISIS features some examples in which the relationship with the United States mattered and others in which it did not. Although the coalition had 81 members and 29 troop-contributing partners, the largest contributors and the ones that made the biggest substantive contribution to the capabilities of the coalition were once again U.S. NATO partners and such countries as Saudi Arabia, another close U.S. strategic partner. Most members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development participated in the coalition in some way, and many of the non-NATO contributors were significant U.S. trade partners. Not all members had strong ties, past coalition experience, or formal alliances with the United States. Of these nontraditional partners, some (such as Morocco and the UAE) acted mainly to advance their own security, providing smaller contributions, and others provided only support to airstrikes. 2 Once again, countries that were ostensibly also fighting ISIS in Syria, such as Iran and Russia, did not join the coalition, although they were operating in the same theater with supposedly overlapping objectives. Thus, antagonistic political relationships often seem to be enough to thwart the formation of a coalition, even when objectives and goals overlap.
Similarly, relationships with the United States mattered in important ways in the coalition formed to fight the Gulf War but cannot explain all coalition member decisions. U.S. allies were motivated by a loyalty to the United States and/or the fear that inaction would result in military or economic abandonment by the United States. The United Kingdom, for example, had strong diplomatic and intelligence ties to the United States but also relied on it to maintain international security. Its desire to protect this relationship made it the second largest contributor to the effort.

On net, then, relationship with the United States does appear to play a significant role in the willingness of countries to contribute forces to U.S. coalitions. Alliances and economic and political ties to the United States were frequently cited across situations as reasons that the coalition members chose to participate. Of course, close U.S. partners often forgo participation in U.S. coalitions (e.g., occupation of Iraq), and large U.S. coalitions have consistently involved nontraditional members and nonpartners that join for a host of other reasons, such as influence and security. Thus, a country's preexisting relationship with the United States is not the only reason that states join, and the lack of close ties does not seem to be a deal-breaker in many contexts.
Our qualitative and quantitative results suggest that states with closer ties to the United States-whether military, political, economic, or cultural-do seem more likely to join U.S. coalitions. This result is supported by our quantitative analysis with the relationship being largest in substantive terms for alliances and cultural ties but weaker for economic ties. Our research confirms that a state's relationship with the United States often drives it to join the coalition-either because of a perceived obligation or a desire to maintain the relationship, protect economic benefits, or earn political capital or favor. Our case studies also underscore that the absence of a relationship with the United States does not prevent a state from joining a coalition. In each intervention we considered, there were "nontraditional" partners that joined because of the region, a shared goal, or a shared adversary. In addition, our research suggests that having a close relationship with the United States does not guarantee a state will join the coalition.
There are frequent situations in which states opt out of coalition membership because they do not support the cause or they have other priorities.
Furthermore, expanding the aperture of qualitative evidence beyond our five case studies, we note by way of simple descriptive data that relationships with the United States might be a strong predictor of major contributors; as summarized in Box 5.1, 74 different countries qualified as major contributors in at least one of the 37 U.S. coalitions conducted between 1946 and 2018 (including troop-contributing host nations when applicable). Not surprisingly, the list of the top ten most-frequent major contributors to U.S. coalitions is rounded out by NATO states, led by the United Kingdom and France (23 U.S. coalitions each); what is perhaps more interesting is the diversity of regional powers in the Asia-Pacific and in the Middle East and North Africa that have qualified as major contributors between four to eight different times. Looking to the future, the finding that states with close ties to the United States are more likely to join coalitions has significant implications for planning and preparation for possible future conflicts. In the case of Russia, the United States already has a strong base of potential partners, including NATO allies and others, that have close ties and willingness to join military operations when required (though this willingness should not be taken for granted or assumed). The Pacific, however, is a tougher situation. Although the United States has several key allies, it has only lukewarm political and military ties with most states in the region (e.g., Vietnam, Philippines), more-limited economic ties, and weak cultural ties. This poses potential challenges to the United States when it comes to forming effective coalitions able to counter major adversaries, such as China. (To those ends, we again note the most-frequent major Asia-Pacific contributors identified in Table 
5
A related question that we do not directly consider here-but that is highly relevant to a discussion about partnerships and future conflict-is whether states that have close ties with both the United States and its adversaries are more or less likely to join U.S.-led coalition operations. In other words, are there situations in which close U.S. allies do not contribute because of competing alliances or relationships? This is a relevant question for policymakers thinking about a potential conflict in Asia, where possible U.S. security partners also have relationships with China. Is it enough to build close ties with a potential partner or is undermining their ties to adversaries also required? The example of France in the Gulf War is instructive. France was a traditional ally of the United States, permanent member of the UNSC, and one of the first 12 NATO states. France contributed significant resources to the U.S. coalition. However, the French military maintained separate objectives and command structures from the United States-making sure to publicly express this divergence throughout the conflict. This is because France wanted to protect its ties with Arab and North African partners, which were concerned that the United States wanted to occupy the Middle East. However, the UNSC formally rejected France's limited participation as "appeasement."

Our next hypothesis considers the effect of geography, positing that states are more likely to join coalitions when the conflict takes place in their home region. Results from the quantitative analysis, shown in Table 
5

Although the findings illustrate that the U.S. military is wise to search for regional partners when building a coalition, we know little about where the home region effect is strongest. To investigate this issue, we constructed an additional model specification in which the general home region indicator is replaced by a set of indicators for specific home regions (e.g., European, Central American). All other model components remain the same. We expect the specific home region indicators to be positive across the board because we have evidence that the aggregate home region effect is positive. Table 
5
We observe particularly strong home region effects in Europe, the Middle East, and West Africa. The estimated coefficient for the West African home region effect is large, but there are fewer situations in which an intervention takes place in West Africa and West African states are potential allies (15) than there are involving Europe and European allies (268) or the Middle East and Middle Eastern potential contributors (178). If a coalition intervention develops in Europe, European states are 13.2 percent more likely to join as minor partners and 28.6 percent more likely to join as major partners. In the logit model, the estimated effect is 42.1 percentage points. In the Middle East, the home region effect marginally decreases the likelihood of coalition participation as minor partners (-3.0 percent) but substantially increases the likelihood of joining the coalition as a major partner (11.4 percent). The estimated aggregate effect is positive and statistically significant in the logit (7.4 percent) model as well.
The qualitative analysis also provides strong evidence that the region of the intervention matters for state decisions about joining coalitions. Accounts of the Gulf War and the coalition that conducted it consistently note that, for the regional partners (Middle East, North Africa), membership in the coalition was driven by the clear and immediate threat posed by Saddam's violation of sovereignty as state leaders feared they would become the Iraqi military's next target. Had the intervention occurred in another region, many of these local partners might not have been willing to contribute forces or other resources to the coalition effort. 9 Furthermore, the contributions of regional partners were sizable. Based on our data, the United Kingdom and Egypt contributed the largest numbers of forces (other than the United States) at 35,000 each, followed by Saudi Arabia with 20,000-40,000, Syria with 20,000, France with 15,000-20,000, and Kuwait with 10,500-14,000. In other words, regional partners were major contributors to this intervention. This level of regional commitment is indicative of the significance of the perceived threat and those partners' willingness to take an active role in their defense. Membership of the Global Coalition Against ISIS provides further support for the argument that region matters to participation. In this case, participation of regional partners reflected the proximate and immediate security threat unfolding in their region and a response to the threat it posed to their security. Jordan, for example, which shares Iraq's western border, was particularly exposed. Likewise, Saudi Arabia (which shares the longest border of all of Iraq's neighbors and is believed to have been the home of the largest number of foreign fighters involved in Syria and Iraq after Russia and Tunisia) was also under direct threat from ISIS.

The EFP deployment was a NATO operation aimed to specifically protect Europe (especially the Baltics) and participation reflects this focus, with the United States providing fewer forces and allowing European allies to provide the bulk of both military forces and resources. (Canada was the only other non-NATO contributor.) Although NATO missions typically have robust participation from member countries, the fact that this mission was to defend Europe-i.e., members' own territory-increased members' willingness (and feeling of obligation) to join. Participation in the coalition has been diverse and inclusive; most NATO allies provided at least some direct military support. 
13
14
Our qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest fairly unambiguously that states are more likely to join a coalition when the intervention is occurring in their own region. Beyond the key case studies examined, we find additional qualitative evidence in a diverse set of U.S. Cold War and post-Cold War cases. For instance, major contributors to combat and stability operations in Korea (1950-1957) and in Vietnam  (1960-1975) were almost entirely from the Asia-Pacific region (e.g., Australia, New Zealand, India, Laos, Philippines, Thailand). Likewise, coalition stability interventions in Congo-Leopoldville, the Dominican Republic, and Grenada during the Cold War were dominated by regional peacekeepers; those in the Balkans in the post-Cold War period were disproportionately supported by European forces. (Of course, we also recognize a handful of prominent post-Cold War coalition stability operations-such as in Somalia, Rwanda, Haiti, and Liberia-in which few, if any, local states qualified as major contributors.)
There appear to be several reasons for these findings. First, nations are more likely to perceive a meaningful national security threat and to want to participate in the response. Second, they might simply feel more obligation to join when the intervention occurs in their backyard. Third, they might be largely motivated by an opportunity to gain access to incentives, aid, or other benefits. Finally, they might join to ensure that they have a say in the intervention processes and policies and to prevent external domination of the neighborhood. This can explain how the United States was able to build such a diverse coalition during the Gulf War and the Global Coalition Against ISIS and would be relevant to any sort of conflict or coalition that occurred in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command area of responsibility. It is possible that if a major security threat to national stability or sovereignty were to emerge in the region, states would be more willing to partner with the United States, both to control any outcome and to have a say in postconflict policy choices.
Our third hypothesis focuses on shared interests and the role they play in state decisions to join coalition interventions. First, it is worth being explicit in what we mean by this term in this context. Shared interests could be mutual goals or a common threat-in essence, a shared focal point that can tie coalition members together, giving them a common frame of reference. There are at least two possible hypotheses. States might join coalitions when they have different interests and objectives than the leader, viewing joining as a way to influence outcomes. In such a case, it is possible that shared objectives are not required and that states might be willing to join with a broad set of divergent goals and interests. On the other hand, it might be that states are most likely to join when they do share common goals and interests with the coalition leader.
Our quantitative analysis and case studies suggest that having shared interests does seem to support coalition membership: States do seem somewhat more likely to join when they share interests with the United States. However, it is by no means the case that the objectives of different partners must be wholly the same or entirely overlapping. Diversity of interests, including those of states with very narrow self-interested goals, can provide a level of cohesion and commitment that helps hold the coalition together. In other words, coalition membership appears to rest on the existence of a shared set of results but choices of means and side objectives pursued along the way can differ widely.
We quantitatively assess shared interests in two ways. First, we consider trade flows between the potential partner and the intervention target. The United States is more likely to intervene in places where it has economic interests; therefore, if a potential partner also has economic interests in the target country, that would provide a shared interest. Second, we consider the congruence of the UN voting records of the United States and the potential partner. Although we are specifically focused on shared interests regarding the intervention, it is reasonable to assume that if states have similar voting preferences across a wide variety of issues in the UN-note, the UN agreement variable reflects voting similarities across an entire UN session-they might also have shared interests regarding the intervention in question. Neither is a perfect proxy, but together they can provide some insight.
Note that the coefficients for trade are not in Table

A review of our case studies supports the finding of the quantitative analysis that shared interests do matter to the decisions that states make about whether to join a U.S.-led coalition, but our case studies also add nuance, suggesting that even states with divergent interests might join a coalition to pursue national aims. Our qualitative analysis further suggests that although shared interests might be a factor in determining whether states join a coalition, they are far from the most important ones.
The EFP coalition is an example in which shared interests are important but states also have divergent priorities and reasons for joining. The shared interests of NATO partners are clear: to deter a Russian advance and solidify the alliance. But EFP members differ significantly in their objectives vis-à-vis Russia and their notions about how best to respond to that risk.

The case of the Global Coalition Against ISIS is another one in which members share a core threat and common set of interests but have widely divergent objectives and thoughts about the best way to achieve those objectives. From the start, there was clear agreement across the coalition about the threat posed by ISIS. Among the mostmilitarily capable partners that also made the largest contributions to the Defeat ISIS campaign, there was a general agreement that ISIS represented a particularly virulent strain of terrorism, threatening regional stability, posing a risk of genocide to minorities, and raising the prospects of attacks in the West given the large flows of foreign fighters who joined the group from Europe. Iraq's neighbors, particularly the Arab states, had an even more focused view of the threat, fearing spillover from Iraq and Syria into their own territory. However, there were also clear divergences in objectives and priorities on key issues, such as whether to intervene in Syria, how to work with the Kurds, and what the end-state goal of an expansion of the intervention into Syria would be. Turkey, for instance, joined the coalition out of concerns about the ISIS threat but otherwise had a very different set of objectives vis-à-vis Syria and the Kurds-specifically, to elevate the threat of the People's Protection Units (a Syrian Kurdish militia that operated along the Turkish border and has links to the Turkish Kurdistan Worker's Party) over the threat posed by ISIS. 
19
The case of the Gulf War is another good example of the "shared ends, differing means" view of coalition formation. Coalition partners were united in their core interests and objectives: to liberate Kuwait and contain Saddam's aggression. Most also shared a commitment to protecting the norm of territorial sovereignty and agreed on the severity of Saddam's threat to that norm. Partners also shared a clear understanding and common perception of the threat. For many states, particularly the regional members, the security concern was the primary reason they joined the coalition-to protect their own national security and prevent continued aggression from Saddam. However, member states also held a variety of additional and sometimes conflicting narrower objectives. States differed as to whether they perceived Saddam's occupation of Kuwait as a direct national security threat or more generally as a threat to norms of sovereignty, and this difference shaped their goals, level of commitment, and desired outcome. States also differed in their objectives regarding the United States. Some sought to build closer ties, some to avoid the costs of nonparticipation, and others to ensure enough influence to prevent a long-term U.S. presence in the region. That states were working toward different aims was a challenge for the coalition, but the immediacy of the shared threat held the partnerships together.
In the case of Afghanistan, coalition partners once again shared a set of core interests and desired ends. Coalition members shared a common perceived threat (in broad terms and at least at the start): terrorists and militant groups that sought to retain their safe haven and resist Western influence. In the post-9/11 environment, states were ready and willing to sign onto these core interests, believing that action against terrorist safe havens was essential to international security. But partners also had their own, narrower objectives. Our analysis suggests that many partners (including close U.S. allies) were involved in Afghanistan mostly to satisfy the United States-whose aid they saw as key to their own security-rather than because they had clear and consistent views on the objectives in Afghanistan or the goals of the operation. Some states, such as Romania and Bulgaria, used participation in the coalition to make the case for their inclusion in NATO. Differing national objectives and only a diffuse threat in the early years of the conflict meant that coalition members had divergent views of political objectives that they were pursuing and their prioritization.

Across the five case studies, it seems that the role of shared interests remains far from straightforward. Coalition formation does seem centered on some core shared interests or ends. States are more likely to join when there is a common threat or a common goal or end state. However, this does not mean that coalition members cannot also be pursuing a variety of individual goals with their own set of means. States consistently join coalitions to advance their own independent priorities; even when they share objectives with other members, they might perceive those priorities differently and have different ideas about how to pursue them. Diversity of objective is not necessarily a bad thing when it comes to coalition formation. It can create a more diverse coalition, and this might have advantages for cohesion, longevity, and legitimacy. However, diversity of

-1952:
Our analysis in Chapter Four showed that international legitimacy was a key consideration for the United States when deciding whether to work through a coalition. In this section, we consider whether international legitimacy, as measured by intergovernmental approval or leadership, is a factor considered by states when deciding whether to join a coalition.
Although leadership and sponsorship are distinct, we consider them together. Interventions led by an IGO might have a commander from that IGO (e.g., a NATO commander); an IGO-sponsored intervention might only have the approval or the backing of the IGO. In either case, the effect is largely the same-that of establishing approval and legitimacy at a level above the national.
Our analysis finds reasonably consistent support for the role of IGO leadership or sponsorship in driving coalition participation. Even when partners might join in the absence of IGO involvement, across case studies and in our statistical analysis, IGO involvement or approval is associated with an increased likelihood that a given potential partner joins the coalition.
Table

The qualitative analysis provides consistent support for the role of IGO leadership or sponsorship in driving coalition participation. In our case studies, IGO leadership or sponsorship seems to matter a great deal in some situations but less in others. Support for the hypothesis seems strongest in the instances of Afghanistan and the Gulf War. In both instances, IGO sponsorship or approval played a role in widening membership and persuading reluctant partners to join. In the case of Afghanistan, the fact that members had chosen to invoke Article 5-for the first time in the alliance's history-was significant and drove the commitments of many NATO allies who might not have committed forces otherwise. Wide domestic public support in NATO countries, at least at the start of the operation, was bolstered by institutional NATO approval, and this provided further impetus to allied military contributions. 
25
In the Gulf War, it was UN approval and the UNSC resolution that bolstered support and gave the United States leverage to encourage participation from a wider group of allies (including regional partners) and even to accrue nonmilitary contributions from traditional adversaries that might otherwise have been opposed (e.g., Russia). Following the UN-mandated ultimatum against Saddam, some UN member 
25
Two of our case studies did not have formal IGO sponsorship: the postwar occupation of Japan and the Global Coalition Against ISIS. Although IGO sponsorship clearly mattered to participation in the other case studies, the lack of IGO sponsorship in these two does not seem to have played a big role. Coalition membership in post-World War II Japan was governed by geopolitical factors and was intentionally limited. The United States accepted help only reluctantly, seeking to establish itself as the sole and principal power in Asia, as would be reflected in its policies in the occupation of Japan. 
27
The Global Coalition Against ISIS did not have an official IGO sponsor, but its more than 80 formal supporters (not all of which provided troops) functioned almost as an IGO, providing international approval and legitimacy that encouraged moreactive military participation among the core coalition members.

On net then, IGO leadership or sponsorship seems relevant to coalition formation because it provides a layer of legitimacy that increases the willingness of states to join the coalition. However, it is clear that the importance of IGO leadership or involvement varies over time, mattering more as norms of sovereignty and the preference for multilateral interventions became stronger after the end of the Cold War. Beyond the qualitative evidence provided by our in-depth case studies, a quick survey of the full universe of U.S. coalition interventions between 1946 and 2018 shows that all but one of the 17 instances between World War II and the Gulf War (during the Cold War)-the UN Operation in the Congo-were ad hoc U.S.-led missions, even though IGOs (such as the UN, OAS, and OECS) might have lent the veil of legitimacy in such places as Korea, Dominican Republic, and Grenada. By contrast, with only a couple exceptions not covered in the case study analysis (specifically, the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq and 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami relief mission), every U.S. coalition since 1991 has involved some degree of approval or joint leadership from the UN, NATO, EU, and/or ECOWAS/AU. IGO approval might not matter for all states. Some might join willingly without formal international support. IGO involvement does matter for states on the margin, however, and, as a result, can diversify a coalition and extend the legitimacy of an operation in a way that the average coalition cannot. Notably, IGO sponsorship can bring with it logistical challenges and limitations. In an IGO-led mission, for example, the United States might need to work through formal structures, rely on consensus, and defer to partners in ways that prevent decisive action and limit flexibility. Thinking about future conflicts, IGOs could play an important role. In the event of a conflict with Russia in Europe, NATO would play a key role in building legitimacy and encouraging wide participation. In the case of continued conflict in the Middle East, past experience and regional tensions mean that the United States might need to rely on IGOs-or, at the very least, might be better able to build wide support for continued U.S. involvement with IGO support. Finally, in the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, hesitancy among regional states to challenge China even implicitly might mean that coalitions are easier to build under the umbrella of IGOs than under direct U.S. sponsorship.
Another reason (and the last hypothesis we consider here) that states might join coalitions is to advance their own international status-to be seen as major players on the international scene or at least be involved in decisionmaking that might affect their interests going forward. It is difficult to quantitatively operationalize this concept of status-seeking in a way that is consistent with what we describe in this chapter. States that seek to increase their status might be small states seeking to gain some kind of leverage, rising or revisionist states seeking to punch above their weight, states seeking to boost their economic potential, or major powers seeking to advance or underscore their great-power position of influence. As a reminder, we draw a distinction between states that respond to a status-seeking motive and those that are enticed to join a coalition by incentives provided by a coalition leader. As noted in Chapter Two, past work has underscored the role that monetary, economic, and political incentives-both explicit and implicit-have played in motivating states to join coalitions.

There is evidence in our case studies that states use coalition contributions as a way to increase international legitimacy and national status. This is true of small states (such as Serbia) but also of larger, more-developed states (such as Canada) that see coalition membership as a way to advance their international position and signal to other states their relevance to geopolitical events. Specific examples of states using coalition membership to advance their international status exist in each case study. In Afghanistan, many NATO partners contributed forces largely to appease the United States, but some, such as Canada, took on larger roles as a way to signal their importance within the international system more broadly. Canada contributed significantly more forces than would be expected given the size of its military and compared with the contributions of others. It did this in part to increase its role in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and to claim a more significant role on the international stage. 31 30 Henke, 2019b.

Status-seeking appears to be less of a significant factor in the EFP coalition, largely because this is a NATO mission, and all NATO partners are more or less obligated to commit to it. However, it is not impossible that the diversity of participation among even small NATO allies reflects their efforts to sustain relevance.
Although not relevant in all situations or to all partners, there are clearly instances in which states seek coalition membership to advance their international position, status, and legitimacy. Although these situations often involve smaller states seeking to "punch above their weight," others can involve larger states or developing states that aspire to 37 Ann Mosely Lesch, "Contrasting Reactions to the Persian Gulf Crisis: Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and the Palestinians," Middle East

Our analysis finds some support for each of the hypotheses considered in this chapter and highlights how and when such factors as relationship with the United States, IGO sponsorship, opportunities for status-seeking, shared interests, and the region of the intervention shape the decisions that states make about when to join U.S coalitions (see Table 
5
Among these five factors, it is difficult to rank one as more important to state decisionmaking than another. Instead, states might join a given coalition for any number of mutually reinforcing reasons. For close U.S. allies, protection of that relationship might be paramount; other states might be more strongly motivated by overlapping interests. For nontraditional U.S. partners, such factors as IGO sponsorship and region might take on outsized importance in determining whether coalition membership makes sense. It is likely that it is the interaction of these different factors that leads states to join coalitions and not any one in isolation.
Furthermore, we do not claim that these five factors are the only ones that might influence decisions to join coalitions. As noted previously, we chose to focus our analysis on a select set of hypotheses, specifically those that emerge most strongly from the literature on coalition interventions and those that would be useful inputs to the 41 Courtney J. Richardson, "A Responsible Power? China and the UN Peacekeeping Regime," International Peacekeeping, Vol. 18, No. 3, 2011.  planning and decisionmaking processes of policymakers and military planners who are thinking about how to build the broad coalitions needed to fight the wars of the future. Two other factors that receive broad support from the literature on coalition formation are the domestic politics of the potential partner and the role of implicit and explicit incentives. Domestic politics and government institutional factors might affect a state's choice to join a coalition or to remain outside it. For example, in the case of the intervention in Afghanistan, there was broad support for participation (at first) in NATO countries that might have factored into state decisionmaking. Similarly, we know that states have historically joined coalitions in return for monetary payments, economic benefits, military experience, and aid. Incentives were used to induce wider participation in the Global Coalition Against ISIS, the Gulf War, and in Afghanistan; they were also used to encourage participating states to provide more forces. Decisions about coalition membership are likely to be highly context specific-that is, dependent on the specific conflict or crisis and its timing. Overall, then, the decisions that states make about where and when to intervene are complex and multifaceted, relying on many factors simultaneously.
For U.S. policymakers and military leaders, there are a few key takeaways. First, there are many paths to coalition-building. The United States can build diverse coalitions by appealing to different states on different dimensions, depending on the state and the interests at stake. One key path will be building stronger political, military, and economic ties. Different types of relationships are not interchangeable, but any type of relationship can increase the likelihood that a given state joins the United States in the event of a crisis. Equally important, however, is the insight that alliances do not guarantee participation. The United States should not assume coalition support, even from close allies, when designing contingency plans. Second, our analysis indicates that even states that are hesitant to partner with the United States might do so when the crisis is in their region. Third, our case studies underscore the role of status-seeking Seeking to increase diversity of coalition without costly concessions of payoffs in driving intervention participation for both small states and larger ones. This provides a key point of leverage for the United States: States seeking status might be especially vulnerable to recruitment into the intervention coalition and especially willing to accept side payments or other intangible benefits in return for their participation. Fourth, we observed that IGO sponsorship can increase the likelihood that potential contributors decide to join a coalition, which suggests that working through or enlisting the support of an IGO can be an effective strategy for policymakers seeking to build a diverse set of partnerships for a small-or large-scale operation. Finally, we noted that shared interests are important but that states can and do join coalitions to pursue their own national aims; this suggests that a full match of objectives might not be a requirement as the United States seeks to form coalitions with new partners. Instead, relationships and membership can be transactional, and states might choose to join to advance their own independent aims. Such transactional aims could be leveraged to build coalitions for future interventions.
In this chapter, we consider factors that appear to affect the likelihood that coalition interventions achieve their political objectives. As noted elsewhere, the empirical challenges associated with the research question considered in this chapter are the most extensive. There are several reasons this is the case. First, the question of what makes an intervention successful is a challenging one to study empirically because so much depends on context. Past work has shown that there is no one set of factors likely to make an intervention successful. The elements most strongly linked to success are likely to vary depending on the type of conflict, the type of intervention, the operating environment, and many other factors. This is further complicated by the fact that we only have 37 coalition interventions in our sample. This makes it difficult to conduct rigorous quantitative analyses that compare successful coalitions with unsuccessful ones-and that comparison is required to answer the research question posed in this chapter. Instead, we have to rely on descriptive statistics and case studies, neither of which is likely to provide definitive and fully convincing results. Still, we use both methods in this chapter to gain some insight into this question of coalition success.
Although we expect that our findings will be less clear and less definitive than those in the previous two chapters, we are still able to provide some useful insights.
As noted in Chapter Three, the question we focus on in this chapter is whether the United States generally has more or less success in achieving its political objectives using coalition interventions than it does when conducting unilateral interventions. This is a narrower question than whether coalitions or unilateral interventions are more effective from the perspective of other coalition partners or the target state. We consider specifically characteristics of the coalition that the United States is able to control, and we assess which characteristics appear most and least likely to help the United States pursue its own interests and its stated goals for the intervention. For this analysis, we use the political objectives collected in previous RAND work for all U.S. military interventions and the assessments made in prior work about the extent to which these objectives were achieved.

From the perspective of a policymaker, this is a key question: Are coalition interventions more likely to be successful than unilateral interventions? If the answer is yes, then seeking multilateral interventions might be the way to go. If the answer is no, then coalition interventions might not be preferred or even desired, in spite of all their benefits. In reality, the answer is likely to be, "it depends," meaning that coalitions are more successful in some situations and less successful in others (all else equal). In this section, we explore the qualitative and quantitative evidence in support of and against the general effectiveness of coalition interventions compared with unilateral ones.
In this analysis, our objective is to estimate the causal effect of coalition formation on the average level of objective success. In an ideal quasi-experimental setting, we would Prevent the remilitarization of Japan.
Repatriate internally and externally displaced Japanese citizens.
Provide humanitarian relief to the Japanese population.
Promote longer-term political and social stability through democratic institution-building (i.e., marginalization of the emperor to role of state figurehead) and economic aid and reconstruction.
After the start of the Cold War: Contain the expansion of Soviet and Chinese influence and spread of communism in East Asia.
After the start of the Korean War: Secure access to strategic air and shipping lanes and staging areas for deployment of personnel and equipment to the Korean Peninsula. We start simply by comparing the success of coalition and unilateral interventions in a descriptive sense. 2 Figure

However, this analysis provides only a high-level view and does not control for relevant factors, such as intervention size or period. To gain insight into the effect of coalitions on the success of objectives, we must create an empirical model that is parsimonious while minimizing omitted variable bias. To solve this problem, we turn to a model selection technique called double-selection lasso. In the lasso method, we earmark a set of independent variables of interest, and we identify a pool of potentially relevant predictor variables. From this pool, lasso selects the model features.

For robustness, we also check the effect of coalition interventions on another measure of success: the per capita income of the target state (or states). This measure might not reflect the objectives and interests of the United States or the coalition as a whole as precisely as other measures do, but it does capture another dimension of success, is readily available, widely recognized, and less prone to criticisms of subjectivity. To implement the test, we calculate the average change in per capita income between the intervention's end year and five years afterward in the target state(s) for each intervention. This variable is then used as the dependent or outcome variable in the same models and estimation techniques (i.e., linear regression and lasso). Again, we observe no difference between the success of coalition and unilateral interventions in terms of per capita income. This finding is somewhat counterintuitive. As shown in Chapter Five, coalitions often attract states in the same region as the target state(s)-a finding that is both statistically significant and robust. These coalition members have greater incentive to provide political and economic stability to neighboring countries; proximity is a key determinant of trade flows. 
4
We do find, however, that coalitions pursue more objectives per intervention than the United States pursues in unilateral interventions. The average number of objectives in a coalition intervention is 3.85; unilateral interventions, on average, pursue 2.82-a difference of 1.03, which is politically and statistically significant. We plot histograms of the total number of objectives pursued in coalitions (green) and in unilateral interventions (white) and compare the distributions via a t-test in Figure 
6
Qualitative analysis, on the other hand, might provide additional insights on whether and how coalitions contribute to success. Case studies could allow us to identify the contexts in which coalitions seem to advance political objectives and the contexts in which they do not matter that much. We cannot directly address the relative effectiveness of coalitions on intervention outcomes using only five case studies, but we are able to consider the extent to which having coalition support was crucial to successes achieved in each intervention. Our review suggests that coalitions can help the United States achieve its aims in some contexts but that it would be a mistake to assume that forming a coalition ensures intervention success. The clearest example of a case where intervention outcomes and coalition support seem unrelated was the BCOF force in Japan. In this case, the United States was able to largely achieve its objectives despite a dysfunctional coalition that provided minimal support and fell apart quickly. Although the United States sought coalition support to manage what it expected would be significant force demands, those demands ended up being significantly lower than expected; ultimately, the United States operated mostly on its own. The common goals of elevating the prestige and unity of the British Commonwealth were never achieved and BCOF members were not able to directly contribute to broader aims of stabilization and demilitarization. Assigned to the rural areas of Japan, far separated from the center of power in Tokyo, members of the BCOF failed to reap any substantial dividends-politically, militarily, or economically.

Similarly, in OIR, both military and political contributions allowed the coalition to achieve gains that a unilateral intervention might not have. Partner forces made substantial military commitments that eased the burden on the United States and filled niche capability gaps that the United States might otherwise have struggled to fill. Traditional U.S. partners-Australia, France, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom-arguably provided the greatest military support to the operation. In the first three years of the campaign, when air strikes were a crucial tool to reclaiming territory, those four partners generated 81 percent of the non-U.S. strikes conducted in Iraq. 
9
The case of Afghanistan falls somewhere in the middle and is more difficult to assess. The intervention has been mixed when it comes to success generally. In the early stages of the war, the United States intervened mostly without partners, and its ability to act quickly and decisively is one reason that it was able to achieve key objectives. Later, the United States brought in partners for the reconstruction phase of the mission and experienced more difficulty in achieving mission objectives. The second phase of U.S. operations in Afghanistan involved a large number of partners; many NATO allies made sizable contributions of ground forces (already described in Chapter Four) and, in some instances, also air and naval forces. Given the high resource demands of stabilization and nation-building activities, the additional resources were valuable to the United States, especially as it simultaneously conducted combat operations in Iraq. As already noted, much of what the United States received from allies in terms of operational support was procedural in nature-they offered logistical support and help in coordination rather than substantially augmenting U.S. capabilities.

Overall, our case studies suggest that coalitions have benefits and are useful in some situations but can bring new challenges that work against intervention success in others. In each of the case studies in which the United States operated with a coalition, that coalition provided some significant advantages. In many instances, the more important of these advantages were political rather than military in nature, but this might be particular to the situations chosen and the fact that most are from the post-Cold War period when the United States faced no real peer challengers. In some situations, without the political legitimacy provided by the coalition, it is not clear whether the intervention would have happened at all. However, there are also situations in which the United States benefited from acting more or less alone. Coalitions do bring challenges, and those challenges can interfere with efforts to achieve key objectives. We describe these challenges in greater detail throughout this chapter. the odds of success when there are concerns about legitimacy or when operational demands are high. Otherwise, the United States operating unilaterally is often just as effective. Looking back over the larger set of case studies, coalitions have been clearly beneficial in the case of long, drawn-out missions with high operational requirements that the United States could not meet on its own (e.g., the World Wars, Korea, and Vietnam) and in the case of major, high-tempo post-Cold War air campaigns to conduct combined airstrikes and enforce no-fly zones (e.g., Bosnia, Kosovo, Libya, Iraq, and Syria). However, planners cannot know before an intervention how long it will last or what the operational requirements are likely to be (even if there are indicators that suggest when an operation will have high demands). As a result, they may not always know when it would be wise to form a coalition and when an intervention will be manageable as a unilateral mission. Coalitions also have seemingly increased the chances for sustainable success in postconflict stability and peacekeeping missions (discussed in more detail in the next section) in which the United States did not perceive a strong direct security threat and/or was able to sustain elite and popular domestic support for open-ended troop deployments (e.g., Bosnia, Croatia, Haiti, and Rwanda).
However, in assessing the effect of coalitions on success, we must also consider the U.S. experience with unilateral interventions. The United States has been successful working through coalitions but also working unilaterally. Trying to summarize the set of unilateral interventions in which the United States had a high degree of success yields some interesting observations. First, we find that unilateral successes (again, focusing on achievement of U.S. political objectives) appear most common for deterrence missions-although we caveat that much of this success accrued with changes in the international system at the end of the Cold War. The United States has also often achieved its political objectives unilaterally when the intervention required only some kind of naval action, such as a show of force, deterrent, or other activity. (Here, however, we also note that the few major instances of coalition naval operations-while usually part of broader, joint ground and air operations-also have enjoyed a relatively high record of tactical and operational success, including, at times, coalition interdiction and naval embargo, as well as sanction-enforcement operations focused on adversaries in North Korea, Iraq, Yugoslavia and Serbia, Libya, Somalia, and others.) The United States has less frequently conducted major combat operations or large stabilization missions on its own. This does not necessarily mean that coalitions are required for these operations, but it does suggest that these types of situations are historically ones in which the United States has chosen to work with partners, out of necessity or choice. In the next section, we will explicitly consider the case of stability operations and whether there appears to be any evidence that coalitions increase the likelihood of success in these types of operations.
If coalitions do not increase the odds of success overall, another possibility is that they support success for certain types of interventions. One candidate would be stabilization missions in which resource demands are often high and long-term. However, because they are complex and resource-intensive, and because sprawling objectives can lead to disagreements, coordinating coalition operations might be especially difficult and fraught. This is a hypothesis that is difficult to assess both qualitatively and quantitatively. We simply do not have enough stabilization operations to conduct a regression analysis, and assessing this hypothesis with our sample is challenging because of both the small dataset and the mixed U.S. record in conducting successful stability operations-unilaterally or in coalitions. However, we can still explore the data we do have and extract some insights and observations.
Although we lack the data needed for an assessment using regressions, we can look at descriptive patterns to identify trends. First, it is worth remembering that of the 17 stability operations in which the United States was involved between 1946 and 2018, 12 have been coalitions. 
19
6
Although our quantitative analysis fails to find support for this hypothesis, we can also assess the idea qualitatively by looking at our case studies. Only two of our case studies concern U.S. stabilization missions, and they provide fairly different perspectives on coalition value to achievement of U.S. objectives. As just described, in the case of Afghanistan, the nature of the operation, its operational demands, and its extended duration certainly made the coalition seem necessary and the best option. Without a full counterfactual analysis, we cannot say that the United States would have achieved a better outcome if it had chosen to operate unilaterally. We can only point out that having a coalition did not guarantee success but did make some contributions toward achievement of U.S. objectives, as already described.
Although coalition forces might have played a role in stabilization in Afghanistan, our other stabilization case study, the postwar stabilization of Japan, tells a different story. As already noted, coalition forces played little or no role; the BCOF forces were largely peripheral to many of the gains that were achieved; and, as a result, the general Japanese populace viewed the BCOF as "playing soldiers, while it was the Americans who were helping them to build their new country." 
20
20
We find little clear support, then, that coalitions are best in certain operating environments. Instead, coalitions seem most crucial to success where, as already noted, they help overcome major obstacles to the intervention-either political legitimacy or operational demands, regardless of activity type. Since the end of World War II, the United States has rarely engaged in a large-scale, lengthy stability operation without a set of coalition partners. The country has, however, conducted other major operations unilaterally.
On net, then, we find no significant evidence that coalitions are specifically preferred to unilateral interventions in the case of stability operations. However, this is not to say that there are not situations in which stability operations benefit from or require coalitions. There are plenty of anecdotal instances in which coalition participation proved important for the execution of a stability operation or the burden-sharing aspect of the coalition helped offset some of the high costs of such an operation. As previously noted, key examples include instances in which U.S. elite and popular support could not be maintained indefinitely, and other partners assumed the mantle of coalition leadership after U.S. withdrawal-for instance, after the October 1993 Battle of Mogadishu in Somalia, in which numerous U.S. special operations forces casualties were sustained, or attacks on UN peacekeepers during post-genocide stability in Rwanda in 1994. Similarly, after the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan began, the overstretched U.S. military was willing to deploy as the entry force to establish initial security in places such Liberia (in 2003) and Haiti (in 2004) but was unwilling to sustain a large residual ground presence; had Washington not been able to hand off leadership to ECOWAS and/or the UN quickly, these interventions likely would not have had the success they did. Likewise, there is little doubt about the same counterfactual in the Balkans: Unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia, Croatia, or Kosovo likely would not have been as successful as the coalitions that were formed.
Nevertheless, we do not find a systematic pattern suggesting that coalitions are more successful than unilateral efforts for stability operations. In part, this is certainly because of the lack of sufficient data to rigorously test this hypothesis. The lack of a clear pattern also might result from selection effects-whether the United States chooses coalitions only for the hardest stability operations. It is also possible that these interventions would have turned out much worse without coalitions. But without more data, we cannot draw any definitive conclusions other than to say that we lack the data needed to support this hypothesis.
In the previous chapter, we considered the role of shared interests and concluded that although having some kind of shared interest, threat, or desired end state is important to coalition formation, states can and do have their own national objectives in addition.
Here we consider the role that shared interest plays in success at achieving U.S. political objectives. Again, we consider common objectives, goals, and threats. The evidence from our case studies in this instance is fairly convincing that having a shared interest is important to intervention outcomes. However, our analysis allows us to be more specific and argue that not just shared interests but also shared threats-especially severe shared threats-seem key to success at achieving U.S. political objectives. We observe that having a severe shared threat can help coalitions overcome some of the challenges and pitfalls of multilateral operations. We also find that although having multiple national objectives or differing threat perceptions does not prevent coalition formation, it can interfere with the ability of a coalition to achieve its ultimate objectives.
For the quantitative analysis, we again use UN voting data to create a measure of shared interest among coalition members. For each coalition partner, we calculate its voting similarity to the United States in the year of the UN session in which the intervention began. The values range from 0 (i.e., complete disagreement) to 1 (i.e., complete unanimity). We then calculate the average UN voting agreement of all the coalition's partners and use it to test the effect of shared interest on objective success. Figure

Although there is no empirically demonstrable relationship between the two variables, we again note the difficulties of quantitative analysis in this setting. First, shared interest is not randomly assigned. For example, the average voting congruence of coalition members likely correlates with the coalition size or period (e.g., post-Cold War), which might also influence a coalition's success. In reality, there are several potential confounding variables (both observed and unobserved) that affect the shared interest of the coalition and, simultaneously, its likelihood of success. But we are unable to control for these factors in our analysis. Many are unobservable-and, furthermore, we lack sufficient data to design sophisticated models that might be able to hurdle the challenge of nonrandom assignment. Second, even if shared interest were randomly assigned to a subset of coalition interventions, a simple means comparison of average objective success would still be fraught with large standard errors and low statistical power because of our small sample size.
With these caveats established, we conclude that the quantitative analysis fails to identify any relationship between shared interest, as measured by UN voting congruence, and objective success. The regression results in Box 6.1 and the plot in Figure 
6
Our qualitative analysis underscores the important role of shared threats in coalition outcomes-where these exist, coalitions tend to hold together more strongly and to be better able to overcome divergent objectives and intracoalition differences. In the case of OIR, it was the shared interests and shared threat that allowed such a large and diverse coalition to form and to hold together in the fight against ISIS. Despite being geographically diverse, states in the Global Coalition Against ISIS experienced many of the same concerns and fears about the threat posed by ISIS. For example, consider the specific threat posed by returning foreign fighters (many of whom came from Europe) to their countries of origin. Haesebrouck notes that many of the countries that participated in airstrikes-including France, Belgium, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands-were large origin countries of foreign fighter flows to Syria and Iraq.

In the case of post-World War II Japan, shared interests were weaker, and there was limited perception of a shared threat. Although the intervention was ultimately successful, the coalition itself fell apart pretty quickly, largely because coalition members differed significantly in their priorities and objectives and did not face a real threat to unite them in transcendence of these differences. The lack of a true and motivating threat in post-World War II Japan might explain the gradual collapse of the coalition and the fact that the United States never seriously tried to engage coalition partners in the reconstruction effort.

38
In the five case studies described here, coalitions that shared a common threat reaped meaningful advantages in terms of cohesion and commitment that helped them overcome some of the challenges associated with coalition warfare. Coalitions that lacked an immediate shared threat experienced cracks of various kinds and divisions that perpetuated and worsened communication gaps and weakened the political will of key coalition members to commit forces to ongoing military operations. Although our ability to generalize is limited, this finding-that having a shared threat matters-is consistent with previous research. The added value of the case studies here is that we have been able to explore the mechanisms through which the shared threat translates into better outcomes, and we have identified examples of how sensitive this link appears. In two of our case studies, even small differences in perception of the threat created cracks in coalition cohesion with implications for intervention outcomes. We can say with some confidence that having a shared threat can be helpful in uniting a coalition in ways that support achievement of key objectives and that the lack of a shared threat can be a challenge, but we cannot say with any certainty that having a shared threat is required or a necessary condition for a successful coalition operation.
Partners that have fought together before and have experience working and training together, as part of either a formal alliance or a more informal partnership or coalition, might have advantages and a head start at overcoming challenges of coordination, communication, and interoperability. NATO partners, for example, conduct many training exercises to increase their skill at working and fighting together, and the United States similarly trains with other allies and partners. In this section, we consider whether past experience appears to influence the likelihood that a coalition achieves its political objectives.
We again face serious data constraints in testing the relationship between past partnership experience and coalition objective success. We also face the challenge of quantitatively measuring coalition experience. For each coalition, we tally the number of times that coalition partners have participated in past U.S.-led interventions. But this metric creates additional difficulties in the analysis. In other low-observation settings, we have relied primarily on t-tests, univariate regressions, and descriptive statistics, but here we construct a multivariate regression to test the hypothesis. In this model, we control for two additional variables: We order the coalition interventions chronologically and rank them (e.g., first [1], second [2], third [3]) and the size of the coalition as measured by the number of partners. The first variable confounds the analysis because the experience metric will naturally grow over time. Our objective is to compare coalitions with different levels of partner experience, not to compare recent interventions with older ones, so we control for the variable in our statistical model. If we just compared the raw total tallies of interventions, we would certainly capture the strong correlation between coalition order (the term we use to determine when the coalition happens chronologically) and coalition experience (i.e., lower order, less experience). Similarly, larger coalitions will have more experience as measured by our metric simply because larger coalitions will have had more opportunities for past coalition participation (i.e., more partners, more potential for past experience).
The model tests whether experience is associated with coalition success while controlling for the effects of coalition order and size. The results are presented in Box 6.2.
We ultimately lack evidence to conclude that past coalition experience increases the likelihood of objective success. The effect size is exceptionally small and falls short of statistical significance. An additional past partnership in a coalition is predicted to improve the average objective success score by 0.001. As a reminder, the index ranges from one to three so the estimated effect is negligible and statistically insignificant. We note that it is a priori unlikely that we would uncover statistically significant or otherwise robust findings in the small sample in which standard errors are often large and confidence intervals wide. What's more, we are limited by a measure of experience that is somewhat crude, albeit available and tractable. Although past coalition participation captures experience, other measures (e.g., bilateral trainings) might better capture experience and ability of coalition partners to interoperate and achieve objective success. Given these caveats, we cannot assert that coalition experience improves the likelihood of objective success using the observable empirical relationship.
With quantitative analysis providing little evidence of an effect in either direction, we next consider the qualitative evidence. As a starting point, the BCOF troops that operated alongside U.S. forces in postwar Japan offer some evidence that new military partnerships might be particularly challenged by issues of communication, coordination, and interoperability. Despite serving under the common aegis of the waning British Commonwealth and Empire, the BCOF was the first Commonwealth occupational force; hence, the subsequent "rivalries and foul-ups were only to be expected." 
39
In several of the other case studies examined, the benefits of past coalition fighting or joint training experience among long-term allies seem readily apparent. For instance, in the case of the Gulf War, a unique divided command structure that put Saudi Arabia in command of regional partners and the United States in command of Western partners had the added benefit of capitalizing on the established history of force integration among most of the Western partners. Many of the states were members of NATO and therefore familiar with fighting alongside the United States. The states that were not, such as Argentina, had conducted joint exercises with the United States in the past, which facilitated efficient integration. 40 This allowed the coalition to minimize some of the logistical challenges that have affected other large coalition

In the Afghanistan case, the value of past NATO experience has been similarly mixed in easing some of the challenges of coalition warfare. Despite a large and diverse coalition, analysis of the early days of NATO operations in Afghanistan underscores the relatively short learning curve experienced by the coalition. It was able to achieve a significant degree of jointness relatively quickly that extended beyond that achieved in other operations. This is likely in large part thanks to previous experiences operating and training together.

Our analysis finds mixed support for the hypothesis that experience as a coalition contributes to achievement of coalition objectives. Our quantitative analysis found little evidence to support this hypothesis, and our case studies provide only mixed support. In our qualitative analysis, we found clear instances in which experience mattered and contributed to success. Across the five case studies, we find mixed support for the argument that past coalition experience can improve coalition effectiveness and support achievement of U.S. objectives. Our case studies highlight some of the ways that past experience has been valuable. The Gulf War provides some of the clearest examples of operational successes that resulted from past joint training. In some situations at the other end of the spectrum, such as Afghanistan, past experience and habits built over time preparing for conventional conflicts have been liabilities in more-unconventional environments. On the other hand, the coalitions in most of our case studies continue to face significant obstacles to communication, C2, and interoperability despite past experience.
There are many reasons why this might be the case. First, there might be contextspecific dynamics to multinational coordination that require bespoke solutions in each operation. Second, the skills and processes that support interoperability might be ones that are difficult to institutionalize, meaning that as new commanders rise to the top, they must relearn at least some of what their predecessors have already experienced. Finally, it could be that the process of cross-nation cooperation and achieving full interoperability are so challenging that gaps remain despite decades of experience. On net, we can only say that past experience operating and training together might support the success of coalitions in many ways, but they do not eliminate the challenges of interoperability and might even be an impediment if they create obstacles to flexibility.
There are two possible predictions about the effect of membership size on coalition outcomes. On the one hand, more partners might mean more capabilities and wider legitimacy, which might favor success. On the other hand, more partners might mean more coordination and communication challenges and more potential divergence of priorities that undermine progress toward key objectives. We consider these hypotheses both qualitatively and quantitatively in this section.
Our quantitative analysis relies primarily on descriptive statistics to assess the relationship between success and number of partners. We find little clear evidence of a trend through this lens, whether we measure coalition size through the total number of partners or the number of major partners. Visualizations of both comparisons are shown in Figures 6.4 and 6.5. We also considered whether there might be a relationship between the number of partners and the number of objectives an intervention had and whether there were notable trends in coalition size by activity type. We found no relationship between number of objectives and coalition size. We found some differences in coalition size by activity type, but (as elsewhere) these are difficult to interpret because of our small sample size. Interestingly, the patterns for combat, deterrence, and stabilization missions (three of the most-common U.S. intervention types) have, on average, a similar number of major partners; stability operations are slightly larger when all partners are considered. The quantitative analysis, then, fails to find any consistent relationship between number of partners and intervention outcomes. This result is, in reality, not all that surprising, especially given the fact that we had two contradictory theories for how coalition size might affect intervention outcomes. In some situations, the added size might be beneficial from a legitimacy or capability aggregation perspective. In others, however, it might have the opposite effect of creating additional coordination challenges and barriers. We will use our case studies to further explore these relationships.
The five case studies provide evidence of both mechanisms. On net, although the gains in legitimacy derived from having a large, diverse coalition are sometimes necessary, there appear to be substantial downsides that can complicate progress toward U.S. objectives, at least in the instances we examined.
Smaller coalitions in our sample do appear to have success at achieving U.S. political objectives. It is not clear whether this is because of their size, but the ability to avoid some of the logistical challenges of larger coalitions does appear to have been an advantage in these instances. The postwar occupation of Japan, for example, relied on a very small number of partners at its start, and the United States intentionally sought to limit the number of partners to maximize its own influence and control. Even among the smaller number of partners, there were divergences in enthusiasm and objectives, and each partner sought to have its own independent role. A smaller number of weaker partners allowed the United States to operate in a largely unilateral fashion and to marginalize coalition partners, especially as the coalition itself began to fall apart. In the end, this ability of the United States to operate more or less independently appears to be one factor that favored success.

In the Gulf War, the size of the coalition provided many benefits in terms of operational capabilities and legitimacy. There were operational challenges, but coalition leaders managed these challenges in part with a divided command structure in which Saudi Arabia commanded the regional partners (Arab and Muslim countries) while the United States commanded other contributors. This allowed the size of the intervention to be a real asset rather than an impediment. Specifically, the Gulf War coalition had two "separate but parallel lines of authority with U.S. and Saudi Arabian forces remaining under their respective national command authorities."

For the EFP, it appears that the larger number of coalition partners has contributed directly and extensively to the deterrent signal sent by the coalition force. Although there have been interoperability and other challenges that result from coalition size, they do not appear to offset the benefits of the larger number of partners. As noted elsewhere, all NATO members except Turkey have contributed to the EFP force in some way-even Iceland, which has no armed forces and instead has deployed civilians and members of its Coast Guard. This diversity has been central to coalition success. Politically speaking, having a broad coalition of NATO allies is important for several reasons. First, it affirms the alliance's resolve and its viability. It also sends an important message to Russia regarding alliance solidarity and reminds Moscow that, unlike attacking Georgia or Ukraine, attacking one of the Baltic States or Romania 77 Robert H.

Finally, in the Afghan stabilization mission, the effect of the larger number of partners seems more ambiguous. There were legitimacy and operational gains from having a large number of partners, but there were also real challenges. As already described, the large number of partners created not only the challenge of divergent priorities and objectives, but also significant interoperability challenges on several different levels. There were difficulties between the United States and its NATO partners, the coalition and the host, and Afghan partners themselves, thus restricting coordination.

Our analyses suggest that the relationship between coalition size and intervention outcomes depends somewhat on context. There are clearly situations in which large and diverse coalitions have advantages in terms of legitimacy and access to resources. However, there are also situations in which large coalitions struggle with coordination and communication problems that, in turn, create challenges for operational effectiveness. This might be a case where the key is "right-sizing" the coalition; that is, ensuring that the coalition is the right size for the intervention and its objectives. Small coalitions might be best when possible, but there might be instances in which larger coalitions are required-for legitimacy or for operational purposes, for example. In these instances, the benefits of having a large coalition might be worth the costs.
In this chapter, we considered evidence for the five hypotheses that focused on determinants of coalition success. In general, our results were mixed. This was partly because of the small dataset. With only 37 coalition interventions, we are limited in our ability to compare across situations and identify systematic patterns and trends. Our quantitative analysis is limited because of this, the nonrandom nature of coalition formation, and the impact of selection effects. Our case studies help fill this gap somewhat, but even those do not tell a consistent story. What seems important to success in one case has a limited effect on success in other situations. This emphasizes the fundamental role played by context in shaping intervention outcomes and determining which specific intervention characteristics most directly contribute to success. What works in one context, for one threat, or in one situation might not work in another context or against a different adversary. This result is consistent with past RAND work on determinants of success in U.S. military interventions writ large.
Turning to the five hypotheses considered in this chapter, we found no evidence that coalitions are consistently more successful than unilateral interventions, but our research underscored that they can sometimes contribute to success when they create the legitimacy needed to win sufficient support or when they help address fundamental operational demands. We did not find evidence that coalitions were more or less supportive of success than unilateral interventions for any one activity type. We found mixed evidence when it came to the effects of experience and size. Although there was no clear quantitative trend, our case studies suggest that, on average, more experience in training or fighting as a coalition can support success. However, the case studies also caution that experience does not guarantee success and can be an impediment to innovation. When it comes to size, smaller interventions in our dataset had some advantages, but larger ones are often needed to meet operational or legitimacy requirements, despite the challenges that can bring in terms of collective action. Finally, we found more-consistent evidence in our case studies that coalitions with clearly shared threats and more-severe threats tended to have better outcomes in terms of achieving stated political objectives; the threat pushed them to cooperate more effectively and to overcome coordination and other challenges. Comparing this with the finding in the previous chapter that having shared objectives was often but not always a factor predicting coalition membership suggests an interesting dichotomy. Sharing goals or threats might not predict membership, but it might have a beneficial effect on outcomes where it exists. However, even a shared threat is not a guarantee of objective achievement, even in the limited set of situations considered here.
It is worth noting a variety of other factors contributed to the success of the situations considered here, including adversaries that were weaker than expected, dominant U.S. military strength, and extensive amounts of U.S. resources. Our goal here was not to enumerate all those factors that contributed to success but to focus in on a handful with direct relevance to key policy debates and decisions. Our results have some implications for policymakers; we mention those here and consider them in more detail in the next chapter. Perhaps most importantly, there is no formula for a successful coalition intervention. Instead, context matters a great deal and drives key outcomes. Second, it might be wrong to assume that larger and more-experienced coalitions will be best in challenging interventions. Instead, large coalitions might only be worth the challenges they pose when they are required. More-experienced coalitions might be better positioned to be successful, but this is not a guarantee. Furthermore, context matters even with experienced coalitions, and the same old routines might be counterproductive. Forming coalitions around a shared threat-but not necessarily shared objectives-also seems to favor success. The distinction might be important. Coalition partners that perceive a shared threat might be more likely to compromise and commit to working together. However, it might be acceptable and even beneficial to recruit and incorporate coalition partners with differing objectives. Having the ability to pursue their own priorities might strengthen the commitment of key allies and partners to the coalition. Considering this in the context of the Pacific region, for example, this insight would suggest that the United States could form a coalition around a shared threat from China, even if partners differ in their objectives. Coercing adherence to U.S. objectives might not be necessary to coalition success. Finally, there is no reason based on the evidence here to think that coalitions will always be more successful than unilateral efforts, especially for situations in which operational demands or legitimacy requirements do not require a coalition. Thus, the decision to form a coalition should be a measured and intentional one rather than one taken as the default, because possible coalition partners exist, or because it is assumed to be necessary.
In this report, we have considered three sets of hypotheses regarding how the United States uses coalition interventions, what nations are likely to join them, and when these operations are successful. In this chapter, we summarize key insights, describe implications for the Army, and provide recommendations. Box 7.1 summarizes the evidence and findings on each of the hypothesis.
We found strong support for two of our hypotheses about why the United States chooses to use coalitions and mixed support for the other three. The United States has tended to use coalitions to offset the operational burden of an intervention and to build the legitimacy needed to carry out an intervention. These findings are consistent with existing literature. We find that logistical concerns related to geography are not irrelevant to coalition decisions but that the United States can often overcome the challenges associated with distance without entering into formal coalitions that involve the provision of forces. Domestic considerations related to the political support of the general public and of the political elite appear to matter in some situations but not others and not systematically. Finally, although the United States has, since the end of the Cold War, tended to use unilateral interventions when the immediate threat to the United States is high, our broader analysis suggests that operational burden and considerations of legitimacy often mean that the United States is forced to rely on coalition support. Furthermore, we observe instances in which the United States expressed a willingness to intervene unilaterally if the costs of forming a coalition are too high.
This part of the analysis was largely descriptive in nature and does not suggest specific recommendations for Army leaders. However, the results do have implications for thinking about the future of interventions-and the future of coalitions, specifically. As the United States shifts to a focus on competing with and defeating near-peer adversaries, defense planners and policymakers must also consider what these conflicts might look like and how the United States will prepare for them. There are at least two possible directions, and each suggests something different about future trends in Burden-sharing Coalitions are more likely when operational demands are expected to be high.
The United States could use coalitions to gain access and sustainment or logistical support when interventions occur far from the United States, but they also rely on noncoalition partners and special agreements.
International legitimacy Coalitions are more likely when the need for international legitimacy is higher.
Domestic political considerations matter in some situations but are less relevant than other factors.
The United States often prefers to act unilaterally when the immediate threat is high, but operational and legitimacy considerations mean that, even in high-threat situations, the United States sometimes has to rely on coalitions.
States with close ties to the United States are more likely (but not guaranteed) to join coalitions. States without close ties might join for other reasons.
States are more likely to join coalitions in their home region.
Shared interests are associated with a higher likelihood of joining a coalition, but states could also enter to pursue their unique objectives.
IGO IGO sponsorship appears likely to increase willingness of states to join.
States sometimes join coalitions to advance their status or reputation.
Coalitions can support success in some situations, but there is no systematic trend.
We found no consistent trend for this hypothesis.
Having some shared interest does seem to be associated with a higher likelihood of achieving U.S. objectives; shared threats seem especially important to coalition outcomes.
Experience with partners in the past provides some benefit but cannot overcome key coalition challenges.
Smaller coalitions can operate more efficiently, but sometimes larger coalitions are needed for legitimacy or burden-sharing.
coalitions. First, if we expect that future conflicts are likely to be larger-scale confrontations with such adversaries as Russia and China, then the United States will likely be forced to rely more heavily on coalitions to help meet the operational demands of a major-power war. These will be situations in which, despite the severe threat, operational demands and geography will force the United States to build coalitions and rely on partners. However, our analysis also showed that during the Cold War, a period when the United States faced a major-power adversary, conflicts tended to operate through proxies, coalitions were used less often, and the United States more often intervened unilaterally (though carefully to avoid directly engaging with the Soviet Union). In this model, the relevance of coalitions would depend on trends in norms. In the Cold War, preventing the spread of communism far outstripped any demand for legitimacy. In the post-Cold War environment, legitimacy has been paramount, but will this trend continue in a threat environment that is more severe? If yes, then coalitions might continue to increase as a proportion of interventions. If no, then dependence on coalitions might depend on U.S. willingness and ability to shoulder the operational demands and the more general interest in engaging coalition forces. Importantly, one way in which legitimacy might continue to matter (even in the face of changing norms) involves questions of access-having regional partners and support can ease access and logistical challenges that are manifold in both U.S. Indo-Pacific Command and U.S. European Command. Still, a changed threat environment might change the way in which the United States uses coalitions.
Our analysis of coalition contributors suggests that states are more likely to join U.S. coalitions when they have close ties with the United States, when the intervention occurs in their own region, and/or when they can leverage membership to increase their status or standing. We found that states do seem to be motivated to join coalitions when they have core shared interests or desired end states, but we also observed that states very often join coalitions with their own narrower objectives that differ from those of the United States or the stated objectives of the coalition. Finally, we found mixed support for the argument that IGO sponsorship drives membership. IGO sponsorship does seem support coalition membership, but our research identified clear exceptions.
These results are useful for military planners who are thinking about what the U.S. Army needs to do to ensure that it is able to build coalitions when needed or desired to pursue objectives or operate in conflicts for which partners are required. Specifically, planners and policymakers can leverage the insights here to identify specific states that might be willing to join a coalition or are at least open to joining with the right incentives. It also identifies areas where the United States might not need to focus when it comes to building coalitions. We offer additional thoughts here.
When it comes to building coalitions, establishing strong ties prior to a conflict or crisis can be beneficial. The Army should seek to build and strengthen these ties with potential partners along political, military, economic, and cultural dimensions.
Our analysis found that states with long-standing close ties to the United States tended to be more likely than other states to join U.S. coalitions. Furthermore, we found that this was true across types of relationships: military, political, economic, and cultural. Although the strongest relationship was found for military alliances, we found that military assistance and cultural ties (for example, the percentage of the country that speaks English) also mattered. To build relationships that encourage coalition partnerships, the U.S. government generally and the U.S. Army specifically have several options. First, military and diplomatic leaders could seek to expand the number of formal partnerships to which the United States is a member. That is a high bar and might be challenging in such places as East Asia, where potential partners have avoided bilateral relationships and are concerned about angering China. However, there are options below formal alliances, including unofficial partnerships and even close military or political ties built through interpersonal relationships, joint training and exercises, and personnel exchanges. Another option would be to establish ties with military assistance that could build a different type of military and economic relationship while also building partner capacity in ways that can support future operations. Economic ties can also matter. Increasing trade relationships with a country, for example, appears to increase the likelihood that a state joins a coalition. In other words, economic relationships and interdependence might also build connections that support coalition formation. Finally, our results suggest that cultural ties also matter. Although it is unlikely that a strategy of increasing the English-speaking population in a country is feasible, there are many other ways of using soft power and influence to expand cultural ties-through trade, educational exchanges, social media campaigns, and other methods. The U.S. Army can assist in these efforts by partnering with other organizations in the interagency on influence campaigns and personal relationships that can strengthen unofficial ties between the United States and potential partners. Equally important to the observation that closer ties can encourage potential partners and allies to join U.S. coalitions, our results suggest that even allies do not universally join U.S. coalitions. As a result, the United States cannot and should not assume partner or ally support when conducting contingency planning.
Where does the United States stand on building the relationships it needs to support future coalitions? The answer varies by region. In Europe, the United States has strong political and military ties, formal alliances, deep trade relationships, and strong cultural connections, but there are concerns that even this might not be enough to guarantee support in the face of a major conflict. In the Middle East, the U.S. position is more uncertain. The United States has several partnerships but no formal alliances. Economic ties are stronger: The United States is a major trading partner of the region and funnels substantial military assistance to the region, in the form of foreign military sales and training and other support. Cultural ties to the United States are weaker, and past U.S. actions have engendered animosity in the region-more in some places than others. In the Pacific, the U.S. position is also fragile. The United States has several key military alliances in the region, but many other states have stringently avoided formal military relationships. Even close allies have shown hesitancy to anger or provoke China by drawing closer to the United States. Economic ties are strong; the United States is a major economic player in the region but is overshadowed by China in most situations. The U.S. decision not to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership looms large here; doing so would have built a strong set of economic ties that could have increased the odds of future coalition support. Finally, cultural ties are dominated by China in some places. The United States is already aware of the challenges that it might face in building coalition support in future conflicts with China and is working to close that gap. The findings in this report underscore the importance of that initiative and highlight the distance that the United States has to go in this area-but also the many different paths that the U.S. government could use to build the closer ties needed to support coalition membership.
There is some evidence that states seeking greater international status or influence might be primed for recruitment to a coalition, even if initially resistant. When forming coalitions, the United States should consider whether there are status-seeking states that might be willing to join without explicit or implicit payments or side payments.
Although we tested this hypothesis only with qualitative data, we found some evidence of states joining to advance their own status or standing in several of the intervention case studies we considered. In most of these situations, the partners in question were smaller states seeking to advance their place on the international stage. This was true in the coalitions formed in the Gulf War and to fight ISIS. In the post-World War II occupation of Japan, as another example, Australia and other members of the BCOF saw the intervention as a way to gain international standing and sought to establish their roles as independent contributors. In other situations, even larger states, such as Canada in the case of the war in Afghanistan, have used participation in a coalition to advance national standing and reputation. In part, these efforts aim to win the favor of the United States or to solidify relationships on which they are economically or militarily dependent, but they also sought to give partners a place at the table and a larger voice on the international stage.
This notion that the United States might be able to leverage the desire of some states to advance their international status when building coalitions is one that deserves additional research, given the potential implications. Specifically, if the relationship observed in our research is one that can be generalized, then identifying those states most vulnerable to such appeals could be a useful means for the United States to extend and diversify future coalitions without significant costs. When thinking about possible future conflicts and the coalitions that would be needed to fight them, the European, Pacific, and Middle East theaters are very different. In each case, however, there are both smaller states that might seek more influence and rapidly rising states that might see coalition membership as a pathway to greater international political influence. Additional research in this area should (1) seek ways to test this relationship between status-seeking and coalition membership empirically and in a wider set of situations and (2) explore whether certain types of states are most likely to have status objectives.
IGO sponsorship or leadership might not be required for the formation of strong coalitions, but it can increase the willingness of potential contributors to join. Building and working through IGOs can help the United States successfully build coalitions for military interventions.
Our analysis shows that states are more likely to join military coalitions when there is an IGO sponsoring or leading the intervention. This result speaks to the importance of legitimacy when it comes to coalition formation. States do seem to be more willing to join coalitions when they have the approval of an international organization, such as NATO, the EU, or the AU. Our case studies show that IGO sponsorship is not a requirement, and coalitions have been successfully formed without having an IGO involved. However, our research also highlights the essential role that IGO involvement has played in numerous situations in building a diverse coalition and holding that coalition together in the face of challenges.
For the United States, building and working through IGOs might be one way to support the formation of diverse coalitions. Importantly, IGOs formed in one region can also serve as powerful legitimacy providers for interventions in other regions. For example, NATO has led interventions across the globe, and interventions supported by the UN have similarly spanned boundaries. IGOs can serve as the core foundation of an intervention and motivate wider participation. The United States does not have a similar Pacific-based, multilateral IGO that can support coalition formation in this way, and it is unlikely that the United States will be able to build such an organization in the region. Rather, it has a series of bilateral alliances that it must work through to achieve its aims, which could pose a vulnerability if a conflict in the region requires a coalition-led response. However, informal relationships could fill the gap. Exercises that bring multiple East Asian players together could be one way to foster multilateral ties, though perhaps not formal alliances. Furthermore, IGOs, such as NATO and the UN, can still provide some degree of support and legitimacy at the global level that could help build consensus around a coalition (though they could not provide logisti-cal support in the same way). When thinking about and planning for future interventions, the United States should consider more carefully and earlier how it will leverage IGO support to build strong coalitions. IGO sponsorship should be incorporated into operational planning and exercises. IGO support is not something that can be built overnight; it is something that requires significant investment and consensus-building. IGOs do have long-term value, however. To the extent that the United States seeks to continue to exert international influence, maintaining and working through IGOs might be one efficient and effective way to do it.
Our results on factors driving coalition success were among the weakest. We found that coalitions do not favor success compared with unilateral interventions (overall or across activity types), and the effects of past coalition experience and number of partners are mixed. We found some qualitative support for an argument that shared threats can support cohesion and ultimately success, and we observed that shared threats seem more important than shared objectives in many situations. With only five case studies, we must be careful about generalizing, but our results suggest a few recommendations of Army planners.
Although coalitions can be beneficial and support success at achieving U.S. political objectives in some situations, there is no guarantee that they will be more effective than unilateral interventions.
Our analysis shows that although coalitions can have benefits-in terms of legitimacy gained or operational resources acquired-there is no guarantee that they will be any more effective than a unilateral intervention. Similarly, although large and diverse coalitions can bring benefits, they also bring significant challenges that can work against successful achievement of key objectives. Although the decision to enter into a coalition might be one of necessity, the choice of coalition structure, partners, and processes can play a role in determining whether an intervention achieves U.S. political objectives or does not. There are some interventions that are better conducted as coalitions and others that must be done in that way. One example of the former is the Global Coalition Against ISIS, a coalition that required regional support to be as effective as it was. Examples of the latter are large conflicts, such as the World Wars and (to a lesser extent) the Korean War, which required partners to meet operational requirements. In each of these instances, the challenges of coalitions were worth shouldering for the benefits they provided. However, there are coalitions that have been less effective at achieving key objectives, such as the one in Afghanistan (despite its size and diverse membership). The key to coalition success seems to be ensuring that the right partners are involved; this might mean not only partners that can con-tribute larger numbers of forces but also small countries that can contribute essential niche or specialized capabilities. The number of partners might matter less for the United States than having key partners whose support and commitment are essential to good coalition outcomes. For example, in the case of Afghanistan, the first part of the intervention was largely unilateral but benefited from the support of key Afghan warlord partners who provided legitimacy.

We do not suggest that past interventions conducted as coalitions that did not succeed should have been unilateral, and we do not argue for more unilateral interventions. Instead, our argument is that coalitions should be formed with a clear view of which partners are needed, why, and what role each coalition partner will serve. It should be a highly intentional and reasoned decision that recognizes the limits of the coalition and has realistic expectations; decisions should not be based on who is available or willing. In this view, coalition partners are not interchangeable. Rather, each partner serves a very specific function that supports intervention success. Therefore, operational plans for future contingencies should explicitly consider which coalition partners will be required and what their roles should be, and the U.S. military should then seek to build and exercise these relationships. In many situations, the most-important partners are not the ones with the most military resources but the ones that bring regional access and support. When a conflict breaks out, it is too late to think about which partners are needed and which roles must be filled. Planning is likely to be haphazard and coalition membership based on who is available and acts fastest. Advance planning also might help remove uncertainty about which partners might support a coalition in various contexts. However, the ability to have such conversations might be limited with some partners. For example, it would be easier to have these discussions in Europe than it would in the Pacific, where possible partners are more fearful of China.
Having some kind of shared interest, such as a perceived or real threat or desired end state, is important to coalition formation and success, but states also can-and do-have their own national objectives.
We observed in our case studies that coalitions were often formed around a shared set of interests or desired end states but that partners often also had divergent objectives. Examples are the objectives of the French and Italian forces in the EFP deployment (although sharing the concern about the Russian threat, they sought to advance national interests by joining the coalition) and of Turkey in the coalition against ISIS.
Shared interests, such as a shared threat or overarching desired outcome (e.g., defeating ISIS, removing Saddam from Kuwait), are important to coalition formation but even more central to the ability of coalitions to achieve that outcome. (This is not to be confused with separate national-level objectives that might also exist, such as status-seeking, building ties with the United States, or operational experience.) In particular, we found that coalitions that shared a common threat and common view of that threat tended to have several advantages in terms of cohesion, communication, and commitment, although those that lacked such a shared threat tended to suffer from conflicting motivations, communication challenges, and failure to coordinate. For example, one of the reasons that the Global Coalition Against ISIS was so successful was that even as partners had varied and conflicting individual motives, they all shared a perception that the threat posed by ISIS was severe and immediate. This shared sense of the threat and understanding that action had to be immediate allowed for an expanded membership and allowed the diverse coalition to hang together for an extended period. The Gulf War coalition similarly benefited from a very clear and shared sense of threat. Nations differed in their specific objectives, and even in what they thought the end goals of the intervention should be, but they shared the sense that turning back Saddam's aggression was essential both to uphold international norms and to prevent a cascade of aggression. On the other hand, in other interventions we considered, coalition partners did not share a common threat or at least a common view of a threat. In the instances of Afghanistan and the EFP deployments, coalition partners differed in their experiences and perceptions of the threat's severity. These different perceptions created cracks and fissures that undermined coalition success.
Considering current threats, the United States faces challenges in both Europe and the Pacific in building a coalition with a common perception of the threat. We have already described the conflicting views of the Russian threat among NATO and EU partners. Similarly, in the Pacific, different Asian allies have different views of the threat posed by China, and this might be an impediment to forming closer partnerships in the region. One way to works toward stronger partnerships and to support the development of a future coalition might be to encourage the development of a common view of the threat posed by China. The U.S. Army might be able to play a role here through military exchanges and talks and through longer-term efforts in information-sharing aimed at creating a common language and definition of the threat posed by China to the United States and its partners in the region.
Experience with fighting as a coalition can support success at achieving U.S. political objectives. The U.S. Army should continue efforts to train and exercise with potential future partners but emphasize innovation over routine.
Our analysis shows that past experience training or fighting as a coalition can provide advantages that support success in future operations. This is not a surprising finding; we would expect that past experience operating as a coalition would yield better interoperability and communication and that past experience also supports the development of processes and procedures that can make coalitions function effectively. Although our quantitative analysis had ambiguous results, our qualitative case studies provide examples of the benefits of experience. The best example is perhaps the Gulf War, in which past experience in coalitions and exercises supported ground, air, and naval operations and contributed to the achievement of key objectives. Past experience in this case also helped overcome the challenges created by the diversity and size of the coalition. In the Global Coalition Against ISIS, the United States was able to rely on its close NATO partners and literally decades of experience to support operations. Past experience was specifically useful in supporting communication, sharing operational responsibility, and facilitating operational support and logistics. We also have examples in which lack of coalition experience undermined an intervention-specifically, the new partnerships in the post-World War II occupation of Japan.
However, it is also clear that past experience does not guarantee success at achieving U.S. objectives and can even serve as an impediment if past practice stifles innovation. Afghanistan is a good example of such an instance. Specifically, past NATO operations and training had focused on a very different type of conflict and a very different type of adversary. As a result, the coalition faced challenges as it sought to adapt to a COIN mission against a nontraditional adversary and to take on stabilization and nation-building tasks.
Still, these instances seem to indicate that, on net, the benefits of experience outweigh the downsides. The United States should not assume past practice or exercises will guarantee favorable outcomes, but it should continue to invest in training and exercises with allies, partners, and potential partners. It is worth noting that past interventions have benefited not only from experience with formal allies but also from exercises conducted with frequent partners. As the U.S. military faces increasing financial pressure and cuts, the value of training and exercises should not be overlooked or downplayed. Investments in this type of experience today can pay off in the future. At the same time, training should be structured to ensure adaptability to multiple operating environments, which means it likely needs to be revised and updated often to factor in unexpected challenges and demands. The United States is already working toward developing better training to support future operations-for example, events such as the Defender series in Europe, Pacific Defender, and Pacific Pathways. These types of exercises are the type that our analysis suggests would be useful to future coalitions, and our analysis encourages their continuation despite resource pressures.

The foundation of this analysis is a dataset that has evolved over the course of recent RAND Arroyo Center research focused on historical trends in U.S. military interventions and projections of future demand for U.S. ground forces.

This codebook is intended to supplement the methodological discussion presented in Chapter Three; it provides a more comprehensive discussion of the challenges, choices, and decisions involved in the data collection and coding processes, and it defines in fuller detail the variables in the dataset. It is divided into five sections. The first outlines some of the source material. The second describes definitional issues involving military and coalition interventions generally and our approach to constructing the case universe of U.S. coalition interventions between 1946 and 2018. The third section explains the rationale and approach for distinguishing between major and minor coalition contributors in the coding of this dataset. The fourth provides additional information on other important coding decisions rendered in the construction of the case universe and coding of individual variables. The final section summarizes the four different coalition-level and major contributor-level configurations of the dataset (which permit quantitative analyses both annually and in aggregate), and it details and defines all of the variables coded in each of the four organizational permutations of the dataset. In Appendix B, we provide a full list of U.S. coalition and noncoalition interventions between 1946 and 2018.
• Shawn P. Creamer, "The United Nations Command and the Sending States,"
International Journal of Korean Studies, Vol. 21, No. 2, 2017.  • Jacob Neufeld and George Watson, Jr., eds., Coalition Air Warfare in the Korean  War, 1950-1953, Washington,  In our foundational dataset (from which we which we circumscribed the universe of U.S. coalitions), the theoretical definition of a military intervention employed is specific to the type of forces used and the activities conducted by those forces. That is, in constructing the historical universe of U.S. military interventions, missions could qualify based (independently) on deployments in the ground, air, or naval domains. Specifically, we examined the following:
• ground forces domain. We defined a U.S. ground intervention to include any deployment of U.S. soldiers from the United States to another sovereign country that met or exceeded a size threshold of at least "100 person-years" in manpower requirement equivalence (in additional to satisfying certain activity type criteria, as described later). This ground force size threshold could constitute, for instance, 100 personnel deployed for one year or a larger number of forces deployed for a shorter period of time (i.e., 200 personnel deployed for six months or 1,200 personnel deployed for one month). We used this threshold because of its utility for force planners; on the one hand, it errs on the side of case inclusiveness-that is, it sets a relatively low bar for inclusion, even for coalition partners with small militaries. On the other hand, it excludes more-minor deployments and contributions that are unlikely to matter as much for force structure and coalition contingency planning purposes. 3 • naval forces domain. We defined a U.S. naval intervention (in the post-World War II era) to include any deployment of sailors and marines satisfying at least one of two criteria: (1) the positioning or movement of a carrier strike group (or force size equivalent) to a theater of crisis or conflict (i.e., for purposes other than regular naval exercises or fleet readiness) and/or (2) the use of kinetic naval activities (e.g., firing of torpedoes or surface-to-air cannon fire, Tomahawk missiles). • air forces domain. We defined a U.S. air intervention (in the post-World War II era) to include any deployment of airmen satisfying at least one of two criteria: (1) the positioning or movement of an approximate wing-year of aircraft (about 80 planes for 12 months, or force size equivalent) to a theater of crisis or conflict (i.e., for purposes other than regular air exercises or air-defense readiness) and/or (2) the use of kinetic air activities (i.e., substantial firing of air-to-air or air-to-ground missiles or close air-support canon fire).
4
In addition, to meet the definition of a military intervention (generally) in the RAND U.S. Military Intervention Dataset on which this effort was modeled, the foreign-deployed forces needed to be engaged in at least one of the ten activity types listed in Box A.1.
The primary reason for this activity type parameter in our definition of military interventions is to exclude from the dataset general forward deployments constituting the permanent U.S. posture footprint abroad (e.g., long-term baselines of peacetime garrisons, logistics and support hubs, weapons depots).
5
After these definitional criteria were established for the coalition intervention dataset, our data-collection efforts proceeded in three phases. First, we had to identify the subset of all historical U.S. interventions in which partners collaborated for a common action. Second, we had to identify the list of all partners involved in these coalition situations and determine the major and minor contributors in each case (described in the next section). Third, for all major contributors and in aggregate, we had to code the ground, air, and naval force sizes, activity types, and other coalition variables pertinent to each case (described in the final section of this appendix).
During the first phase of data construction, multiple coders from our research team reviewed every U.S. military intervention between 1946 and 2018 (N = 115) to identify potentially qualifying coalition situations. To merit inclusion, a case had to involve U.S. military forces working in operational and/or strategic coordination with the armed forces of at least one other foreign-deployed country; the partner deployment also had to satisfy our definition of a military intervention as already described (i.e., qualifying activity type and minimum size threshold of 100 person-years). 
6
7
Second, and often relatedly, in several instances we found insufficient evidence of operational and/or strategic coordination between different international contingents on the ground to constitute a coalition per se (i.e., to satisfy the definitional component "for a common action"). This was true, for instance, in several recent and ongoing U.S. counterterrorism operations in central and eastern Africa (e.g., Combined Joint Task Force-Africa, multinational efforts to defeat Boko Haram in Lake Chad Basin). In these instances, we found evidence of other forces (often apparently special forces) deployed in the same theater of operations for common purposes (e.g., French, Italian, British, German, and Japanese contingents in Djibouti, Kenya, and elsewhere), but no 6 At least one partner nation had to meet these basic size thresholds individually for the case to be considered a coalition; that is, in a few borderline situations, the total number of non-U.S. troops deployed exceeded the 100 person-year threshold, even though no countries individually deployed more than 100 troops. This was particularly common among humanitarian and disaster relief situations. In such instances, the U.S. intervention would not be considered as part of a coalition; rather, the U.S. deployment would be coded as a unilateral intervention.

The most-difficult methodological challenge in constructing the RUCID case universe was how to build a manageable set of coalition partners. Consider, for instance, very large coalitions-such as the U.S.-led occupation of Afghanistan, in which some 50 countries contributed military troops to ISAF and OEF and dozens more provided support in other forms (i.e., civilian and police training, military equipment and sales, economic and humanitarian aid, diplomatic and political support). On a practical level, it would have been infeasible for our team to code every single partner in all 39 coalitions in full detail within the scope of our project resources. At the same time, the often symbolic contributions of token partners-for instance, the OEF contributions of such countries as Austria, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, El Salvador, Iceland, Ireland, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Malaysia, Slovenia, Singapore, Tonga, Ukraine, and the UAE, none of which ever committed more than 100 military personnel to Afghanistan-are of secondary interest to military planners. The primary research design challenge, therefore, was to establish a methodologically defensible approach for defining and coding major contributors relative to minor ones.
To these ends, the RAND research team tested multiple coding schemes across different case studies to determine appropriately inclusive criteria for defining major contributors (who would be coded in full in the partner dataset) versus minor contributors (whose participation would be recorded in aggregate coalition-level data but would not be coded in full in the partner dataset). Ultimately, to merit inclusion as a major contributor, non-U.S. partners had to satisfy several conditions. These parameters were designed to be consistent with our definition of military intervention as already described while also scoping the list of all contributors in each coalition to those assuming the lion's share of the military, economic, and political burdens.
First, the partner nation had to provide support in the form of military personnel; countries that provided only military equipment, civilian advisers and trainers, economic assistance or humanitarian aid, or similar limited measures did not qualify as major contributors. Second, the partner nation forces had to be foreign-deployed.

• ground forces domain. We defined a major ground force contributor as any country with a deployment of soldiers to another sovereign country that met or exceeded 100 person-years-plus two additional parameters: The troops must have deployed for at least 25 percent of the duration of the coalition and must have constituted at least 5 percent of the total non-U.S. troops.
12
Thus, to qualify as an intervention on the basis of the non-U.S. naval or air forces involved, the deployment had to involve either the use of kinetic naval or air power (as in the U.S. criteria) or the presence of a substantial portion of the partner's naval or air forces, albeit far less than a carrier strike group or wing-year equivalent-specifically, about 5 percent of the non-U.S. coalition total. Although this size threshold proved to be relatively low in the context of most coalitions (i.e., usually fewer than 2-3 ships or 7-12 aircraft), it yielded very few instances of partner naval or air interventions exclusive of qualifying ground interventions. Stated another way, we found that if a partner nation was providing in excess of 5 percent of non-U.S. aircraft and/or ships, that country was, in most instances, providing in excess of 5 percent of non-U.S. ground forces as well. Likewise, our research found only a few instances of coalition partners conducting kinetic air or naval activities but not independently qualifying based on the size criteria for ground, air, or naval contributions. 
13
Consequently, we explored using a percentage threshold rather than an absolute threshold for distinguishing between partner participation levels. We began by testing 5-percent, 10-percent, and 25-percent size thresholds on two large coalition situations: OIF and OEF. It quickly became apparent that thresholds of 10 percent or higher would be too restrictive for the purposes of our analyses; using the Iraq example again, total non-U.S. (and nonhost) forces peaked at about 25,000, implying a peak 10-percent threshold of about 2,500 troops, which only five countries exceeded during the war (Italy, Poland, South Korea, Romania, and the United Kingdom). On the other hand, lowering the bar marginally to 4 percent or 3 percent added only one or two borderline countries as major contributors. Finally, we tested these size parameters on several smaller coalitions (e.g., Haiti, Somalia, and Grenada), and we found that they were also properly scoped for what we observed to be relatively similar deploymentdistribution patterns between major and minor partners in most coalitions.
Additionally, we explored imposing a percentage threshold for the duration of the deployment to isolate aberrations in which relatively unimportant partners technically exceeded the size threshold but were quickly drawn down. Using the same process already described, we tested 10-percent, 25-percent, and 50-percent duration thresholds on OIF and OEF and quickly realized that 50 percent was too stringent of a requirement but that 25 percent appropriately scoped the borderline instances. Next, as the final refinement for qualifying as a major contributor based on ground force criteria, we needed to decide whether countries should be required to exceed the 5-percent size threshold and the 25-percent duration threshold-or whether they should be required to exceed the 5-percent size threshold for 25 percent of the duration of the coalition (or some other duration between 0 and 25 percent). As already noted, the reason for this subcriterion was that we found that some borderline instances in which countries might exceed the 5-percent size threshold for only a month or two in a multiyear coalition. We therefore considered three possible permutations:
1. weakest permutation ("5 AND 25"): To be considered a major contributor, the nation's deployment of troops must have exceeded 5 percent of total non-U.S. forces at any given point (i.e., if even for just one month or one year) and exceeded 25 percent of the duration of the coalition. This option would yield the largest number of major contributors. 2. strongest permutation ("5 FOR 25"): To be considered a major contributor, the nation's deployment of troops must have exceeded 5 percent of total non-U.S. forces for at least 25 percent of the duration of the coalition. This option would yield the fewest number of major contributors. 3. middling permutation ("5 FOR 10 [AND 25]"): To be considered a major contributor, the nation's deployment of troops must have exceeded 5 percent of total non-U.S. forces for at least some shorter percentage of the duration of the coalition-say 10 percent-and the nation's deployment must have exceeded 25 percent of the duration of the coalition in total (though not necessarily above 5 percent). This option would yield a midlevel number of major contributors.
We tested these three coding options against multiple cases-three of which are summarized in Table 
A
During this dataset construction process, we encountered several additional methodological and case-specific challenges, which we note here. 14 First, as a general caveat, collecting granular data on historical force deployment data across more than 100 countries over nearly 80 years is a difficult proposition for several reasons. Chief among these are data availability issues, particularly from official foreign military sources. Relatedly, we note that it was generally more challenging to collect quantitative data on partner naval and air contributions than on ground force deployments. Official statistics are generally widely available from IGOs, such as the UN and NATO, but official data on ad hoc coalitions and coalitions conducted under the auspices of other international organizations are often more elusive. This is particularly true of older coalitions, such as those in the immediate post-World War II era. At the same time, we were surprised to discover a dearth of reputable comprehensive statistical reference resources on coalition sizes and compositions (generally). As one notable exception, we acknowledge the earlier RAND work of Larson, et al., which was highly relevant in quantifying air and naval contributions to post-Cold War coalitions. 
15
16
Second, aside from general data availability issues, estimating and aggregating ground force troop numbers can be challenging for two broad methodological reasons. Different sources might offer different estimates for the same year; this might be a data reliability issue. Alternatively, and more commonly, deployment sizes of national contingents vary widely throughout a given month, year, and coalition life cycle. For these reasons, at every level of analysis (i.e., in aggregate and annually), our dataset provides high, low, and best estimates of coalition and major contributor ground forces. In most situations, aggregate "best" estimates represent the average of annual "best" estimates, while "high" and "low" estimates represent the peak and trough of a coalition or major contributor's manpower deployments.
Third, treatment of host nation forces created several conceptual difficulties. Through one lens, for instance, we reasoned that host nation troops battling in combat or COIN alongside foreign interveners should be counted in the quantitative analyses of coalition force sizes. During the Korean War, for example, the host nation forces were virtually wiped out at the start of the UN-authorized coalition intervention. But between 1950 and 1953, the South Korean armed forces grew from some 80,000 to 600,000, nearly doubling the more than 300,000 U.S. forces on the peninsula at war's end. In this instance, excluding the host nation forces could significantly bias some statistical results. On the other hand, including these forces as coalition members would be to violate a key definitional component of a military intervention-specifically, that the forces be foreign-deployed. 
17
To resolve these issues, therefore, host nation forces are not included in the quantitative findings presented in this report unless otherwise specified in the statistical analysis. However, for the benefit of future academics and defense planners, host nation contributions (e.g., force sizes, activity types) are coded separately in the dataset. The dataset structure (as we will describe in more detail) is thus designed to allow future dataset users to include or exclude host nation troops in their analyses, depending on the relevance to their line of research.
Fourth, linkage of contiguous and/or overlapping missions under different authorities sometimes proved pragmatically challenging to code. The start and end dates of U.S. military interventions occasionally align neatly with those of an associated coalition intervention-for instance, U.S. boots were the first ones into Iraq in March 2003 and the last ones out in December 2011. More commonly, however, this is not the case. U.S. forces often withdraw before a coalition intervention is complete (e.g., Vietnam, Bosnia)-or deploy before or after a coalition is assembled (e.g., Haiti and Croatia, respectively). More to the point, many (perhaps even most) coalitions evolve under the leadership of distinct, rehatted authorities over many years.
The essential methodological problem was thus: Should distinctly different phases of overlapping missions be coded as a single, contiguous coalition intervention or as several discrete coalitions sometimes with different core members? The case of Haiti (1994) is illustrative of the problem. The United States entered unilaterally with more than 20,000 troops, then briefly took control of an ad hoc multinational coalition (MNF-Haiti), and then turned over control to a series of three UN military missions. 
18
17
Fifth, we offer a few additional coding notes and observations regarding activity types. We coded activity types for both coalitions in aggregate and major contributors individually; typically, these activity types align, but they do not always do so. In some instances, a major contributor might have national caveats or restrictions placed on the use of its forces, and it might be conducting humanitarian activities or stabilization activities while the broader coalition is engaged primarily in combat or COIN operations. Similarly, the dataset is designed to feature separate activity type codings for each coalition (and major contributor) in the land, sea, and air domains. In a given case, a coalition's (or major contributor's) ground forces might primarily be conducting combat operations while its naval and air forces are primarily engaged in enforcing maritime embargoes or no-fly zones (i.e., interdiction activities) or providing transport-and-lift or ISR support. To these ends, every domain (land, sea, air) at both the aggregate-coalition and individual contributor levels is coded with up to three activity types, allowing for analysis of primary, secondary, and tertiary activity types. Finally, we note that the country-year level configuration of the dataset permits variance in activity over time within given interventions. For instance, a country might start a coalition in a strictly advisory or assistance role and then become more deeply involved in combat, COIN, or stabilization activities; similarly, coalition partners might use only kinetic air or naval power in one or two years of a conflict but deploy their maritime or naval forces to other ends throughout said coalition. The dataset, therefore, permits a high degree of granularity in statistical analysis of activity types by contributor and service branch over time and across coalitions and noncoalitions alike.
Sixth, regarding case dates and durations, we note that all post-World War II cases are coded as beginning on January 1, 1946 rather than on Victory in Europe or Victory in Japan Days. The primary reason for this decision was because most of the immediate U.S. demobilization from the occupation zones was completed by the end of 1945; therefore, by beginning our case universe in 1946, we can in part avoid fallaciously exaggerating peak postwar troop numbers devoted to stabilization operations. Relatedly, for ongoing coalitions, duration lengths are calculated through December 31, 2018. When precise start or end dates are unknown for a coalition or a major contributor's entry and exit from the coalition, yearly data are used instead. For instance, if Georgian troops were first known to have deployed to OEF in 2010 but the precise day or month was unknown, then the duration of their deployment would be calculated beginning January 1, 2010; likewise, if precise withdrawal dates within a given year are unknown, the end date of the deployment would be calculated as December 31 of that year. Because of this coding convention, the data might slightly overestimate or underestimate the monthly durations of some operations and national deployments.
The final configuration of RUCID contains iterations of the data organized along four distinct levels, or lenses of observation, covering the period from 1946 to 2018:

With state fixed effects, we include a parameter for each state and remove its timeinvariant propensity to contribute.
To elaborate further, state fixed effects allow us to observe how within-state variation affects the likelihood of coalition participation. The fixed effects control for all state-specific characteristics, both observed and unobserved. Continuing with the Canadian example, we can use an explanatory variable that researchers might hypothesize influences coalition participation: trade between the United States and the potential contributor (which is Canada in this case). Let's assume, perhaps unrealistically, that trade does not influence a state's decision to join a U.S. coalition. Canada is a perennial ally of the United States and often joins U.S.-led coalitions. Additionally, Canada and the United States also have high levels of trade. A naïve parsimonious regression model might infer that trade induces participation where no such relationship exists. Recall our earlier assumption. The fixed-effects model controls for the fact that Canada and the United States have strong economic ties and those ties have existed for the entirety of the sample (1946-2018). Instead the fixed-effects approach tests whether increases (or decreases) from the average level of trade between the United States and Canada in turn increase (or decrease) the likelihood of coalition support. Although this technique has distinct advantages, it has one noteworthy shortcoming: Because all of the observed and unobserved timeinvariant characteristics of the state are effectively removed through the fixed effects, we cannot estimate the impact of variables that are fixed over time.
For example, the fixed-effects model cannot estimate the effect of cultural ties; the proxy (percentage of the population that speaks English) does not vary over time. We cannot observe deviations from the time-invariant mean because it does not deviate over time. This failure represents a limitation; it would be interesting to observe how cultural ties influence the likelihood of coalition participation in the fixed-effects model, which is a crucial tool in the empiricist's toolkit and often used to identify causal effects of explanatory variables. The fixed-effects estimates are found in column 2 in Table 
C
If too much variance is explained by the other predictors, it might signal that xi is collinear, which in turn jeopardizes estimation of model coefficients and standard errors. A more detailed explanation of derivation can be found in several statistics and econo-metrics texts, such as Practical Regression and Anova Using R.

The lasso technique does not produce test statistics for covariates; therefore, these columns are blank. The selected covariates are COIN, deterrence, stability, territorial claims, and average annual U.S. troops. In columns 4 and 5, we present estimates of the identical models on another measure of success: the change in per capita income in the target state(s) over the proceeding five years. The selected covariates are advisory, no ground component, stability, territorial claims, Central America region indicator, and the count of U.S. troops.

Per this document,A coalition is an arrangement between two or more nations for common action. Coalitions are typically ad hoc; formed by different nations, often with different objectives; usually for a single problem or issue, while addressing a narrow sector of common interest. Operations conducted with units from two or more coalition members are referred to as coalition operations. (p. I-1)
4 Air and naval size limits vary according to the time and resources available. For the United States in the post-Cold War period, for instance, we consider only carrier strike group deployments for naval operations, air-wing deployments for air forces, and any kinetic activity. At other periods when such criteria would not apply, we instead considered the proportion of total available air and naval forces. We discuss the coding criteria in more detail in Chapter Three and Appendix A.
As described in more detail in Chapter Three and Appendix A, states could also qualify as major contributors in the air and naval domains by conducting kinetic strikes and attacks or by contributing approximately 5 percent of total non-U.S. aircraft or ships.

Included in forward presence are not only garrisoned peacetime troops at main operating bases (that is, absent a clear deterrent purpose) but also personnel at long-term logistics and support hubs, overseas weapon depots, and other locations. Other excluded activity types include noncombatant evacuation operations and paramilitary operations, such as covert actions conducted by civilian intelligence agencies, contractors, mercenaries, and nonstate actors.

To merit inclusion in the universe of coalitions, a case had to involve U.S. military forces working in operational and/or strategic coordination with the armed forces of at least one other foreign-deployed country; in addition, the partner deployment had to satisfy our definition of a military intervention as described (i.e., qualifying activity type and minimum size threshold of 100 person-years)
.6  For additional information on situations that were closely examined but considered definitional near misses, see the section "Defining the U.S. Coalition Intervention Universe" in Appendix
A.7  See our codebook in Appendix A for a more detailed discussion of the process by which we defined and distinguished between major and minor contributors-and how subsequent decisions were rendered for in-depth coding of so-called major partners.
IISS, The Military Balance, Abingdon, United Kingdom: Routledge, 1961-2018.   
As an additional subcriterion, major partners were required to exceed 5 percent of total non-U.S. (and nonhost) forces for at least 10 percent of the duration of the coalition. The concern motivating this condition was to exclude borderline instances in which a country might cross the threshold exceeding 5 percent of total non-U.S. troops for a very short period, such as during the waning months of a coalition after other major contributors have withdrawn. In practice, this subcriterion was rarely invoked during the coding process.
Although this size threshold proved to be relatively low in the context of most coalitions (i.e., usually fewer than 2-3 ships or 7-12 aircraft), it yielded very few instances of partner naval or air interventions exclusive of qualifying ground interventions. That is to say, we found that if a partner nation was providing in excess of 5 percent of non-U.S. aircraft and/or ships, that country was, in most instances, providing in excess of 5 percent of non-U.S. ground forces as well. Likewise, our research found only a few instances of coalition partners conducting kinetic air or naval activities but not independently qualifying based on the size criteria for ground, air, or naval contributions
.12  As one exception to the dearth of sources containing centralized air and naval coalition statistics, we note the work of Eric V. Larson, Gustav Lindstrom, Myron Hura, Ken Gardiner, Jim Keffer, and William Little, Interoperability of U.S. and NATO Allied Forces: Supporting Data and Case Studies, Santa Monica, Calif.: RAND Corporation,MR-1603-AF, 2003.   
Important coding challenges and decisions are discussed in detail in Appendix A. More-granular case-by-case notes are embedded in the raw dataset.
See Appendix B for additional data on these coalitions, such as aggregate force sizes and complete lists of major and minor partners.
For instance, throughout CJTF-HOA, French, Italian, British, German, and Japanese troops have been deployed to Djibouti, Kenya, and elsewhere in the subcontinent theater of operations for the common purpose of defeating transnational terrorist organizations, such as al-Shabaab and Boko Haram; however, we found no clear evidence (at least at the unclassified level) that U.S. and foreign militaries were coordinating beyond perhaps intelligence-sharing and regular regional training exercises. That being the case, this does not meet our definition of coalition action. At the same time, U.S. forces were typically conducting multiple bilateral train-andassist missions with regional militaries as part of larger counterterrorism-oriented deployments in this handful of instances, but host African nations were not typically operating under the umbrella of a foreign-deployed international coalition. Stated more broadly, our coding standards exclude from the U.S. coalition case universe any borderline interventions in which U.S. troops were deployed to a country at the same time as one or more other foreign militaries but during which time these foreign forces did not cooperate operationally and/or
strategically.

Although Italy did not provide troops to the coalition's combat ground operation in the period from October to December, it did deploy an aircraft carrier (along with France and the United Kingdom) and thus qualified as a coalition member (according to our definition) based on its naval contributions.

2017; and Kavanagh et al., 2019.   
As discussed in Chapter One, there were several reasons for focusing on only on post-World War II interventions. First, the geopolitical situation in the first half of the 20th century was significantly different from the latter half and that of today. As a result, interventions during that earlier period provide insights that are less useful for military planners. Second, coalitions themselves were less common for the United States in the period before World War II. Military alliances were relevant, but there were fewer international organizations tying countries together and less emphasis on multilateralism in military operations generally. Furthermore, a great deal of U.S. military activity during this period was focused on the Central and South American region, where European military powers were less involved. Finally, the data we needed to collect and then use in our analyses are less available for the period before 1946.
3 Although this method permits a manageable set of incidents for purposes of analysis, it is admittedly imperfect. The threshold of 100 person-years means that we omitted from consideration any number of smaller-scale adversary deployments of military forces that could, because of their circumstances, be substantively interesting. We nevertheless upheld the threshold as a useful means of focusing attention on larger operations that could hold more-salient implications for DoD and help ensure a more consistent comparison of military interventions across states and over time.
For purposes of this dataset, airstrikes or combat close air support conducted by naval fighter aircraft (or U.S. Air Force fighters launching from carrier strike groups) are considered kinetic air activities rather than kinetic naval activities.
Also excluded are noncombatant evacuation operations and paramilitary operations, such as covert actions conducted by civilian intelligence agencies, contractors, mercenaries, and nonstate actors.
This coding rule was also occasionally invoked to exclude certain would-be partners from coalitions when adversarial countries were deployed to the same theater but operated without jointness. For instance, an early Cold War application was our decision to exclude the Soviet Union as a major coalition partner during the Allied administration of the occupied zones of Germany and Austria after World War II. For the same reason, we excluded Iran (and Russia) from the more recent anti-ISIS U.S.-led coalition in Iraq and Syria.Relatedly, we excluded U.S. involvement in the Greek Civil War from the coalition case universe because U.S. forces replaced British advisers; we did not find historical evidence of coordination between the two powers per se.
By contrast, several operations that were primarily air interventions were coded as coalitions, including the Berlin Airlift, monitoring of northern and southern no-fly zones over Iraq after the Gulf War, and NATO air campaigns in the 1990s and 2000s against Bosnia, Kosovo, and Libya.
In a handful of instances, this parameter complicated the data-collection process. For instance, during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, many analyses consider all of the forces of Gulf State partners as part of the coalition, even though many of these troops never deployed beyond their borders. Taking Saudi Arabia during Desert Storm as an example, our approach endeavored to count the tens of thousands of Saudi troops who crossed into Kuwait in January 1991, but not (at least in theory) the thousands more amassed on the Iraqi border, who remained on Saudi soil. Similarly, during Desert Shield, many sources count the combined GCC armed forces as part of the coalition (some 65,000-75,000 total), of which perhaps only 3,000-5,000 appear to have deployed beyond Bahrain, Qatar, Oman, or the UAE; our approach counts these foreign-deployed forces as part of the coalition but excludes the domestically garrisoned forces, even though they might have served a deterrent function in coordination with coalition objectives
.11  As an initial potential solution to this problem, we first attempted to use a standard that consistently compared approximately equivalent proportions of each state's individual naval and air inventories. Unfortunately, in the coalition context of dozens and dozens of potential partners, this approach proved to be methodologically infeasible.
As an additional subcriterion, major partners were required to exceed 5 percent of total non-U.S. (and nonhost) forces for at least 10 percent of the duration of the coalition. The concern motivating this condition was to exclude borderline instances in which a country might cross the threshold exceeding 5 percent of total non-U.S. troops for a very short period, such as during the waning months of a coalition after other major contributors have withdrawn. In practice, this subcriterion was rarely invoked during the coding process.
  13  One notable exception includes the deployment of South African fighter pilots during the Korean War. The deployment of the so-called Flying Cheetahs qualified as a South African air intervention based on the merits of the unit's kinetic air activities, even though the deployment size was less than 5 percent of total coalition aircraft and despite the fact that South Africa deployed no naval or ground forces to the theater of operations.
For a similar discussion of important coding decisions made in the construction of the original U.S. military interventions dataset, seeKavanagh et al., 2019, Appendix A.   
Larson et al., 2003.
The publications used to construct the original dataset of U.S. interventions since 1898 are too numerous to cite here, but we found many to be particularly relevant as general references. See, for instance,
Cobble, Gaffney, and Gorenburg, 2003;
Siegel, 1991;
U.S. Air Force, 2015;
Note that the four versions of the dataset are linked by a "coalition_id" field that is consistent across these permutations of the data presentation; likewise, an "intervention_id" field permits compatibility with existing RAND research in this series of efforts.

9/11 peer competitors, such as Russia and China. Operations against these competitors are likely to have both a high level of threat and high operational demands, and the United States will almost certainly have to build and work through coalitions.
The quantitative and qualitative evidence described here provides clear support for two of the five hypotheses and limited to mixed support for the other three. Box 4.7 summarizes the results. Evidence appears strongest for the roles played by operational demand and international legitimacy. First, the United States clearly relies on coalitions to spread the costs of an intervention, to fill niche capabilities that it could not support on its own, and to share large operational burdens that exceed U.S. capacity or what the United States is willing to commit. Even in the face of significant threats to U.S. interests, the United States has used coalitions to spread the operational burden. Second, there are many examples of the United States using coalitions to win international support and legitimacy and to build regional legitimacy that facilitates the intervention. In the post-World War II period, the international legitimacy motivation has outweighed concerns about operational burden in decisions to form coalitions, but this will not always be the case. Furthermore, U.S. use of coalitions has increased in the post-Cold War period and this might reflect heightened concerns about legitimacy and an expanding norm of multilateralism.
Support is more mixed for arguments about the role of coalitions as a way to gain necessary access and logistical or sustainment support. We do not find significant quantitative evidence for such an argument, and our case studies suggest that decisions about coalitions and efforts to gain necessary access and permissions are largely separate

Larson, Gustav Lindstrom, Myron Hura, Ken Gardiner, Jim  Such cross-cutting reference materials were particularly useful for capturing newer and U.S.-centric data. In most instances, however, the quantitative dataset was constructed using supplementary coalition-specific and partner-specific data sources. For instance, as but one case illustration, the following resources were consulted to quantify annual changes in partner ground, air, and naval force contributions to the Korean War and post-armistice coalition:
• Gordon Rottman, Korean War Order of Battle: United States, United Nations, and  Communist Ground, Naval, and Air Forces, 1950-1953, Westport, Conn.: Praeger  Publishers, 2002.         
In this appendix, we provide some additional details on the statistical models used in this report and some additional summary statistics, diagnostics, and robustness tests.
Tables C.1-C.6 contain summary statistics and tables of pairwise correlations for both the intervention-level and the potential partner-level data, both for the "all country pool" and "criteria-selected country pool."
In Tables C.7-C.10, we show raw coefficients from several empirical models. Some show the original analysis described in the main report; others test the robustness of the findings by varying the model or estimator. In addition to the logit models used in Chapters Four and Five, we also test those hypotheses in linear probability models. Linear probability models are simply standard linear models in which the outcome is binary and the parameters are estimated through least squares regressions. Although logit is the more "appropriate" model of probability, and therefore presented in the body of this report, linear probability models also have useful characteristics. OLS regression is a computationally simple routine and opens a wider array of postestimation commands in the Stata suite.
For instance, OLS regression permits easy estimation of parameters in fixedeffects regressions. We use state-level fixed effects in our analysis of the determinants of coalition support-primary analysis is described in Chapter Five. State fixed effects mitigate omitted variable bias by removing each potential partner's timeinvariant characteristics. Individual states (e.g., Canada or Iran) might have a higher (in Iran's case, lower) propensity to join U.S.-led coalitions. The propensity is specific to Canada's or Iran's unique relationship with the United States and not the myriad determinants we test (e.g., shared interest, economic or military ties).
