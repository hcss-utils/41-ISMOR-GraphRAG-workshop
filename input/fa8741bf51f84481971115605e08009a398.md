The first issue to address when analyzing fighter mix options is whether the USAF should replace its current front-line air superiority fighter, the F-15C, with new models of the same design or with the stealthy F-22?
The answer that emerged from our analysis was robust.
Unless one can rule out the possibility of conflict with such adversaries as China or Russia-both states deploying substantial numbers of fourth-generation fighters-the capabilities the F-22 provides are essential to success in future conflicts.
Without such capabilities, particularly the ability to take the first shot from beyond the range of the enemy's air-to-air radars, too much time and too many U.S. aircraft will be lost trying to defeat the enemy's fighter force.
As a result, territory and ground forces will be lost to the enemy attack, resulting in the loss of the opening phase of the conflict.
Because success in these scenarios was not possible without sizable numbers of F-22s, we did not examine options that reduced the currently planned buy of the F-22A.
