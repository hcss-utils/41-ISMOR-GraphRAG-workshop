Rus sian analysis of the changing nature of warfare and interpretations of political warfare draw from at least three sources.
First, Russian observers have carefully analyzed U.S. activities for signs of the changing nature of warfare and the potential Western threat to Russia.
For example, Rus sian officials highlight the threat of U.S.-backed color revolutions, which in their view demonstrate how the United States has utilized nonmilitary tactics, sometimes backed by military force, to achieve its objectives of regime change.

the United States has developed a new method of warfare, beginning with using non-military tactics to change opposing governments through colored revolutions that utilize the protest potential of the population to engineer peaceful regime change" (Gorenburg, 2014).
