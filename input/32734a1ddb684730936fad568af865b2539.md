Both the Israelis and the Russians have fielded heavy armored personnel carriers (APCs) to overcome the demonstrated inadequacies of lightly armored APCs.
The Russian BMP-2 proved vulnerable to Chechen rocket propelled grenades (RPG), and the Israeli's US built M113 fell short of the challenge in the 1982 war in Lebanon against the same weapons.
The Russian BTR-T heavy APC and the Israeli Achzarit heavy assault carrier are both based on the old Soviet T-54 or T-55 cast steel hull with turret and main gun removed.
Engine horsepower has increased, as has troop carrying capacity.
The Achzarit is reputed to have advanced composite armor as well.
The BTR-T will likely be fitted with Kontakt-5 explosive reactive armor.
