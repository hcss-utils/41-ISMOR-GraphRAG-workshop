The likes of China and Russia are emphasizing the latter attribute in their quest to negate U.S. military superiority in wartime.
For instance, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is believed to have drawn up plans involving forces attacking from multiple dimensions-land, surface, sub-surface, and air-and vectors to overwhelm U.S. maritime forces.
This involves pitting high-density, cheaper, and more expendable assets against the U.S. Navy battle force, which largely has the opposite of these characteristics and the magazine capacities of which could be depleted rapidly during a high-intensity missile exchange.
James Holmes and Toshi Yoshihara note that "PLA saturation attacks will involve the concerted use of cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic missiles; aerial attack from manned and unmanned warplanes, mines; torpedo attack; electronic warfare and cyber warfare."
