There are only a handful of remaining regional powers that possess the capability and sophistication to continue developing and producing what is commonly referred to as fifth-generation weaponry capable of threatening the state-of-the-art air force of the US; fortunately, none of them (e.g., Britain, France, Israel, Russia, Ukraine) are currently hostile to the US, and the likelihood of military action between the US and any of these states in the near-term remains low.
Many other states possess advanced weaponry that has been exported to them from the US or these other originator states (e.g., China, India, Abu Dhabi, etc.),
however there, too, the likelihood of US military action is currently low.
Analysts instead suggest that the countries the US would most likely find itself conducting war in or against in the next ten years are the Third World nations where regimes are either incapable of or unwilling to stomp out terrorist elements within their borders.
These are the countries where the US will most likely find itself involved in military action, but these are also often countries that have little capability to threaten a First World air force.
