Russia observed with great concern the rise of fascism on two fronts in Germany in the West and Japan in the East.
Russia had fallen to a one-front war in World War I when allied with the world's wealthiest nations.
This time it was diplomatically isolated and had yet to recover from the combined effects of World War I and the Russian Civil War.
In the 1930s, it tried to set up Germany to fight the West so that Russia could play the role of a jackal state late in the war.
In fact, when Russia joined with Germany in 1939 to destroy Poland and divide Eastern Europe, it allowed Germany to acquire the resource base necessary to go to war.
Germany then turned on Russia, the real target of its ambitions, as Adolf Hitler had made so clear in Mein Kampf, a book Joseph Stalin should have read, but apparently did not.
So Russian strategy was disastrous in Europe.
