U.S. forces were deployed at their highest levels after World War II in three conflicts-the Korean, Vietnam, and Gulf Wars.
In situations short of actual combat during the Cold War, the largest concentrations were in Europe, particularly Germany.
This was understandable, given that the bulk of Soviet military power was in Europe, including Russia west of the Urals, with the bestequipped forces massed in Germany.
In view of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the withdrawal of former Soviet forces from Central and Eastern Europe, the continuing shift in U.S. overseas commerce from a transatlantic to a transpacific emphasis, the increase in military and economic potential in Asia (notably in Japan, China, and India), and the dangerous situation in Korea, the continued concentration of U.S. forces in Asia might appear more likely than the retention of significant force levels in Europe.
But the Gulf War and subsequent events have shown a continuing interest in Middle East oil.
The political obstacles to prepositioning equipment and basing forces in large numbers in this region constitute one of the many arguments for sustaining the U.S. military presence in Europe.
