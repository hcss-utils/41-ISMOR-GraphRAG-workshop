In November of 2016 there was not only the election of Donald Trump-who did not agree with this new approach to Cuba-but also the death of Fidel Castro, who though he stepped down as the President of Cuba in 2008, was still the largest figure in Cuban politics.
The fact that the attacks occurred right around this time might be a coincidence but it's not unreasonable to think that Russia might have carried them out as a way to torpedo the warming of ties between the United States and Cuba.
Even if that wasn't what was intended, it does not detract from the fact that the Havana Syndrome attacks did contribute to the cooling of ties between the countries and the serious scale-back of personnel at the U.S. Embassy.
In other words, whether it was intended or not, the Cuba example demonstrates just how much of an impact these cases can have on U.S. interests.
