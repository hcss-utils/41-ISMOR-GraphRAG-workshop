Enduring Strategic Rivalries: Great Britain vs. France during the French Wars (1792-1815) soning the recently taken city of Buenos Aires and recapturing the Cape of Good Hope.
In the Mediterranean, some 6,000 British troops sailed from Sicily to take Alexandria.
This appeared to be a repeat of the colonial campaigns that the British waged in the West and East Indies while their allies fought the French in Europe during the Wars of the First and Second Coalition.
Although little actual colonial expansion occurred after 1803 due to the high cost of campaigning in the disease-ridden West Indies, such unilateral actions never pleased Britain's coalition partners, particularly Tsar Alexander.
Consequently, just as Napoleon had to devise an alternate maritime economic strategy to compete with Britain, London likewise needed to comprehensively reassess its strategy despite the success it had produced in previous conflicts such as the Seven Years' War.
As it stood, Britain's traditional strategy failed in the French Wars to protect either the Low Countries or the Baltic, and British freedom of action in the Mediterranean was considerably restricted due to the exacting costs of blockading the French Empire and the threat now posed by the Russians.
