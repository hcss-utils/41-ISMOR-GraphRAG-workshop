This paper is the second part of a larger study the principal purpose of which is to determine the trajectory of China's nuclear weapons policy, strategy, capability and doctrine. Building on the first paper, which provided a benchmark for comparative analysis in the form of an overview of the evolution of US nuclear strategy since the end of the Second World War, this paper discusses the origins of China's nuclear strategy; its view of deterrence; what certain elements of its declaratory policy reveal about Beijing's nuclear strategy; and where that strategy appears to stand at present. The paper concludes that while the evolution of China's nuclear strategy bear some resemblance to Western patterns of nuclear evolution, the process has been largely unique; and that although Beijing will probably maintain an official commitment to minimal deterrence, China's nuclear strategy has progressed well beyond its declaratory policy, and is continuing to change rapidly. Further papers in this study will examine China's strategic nuclear forces, and investigate the principal drivers of China's declaratory policy, nuclear strategy, and nuclear doctrine. The study will conclude with a comprehensive report discussing the apparent trajectory of China's nuclear posture and the implications thereof for Canada and its allies, and suggesting directions for future research.

Introduction: This paper is the second part of a larger study the principal purpose of which is to determine the trajectory of China's nuclear weapons policy, strategy, capability and doctrine. Building on the first paper, which provided a benchmark for comparative analysis in the form of an overview of the evolution of US nuclear strategy since the end of the Second World War, this paper examines the evolution of China's nuclear strategy over the course of its half-century as a nuclear weapon state. The present study looks at the origins of China's nuclear strategy in classical military and political philosophy; the influence of Mao and his successors; how China has, over the course of its nuclear tenure, gradually come to grips with the concept of deterrence; what certain elements of China's declaratory nuclear policy (notably its no first-use policy, its approach to strategic arms control, and its stand on ballistic missile defences) reveal about its nuclear strategy; and where that strategy stands at present.
Results: China's nuclear strategy is grounded in classical military theory and informed by classical Chinese military philosophy to a greater degree than was the case in the US, and has been heavily influenced by Mao and his successors; by their ideological commitment to People's War; and by unique adaptations of Marxist-Leninist military theory. China's relationship with deterrence has been complex, ranging from disdain for nuclear "paper tigers" to an "existential" deterrent capability; then to a "minimal" deterrent based on a small number of inaccurate missiles carrying high-yield warheads; and finally, more recently, to what appears to be a "limited deterrent" based on some capacity for nuclear war-fighting. China has, for all intents and purposes, achieved a state of "essential equivalence" in nuclear capacity vis-à-vis potential adversaries, and as a consequence of its strategic force expansion and US strategic force reductions, is evolving towards parity.
Elements of China's declaratory policy (specifically, Beijing's no first-use (NFU) pledge; its approach to strategic arms control; and its view of ballistic missile defences) demonstrate a significant gap between Beijing's words and its deeds. China's NFU pledge is undermined by elements of strategy and doctrine that appear likely to permit first-use under circumstances where it would be strategically advantageous for China to do so; its arms control efforts appear to be designed less as instruments of international altruism than as a means of minimizing both China's strategic lacunae and the strategic advantages enjoyed by potential adversaries; and its strong opposition to missile defences as "destabilizing" is somewhat diluted by China's recent tests of anti-satellite and anti-ballistic missile weapons. China's nuclear evolution is more rapid and comprehensive than many observers appreciate. While China does not appear to be attempting to develop a genuine counterforce capability, Beijing is attempting to increase the number of options -including nuclear options -available to counter attempts by the US and others to interfere with realization of its strategic objectives within its area of interest and influence. Although it is not DRDC CORA TM 2011-156  iii clear at present where the trajectory of China's nuclear posture may be leading, Beijing is clearly no longer satisfied with its long-standing posture of minimum deterrence -if indeed it ever was.
For the sake of diplomacy, Beijing will likely continue to maintain a declaratory policy of "minimal deterrence". Its nuclear posture, however, is already well beyond that, and is continuing to change. While aspects of the transformation are likely to resemble (at least in part) some aspects of America's strategic nuclear evolution since 1945, the trajectory of China's strategic nuclear evolution since its first detonation nearly fifty years ago has been comparatively unique to date, and likely will continue to be so.
Significance and Future plans: With its enormous population and rapidly-expanding economy, and given present trends in US economic choices, China is widely expected to be one of the most important and influential states in the world over the coming decades. While China is and will almost certainly remain an important trading partner, however, China's political regime is both antithetical and antipathetic to Western liberal democracy, and China's regional (and perhaps eventually global) aspirations are a matter of some concern. The future trajectory of China's nuclear posture is therefore a matter of critical interest to the Department of National Defence and, more broadly, to the Government of Canada.
The next (third) paper in this study will examine and assess the current status of China's strategic nuclear forces, looking both at extant systems and their capabilities and the programmes that are currently under way to update, upgrade or augment them. The fourth paper will attempt to discern the factors and influences that constitute the fundamental drivers of China's declaratory policy, strategy and doctrine in the nuclear domain. All of the papers produced in the course of this study will be compiled in a capstone paper that will offer an assessment of the likely trajectory of China's nuclear posture; propose recommendations for Canada and for allied states as they attempt to come to grips with the challenges and opportunities offered by China in the years ahead; and identify useful directions for further research into China's strategic intentions and capabilities.

Introduction: Ce document est le deuxième volet d'une étude plus large dont l'objet principal est de déterminer la trajectoire de la Chine en matière de politique des armes nucléaires, la stratégie, la capacité et la doctrine. S'appuyant sur le premier document, qui a fourni un point de repère pour l'analyse comparative sous la forme d'un aperçu de l'évolution de la stratégie nucléaire américaine depuis le fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, cette étude examine l'évolution de la stratégie nucléaire de la Chine au cours de sa moitié siècle comme un Etat doté d'armes nucléaires. La présente étude se penche sur les origines de la stratégie nucléaire de la Chine dans la philosophie politique et militaire classique, l'influence de Mao et de ses successeurs, comment la Chine a, au cours de son mandat nucléaires, progressivement venir à bout de la notion de dissuasion, ce que certains éléments de la politique nucléaire de la Chine déclaratoire (notamment son pas de politique de première utilisation, son approche de la maîtrise des armements stratégiques, et sa position sur les moyens de défense contre les missiles balistiques) révèle sur sa stratégie nucléaire, et où cette stratégie est à l'heure actuelle.
Résultats: La stratégie nucléaire de la Chine est fondée sur la théorie militaire classique et éclairé par la philosophie classique militaire oriental à un degré plus élevé que ce fut le cas aux États-Unis, et a été fortement influencée Mao et ses successeurs, de par leur engagement idéologique à la guerre populaire, et par adaptations uniques de la théorie militaire marxiste-léniniste. relations de la Chine avec la dissuasion a été complexe, allant de dédain pour le nucléaire "tigres de papier" à une capacité de dissuasion «existentielle», puis à un "minimum" de dissuasion basée sur un petit nombre de missiles imprécis transporter des ogives à haut rendement, et enfin, plus récemment, à ce qui semble être une «force de dissuasion limitée" sur la base des capacités nucléaires de combat. La Chine a, pour toutes fins utiles, réalisé un état de «l'équivalence essentielle» de la capacité nucléaire vis-à-vis des adversaires potentiels, et en conséquence de son expansion stratégique de la force et la réduction des forces stratégiques des États-Unis, est l'évolution vers la parité.
Les éléments de la politique déclaratoire de la Chine (plus précisément, Pékin n'est pas le premier engagement d'utilisation, son approche de la maîtrise des armements stratégiques, et son point de vue des moyens de défense contre les missiles balistiques) montrent un écart important entre les mots de Beijing et de ses actes. gage NFU Chine est miné par des éléments de la stratégie et la doctrine qui semble susceptible de permettre la première utilisation dans des circonstances où il serait stratégiquement avantageux pour la Chine de le faire; ses efforts de maîtrise des armements semble être conçu moins comme des instruments de l'altruisme international que comme un les moyens de minimiser les lacunes stratégiques de la Chine et les avantages stratégiques dont bénéficient les adversaires potentiels, et sa ferme opposition à la défense antimissile de "déstabilisation" est quelque peu diluée par des essais récents de la Chine de l'anti-satellite et des armes anti-missiles balistiques. L'évolution nucléaire de la Chine est plus rapide et plus complet DRDC CORA TM 2011-156 v que de nombreux observateurs apprécient. Alors que la Chine ne semble pas être de tenter de développer une capacité de contre-véritable, Pékin tente d'accroître le nombre d'options -y compris l'option nucléaire -disponible pour s'opposer aux tentatives des États-Unis et d'autres d'interférer avec la réalisation de ses objectifs stratégiques dans son domaine de d'intérêt et d'influence. Bien qu'il n'est pas clair à l'heure actuelle où la trajectoire de la posture nucléaire de la Chine peut être à la tête, Pékin n'est clairement pas plus satisfait de sa position de longue date de la dissuasion minimum -si tant est qu'elle l'a jamais été.
Par souci de diplomatie, Beijing va probablement continuer de maintenir une politique déclaratoire de la «dissuasion minimale». Sa posture nucléaire, en revanche, est déjà bien au-delà, et continue de changer. Bien que les aspects de la transformation sont susceptibles de ressembler à (au moins en partie) certains aspects de l'Amérique évolution stratégique nucléaire depuis 1945, la trajectoire de la Chine évolution nucléaire stratégique depuis sa première détonation près de cinquante ans a été relativement unique à ce jour, et probablement continuera de l'être.
Importance et plans pour l'avenir: Avec sa population énorme et en pleine expansion économique, et compte tenu des tendances actuelles dans les choix économiques américaines, la Chine est largement pressenti pour être l'un des états les plus importants et influents dans le monde au cours des prochaines décennies. Alors que la Chine est et restera presque certainement un partenaire commercial important, toutefois, le régime politique de la Chine est à la fois antithétiques et antipathiques à la démocratie libérale occidentale, et la Chine régionaux (et peutêtre éventuellement mondiale) aspirations sont un sujet de préoccupation. La trajectoire future de la position nucléaire de la Chine est donc une question d'intérêt critique pour le ministère de la Défense nationale et, plus largement, pour le gouvernement du Canada.
La prochaine (troisième) du papier de cette étude permettra d'examiner et d'évaluer l'état actuel de la Chine forces nucléaires stratégiques, la recherche à la fois les systèmes existants et à leurs capacités et les programmes qui sont actuellement en cours pour mettre à jour, améliorer ou augmenter leur. Le quatrième document va tenter de deviner les facteurs et les influences qui constituent les facteurs fondamentaux de la politique de la Chine, la stratégie déclaratoire et de la doctrine dans le domaine nucléaire. Tous les documents produits dans le cadre de cette étude seront compilés dans un document de couronnement qui offrira une évaluation de la trajectoire probable de la posture nucléaire de la Chine; de proposer des recommandations pour le Canada et les États alliés qui tentent de venir à bout des défis et les possibilités offertes par la Chine dans les années à venir, et dégager des orientations utiles pour la recherche plus loin dans les intentions stratégiques de la Chine et les capacités.

This paper is the second part of a larger study the principal purpose of which is to determine whether China's nuclear weapons policy, strategy, capability and doctrine should be matters of concern to the Department of National Defence (DND). The first paper, entitled China's evolving nuclear posture: Part I -Background and Benchmark, is available from the Centre for Operational Research and Analysis at Defence R&D Canada.
With its enormous population and rapidly-expanding economy, and given present trends in US economic choices, China is widely expected to be one of the most important and influential states in the world over the coming decades. While China is and will almost certainly remain an important trading partner, however, China's political regime is both antithetical and antipathetic to Western liberal democracy, and China's regional (and perhaps eventually global) aspirations are a matter of some concern. The future trajectory of China's nuclear posture is therefore a matter of critical interest to the Department of National Defence and, more broadly, to the Government of Canada.
This study is derived from and is intended to support the broader investigation of China's emergence as a great power under the aegis of the Applied Research Programme (ARP) project 10aa16 established under Partner Group (0), entitled The Rise of China: Strategic Assessment and Implications for Canadian Security. A preliminary strategic assessment of China published in May 2010 identified the scope and strategic intent of China's nuclear modernization programme as topics in need of further investigation and analysis. This study, of which this present paper is the second instalment, aims to do so.
As the fifth state to achieve a nuclear weapons capability and the last to obtain a permanent seat on the UN Security Council (UNSC), the People's Republic of China (hereafter PRC or China; Taiwan will be referred to throughout this study either as such, or as the Republic of China, or ROC) offers a unique case study in the evolution of nuclear policy, strategy, capability and doctrine. Unlike the US and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), China did not participate as such in either the bilateral arms race between the two superpowers; nor was it a key participant in the deterrent relationship characterized by thousands of cross-targeted strategic nuclear weapons that constituted the uneasy standoff commonly known as Mutual Assured Destruction, or MAD. Unlike Britain and France, respectively the third and fourth nuclear powers, however, China also did not occupy a subordinate position in a formal defensive alliance with one of the superpowers; its period of rapprochement vis-à-vis the Soviet Union was a matter of strategic convenience rather than fraternal sentiment between Marxists, and it endured only as long as Moscow remained willing to rattle its nuclear and conventional sabres to underwrite China's foreign policy objectives. By the time of Beijing's first nuclear detonation on 16 October 1964, such cooperation as remained between the two principal communist states was largely cosmetic; substantive cooperation between the USSR and the PRC was long over, and before the decade was out, the world's two largest 'fraternal socialist allies' would be blackguarding each other at every opportunity.
Finally, as a state with both an enormous land mass and an even more enormous population (and -as a consequence of Mao's 'People's War', the Chinese communist version of the Napoleonic levée en masse -an equally enormous conventional army), China has never in modern times faced a serious threat of invasion. Beijing's military rationale for joining the nuclear club has always been obscure and often internally inconsistent, and thus its political rationale has more often been the principle subject of decryption and analysis -the more so because the regime's dogged opacity complicates empirical analysis and, consequently, encourages speculation.
While a good deal of attention has been paid to China's nuclear weapons, power and propulsion technologies, most of the strategic analysis surrounding China's nuclear thinking has focussed on the diverse but intimately interconnected domains of policy, strategy and doctrine. Each of these areas of study poses different challenges, and each, as a necessary first step, demands definition. Policy, for the purposes of this study, will be understood to be the stated intent of government -a concept that, where nuclear weapons are concerned, is usually articulated as declaratory policy, because our understanding of it is derived almost exclusively from declarations made by the government that is the subject of our investigation. Policy is generally easy to investigate and analyze, because governments make a point of telling us what their policy is, often in considerable detail. The principal difficulties with analysis of policy are two-fold: first, the government in question may be lying, which is to say that its policy, by definition produced for public consumption, may not reflect its actual intent; and second, even if its policy does reflect the government's intent, that intent may be misunderstood by analysts lacking an in-depth knowledge of the cultural and historical context underlying policy, which may lead to miscomprehension of the role of policy as a mechanism for internal and external dissemination of a specific government message. Also, policy may change without warning, either as a result of a conscious decision by the government, or by a change in the nature of the government. As a guide to future behaviour, therefore, policy is deceptively mercurial.
Focussing less on policy and more on doctrine, however, does not solve or even simplify the problem. In its proper military context, doctrine as a rule describes how a military force intends to fight, and is primarily derived from its theory for conducting operations and its capabilities, which are in turn a function of its structure, manpower and equipment. How that force does fight, however, is invariably situation-dependent and is subject to innumerable external influences (among which the actions of the enemy are not always the most important), not the least of which is policy itself, i.e., constraints resulting from political decisions taken without reference to the dictates of doctrine or even the operational situation. Moreover, actual military doctrineespecially doctrine for sensitive military endeavours like covert surveillance, the activities of Special Forces personnel, and operations involving nuclear forces -tends to be highly classified. As a result, any doctrine that is not classified is -like policy -more likely to be either patently obvious, unimportant, intended for public consumption, or intended to deceive a potential adversary. Thus doctrine, too, is a fickle and imprecise guide to analysis.
The key frailty of studies aimed solely at policy and doctrine lies in the obscure, insubstantial and often transitory nature of the subject matter, and analysis thereof is vulnerable to governmental opacity, rapid and unpredictable change, prevarication both chronic and acute, deception, and situational ad-hocery imposed upon a combatant par la force des choses. Moreover -and this is a 2 DRDC CORA TM 2011-156 point that will be investigated further in the course of this study -both policy and doctrine are highly subjective topics that owe far more to the historical and cultural contexts and antecedents of their imaginers than is generally acknowledged. Accordingly, while this study will examine both China's nuclear policy and its nuclear doctrine, its principal focus -and, indeed, the point of reference against which conclusions relating to policy and doctrine will be checked for relevance and accuracy -will be China's nuclear strategy.
The advantage of focussing on strategy derives from its grounding in objective rather than subjective factors. This is especially true where nuclear strategy is concerned. What a nuclear weapon state (NWS) is or is not likely to do in time of crisis is determined to a large extent by what it can and cannot do -and these considerations in turn derive largely from constraints imposed by the state of technology and the shape and characteristics of the physical world. By examining what is known, what is probable, and what is possible in terms of a state's technological capacity, force structure and posture, weapons systems, and military R&D in the context of its location and geography, its people and resources, its neighbours, and its past and present conduct, it is possible to define a variety of probable strategic trajectories for that state, and select therefrom those (or even the one) most likely to describe its preferred path toward its desired end-state. Furthermore, by comparing that path to policy and doctrine as articulated by the target state, it is possible to validate (or falsify) the inferred strategic trajectory -cognizant always, of course, of the fact that elements of policy and doctrine may be an exercise in deliberate deception designed to conceal the state's strategic path, rather than serve as sign-posts pointing it out.
The research contained in this report has been limited largely to secondary source material due to institutional resource constraints. This paper, and all other papers prepared in this ARP, are constrained by the lack of access to primary source material (including Mandarin language sources and/or translation services), as well as a lack of opportunity for in-country research. Consequently, while every effort has been made to ensure that the present work meets acceptable scholarly standards, these constraints impose inescapable limitations that cannot be overcome without the provision of additional resources. Therefore, the results of this study should not be regarded as authoritative, but the best judgement of the author based upon his/her experience and the research material at hand.
A note on nomenclature. The Wade-Giles transliteration of Chinese characters that came into use in the second half of the 19 th Century has been largely superseded by the Pinyin system. This has the potential to lead to some minor confusion, as many historical figures are known to the West typically in their Wade-Giles format (e.g., Mao Tse-tung and Chiang Kai-shek, who in Pinyin are known respectively as Mao Zedong and Jiang Jieshi). The problem is even more pronounced in the case of legendary individuals; the ancient Chinese military writer Sun Tzu, for example, is also referred to as Sun-Tsu, Sun-Tse, Sun-Tsi, and -in Pinyin -as Sunzi. For the sake of simplicity and consistency and in order to avoid unnecessary confusion, I will adhere throughout this paper to Pinyin transliteration, with Wade-Giles used only for illustrative purposes.
As noted above, China's nuclear trajectory since its decision shortly after the establishment of the PRC to become a NWS has its foundations in a wide variety of historical and cultural wellsprings, and differs considerably from the nuclear trajectories of the other Permanent Five members of the UNSC (and for that matter from all other NWS, both acknowledged and unacknowledged). The first paper in this study established a benchmark for the evolution of nuclear strategy in order to set the scene for this present paper, which will examine how China's version thereof is generally understood to have developed since Mao's regime first decided to create a domestic nuclear weapons capability; and for the third paper, which will examine the current state, modernization and likely trajectory of China's nuclear capability. While the first paper identified a variety of significant caveats that complicate (in some cases rather significantly) drawing any meaningful comparisons between the US and Chinese evolutionary experiences, the use of the US experience as a benchmark establishes a helpful timeline for comparison; introduced the concepts and ideas against which China's nuclear thinking, rightly or wrongly, tends to be compared; and established the Western, which is to say the American, baseline of nuclear strategy -a crucial consideration given that China's strategic development, especially over the past twenty years, evolved largely with the US occupying the role of most likely adversary.
This present paper, as the second part of this larger study, will examine how China's nuclear strategy has evolved over the past half-century, using the evolution of US nuclear strategy as a standard for comparison. It will begin with an examination of the classical roots of Chinese military thought, and from that foundation proceed to a discussion of how those roots appear to have been moulded both by China's more recent history; by the experience of the victorious Maoist faction both in China's civil war and in the war against the Japanese occupiers; by communist, Marxist and Maoist thought; and by the evolution of Soviet and American nuclear capabilities and strategy and experience. The paper will examine China's complex and uneasy relationship with the concept of nuclear deterrence, and will address controversial and often contradictory aspects of Beijing's declaratory policy, including its policies on strategic arms control and disarmament, ballistic missile defence, counterforce, and no-first-use.
From the foundation provided by the first and second papers, the next (third) paper in this study will offer an objective overview of China's evolving strategic capability, a category of military power that comprises not just nuclear weapons but rather all of the offensive, defensive, command and control and asymmetric technologies necessary to engage in nuclear operations visà-vis China's key potential adversary -which, from China's perspective, is at present the United States. This will include an appreciation not only of China's warheads and delivery systems, but also of its capacity to manage nuclear operations; its pursuit of asymmetric force multipliers designed to exploit the inherent weaknesses of American nuclear and conventional weapons systems; its alleged preparations, both conceptual and practical, for nuclear war-fighting; and its growing embrace of allegedly destabilizing technologies like ballistic missile defence.
Having discussed China's strategic thinking and its strategic nuclear capabilities, the fourth paper will attempt to derive and articulate the principal drivers of China's nuclear strategy -the key factors that have influenced its evolution over the half-century since China's nuclear programme got under way, and that are likely to influence that programme, at least for the foreseeable future. Four categories of influence will be discussed: the advancement of China's strategic interests, including self-defence; the gradual (and quite deliberate) displacement of Marxist/Maoist ideology by an increasingly emphatic nationalism; the enduring irritant of Taiwan; and the central importance of the US, in particular its role in the Western Pacific, and throughout Asia writ large.
These individual papers, once complete, will be compiled in a final report that will attempt to derive from the conclusions reached in the course of this project an assessment of what seems to be the most probable strategic path for China's ongoing evolution as a nuclear weapon state.
Having identified the key conceptual and technological waypoints in China's nuclear policy, strategy, capability and doctrine, the goal of this final report will be to articulate a best-fit trajectory that incorporates and explains to the greatest extent feasible all of the data observed to date. As with any attempt to project future events from a comprehensive analysis of historical trends, the aim is not to pretend to oracular precision with respect to the future shape of the international security environment (which, as with any complex interdependent nonlinear system, is by definition impossible), but rather to offer a rough projection of where, ceteris paribus, China's strategic ambitions are likely to take China's nuclear thought and capability over the near term; to identify areas for further research; and to suggest the sorts of sign-posts that present and future analysts ought to look for in order to determine whether China is still following the anticipated path, or whether -as has happened so often in the past -the political masters of the Middle Kingdom, seeing two roads diverge in a wood, have decided to follow the one less traveled by.
This study forms part of the broader investigation of China's re-emergence as a key great power under the aegis of the Applied Research Project (ARP) 10aa16, established in April 2009, entitled The Rise of China: Strategic Assessment and Implications for Canadian Security. This project seeks to answer three basic questions: (1) Is the current trajectory of China's rise likely to continue? (2) What are the implications for the international order? (3) What are the implications for Canadian security? The research contained in this report has been limited largely to secondary source material due to institutional resource constraints. This paper, and all other papers prepared in this ARP, are constrained by the lack of access to primary source material (including Mandarin language sources and/or translation services), as well as a lack of opportunity for in-country research. Consequently, while every effort has been made to ensure that the present work meets acceptable scholarly standards, these constraints impose inescapable limitations that cannot be overcome without the provision of additional resources. Therefore, the results of this study should not be regarded as authoritative, but the best judgement of the author based upon his/her experience and the research material at hand.
One of the chief impediments to any examination of the internal deliberations of a relatively opaque organization like the Communist Party of China (CPC) and its principal strategic and military decision-making entities is secrecy. All states keep secrets as a matter of course, and defence secrets tend to be among the most jealously guarded. Nuclear secrets are naturally handled with even greater care than the average breed of classified information, and totalitarian states tend to exercise a more rigorous degree of vigilance over information deemed to be potentially injurious to the interest of the state -and in such states, there is nothing like the pressure for transparency that tends to characterize the nuclear debate in free societies. As a consequence, substantive analysis of how China's nuclear capability, strategy and doctrine have evolved over the course of the past five decades had to wait for official government statements about the roles and missions of China's nuclear forces to become available.
This did not happen until 2006, when the Defence White Paper published that year by Beijing took the unprecedented step of discussing China's nuclear strategy in a document intended for public consumption.
1
China's nuclear strategy is subject to the state's nuclear policy and military strategy. Its fundamental goal is to deter other countries from using or threatening to use nuclear weapons against China. China remains firmly committed to the policy of no first use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances. It unconditionally undertakes not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, and stands for the comprehensive prohibition and complete elimination of nuclear weapons. China upholds the principles of counterattack in self-defense and limited development of nuclear weapons, and aims at building a lean and effective nuclear force capable of meeting national security needs. It endeavors to ensure the security and reliability of its nuclear weapons and maintains a credible nuclear deterrent force. China's nuclear force is under the direct command of the Central Military Commission (CMC). China exercises great restraint in developing its nuclear force. It has never entered into and will never enter into a nuclear arms race with any other country. 2
The 2006 White Paper went further, discussing the role of the PLA Navy in conducting "nuclear operations" and that of the Second Artillery Force in executing "strategic nuclear counterstrikes" This degree of clarity was something of a departure from previous practice. While the 2004 White Paper had made similar statements about the PLA Navy's SLBM force and Second Artillery's ballistic missile capabilities, its discussion of China's nuclear strategy had been limited to a reiteration of Beijing's no-first-use (NFU) policy, its negative security assurances (NSA) vis-à-vis non-nuclear weapon states (NNWS) and nuclear weapons-free zones (NWFZ), its support for nuclear non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament (NACD), and its promise never to engage in a nuclear arms race with any other state. 
3
While this was admittedly thin gruel, it was considerably more than had ever been made available to outside analysts, who had hitherto been forced to subsist on a relatively anaemic diet of distant observation and informed speculation. Absent definitive statements from the PLA or its political masters, the shape of Beijing's nuclear strategy remained obscure. Some understanding may be gleaned from articles penned (obviously, with official sanction) by senior military leaders and thinkers. Wang Zhongchun, both a Senior Colonel and a Professor at the PLA's National Defense University (as well as a former visiting scholar at the US Army's Strategic Studies Institute), laid out the strategic function of China's nuclear forces in a recent edition of China Security, arguing that "China's nuclear weapons play multiple strategic roles": First, nuclear weapons hold up China's power status and its position as one of the five permanent members of the United Nations. Second, as a retaliatory strategic force, nuclear weapons are an indispensable deterrent to those nuclear states that put China on their 'nuclear strike lists'. Finally, nuclear weapons, as 'an assassin's mace', can be used at a time when China's core national security and development interests are fundamentally undermined. 
5
Finally, the manner in which Wang formulates the third role of China's nuclear weapons is of particular significance, as it is the one that differs most substantially from the current nuclear strategy of other states. Wang is implying that Beijing would rattle its nuclear sabre in response not only to a threat to China's core national security interests, but also in response to a threat to China's "development interests". While foreign to Western principles of nuclear strategy, this is a logical consequence of China's security policy. The CPC has defined national development as its key priority, a long-standing policy deriving, as we shall see, from Mao's original decision to subordinate the development of nuclear weapons to the primordial goals of industrialization, urbanization and wealth creation. Any foreign action likely to threaten these goals, Wang argues, is by definition a threat to China's vital interests. The problem is that lacking further definition of terms, the scope for nuclear use by China is potentially very wide. "Development interests" is a broad definition that could, by extension, encompass not only inter-state conflict and the US-China dispute over Taiwan's future but also import-export policy and controls, access to energy, environmental degradation, domestic and civil stability, demographics, international banking and international monetary policy, the actions of the markets, and a whole host of other influences that could potentially undermine China's rise to regional (and eventually global) industrial, economic and political pre-eminence.
China's embrace of a larger and at the same time more interconnected role in the global economic and security architecture naturally complicates any discussion of its overall political and military strategy. The fact that China has been pursuing deeper and more substantive intermingling of this nature reflects Beijing's drive for influence now that the superpower rivalry has ended. For some time now, Chinese officials have been emphasizing the fact that "The Cold War is over," and arguing that, as a consequence, "the trend toward multipolarity is irreversible." 6 While Beijing never accepted the logic of America's self-proclaimed post-1989 'unipolar moment', the CPC at least adapted to the reality of American global pre-eminence. Twenty years later, China seems poised to reap the benefits of the relative transfer of influence resulting from America's economic woes. This shifting tableau makes assessing the course of China's nuclear strategic thought somewhat more challenging, and requires trying to understand the motivations and drivers of state behaviour in an historical and socio-cultural context that is deliberately opaque, linguistically unique, and extraordinarily difficult for outsiders to penetrate. The difficulty is complicated by the fact that even such information as has recently been made available -e.g., successive Defence White Papers -represents policy pronouncements released for public, and especially Western, consumption. These may be nothing more than an exercise in disinformation. Even if they genuinely represent Beijing's intentions, as noted in the introduction to this paper (and as allowed for in the methodology), intentions can change rapidly -much more rapidly than capabilities. This is the key reason that intentions and capabilities are dealt with separately in this project.
A cursory comparison of China's intentions as revealed in the documents that have been published with its emergent suite of capabilities suggests a significant gap between the former and the latter. China's declaratory policy does not appear to match up with either its capabilities or its force structure, and the gap seems to be growing. This disparity between words and deeds, as it were, underlies the arguments made by some observers who assess that, over the past several years, "there has been a shift from a posture of minimum deterrence to limited deterrence, wherein China acquires the necessary components required for a limited war-fighting capability." 7 Analysis aimed at defining, let alone understanding, the gap between a declaratory policy designed to support one set of options, and a suite of capabilities that seems to be designed to support a different set of options, must proceed from an acknowledgement of the discontinuities between China's present and historical understanding of strategy. As one writer has remarked, "…there is a Janus-like quality to the Chinese defence establishment, for it reflects two aspects of war and strategy. One face looks back to the People's War tradition of the PLA's past, while the other faces the complexities of strategic nuclear warfare and deterrence in the latter part of the twentieth century." 8 Understanding how the two faces of Chinese strategy are linked is key to any assessment of the possible future trajectories thereof.
Arguably, the problem is even more complicated than that, as the "face" of Chinese strategy that looks back is seeking philosophical referents not only in the Maoist tradition, but much deeper in antiquity -to the military thinkers of China's past. Senior Chinese political and military thinkers are swift to acknowledge -even boast -that their approach to strategy is heavily influenced by traditional Chinese military thinking. 9 For this reason, any discussion of China's approach to nuclear weapons and nuclear strategy must proceed from at least a cursory understanding of the foundation provided by these traditional approaches, and how that foundation was expanded upon, strengthened or weakened, or otherwise altered by the political and military doctrine of the Maoist era.
Structuring such an examination demands some sort of division, which if chronological must, given the inevitable overlaps, necessarily be somewhat artificial. The first logical division is into two periods: pre-and post-detonation. Indian analysts have posited four pre-detonation stages in the evolution of China's nuclear strategic thinking:
• A preparatory stage (1945-52), during which Beijing was "outwardly disparaging" of nuclear weapons, while at the same time working to adapt Mao's People's War theory to the new nuclear reality;
• A growing awareness of the implications of nuclear weapons (1953-56), during which China sought cooperation with and assistance from the Soviets, as well as shelter under the Soviet nuclear umbrella during the period when Washington's official nuclear doctrine, Massive Retaliation, did not differentiate between targets in the Soviet Union and "Red China";
10
• A firm decision to go nuclear (1957-60), first with Soviet assistance (until 1959, when it became apparent that Moscow was not going to simply hand stockpiles of weapons over to Beijing), and then on its own; and,
• The design and execution of a domestic nuclear weapons programme (1960-64): "a period of self-reliance, determination, and preparations for the first detonation." 11
The early development of China's nuclear strategy took place in this charged political environment, and continued after the first nuclear test had demonstrated China's nuclear capability. Two Chinese analysts divide the following four decades into three periods, one of which, they suggest, is only now beginning:
• "symbolic or existential deterrence" (1964-1980), during which period China possessed nuclear weapons, but with only very limited means of delivering them against strategic targets;
• minimum deterrence based on "quantitative ambiguity" (1980 to the present), during which period China leveraged a small but unknown number of deliverable strategic weapons to deter interference with its aims; and
• "credible and visible minimum nuclear deterrence" (from the present henceforth), during which period China, with growing confidence, technical skills, and strategic capabilities, and with an expanding role and stake in the international security architecture, needs to be more open about its national security interests and 'red-lines', and can afford to be. 
12
That said, producing a better chronology may prove difficult, and primary-source illumination is unlikely to be forthcoming. As the US Department of Defense (DOD) notes in its 2010 assessment of China's military capabilities,
The study of PLA views on strategy remains an inexact science, and outside observers have few direct insights into the formal strategies motivating China's force build-up, the leadership's thinking about the use of force, the contingency planning that shapes the PLA's force structure or doctrine, or the linkages 10 DRDC CORA TM 2011-156   between strategic pronouncements and actual policy decisions, especially in crisis situations. 
13
According to Chinese military officials, the three elements of traditional Chinese strategic wisdom are "the pursuit of peace, the high priority accorded national unity, and the emphasis on defense rather than offense." 
14
15
Our first port of call on this analytical odyssey is the above-mentioned notion of "traditional Chinese strategic wisdom", and how large a role such wisdom played in serving as the foundation for the evolution of China's contemporary political and military strategy as it pertains to nuclear weapons. The extent to which the political and military strategy of a state is influenced by classical strategic thought is naturally difficult to quantify; whole libraries are devoted to decrying the contributions to contemporary Western strategic thought of such luminaries as Caesar, Vegetius, Machiavelli, de Saxe, Gustavus Adolphus, Napoleon, Clausewitz, Jomini, Corbett, Mahan, Liddel-Hart, Chuikov…the list is virtually endless, and such condensed summaries of their respective input to what Hansen has termed the "Western way of war" are at best little more than distillations. In the case of China, however, the potential benefits of at least a cursory inquiry into the classical roots of contemporary strategic thought outweigh the effort demanded by the exercise, as it is generally accepted even among Chinese scholars that modern political and military strategists, especially since the Maoist take-over in the post-Second World War period, have had a marked tendency to look to classical thinkers for example and inspiration. Students of the formulation of Chinese strategy since 1945 tend to agree that the modern body of Chinese political and military strategy owes a great deal to three principal sources of influence: "(1) China's ancient military thought; (2) Mao Zedong's contribution; [and] (3) the Soviet influence through Marxism-Leninism." 
16
When Deng uttered ancient aphorisms, it was easy for Westerners to ignore the unfamiliar references, but consideration of the classical Chinese strategic corpus that he embraced raises questions that compel our attention… 17
The first source of inspiration for China's modern political and military strategy -its "ancient military thought" -has a number of points of origin, but those most commonly cited are the philosophers Lao Tzu (Laozi) and Chuang Tzu (Zhuangzi), and the military strategist Sun Tzu (Sunzi). 
18
(2) thought is more powerful than weapons (sixiang zhongyu bingqi); [and] (3) doctrine overcomes (bare) strength (daoshu shengyu qiangquan)." 
19
Students of classical military strategy tend to focus on a number of well-known thinkers whose contributions to the military art are deemed to stand apart from those of lesser-known strategists.
While the potential membership of this select group is vast, few would dispute that among the key names that continue to resurface in discussions of the roots of military strategy, about a halfdozen individuals qualify as primae inter pares. Carl von Clausewitz (Prussia), Henri Antoine de Jomini (France), Alfred Thayer Mahan (USA), Giulio Douhet (Italy), Sun Tzu (China), and Miyamoto Musashi (Japan) are generally considered the première military thinkers of their respective countries. 
20

21
Given his relative importance in Chinese literature, and taking into consideration the fact that his name and the principles he espoused are routinely cited by Chinese scholars and strategists in support of this or that concept or idea,
22
It would be a misrepresentation of Sun Tzu's writings to reduce his work, as has so often been done, to a series of disjointed acontextual aphorisms. That said, elements of his advice form the individual threads in a larger tapestry of general strategic principles, many of which are reflected in the broader "traditional wisdom" that is taken as the foundation of Chinese political and military strategy. The first of these, borrowing a phrase from more recent writers like Basil Liddel-Hart, is perhaps best termed the 'indirect approach'. Sun Tzu, for example, opined that while the "direct method" (the clash, or l'arme blanche, as Jomini put it) is required when joining battle, victory can only be assured through the application of "indirect methods" employed before battle begins. 
23
24
25
26
27
Another consistent, related theme in Sun Tzu's work is the emphasis that he places on deceiving the enemy; warfare, in his estimation, is grounded in deceiving the enemy (the usual formulation is "all warfare is based on deception," or "in war it is all about tricks," bing zhe guidao ye). 
28
29
Not so in the Middle Kingdom. As one Indian analyst puts it, "if there is one single concept that has influenced contemporary Chinese strategic behaviour, it has been that of deception." 
31
If the best-known of Clausewitz's strategic insights is that war and policy are indivisible components on a continuum, one of the best-known of Sun Tzu's principles is, if not the diametric opposite, at least jarringly tangential. The idea that excellence in warfare consists in "breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting" has often been posited as evidence of an inherent aversion to battle on the ancient strategist's part. 
33
This articulation of what might be termed a cognitive philosophy of conflict helps to explain the misperception that the works of Sun Tzu (and of his contemporary Mo Tzu, and for that matter of other Chinese philosophers and strategists of the period, like Chuang Tzu -who, among his other contributions to Taoist philosophy, lamented that life is limited, while knowledge to be gained is unlimited) are somehow opposed to conflict. Such an interpretation both misstates and overstates the case. The common thread between these philosophers is their conviction that intangibles can often count for more in war than measurable advantages. This idea has most often been stated as "mind over matter", a uniquely occidental phrase with so much paranormal baggage that using it as short-hand for a fundamentally philosophical precept causes more problems than it solves. It also mischaracterizes both the general thrust of much of China's military philosophy, which by and large accepts "warfare and conflict as relatively constant features" of the political landscapehardly a surprising conclusion given how many of China's ancient philosophers were writing during the Warring States period -and considers violence to be a "highly efficacious means for dealing with conflict."
35
What Sun Tzu seems to have been attempting to convey was the importance, amongst other things, of according primacy of place to thought over action; of emphasizing the mental over the physical; and of putting men before machines. Put that way, this is not as alien a concept to Western ears as might be supposed; no less a commander-in-chief than Bonaparte is said to have held that "the moral is to the material as three to one." This conceptual artery feeds much of China's ancient political and military thought, and informs "strategy" at all levels, from the tactical, where the commander is enjoined to pay attention to the loyalty and spirit of his troops, to the political, where (as Clausewitz would later counsel) the thrust and aims of war must be circumscribed by, responsive to, and designed to achieve the political goals of the state.
The object of this cognitive approach to strategy, according to more recent interpretations, is to ensure that the "mental" (conceptual, intellectual, moral, spiritual) facets of conflict are accorded different priority and emphasis than the "physical" facets thereof (weapons and equipment, wounds and death, distance and terrain and weather). A different philosopher might have counselled that the disparate elements of war be "harmonized" with one another, harmony being a "quintessentially Confucian" ideal. Good order in all things, according to the sum of China's guiding philosophy, "is the basis of prosperity and security…. Historically," the same author goes on to argue, "China has assimilated aggression, rolling with punches, overcoming hardness with softness. Where possible it has avoided taking the offensive. This is not to say, of course, that the Beijing government avoids coercion close to home….But it is to suggest that China prefers, particularly in a nuclear age, to use 'soft power 
' and 'smile diplomacy' abroad." 36
All of this begs the question: how well do such ancient precepts survive the transition from chariots, spears and swords to satellites, globe-spanning ballistic missiles, and thermonuclear weapons? One author has suggested a direct mapping of the old over the new, arguing that "if ancient Chinese military doctrines were transplanted to China's current nuclear posture, Sun Tzu would consider counter-value targeting as least desirable, counter-force only slightly better, counter-control targeting, although it does not have exact correspondence, yet a little better, with the highest form being counter-strategy." 38 While it may be enjoyable to indulge in speculative alternative history, it is too great a stretch to attempt to apply directly precepts taken out of context from ancient works to modern strategic problems, concepts and terminology. Sun Tzu's admonitions were not intended, for example, to limit civilian casualties; to the extent that he enjoins generals not to attack "walled cities", this is not to spare the occupants thereof the horrors of the inevitable rapine and pillage, but rather to avoid the needless expenditure of his soldiers' lives against a strong point designed specifically to absorb an assault while inflicting maximum damage on an attacker. Instead, Sun Tzu counselled taking strong points by means of deception, e.g., through the use of spies and turncoats. 
39
40
Under the general thrust of ancient Chinese philosophy, the acme of generalship would be achieving victory -defined as accomplishing China's strategic aims -without a single weapon being used, through the cautious and deliberate application of the indirect approach; deception; according primacy of place to intellectual and spiritual over purely physical factors; and through exemplifying the virtues of patience, adaptability, and "absolute flexibility." This, by and large, is how China has thus far conducted itself as a member of the nuclear club.

Assessing the impact of the classical military philosophers upon contemporary strategic thought: a rough quantitative approach
It is difficult to structure a comprehensive, empirical test of the widely-held belief that ancient philosophers and military thinkers play a more important role in contemporary Chinese political and military strategy than their Western counterparts play in contemporary Western political and military strategy. A new automated database created recently by Google, however, offers a unique means of examining this question.
For some years, Google has been engaged in a tremendously ambitious project: the digital scanning of every book ever published. Google's watershed insight into the problem of machine translation was to minimize context; to ignore the gestalt of a piece of text and look simply at the immediate context of words next to each other, to throw away the rules and examine only numerical patterns. Applying the same logic to the new database resulted in Google's "n-gram viewer", a trial piece of software still in the testing phase. In order to avoid copyright problems, the researcher who proposed the project to Google in 2007 -Erez Lieberman Aiden, a mathematician following a Ph.D. in genomics at Harvard -suggested converting the scanned book database into a n-gram database: "a map of the context and frequency of words across history."
41
The Google database currently consists of 2 trillion words taken from 15,000,000 books, or oneeighth of all of the books published in every language since the Gutenberg Bible was printed in 1450. To make it searchable, the database had to be converted into n-grams: unigrams (single words or word-character groups), bigrams (double words or word-character groups), trigrams, and so forth. This required the database developers to make decisions about how to deal with, for example, contractions, compound words, hyphenated words, apostrophes, and so on, with separate decisions made for each of the ten linguistic corpora under development. The full details of how they went about this task can be found in their paper. 
42
What is more interesting, however, are the relative "peaks" in popularity among the three. Lao Tzu was immensely popular in the waning days of the Republic but plummeted enormously during the rise of Mao and the communists. All three waxed in popularity during the decline in PRC-USSR relations and the rise of Chinese nationalism, and then plummeted again during the corrosive anti-intellectualism of the Cultural Revolution. They recovered again after Mao's death. Interestingly, while the political philosophers (Lao and Chuang) declined after the fall of the USSR, the military philosopher Sun Tzu did not; and all underwent a brief resurgence after 2000, before declining again near the end of the first decade of the 21 st Century.

Front), and never really recovered; while Musashi peaked twice, first during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-05), and second during the heavy penetration of the Japanese into the US financial and cultural industries in the late 1970s and early 1980s. English-language literature, 1900-2008   In order to ensure that this interpretation of the prevalence of Sun Tzu in English literature is not misrepresented by differences between the Wade-Giles, Pinyin and other transliterations of the antique gentleman's name, it is worth checking the prevalence of the three most common variations thereof in the English-language corpus: Sun Tzu, Sunzi, and Sun Tse. Figure

It appears from these comparisons that Sun Tzu never figured as prominently in Western literature as did his principle Western counterparts, remaining at a low level of prevalence throughout most of the 20 th Century. He only began to climb in importance after 1990, reaching roughly the same level of prominence as Musashi in the post-9/11 period. This contrasts sharply with Sun Tzu's impact in the Chinese literature of the past century, which, as noted above, grew strongly in the late 1950s and early 1960s, suffered a steep drop during the Cultural Revolution, strengthened again in the late 1970s, and grew even more around the turn of the present century.
Sun Tzu in Chinese Literature The impact is not really noticeable, however, until the Chinese and English corpuses are compared. While the results of such a database survey are rough at best, they at least provide some empirical support for the widely-held belief that the works of China's classical political and military thinkers have played a larger role in Chinese policy and strategy debates than their Western counterparts have played in similar debates in the English-speaking world. If nothing else, such data demonstrate that, as Newmyer puts it, there are indeed enduring "fundamental philosophical and political views that are reflected in the tradition and continue to shape the regime's behaviour around war and peace."
46
Most outstanding among the modern Chinese statesmen and strategists are Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, and Jiang Zemin. 
47
While propaganda in the service of regime perpetuation lies at the heart of the tendency to paint the supreme leader as a great military thinker (or even as a spiritual, if not necessarily actual, reincarnation of Caesar, as was the case with Napoleon), there is in such developments a more subtle driver: the conflation, deliberate or unconscious, of policy -the purview of statesmen, as expressed in the above citation -with strategy. In this connexion it is useful to recall the distinction between policy and strategy that was established in the first paper in the present series: policy is what a government, based on the whole vast gamut of political and other calculations, actually does; while strategy is what a government -based on "objective rather than subjective factors", including but not limited to the state's "technological capacity, force structure and posture, weapons systems, and military R&D in the context of its location and geography, its people and resources, its neighbours, and its past and present conduct" -ought, logically, to do. 
48
While Deng had extensive practical military experience, Mao's early influence and his role as the leader of an embryonic state locked in wars bother internal and external grant him primacy of place. It is therefore with Mao that we must begin if we are to understand how the modern Chinese approach to military strategy emerged from the welter of ancient strategic and political thought that makes up the foundations of China's strategic culture; and from the chaotic events that led up to the formation of the People's Republic and, a scant two decades later, China's first nuclear detonation.
Mao's approach to military philosophy might best be described as an admixture of pristine philosophy with the brutal realities of invasion, insurgency and civil war. While he is known to have cited the ancient Chinese philosophers as inspiration for his own theories of war, he diverged from them in a number of key areas. Where Sun Tzu, for example, deemed it "supreme excellence" to defeat the enemy without having to actually fight him, Mao, in his 1937 treatise
On Guerilla Warfare, took a somewhat harsher line, stating that "The first law of war is to preserve ourselves and destroy the enemy." 49 This stance was almost immediately softened, however, in obedience to the strategic realities inherent in commanding a force that was always outnumbered and on the run from a better organized and better equipped enemy. In phrases more reminiscent of Sun Tzu, Mao proposed three propositions for victory: first, one should fight a fight a decisive engagement only when victory is certain; second, one should avoid a decisive engagement when victory is uncertain; and third, one should "avoid absolutely a strategic decisive engagement which stakes the destiny of the nation." 50 This latter admonition reflects the strategic concerns of a general for whom a single major defeat would likely have spelled the end, and was the primordial strategic consideration underscoring both the doctrine of People's War that Mao evolved and promulgated, and the long-standing strategy of 'active defence' upon which People's War was based, and which contemplated making use of China's traditional advantage in space and numbers to absorb and dissipate the energies of a qualitatively superior enemy, allowing Beijing the time necessary to generate the forces to envelope and destroy him.

In recent years it has become popular to assert that China is evolving towards a 'limited war' doctrine. In reality, this is nothing novel; Mao's post-Civil War strategic philosophy advocated restraint and patience, and China's military operations since 1949 -for example its wars with India (1962), the USSR (1969), and Vietnam (1979) -have all been limited in scope and means.
The same has been true of Beijing's conduct in its border disputes with India and Bhutan, and the numerous offshore maritime disputes to which China is party. China's conduct in internal security matters, from its subjugation of Tibet and of its Muslim Uighur minority to the brutal suppression of the Falun Gong sect and the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989, is of course another matter entirely, and helps to shed light on the comparative seriousness with which Beijing views external vis-à-vis internal threats to the state -a topic that will be addressed in a later paper.
Before 1955, discussion of nuclear weapons had been more or less taboo in Chinese political and military circles, and "[s]uch statements as had been allowed to appear were uniformly disparaging of the significance of nuclear weapons." 59 There were a variety of reasons for this, but the most important appear to have been the importance of cultivating and maintaining cordial relations with China's 'fraternal socialist allies' in the USSR, and the need to sustain military and civilian morale in the face of an overwhelming threat that China, in its straitened post-War circumstances, had no hope of matching, and against which no defence was possible. Mao himself had set the tone for the militant disinterest that would later characterize China's collective approach to the new weapons, acknowledging -in August 1945, shortly after the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -that while "some of our comrades…believe that the atomic bomb is all powerful," such a belief was "a big mistake."
60
The official suspension of disbelief about the potential impact of nuclear weapons on the international strategic calculus persisted throughout the latter half of the 1940s and most of the 1950s. Even while the US military was building hundreds of bombs -including inconceivably powerful thermonuclear weapons -and struggling to articulate a strategy for employing (or not employing) them in conflict, Chinese spokesman were publicly denigrating them. Again, such denials as were issued have a definite savour of desperation aimed at buttressing public and military morale; for example, a propaganda pamphlet issued in 1952 stated that while the US clearly intended to use nuclear weapons in the course of the conflict in Korea, atomic bombs were "not dreadful and the enemy could be outwitted." 
61
62
Ignorance cannot have been an excuse; as Hsieh noted in a paper written shortly after the decline in Sino-Soviet relations, China's leaders were almost certainly "aware of the extent to which nuclear weapons and modern delivery systems had altered the nature of warfare and military doctrine." 63 As already suggested, the 'party line' on the atomic bomb was in all probability selected to minimize fear and fractiousness among the populace by down-playing the significance of a capability that China was not in a position to replicate. Here, too, the policy direction was initially set by Mao and Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. Mao's early pronouncements on nuclear weapons, in which he is said to have dismissed them as "paper tigers" (although the accuracy of this translation is disputed), were clearly intended to "inspire the Chinese people's morale." Both men, however, later clarified that the thrust of their argument had been mainly to emphasize that wars could not be won only with one or two advanced weapons." 
64
65
Mao's Politburo took the decision to acquire a nuclear weapons capability in 1955, but while this represented a watershed moment for China, the decision was not an unqualified one. At the time it was completed, the Manhattan Project had been the single costliest venture ever embarked upon by the US, and Mao was under no illusions about the extent of the strain that 'going nuclear' would place upon the state's finances and resources. Butter could not be sacrificed for guns if China was to continue to attempt to recover from the wars it had undergone and drag its economy and industry out of the pre-Revolutionary doldrums. Competing priorities would have to be balanced. In a speech in 1956, Mao put the problem thus: "If we are not to be bullied in the present-day world, we cannot do without the bomb. Then what is to be done about it? One reliable way is to cut military and administrative expenditures down to appropriate proportions." 
67
Thus from the outset China's nuclear weapons programme was circumscribed by firm political boundaries. Mao defined the limits himself in 1956, stating that China's nuclear arsenal "won't be numerous even if we succeed," and that its purpose would be not to seek global or even regional dominance, but rather to "boost our courage and scare others." 69 This statement was the first conceptual inkling of what would later come to serve as the core of China's policy of minimal deterrence.
The potential power of deterrence was clarified the following year by the faint radio transmissions of Sputnik, the launch of which on 4 October 1957 demonstrated the ability of the USSR to deliver a nuclear weapon virtually anywhere in the world, and in a matter of minutes rather than hours, as was the case with air-breathing bombers. The Soviet development and evolutionary improvement of a true inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM) capability was probably the key topic of conversation during the Moscow summit in November 1957, when Mao met Khrushchev and sought from him further assistance in China's own pursuit of the Bomb.
While the meeting appears to have been cordial, and while Moscow still seemed willing, even at this late date, to allow China to attempt to exploit the logical consequences of Soviet advances and political acts, it is most unlikely that Mao was able to obtain any firm guarantees "that Khrushchev was prepared to place the Soviet deterrent power at the service of Chinese military ambitions." 70
In the months following the summit there was a marked change in Chinese public discussion of nuclear weapons. Among other novel initiatives, Chinese officials began to posit an internally contradictory state of affairs, acknowledging that China would be in possession of nuclear weapons in the near future, and at the same time advocating the creation of an Asian nuclear weapons-free zone (NWFZ). Public messaging was by no means evenly distributed or even consistent; while Politburo and Foreign Ministry officials were touting China's benign intentions, military newspapers had adopted a more bellicose tone. In 1958, for example, the commander of the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) published an article stating that China would soon be able to "use atomic weapons and rockets…in coping with the enemies who dare to invade our country and undermine world peace." 71
While such military and political postures may seem mutually incompatible, the incompatibility is not surprising given the context in which they evolved. The offshore islands crisis in the Taiwan Strait in 1958, in which Moscow declined to back Beijing's play, demonstrated the fickleness of fraternal socialist sentiment. From a strategic perspective, the crisis tested whether the Soviet deterrent would be sufficient to dissuade the US from using tactical nuclear weapons, enabling China's conventional forces to execute their mission without significant interference. The fact 68 Hsieh, Communist China's Strategy in the Nuclear Era, 168. 
69
70
72
73
This fact, now come to the fore, meant not only that China would have to develop its own nuclear weapons if it needed to be able to rattle a nuclear sabre, but also that it would have to develop strategies to determine when and how loudly the sabre should be rattled (and for that matter, when and how it should, if necessary, be drawn). The fact that discussion of the utility of nuclear weapons in war had been deliberately muted during the 1940s and early 1950s did not prevent military and political strategists from thinking and writing about them. By the late 1950s, there were two principal Chinese schools of thought on nuclear strategy: the Ministry of Defence school, which continued the Maoist strain and assumed that wars would be protracted and could be fought by mobilizing reserves and resources after conflict had begun; and the General Staff school, which, schooled in Soviet doctrine, had adopted the USSR's new, evolving perspective that wars would be fought with forces-in-being rather than after a period of mobilization; and that China, therefore, required not poorly-armed and lightly-equipped mass levies (the "millet and rifles" army that Mao had led to victory), but rather "a well-trained and well-equipped standing army, a strong air force, and adequate air defence systems" in order to "reduce China's vulnerability to a first blow."
74
Neither the divergence of opinion between the Ministry and the General Staff nor the likely implications for China's armed forces of differences in perspective were surprising. It is not unusual for generals to want to trade huge numbers of mediocre troops motivated by ideological fervour for smaller numbers of more professional, better-trained troops motivated by loyalty, sound leadership, and nationalism. This fact notwithstanding, there were genuine differences between the two philosophies, and the dispute was in many ways a conflict between ideologies that pitted the Ministry's Mao-inspired People's War (renmin zhanzheng)) against the General Staff's Soviet-inspired, well-trained and well-equipped professional force model. The two approaches, it must be noted, proceeded from different assumptions. The Ministry assumed that the China-USSR alliance would continue, and that, recent contretemps notwithstanding, Moscow would still be willing to extend the Soviet nuclear deterrent umbrella to China. The General Staff, by contrast, were less sanguine about Russia's reliability as an ally, and downright pessimistic about the extent and durability of Moscow's commitment to its putative allies. Viewed from a perspective of bureaucratic politics, the disagreement also provided an opportunity for resolving a bureaucratic disagreement about who was empowered to set the direction for the PLA: the Party, or the commanders.
Hindsight permits the analyst to view policy decisions through the lens of subsequent events, and thus entitles us to judge the validity of those decisions on the basis of how well they allowed those on whose behalf they were taken to weather the storms of history. By this measure, it seems that the Ministry position was based less on a shrewd analysis of emerging trends than on wishful thinking. The Ministry, for example, had gravely misunderstood the US decision not to use nuclear weapons either in Korea, or during the 1958 Quemoy-Matsu crisis. 
75
77
One consequence of the realization that China, if it wanted to 'go nuclear', would have to do so alone was a brief but memorable return to the earlier, dismissive style of rhetoric about nuclear weapons that had characterized Mao's statements in the immediate post-war years. Mao himself published a paper entitled "Imperialists and All Reactionaries are Paper Tigers", arguing that the enemy should be "strategically despised but tactically respected" 78 -a difficult tightrope to walk, as it was the tactical effects of the "despised" enemy's military capability that would, in a 75 Mulvenon, 243. 76 Hsieh, "Communist China and Nuclear Warfare", 5. 
77
78
conflict, be most obvious to China's population. It was a tacit acknowledgement that China could not hope to offset the military advantages enjoyed by the US without acquiring its own nuclear weapons. The decline in relations between Moscow and Beijing and the economic and industrial consequences thereof were equally visible in China, and were driven home with a vengeance when, in 1959, the Soviets intimated to Ambassador Harriman that the USSR would consider lending "military assistance" to Taiwan in the event of a confrontation. 
79
80
It took China's nuclear weapon designers some years to overcome the lack of Russian assistance, but they managed to do so. They had a number of advantages, not least of which was the knowledge that the feat had already been accomplished by four other states. The teams engaged in working on the bomb also received special privileges; Deng himself is reported to have told the development teams that they could take credit for their successes, and blame their failures on the Party Central Secretariat.

China detonated its first fission weapon on 16 October 1964. In the wake of the detonation, Beijing released a lengthy statement to the world which, according to two analysts, offers "a fascinating window into China's conflicted attitude about nuclear weapons.
It is riddled with internal contradictions and dialectical mindbenders. It strains credulity, for instance, that the Chinese would have spent an enormous amount of scarce state resources to build a weapon that is explicitly labelled as a 'paper tiger'. If atomic weapons were a paper tiger, it is difficult to fathom how nuclear weapons will provide 'defense' and 'protect the Chinese people from US threats to launch a nuclear war'. Moreover, the official insistence that China developed nuclear weapons in order to aid the global disarmament of nuclear weapons seems disingenuous at best. 
82
A little more than two years after conducting its first nuclear test, China executed its sixth, airdropping its first thermonuclear device from an H-6 bomber over Lop Nur on 17 June 1967. This weapon -based on the Teller-Ulam radiation implosion design first tested fifteen years earlier in the US, and using a U-235 fission primary, Lithium-6 Deuteride as fusion fuel, and a U-238 tertiary jacket -achieved a yield of 3.3 megatons, informing the world that China now had the ability to build and deliver thermonuclear explosives. In a moment of frank honesty, the Second Ministry's Vice Minister, Liu Xiyao, acknowledged that the Chinese had had an easier time building the H-bomb because the US, Russia, Britain and France had already done it, and the Chinese scientists struggling to mimic the achievements of their forebears "knew what kinds of materials should be used to carry out thermonuclear fusion…and commanded the necessary fundamentals."
83
The official communiqué issued by the Politburo in the wake of the test repeated the same official line used two years earlier: the bomb was "entirely for the purpose of defence, with the ultimate aim of abolishing nuclear weapons." This time, the statement added the Maoist principle that "Man is the factor that decides victory and defeat in war," and that "[a]tom bombs, guided missiles and hydrogen bombs, all in all, are nothing much to speak of."
84
While the tenor of such a statement is reminiscent of the writings of Sun Tzu and the other philosophers whose works coloured China's strategic culture, such manifest disdain for what was in reality a significant achievement by a state still struggling to realize the full scope of the industrial revolution rings a little hollow. China, after all, had just spent the better part of a decade engaged in a crash programme to match the most significant military-technological achievement of the US and USSR. Their subsequent denigration of this achievement must be understood in the context of the time, which was characterized by a variety of interacting strategic and sociocultural currents.
China had only just recently begun to recover from the catastrophic social and economic consequences of Mao's abortive Great Leap Forward (1958-1960), and the equally convulsive but ideologically quite different Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) had, by the time of China's H-bomb test, only just got underway. A key feature of this latter phenomenon, at least during the early 'Red Guard' phase was a conscious, vociferous and often violent rejection of anything associated with suspected 'bourgeois' penetration and subversion of the principles of Chinese communism. An inevitable consequence of the vehement rejection of 'bourgeois' values was the tendency to tar anyone, regardless of the impeccability of their ideological credentials, who possessed advanced education or technical skills -especially if they had acquired that education or those skills in the West (as was the case for virtually every senior scientist associated with China's nuclear weapons program -a point that will be investigated in greater depth further along in this study).
It is difficult to reject scientists and technologists without rejecting science and technology, and the Cultural Revolution, by the time it ended in the mid-1970s, had had as profoundly deleterious an impact on China's scientific community and endeavours as Stalin's purges had had on the Red Army, or Lysenko's pseudo-science on a generation of Soviet biologists. The effects were felt not only in the nuclear weapons programme (which had, in any event, reached its apotheosis with the 1967 test) but also in the ballistic missile programme, which was nowhere near as advanced, and which -as a consequence of the upheavals -was destined to be set back by a decade or more.
Against the convulsive backdrop of such events, the abrupt dismissal of the nuclear weapons that China had worked so hard, and sacrificed so much, to build becomes a little easier to understand.
The travails of Mao's social engineering aside, there was another more profound factor at work that tended to compel China's political and military strategists to adopt a dismissive attitude visà-vis the new weapons. Here again we must return to an examination of the deeper currents of Chinese strategic thought. Official statements emphasizing the primacy in war of men over material are to be expected on the part of a state that has a great many of the former, and a distinct paucity of the latter; however, as already noted, such aphorisms are also to be expected when they form a significant part of the foundation of the state's strategic culture, both the ancient aspects thereof, as expressed by Sun Tzu and others, and more modern precepts, e.g., Mao's theory of People's War. One analyst far suggests that China's strategic thought divides into Military Doctrine (Junshi Xueshuo)better known as People's War -and Military Science (Junshi Kexue)…Within this framework, Strategy belongs to Military Art (Junshi Xueshu), the most important branch of Military Science…
85
Such a hierarchical ordering helps to explain where People's War fits in the pantheon of military thought. It also explains the origins of "misperceptions about the obsolescence of People's War." According to Tan, these "derive from a confusion between Military Doctrine and Strategy." 
86
This biaxial understanding of the dividing line in Chinese thought between doctrine and strategy has been noted and commented upon by numerous authors. Some, like Georges Tan Eng Bok, prefer a clean and distinct break between the two. Others argue that trying to force doctrine and strategy into crisply delineated pigeon-holes risks severing the often intangible but very real arteries of influence between them. Paul Goodwin, for example, argues that while People's War is "not a strategy", None the less, thinking in terms of People's War and trying to modify Mao's concepts of war and strategy does not necessarily highlight the demands of twoand three-dimensional warfare. The Janus-like quality of the Chinese military establishment reflects the tension between these two approaches to war and strategy.

This operational doctrine was the antithesis of People's War which, in Mao's formulation, saw large numbers of quickly-raised, adequately-equipped troops with limited training (but motivated by a surfeit of ideological fervour) falling back before a concerted assault, trading space for time, ceding cities to the enemy, and re-conquering lost territory in due course via protracted guerrilla warfare. Such an operational doctrine at first glance leaves very few practical roles for nuclear weapons. Apart from using them to blunt an enemy's initial strike, a strategy based on the principle of réculer pour mieux sauter (withdrawing to improve one's point of departure for subsequent operations) would ensure that the majority of the resulting nuclear detonations would 87 Goodwin, 48. 88 Mention of the classical military and political philosophers in Chinese literature naturally plummeted during this period; see Annex A. 
89
occur either on the land that one has traded for time, or in the cities that one has ceded to the enemy. Tactical nuclear warfare, in short, is counter-indicated when one's operational doctrine contemplates fighting a protracted war on one's own soil.
Mao's guided evolution of the People's War doctrine derives from the two decades worth of experience he gleaned while fighting a guerrilla version of the levée-en-masse against more professional, better-equipped opponents. It would be unjust to refer to People's War as a 'theory', as its precepts were repeatedly put to the test, and its subordinate doctrines of protracted conflict, abandonment of cities, and 'human factors' as the key to overcoming an enemy's technological advantages were all trialled heavily in actual combat. This latter principle, which featured so prominently in Beijing's post-detonation communiqués, is itself a key facet of People's War.
There are likely a number of reasons that it feature so prominently in both China's conventional and its nuclear doctrine. While the origins of the primacy of men over machines indisputably lie with the ancient philosophers, such declamations serve an important motivational role; from a perspective of propaganda designed to buttress or enhance national morale, it is entirely understandable that politically astute leaders would sternly denigrate the importance of having good equipment when addressing a force that was itself chronically underequipped.
There are other differences than merely equipment between conventional Western military forces and an army structured in accordance with the People's War doctrine. People's War, Tan argues, "differs fundamentally from ancient Chinese warfare in relying on organised armed forces under a 'centralized strategic command'." 
90
If such an army could not be created or sustained entirely according to ancient principles, it could not be fought according to them either. Sun Tzu, for example, praised the general who employs "blundering speed" over protracted warfare, arguing that prolonged combat never benefits the state. Mao, by contrast, relied on his experience as a revolutionary leader during a period of guerrilla warfare. Knowing the fragility and capabilities of his army, and understanding the larger political problem that he faced -which was that a single serious defeat would spell the end of his ambition of founding a People's Republic -he largely eschewed "blundering speed", instead, as noted above, advocating the exchange of land for time. In addition to preserving his own force and granting him the time to improve its equipment and training, heaping delay upon delay served an important ideological purpose; it allowed a large margin of time to ensure that the internal contradictions of the capitalist hegemonist armies would be exposed, hastening their inevitable collapse. This latter facet of the People's War doctrine was likely the source of inspiration for Defence Minister Lin Biao when in 1963, quoting Mao, he wrote "[t]he spiritual atomic bomb which the revolutionary people possess is a far more powerful weapon than the physical atomic bomb." should not be dismissed out of hand, because however baldly the sentiment might have been expressed, it was unquestionably grounded in sound military experience.
As China entered the nuclear age and the Cultural Revolution raged, attempts to adapt Mao's quintessentially guerrilla doctrine to the realities of modern mechanized and nuclear conflict came a cropper. A large part of the problem was the lack of a galvanizing threat. The US and its NATO allies had no difficulty imagining the sort of war they would be most likely to fight in the immediate future; the Inner-German Border, the Iron Curtain, the concrete reality of the wall bifurcating Berlin all were clear indications of where the first shots in the inevitable east-west clash were likely to be fired. China, grappling with the problem of transforming Maoist military doctrine (in an age when any deviation from Mao could easily result in denunciations, beatings or even death at the hands of the Red Guards), had no such strategic waypoints to fall back on. Despite the distinct chill in Sino-Soviet relations since the late 1950s, it had become painfully obvious that the USSR was unlikely to attempt to invade. 
93
Some recognized that the problem was in reality two-fold. People's War was poorly adapted to modern military realities not only because the doctrine itself advocated responding to threats by taking steps that would be demonstrably contrary to China's strategic interests; it was also problematic because, for psychological and political reasons, it denigrated and minimized the importance of modern military equipment. In the atmosphere of the 1960s, as noted above, it took genuine courage to question any aspect of Mao's political, military or social doctrine; but this did not mean that the PLA still did not need to be better equipped. Lin Biao, as Defence Minister, took steps to rectify that part of the problem, crafting what he termed a "balanced strategy" consisting of "a modified concept of People's War…associated with a slow, self-reliant modernization process." Goodwin opines that this approach meshed with Mao's policy of "walking on two legs," but hastens to add that Lin's approach led to a schism in which strategy and military modernization were often treated as two independent parts of should have been one debate. 
94

…the weapons that would thwart imperialism were nothing much to speak of; the weapons of a new stage would simply reaffirm older ideas; and the weapons made by experts were embraced by extremists making war on experts. 
95
96
China's nuclear weapons did, however, serve an important political purpose: they announced to the four existing NWS that China now had to be taken seriously. While by no means the only (or even most significant) factor that contributed to the UN's 1971 decision (via Resolution 2758 of the UN General Assembly) to withdraw recognition from the government of the Republic of China and transfer it to the government of Mao's People's Republic, China's demonstrated nuclear capability certainly loomed large on the international stage. No adaptation or amalgamation of nuclear and conventional military doctrine was required in order to effect this primordial political transformation; all that was necessary was an explosion. China's nuclear weapons programme had achieved its most important purpose -a fundamentally political purpose -without any requirement for a delivery system at all.
The death of Mao in September 1976, followed by the purge of the Gang of Four and their supporters in the months that followed lifted the obligation for doctrine to genuflect to philosophical orthodoxy and allowed -to use Freedman's phrase -the "mystical elements of People's War" to at last be done away with. 
97
98
Rather than abandon outright the strategic legacy of the founder of the People's Republic in the years immediately following his death -which would have been problematic in any state, let alone a communist state where legitimacy derives in large part from perceived continuity of leadership, and let alone in a traditionalist society that places high value on respect for the nation's philosophical forebears -China's political and strategic theorists embarked on a programme of rationalization designed to salvage the useful aspects of People's War and adapt them to the new strategic reality. This consisted, in essence, of deriving from Mao's doctrine the essential elements applicable to the operational employment of what had hitherto been a purely political weapon. One Chinese strategist summarized Mao's understanding of People's War in a nuclear context as "fighting sooner, fighting on a larger scale, and fighting a nuclear war." 99 While the latter two principles ring true (People's War was nothing if not 'large scale', while the strategic use of nuclear weapons in tactical scenarios represented an approach similar to that adopted by the US Army in the 1950s), the notion of "fighting sooner" owes more to Sun Tzu's "blundering haste" than it does to Mao's principle of trading space for time. Apparent contradictions notwithstanding, such distillations moved the process forward, and by the late 1970s Chinese strategic thinking had undergone a vital and long overdue transformation, shifting "from People's War to people's nuclear war under modern conditions." 100
It was not an easy transition. A large part of the problem stemmed from the fact that, in the run-up to its first test detonation in 1964, China had been heavily reliant on its Soviet ally not only for military and technical assistance, but also for the training of military personnel and political thinkers. The last generation that had passed through Soviet indoctrination (the ones that survived the Cultural Revolution, at least) were those now guiding the Party and attempting to craft its military and political doctrine. China's strategic thinkers, though, had never fully come to grips with the Soviet approach to military doctrine and nuclear strategy, principally because Soviet military doctrine was difficult to reconcile with Mao's military philosophy. This in turn was due to the very different roots of the Soviet and Chinese military experience, especially during the Second World War. Mao's revolution had faced the dual threats of the Japanese domination of Manchuria and the Republican forces, and had triumphed through delay, denial, indirect guerrilla warfare and the clever and cautious use of very limited resources. As Hsieh notes, this experience had given Chinese strategists a preference for "low level conflicts, national liberation wars, where indeed man, his morale and organization, would be superior to weapons." 
101
101
taken blitzkrieg and made it their own. It is an aphorism of military operations that without morale, an army is nothing; but no soldier that had fought at Kursk could seriously entertain a military philosophy that argued that machines were less important than men. 
102
103
The result, as with any process of rationalization, was a gradual redefinition of what Mao had really meant. Tan, for example, writing in 1984 when this process was well under way, argued that Mao's "man over material" principle really meant the "primacy of men over weapons," which in turn was an allegorical means of stating that, in war, politics take precedence over purely military considerations. 
104
105
The transformation of People's War into "People's War under modern conditions" that took place in the late 1970s and early 1980s consisted, according to one author, of four key alterations to Mao's military philosophy. The first was the abandonment of the principle of trading land for time. Under the new doctrine, instead of drawing the enemy into the heartland, he would be defeated close to the border. Second, protracted war -the strength of Mao's doctrine -was no longer seen as supreme. Commitment to long war became less dogmatic; and instead of downplaying the importance of early battles, the possibility that a war might be won by a decisive blow in the opening stages was once again taken into consideration. Third -perhaps in a nod to the history of military operations outside of China during and since the Second World War -Mao's concept of a "fluid front" was downplayed, and positional warfare was once again seen as important. Fourth, where Mao had advocated abandoning cities to seek refuge and fight in the countryside, "modern conditions" meant that cities had now to be defended instead of abandoned. Finally, Mao's concept of "deterrence through denial" (which might best be described as ensuring that there were no targets of sufficient value that the enemy might consider using a nuclear weapon against them) was replaced by a policy of deterrence through retaliation. 
106
107
All of this seems elementary to denizens of states that followed a different evolutionary trajectory from China. To a certain extent, while China joined the nuclear club in purely technological terms in 1964, and joined it in political terms in 1971, it did not join the rest of the NWS in terms of substantive interaction until some point in the late 1970s when the CPC, having divested itself of the hyper-orthodox agrarian predilections of Mao, began to contemplate an urbanized, industrialized future for China. States that have something to lose do not see nuclear weapons as "paper tigers"; they see them as both threat and insurance. Once China's leaders acknowledged that their goal was to grow their economy, to expand their cities, to lift their population out of abject poverty, and in short to build a nation that would have something to lose -then, and only then, did China's "small but usable strategic nuclear force"
108
Doctrinal transformation continued in the mid-1980s as the PLA's strategic thinkers grappled with the implied consequences of the declining threat of central European warfare, and the growing likelihood -as exemplified by the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and, to a lesser extent, the British recapture of the Falkland Islands -of lower level warfare. NATO's response to these developments was to explore doctrine for "out-of-area" conflicts. China's thinkers perceived a similar decrease in the likelihood of a land invasion of China (which had never been likely in the first place), and -corresponding to a decline in US-Soviet tensions and a gradual increase in the effectiveness of arms control initiatives -a drop in the likelihood of a massive east-west nuclear exchange engulfing China. All of these trends, according to a 1982 article in a CPC journal, "presented new problems to the patterns, strategy and tactics of warfare as well as to military organization" of the PLA. The pressures of contemporary conflict, the author argued, were forcing the PLA into a near world of "readjusting, reorganising and restructuring." 109 Beijing's response was to reduce the emphasis on "People's War under modern conditions", and focus more on "fighting and winning all sorts of local war and armed conflict." 110
The strategists who devised the local war concept differentiated it from "major war" according to five fundamental differences. First, the objectives in a local war are limited, as are the means employed by the adversaries. Second, local wars tend to involve continuous negotiations, or, as then-Deputy Chief of the General Staff Xiong Guangkai put it, "Fighting is usually accompanied by talking." 111 Local wars -unlike People's War, which makes use of the whole national territory to absorb an enemy, and which is by definition protracted -tend to be constrained in space and time. They also, due to the limited nature of the events in question, tend to be impacted to a greater extent than major wars by domestic politics and world opinion. 
112
None of the characteristics of local wars posited by China's military thinkers in the 1980s precluded exercise of the nuclear option; however, it was acknowledged that the threat or use of nuclear force would both violate the limited means criterion for local wars, and would likely elicit a backlash in both domestic politics and world opinion that could imperil the war effort. Where discussions of nuclear use in a context of "People's War under modern conditions" had devolved largely upon where, when and what targets against which to employ the weapons, local war doctrine suggested that the most important question would likely be whether to use, or even threaten to use, nuclear weapons at all.

The Gulf War launched a new and intensive examination by China's defence and security community of the implications for China's security of the so-called 'revolution in military affairs' (RMA). One of the concepts that emerged from this discussion was that of employing less advanced weapon systems in an unconventional manner to circumvent the advanced capabilities enjoyed by adversaries. As the millennium approached, Chinese articles began speaking of the "assassin's mace" (shashoujian) concept, which in a military context boils down to using inferior technology in an innovative manner to obviate the technological and other advantages enjoyed by a superior opponent.
119
The "assassin's mace" concept was not new, although it was a relative rarity in military and political Chinese journals before 1999. Its revival was seen as a natural adaptive outgrowth of the RMA. 120 Shashoujian does not translate readily into English, and the three characters -sha ( ), "kill"; shou ( ) "hand" and jian ( ) sword, -has been variously translated to mean "killing hand-sword", "killer mace", and so forth. Jason Bruzdzinski, suggests that there may be some linguistic and/or cultural justification for interpreting shashoujian to mean not only "assassin's mace" but also, in a martial context, a "well-practiced technique or movement." 121
The idea of using a relatively primitive weapon in a long-practised and overwhelming spoiling (defensive) attack was a Chinese adaptation of the Western understanding of the RMA, which, in very general terms, saw advances in information technology as enabling wars to be fought with less violence, destruction and collateral damage. By contrast, Chinese analysts in 2002 were writing that "tests of atomic and hydrogen bombs, and successful launches of submarine launched and mobile strategic missiles, shows that our Army has 'assassin's mace' to use in overcoming the enemy and achieving victory". 122 SLBMs and ICBMs are not battlefield weapons, nor are they likely to reduce the damage and violence of warfare. Such analyses clearly demonstrate that China from the outset viewed "assassin's mace" as a fundamentally strategic concept. The basic principle was, of course, sound; a footpad with a bludgeon can easily overcome the most talented of rapier-armed swordsman, provided the former enjoys strategic surprise and is able and willing to strike first. The end result of this calculus was a partial (and perhaps only theoretical) repurposing of China's nuclear arsenal; PLA wargames during the past decade, in accordance with the shashoujian principle, have largely envisioned the use of selected nuclear strikes as a means of dislocating enemy efforts and overturning enemy advantages in order to achieve victory on the battlefield "rather than the destruction of the world."

Given how China's political history and the development of its nuclear capability played out, there may not have been a realistic alternative. Despite having a workable nuclear weapon, China for almost two decades after its first nuclear detonation lacked the ability to enter into a deterrent relationship with the US because the PLA did not have a strategic delivery system. Even after the first generation of missiles capable of targeting the US mainland, the DF-5A (Dong Feng or 'East Wind'), was deployed in 1981, the deterrent capacity of the limited number of missiles was no more than existential; detailed, comprehensive strategy was not necessary because "the weapons, once deployed, spoke for themselves." 130 It is not clear, however, what their message was. In theory, China had the ability to destroy a number of US cities. Whether any of the weapons would have survived a disarming pre-emptive counterforce strike by the US is questionable; but whether Chinese society would have survived the devastating retaliation that would inevitably have followed the destruction of a US city is not. It being difficult to construct rational plans for Armageddon, Beijing settled on the alternative: a brief nuclear exchange "followed up by an attempted invasion."
131
Throughout the mid-to late-1960s, China's strategic thought languished, caught between the Scylla of the old guard and People's War, which had built the People's Republic, and the Charybdis of the new realities of warfare, in which massed conscript forces based on 'millet and rifles' were irrelevant in the face of mechanized armies, global positioning systems, precision strike and stealth. China's deterrent force was born into a state of epistemic confusion: founded on a military capability built at enormous cost for largely political reasons; stunted by but nonetheless surviving the vagaries of internal upheavals; taking, for ideological, financial and political reasons, a back seat, along with the naval and air forces, to the land forces of the PLA; and condemned to a minimalist force posture on the theory that a handful of missiles with highyield warheads could pose a threat sufficient to give any potential adversary pause.
This period of uncertainty came to an end as China (fuelled by domestic growth stemming from gradual economic liberalization under Deng's Reform and Opening Up programme initiated in December 1978) began to expand both economically and, as a consequence thereof, in terms of regional and global influence. At present, China is in the latter half of a generational drive to rectify the disruptive doctrinal and dialectical dichotomies that stymied its strategic development.
Over the past decade, China has come into its own as a nuclear power. The next chapter will examine how this transformation has manifested in one of the most important areas of nuclear weapons theory, focusing on the China's long and difficult relationship with deterrence.
One of the most interesting facets of China's evolution from aspiring nuclear weapon state through its first fission and fusion detonations and the slow development of ballistic missiles, to its decades-long struggle to reconcile People's War doctrine with the new military realities of nuclear and information-based weapon systems has been Beijing's troubled relationship with the concept of deterrence.
As noted in the first paper in this series, deterrence, while certainly not a novel concept, took on renewed importance in the nuclear era by virtue of the extreme destructiveness of the new class of weapons. Throughout the history of conventional warfare, deterrence had played its part in preventing (or at least delaying) interstate conflict. Princes -to use Machiavelli's term -whether deliberately or unconsciously, routinely compared the benefits likely to derive from going to war against the costs of doing so (and sometimes against the costs of being trounced by their wouldbe victims), and tended as a rule not to launch a campaign unless there was a reasonable prospect of the gains outweighing the losses. In the nuclear era, however, the losses, even for the victor, were potentially so extreme as to outweigh any possible gains. 
132
Deterrence, however, does not mesh well with communist doctrine of any stripe, which views war as the inevitable ideologically-based outgrowth of class struggles within states, or, in interstate relations, between the enlightened socialist states and the reactionary bourgeois states. Such struggles are not to be avoided but are rather to be encouraged and abetted, until all states are socialist, the boundaries of the state and state apparatus themselves "wither away", and "true communism" emerges. Such doctrine put the USSR, and later China, in a difficult position vis-àvis a doctrinally opposed but vastly more militarily proficient adversary. It is significant that while Soviet and Chinese ideologues initially made all the right noises about drowning the decadent US and its allies beneath a wave of fraternal socialist what-not, none of them ever pushed the button and got the show rolling as Marx and his intellectual successors had allegedly intended. The prospect of large-scale thermonuclear retaliation seems have been sufficient to stem the tide of rhetoric and impose reasoned calculation on otherwise unreasonable actors.
China's internal philosophical struggle with the dichotomy between the fantasy world of communist political and military thought and the cold, harsh reality of the Bomb is evident in how it dealt with the question of deterrence. The gradual evolution in China's grasp of deterrence paints a clear trajectory. As Mulvenon puts it, "Chinese views of nuclear weapons have evolved from initial disparagement and covetousness prior to the acquisition of an arsenal, to a nuclear minimalist perspective that resembles mutual assured destruction (MAD) in every way but name."
133
The early stages of China's slow evolution from doctrinal orthodoxy to reasoned strategy were so inconsistent as to be confusing to outsiders. As noted in the previous chapter, Mao's initial dismissal of nuclear weapons as a "paper tiger" appeared to fly in the face of the contention, made in the same statement, that these weapons would deter the United States from attacking China. Taken in conjunction with later statements attributed to Mao to the effect that China did not fear nuclear war because of its large population, some of whom would surely survive in sufficient numbers to overwhelm any surviving capitalists or imperialists, China's "publicly ambivalent attitude about Armageddon," unique among all of the nuclear powers, seemed to suggest that Beijing would "welcome the deaths of hundreds of millions, if not billions, of people as a possible shortcut to communist nirvana." 
134
Attempts to whitewash such sentiments away over the past four decades have generally been successful, especially given China's gradual adoption of some of the forms, if very little of the actual substance, of Western economic liberalism. But every now and then the mask slips. In July 2005, while speaking at a press briefing, Major-General Zhu Chenghu of China's National Defense University, was widely quoted as having made the following statement:
…if the Americans draw their missiles and position-guided ammunition on to the target zone on China's territory, I think we will have to respond with nuclear weapons", [and that] "we…will prepare ourselves for the destruction of all of the cities east of Xi'an. Of course the Americans will have to be prepared that hundreds of cities will be destroyed by the Chinese. 
135
136
138
It has been argued that much of the discomfort on the part of China's political and military theoreticians and strategists with "the terminology of deterrence" stems from a belief that it "connotes aggressiveness, which is unsuitable to describe China's purely defensive strategy."
139
Penetrating the thought processes of strategists operating according not only to different ideological doctrines but also in the context of a wholly different strategic culture is a non-trivial task. It is of course not possible to know the innermost thoughts of the individuals engaged in developing China's political and military strategy concerning its nuclear weapons; and as the regime is one of the most opaque and secretive in the world, records of internal deliberations are not available, and are unlikely to become available. The following sections will therefore assess how China's attitudes toward nuclear deterrence have evolved on the basis of an analysis of public statements, diplomacy, declaratory doctrine and observable activities. This is of course insufficient, but at present it is all that is possible. In this connexion, it is worth repeating the caveat offered by Fravel and Medeiros to the effect that "[a]ny assessment of Chinese leaders' beliefs about the utility of nuclear weapons and the requirements of deterrence must begin with the observation that primary source data remain scarce but are growing." 
140
For ease of analysis, I have subdivided the discussion that follows into three sections based on the material evolution of China's nuclear capability The first section addresses how China, as an aspiring and eventually a new nuclear weapon state, came slowly to first accept, and then later embrace, the concept of nuclear deterrence. The second section looks at how China dealt with the deterrence problem as a small nuclear weapons state reliant upon "existential deterrence"; and the third, at how China's concept of deterrence changed as its strategic delivery capabilities improved, and China approached a state of "essential equivalence" vis-à-vis the other NWS.
The on-again, off-again relationship between China's communist regime and the concept of nuclear deterrence dates virtually from the formation of the People's Republic, although the seeds of philosophy were undoubtedly sown in 1945 with the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The concept of a bi-directional nuclear deterrent relationship became a reality in 1949 when the USSR detonated its first nuclear weapon; and was thrown into stark relief a few years later when both superpowers demonstrated the far greater yield of thermonuclear weapons. The destruction visited upon two Japanese cities by weapons in the 20-kiloton range -"unacceptable damage", in deterrence parlance -was grossly redefined in less than a decade, when explosive yields began to be measured in megatons rather than in kilotons.
If deterrence was indeed based upon a rational cost-benefit appreciation of a prospective course of action, it was difficult to conceive of any benefit that might justify the risk of even a single thermonuclear detonation in a populated area -especially a major city. History provides some context. The immediate fatalities resulting from the Hiroshima ("Little Boy") and Nagasaki ("Fat Man") attacks totalled approximately two hundred thousand. 
141
143
Their sheer unprecedented destructiveness was doubtless the feature of nuclear weapons of greatest interest to Mao and Zhou, both of whom, at least initially, acknowledged that the Bomb served an important purpose in deterring aggression by potential adversaries.

The disparity between the population and industrial concentrations of China and its potential adversaries may have been at the root of Mao's alleged contempt for nuclear weapons (which seems to have been greater in the late 1950s than earlier in the decade). According to Andrei Gromyko's Russian-edition memoirs, published in 1988, Mao expressed a noteworthy lack of concern about the prospect of nuclear conflict. Mao "argued that his country could survive a nuclear war, even if it lost 300 million people, and finish off the capitalists with conventional weapons." 147 Gromyko recalls responding with the (commendably diplomatic) observation that such a proposal would not be welcomed by the Kremlin.
The sang-froid of Mao's stance has been variously characterized as the epitome of communist doctrine, an outright fabrication, and everything in between. Gromyko's recollection has also been disputed by Chinese scholars; according to one interpretation, Mao is alleged to have said nothing more serious than "It's getting so hot, and we want to force Eisenhower to take a shower." 148 Such are the vagaries of translation. Whatever was actually said, and regardless of what may have been intended, in matters of deterrence, actual intent is often difficult to descry, and tends to take a back seat to perceived intent. Mao's aggressive stance was reported in the media and was taken at face value, and few in the West were inclined to take a rosier view of the Chinese communist regime's rhetoric.
Ironically, this served Beijing's purposes decades later, once China had become a NWS and potential adversaries were discussing whether the regime had the political will to use the weapons it had built. John Lewis and Xue Litai, writing in the late 1970s, argued on the basis of his decades-old comments, that "[g]iven Mao's well-known views about nuclear war, none would doubt that he or successors had the will to order a second-strike retaliation." 149 There is a certain logic to their analysis; after all, they were writing in the wake of the Cultural Revolution, whichlike Mao's Great Leap Forward -had provided empirical evidence of Beijing's willingness to accept, in pursuit of the regime's socio-cultural and ideological goals, a degree of internal hardship that other states (especially democratic ones) would consider intolerable. Regardless of whether the CPC intended these convulsive internal events to harden the Chinese populace to sacrifice, their cumulative impact on China's strategic culture created the perception that -as one Chinese analyst puts it -"China's understanding of 'unacceptable damage from a nuclear attack'
[was] different from that of Western countries." 150 This is of course a blanket statement and, as such, is highly suspect; doubtless the definition of "unacceptable damage" would change somewhat depending upon the strategic circumstances (Beijing would, for example, presumably be willing to tolerate greater risks in the face of an existential threat to China's national existence than, for example, over a few square miles of disputed territory on its remote western frontier). But once again, where deterrence is concerned, it does not really matter whether China's definition of what would be "unacceptable" is, or is not, different in substance from corresponding Western definitions. What matters is that China, as a consequence of its history and the strategic culture deriving therefrom, is perceived to be willing to tolerate higher casualties in pursuit of its national objectives.
Not everyone agreed with this assessment; Bernard Brodie, writing in 1973 at the height of the Cultural Revolution, stated that "[i]t requires a very naïve person to argue that the Chinese…being both Communist and also over-populated, would be relatively unconcerned with the destruction of millions of their people through nuclear attack." 151 Brodie's point requires some nuance; he was, in essence, arguing that communist regimes survive, both economically and politically, on the support of their populaces, and that Beijing would be loathe to sacrifice millions of its citizens out of concern for the security of the regime and the economic prosperity of the state, rather than out of any humanitarian motivations. But the point nonetheless stands, and was reinforced after Mao's death by his successors. Deng, for example, argued in the 1970s that it was "impossible to exterminate the human race by using nuclear weapons.
Now there are more than four billion people in the world. If the worst came to worst and more than two billion people died...more than two billion people would live on the globe just the same." 152
In short, the CPC regime in Beijing seems to have had no difficulty reaching a psychological accommodation with either the notion of nuclear deterrence, or -at least in principle -the reductio ad absurdum of mutual assured destruction. How this accommodation evolved into China's early nuclear doctrine of minimum deterrence is, therefore, a matter of some interest.
The concept of a "minimum deterrence" policy seems to have originated with destruction that would be caused by even a few Soviet bombs would be sufficient to give Washington pause. The US, Khruschev argued, would be deterred from initiating such a general exchange "by the devastation threatened by the nuclear power becoming available to the Soviet forces" -even though Moscow's "nuclear power" was an order of magnitude less than that available to Washington. 
154

Clearly. The obvious strategic utility of China's minimum nuclear deterrent capability did not prevent Beijing from adopting what might be considered a hypocritical (a more nuanced writer might use the term "Janus-like") stance vis-à-vis the deterrent strategies of other states. China's criticism of the deterrent postures of its adversaries, especially "the US imperialists", harked back to its first post-detonation statement. The gulf between doctrine and declaratory policy, however, did not reach full flower until the 1990s, when China began to openly condemn the whole notion of nuclear deterrence. For much of that decade, successive statements from the PRC Foreign Ministry enjoined "other nuclear-weapon states to give up their policy of nuclear deterrence." (10 June 1994). China -according to a speech by Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen at the 1995 Review Conference on the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) -did not "endorse the policy of nuclear deterrence"; its nuclear weapons were "solely for self-defense, never meant This introduced a new argument into the equation -that the problem might be "first-use" rather than merely deterrence. But that aspect of China's policy debate did not resurface for some years.
Qian reiterated his position at the General Assembly's 51 st Session, arguing that the "major nuclear powers should renounce their policy of nuclear deterrence."(25 September 1996) Beijing put the same talking point into the official statement released by the regime to mark its 45 th nuclear weapons test on 29 July 1996: "Major nuclear weapons states should abandon their policy of nuclear deterrence." Ambassador Sha came back to the well again the following spring: "The nuclear-weapon states…should abandon their policy of nuclear deterrence…"(8 April 1997);
161
162
163
(14 March 2001) 164
Beijing's representatives returned to the old talking points shortly thereafter. Hu Xiaodi, the new PRC Ambassador to the UN, told the plenary session of the Conference on Disarmament that "The nuclear deterrence doctrine characterized by the policy of first-use should be abandoned."(7 February 2002) Interestingly, the "first-use" qualifier had sprung up again. This pattern was to reappear often in the years that followed. Ambassador Hu repeated the formulation to the NPT Preparatory Committee the following year -"nuclear deterrence policy based on the first use of nuclear weapons should be abandoned" (28 April 2003) -and the point has been repeatedly reinforced by Chinese officials on innumerable subsequent occasions. President Hu Jintao, addressing the UN Summit on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Nuclear Disarmament in 2009, called for all countries to "abandon the nuclear deterrence policy based on first use of nuclear weapons." 
165
Clearly China has gone to great lengths over the past two decades to de-conflict its own strategic doctrine, which is unequivocally based on continuing deterrent relationships vis-à-vis its principle adversaries (the US and Russia, and regional rivals India, Taiwan, and Japan), from its declaratory policy, which is based on an interesting amalgam of criticism of nuclear deterrence, selective support of arms control and disarmament mechanisms, and periodic calls, however disingenuous, for complete nuclear disarmament. The end result appears to have been a doctrine that lies somewhere between existential and minimal nuclear deterrence seasoned by declaratory policy branding deterrence -especially "deterrence based on first-use" -as somehow immoral. If this were the whole story, then the CPC regime would merit George Orwell's praise for its mastery of what he called "double-think" -the ability to psychologically reconcile two mutually contradictory ideas. But it is not the whole story. The following section will take a more in-depth look at how China's view of deterrence has evolved since its acquisition of nuclear weaponsand, therewith, its first "existential" deterrent capability.
Few would argue that a state possessing, for example, a handful of tanks would be capable of deterring, via the threat of a devastating armoured riposte, attack by a neighbouring state possessing thousands of tanks. One tank slipping through an enemy's cordon could cause some damage, but not a great deal. The individual destructiveness of nuclear weapons, especially thermonuclear weapons, forced nations -both those that possessed them, and those that did notto rethink the classical deterrent calculus.
As Brodie had pointed out, the three elements of a nuclear deterrent balance were the ability to cause unacceptable damage, the willingness to do so, and the impossibility of defence against nuclear weapons. At the time China detonated its first nuclear weapon in 1964, both the US and USSR had invested a great deal in defending their borders against incursions by nuclear-armed bombers. However, missiles were rapidly replacing bombers as the delivery platform of choice; and research and development efforts notwithstanding, there was no practical defence against a ballistic missile. This eventually shifted the emphasis in strike planning to destroying the enemy's missiles before they could be launched, which in practical terms ushered in under Nixon the counterforce strategy that McNamara had toyed with and discarded a decade earlier. Even the eventual deployment of anti-ballistic missile systems by the US (Sprint/Safeguard) and USSR (Galoche/Gazelle) was very limited, and could not guarantee anything even remotely approaching a 'leak-proof' defence. Given the destructive potential carried a single warhead, the 'unacceptable damage' factor in the deterrence equation quickly acquired significant weight.
This calculus formed the background for establishing a sub-category of deterrence that, for the USSR and later for China, entered into effect once the state in question possessed a deliverable nuclear weapon, and that existed as a precursor to the state approaching a "minimal deterrence" capacity. This state of affairs has been labelled "existential deterrence" and is based on the capability, even if only theoretical, to inflict severe damage if necessary. In the US-USSR deterrence relationship, the period of "existential deterrence" by the latter of the former was of short duration, lasting roughly from the first Soviet nuclear detonation in 1949 to some point in the mid-to-late 1950s, by which time the USSR -although still at a severe disadvantage in warheads -had several hundred nuclear weapons, sufficient to ensure that any exchange would unavoidably result in "unacceptable damage" to the US. This inaugurated the "minimal deterrent" that Krushchev had referred to in public discourse. 
166
167
By contrast, China's period of "existential deterrence" has lasted much longer. Beijing's nuclear tests were designed to demonstrate not only the capability to create a nuclear explosion (as, for example, India's 1974 test was intended to demonstrate), but in fact to demonstrate a military capability by deploying finished weapons rather than merely physics packages via H-6 bomber.
Having done so, however, China did not embark upon an extensive build-up of its nuclear stockpile; and its development of ballistic missiles, as compared to the rapidity with which the US and Soviet ballistic missile programmes expanded in the 1960s and 1970s, was lethargic. To a certain extent, this slow growth was a consequence of China's limited resources,
168
169
Much of the debate revolves around whether China pursues either minimum deterrence or limited deterrence. Minimum deterrence refers to 'threatening the lowest level of damage necessary to prevent attack, with the fewest number of nuclear weapons possible'. Similarly, limited deterrence 'requires a limited warfighting capability to inflict costly damage on the adversary at every rung on the escalation ladder, thus denying the enemy victory in a nuclear war'. 
170
• China must own strategic nuclear weapons of a definite quality and quantity in order to ensure national security;
• China must guarantee the safety of strategic nuclear bases and prevent against the loss of combat effectiveness from attacks and destruction by hostile countries;
• China must ensure that its strategic nuclear weapons are at a high degree of war preparedness;
• When an aggressor launches a nuclear attack against China, China must be able to launch nuclear counterattack and nuclear re-attack against the aggressor;
• China must pay attention to the global situation of strategic balance and stability and, when there are changes in the situation, adjust its strategic nuclear weapon development strategy in a timely manner. 
172
170
Clearly, at some point between the 1970s and 1990s, China consciously adopted a strategy of limited deterrence. Whether China's nuclear forces were capable of supporting such a policy change when it happened is moot; as occasionally happens, the policy came first, and the forces were later built or adapted to support it. The strategic doctrine issued by Beijing in 2008, for example, "calls for the building of a lean and effective deterrent force and the flexible use of different means of deterrence," 173 and goes on to add that the "Second Artillery Force is…the core force of China for strategic deterrence," and that Second Artillery "is mainly responsible for deterring other countries from using nuclear weapons against China, and for conducting nuclear counterattacks and precision strikes with conventional missiles." 174 Deterrence, so long a dirty word, has undeniably been rehabilitated.
Or has it? Deterrence is yet another area where linguistic divisions, whether accidentally or deliberately, have been permitted to cloud Western understanding of Beijing's intent. One pair of analysts draws a clear distinction between the theoretical, strategic and policy aspects of a given approach to nuclear weapons, and the pragmatic function of those weapons:
Chinese leaders, political and military, have often used the term 'deterrence' to describe the function of China's nuclear weapons, even if they never clearly state that China's nuclear strategy is deterrence….In 1988, 'deterrence' first appeared in a CMC document on China's new-era military strategy. In the same year, another document issued by the CMC more specifically called for 'an emphasis on the deterrence role of the armed forces,' and 'fostering deterrence with Chinese characteristics. 
175
176
177
178
Jiang's interpretation of the meaning of deterrence if anything only clouds the waters. His contention that "China developed strategic nuclear weapons not for attack but for defense" is standard boiler-plate; where the confusion begins is when Jiang asserts that China's possession of nuclear weapons constitutes "a kind of great deterrent toward nuclear weapons states and makes them not dare to act indiscriminately."
179
180
Constructing and maintaining those forces shore up the existential deterrent, but have also gone beyond this limited objective to the point where China, by the early 1980s (at the latest), had a practical as well as theoretical capability to launch a highly damaging retaliatory strike against the US, its most distant likely adversary -in short, the key requirements for a minimal deterrent.
The gradual professionalization of the PLA, its slow re-equipment and re-armament in line with China's increasing national wealth, and the need to combat the accelerating US advantage in conventional weapons systems with potentially strategic reach and impact have since combined to drive an increase in the effectiveness and survivability of the Second Artillery force to the point that China now, arguably, possesses a limited war-fighting capacity that would enable it to maintain control of its forces and reply to strategic attacks beyond a single retaliatory strike. This is the baseline requirement for a limited deterrence strategy. As China's nuclear capability continues to increase, however, while the stockpiles and delivery capabilities of the major NWS continue to decline, the balance of forces will inevitably pull China beyond nuclear minimalism, to the point where its strategic forces are essentially equivalent to those of its likely adversaries. Essential equivalence, however, creates a whole new strategic calculus, and renders feasible new ranges of strategic options that were previously unavailable or at least impracticable -not the least of which are counterforce doctrines, strategic defences, and MAD.
The first paper in this study noted that 'essential equivalence' was an elastic concept based on the notion that there is "an intangible line separating a condition of substantive nuclear monopoly on the use of nuclear force from a condition where two nuclear powers are capable of doing each other significant harm."
181
182
The threshold for a state of "essential equivalence" may, therefore, be adjudged to be rather lowprobably well below "parity." 
183
The deployment pattern for the DF-5A -like the deployment patterns for all of the IRBMs and ICBMs fielded by the PLA -reflected, consciously or no, a strategy that appears in retrospect to have been based largely if not exclusively on a combination of functional minimalism and a desire to demonstrate strategic nuclear capability. This desire has been evident throughout China's trajectory as a nuclear power; the 1964 post-detonation communiqué explicitly highlighted the role of the explosion as a demonstration of "a major achievement of the Chinese people." 
184
185
187
China's deployments also demonstrate the point, made in the first paper in this series, that policy and doctrine are not the same thing, and indeed may not always be entirely consistent. Policy, after all, reflects a government's intentions, while doctrine is designed to describe how a military force intends to fight. 
192
193
196
This approach imposes a number of ineluctable requirements on China's strategic nuclear capability. The first is the problem of survivability. A strategic retaliatory force depends for its credibility not only on the reliability of individual weapons and the national command chain that enables them to be launched in time of crisis, but also on the likelihood that the system can ride out a disarming first strike and retain sufficient retaliatory capacity to still be able to cause unacceptable damage to the attacker. In this context, the Achilles' Heel of China's strategic forces is that they are almost exclusively land-based and, as such, are relatively easy to locate and target with nuclear or advanced conventional weapons.
Since the 1960s, SSBNs have been the answer to the problem of creating a truly survivable retaliatory force 197 ; however, Chinese ballistic missile submarine (and SLBM) technology lags so far behind that of the US that far from enhancing the survivability of its deterrent force, it is likely that putting a significant proportion of its strategic 'eggs' into one slow-moving, easily-detectable 'basket' would place China's strategic deterrent at greater risk. Beijing nonetheless made the effort to do precisely that, developing the Julang (JL -'giant wave') JL-1 SLBM and deploying twelve of them in the Xia SSBN in 1986; and continues to work on resolving crippling design flaws in the JL-2 SLBM and its launch platform, the Jin SSBN. The slow rate of progress on these systems is probably a combination of many things, including (but not necessarily limited to) the degree of technical sophistication required to produce, deploy and operate nuclear-powered fleet ballistic missile submarines and their primary weapon systems; the enormous cost of doing so; and the painful realization that fielding necessarily small numbers of technologically unsophisticated SSBNs against the world's premiere anti-submarine warfare navy in the sort of mid-Pacific deterrence patrol patterns necessary to threaten continental US targets unquestionably qualifies as the strategic equivalent of "besieging a walled city." Another alternative for maintaining the credibility of a nuclear retaliatory force is constructive ambiguity -the approach adopted by Israel since it became an unacknowledged NWS at some point shortly after China did. While the PRC is an openly-acknowledged NWS, it has adopted some of the same principles as Israel with respect to its nuclear forces, maintaining a high degree of secrecy and operational security, and refusing to confirm or deny details reported in open source literature. Imprecise knowledge about the size, shape and status of China's strategic forces suggests that, in time of war, an adversary contemplating a disarming first strike would never be able to be certain that he had located all of China's weapons. Further ambiguity derives from the variety of launch mechanisms China has adopted -fixed launch platforms, silo-based launchers, and road-mobile transport-erector-launcher (TEL) systems, in addition to SLBMs and aircraftdelivered cruise missiles and gravity bombs (for theatre missions), which taken altogether make it more difficult for a potential adversary to ensure that he has found and destroyed all potential threats. Some analysts have suggested that Beijing is comfortable with "the ambiguity surrounding the survivability of its nuclear forces",
198
The struggle to ensure survivability in the face of superior US detection, surveillance, and nuclear and conventional strike capabilities necessarily affects Beijing's perception of how large an arsenal it must maintain in order to ensure the credibility of its strategic deterrent. Another goad is effectiveness of the deterrent force -and effectiveness is measured in more terms than merely the reliability of the weapons and control systems. The decision by the Clinton Administration to deploy a limited ballistic missile defence system (via H.R. 4, the National Missile Defense Act of 1999, which Clinton signed on 23 July of that year) consisting of 100 ground-based interceptors (GBI) in Alaska with associated tracking and control radars and other system architecture was, from Beijing's perspective, a potential game-changer. 
199
The US BMD system added a new factor to the calculus; as one analyst of Chinese nuclear strategy noted, a minimal deterrent posture is highly vulnerable to changes in the strategic situation, and the size necessary to sustain credibility is related not only to the survivability of the deterrent force, but also to the need to "be able to mount a nuclear strike that can penetrate an enemy's missile defense system after surviving a first strike." 
200
201
This naturally begs a chicken-and-egg question: which came first, the policy or the capability? In other words, did China develop nuclear weapons in response to a genuine threat perception derived from its own policy development process? Or did its nuclear weapons policy evolve in the wake of a decision to acquire nuclear weapons for the largely political, non-military benefits accruing ineluctably from the fact of possession? The foregoing chapters suggest the latter -and China's lengthy and often lackadaisical acquisition and modernization processes reinforce the perception that Beijing views its nuclear forces as, first and foremost, a political tool rather than a military one. This in turn suggests that China's nuclear doctrine is a reaction to the fact of possession (it being alien to the military mind to lack a doctrine for employing a weapon that one possesses), and also explains why doctrine and policy appear to diverge. From the military perspective, nuclear weapons are a means to an end; but from the political perspective, they are an end in and of themselves.
If the role of China's nuclear weapons is predominantly political, then one must ask whether China's insistence on a minimum deterrent is a conscious decision, or simply a consequence of the unwillingness or inability on the part of the CPC to expand China's strategic forces beyond the minimum necessary to maintain a credible existential deterrent. The US, for example, built and emplaced more than 1,000 Minuteman-III ICBMs, and sent more than 2,000 Trident D-5 SLBMs to sea. Was China's far lower build-rate for each of its missile classes a consequence of its threat perception, which was undoubtedly different from that of Washington? Was it a consequence of resource constraints, which were undoubtedly tighter in China than in the US? Or was it, as successive White Papers have averred, a deliberate decision to maintain a very small deterrent force deriving its value from a combination of destructive power and uncertainty?
Absent some greater insight into the decision-making processes of the CPC, it is impossible to be certain. However, some indicators are available. Mao, and later Deng, routinely emphasized that while China would become a nuclear power, development and industrialization would continue to be given priority, and that policy certainly continues under the present generation of leadership. This supports the "resource constraints" argument. Lewis also contends that China has deliberately eschewed the kind of survivability measures that one might expect of a NWS concerned about maintaining the viability of its deterrent: "During the depths of the Sino-Soviet crisis," he notes, "China's leaders did not disperse the available stockpile of atomic bombs, instead retaining them under centralized control." 202 This is the opposite of what one would expect a threatened national command authority to do, and it suggests that loss of nuclear control was deemed a greater risk than a disarming first strike. This provides some useful insight into China's confidence in its personnel and command and control measures, which appears to have increased proportional to the professionalization of the PLA; and it reinforces the suggestion that the political role of nuclear weapons may be, in Beijing's eyes, more important than their military role.
The background against which the debate over the future of China's nuclear strategy is being conducted is growing ever more diverse and complicated. Proponents of China's classical military thought continue to argue that "China's nuclear strategy is completely defensive, focused only on deterring the possibility of nuclear blackmail being used against China by other nuclear powers"
203
204
Some authors have gone further, arguing that China may be trending towards establishing a condition of mutual assured destruction vis-à-vis potential adversaries, notably India and the Russian Federation, but most especially the US; however, the characteristics of the force that China appears to be trying to build (and for which the above-mentioned forward-leaning thinkers are calling) is qualitatively different from the sort of force necessary to invoke a state of MAD.
According to Mulvenon, MAD consists in essence of three strategic principles: avoidance of firststrike options, so as to avoid destabilizing the MAD balance; avoidance of counterforce options, so as not to threaten the enemy's weapons systems which are the foundation of his part of the MAD equation; and avoid defences, as these would interfere with the 'assured' part of the balance. 
205
What, then, does China hope to achieve with its nuclear forces? Is it attempting, as Beijing avers and as Brodie suggested, to deter all war as the only sure means of deterring the use of nuclear weapons?
206
207
One of the interesting facets of the Chinese regime's statements about deterrence is their remarkable consistency over the decades since China's entry into the nuclear club. As the various chronologies discussed above have demonstrated, the official Chinese stance on deterrence has gone through several clearly defined periods. During some of these, deterrence seems to have enjoyed official sanction, while during others, the concept stood in bad odour. After China's first nuclear explosion, for example, Beijing argued that the atomic bomb (though a "paper tiger") would strengthen China's national defence and "oppose the U.S. imperialist policy of nuclear blackmail and nuclear threats."
208
Subsequent statements were less clear, at least until the rounding up of the Gang of Four put an end to the anti-intellectual atmosphere of the Cultural Revolution and it was possible to begin to adapt Maoist dogma (especially with respect to People's War) to the new nuclear reality. China was subsequently very close-mouthed concerning its nuclear weapons policy and doctrine, but abandoned its reticence after the fall of the Berlin Wall, when the US and USSR began negotiating deep cuts in their respective arsenals. China became much more active in international arms control and disarmament activities (a phenomenon that will be discussed at greater length in the next chapter), and, as noted above, began vociferously condemning deterrence as the root of all nuclear evil. After several years (perhaps upon noticing that there was no distinction, in English at least, between the deterrent function performed by US and Russian nuclear weapons, and that performed by China's own nuclear arsenal), toward the end of the 1990s the Foreign Ministry amended its talking points, and began condemning -as Hu Jintao did in 2009 -nuclear deterrence "based on [the] first use of nuclear weapons."
209
What is particularly interesting about China's on-again, off-again relationship with deterrence is that it appears to have evolved entirely independent either of technological developments or of deployment patterns. This is the opposite of what happened in the US. As the chronology offered in the first paper in this study makes clear, US nuclear weapons policy and the doctrine for their employment nearly always followed the development and deployment of new weapons systems. Policy, in other words, tended to be based on the possible. In the Chinese case, the reverse has largely been true. For example, China has maintained a no-first-use policy virtually since the hour of its first nuclear explosion; Beijing's post-test statement included a solemn declaration "that China will never at any time or under any circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons." 210 This policy did not derive from capacity; except in the grossest, most potentially suicidal sense, China at the time did not have the capability to execute a pre-emptive nuclear strike against any state. In 1964, China had one warhead; the US had more than 30,000, of which thousands could have reached the Chinese mainland. If anything, the NFU policy was less a statement of moral principle than an outgrowth of logical reasoning; had China ever used nuclear weapons against any NWS (or for that matter, against any ally of a NWS), it would have risked a devastating response.
While these circumstances have changed significantly since China first issued its NFU policy, the policy itself has not changed at all. This suggests that in China, policy may be even less connected to technological or doctrinal developments (both at home, and on the part of its principal adversaries) than is the case in other NWS. The non-connection of Chinese declaratory policy to concrete developments suggests that its policy principally serves political and rhetorical rather than doctrinal and/or military purposes.
There may be a linguistic origin for the apparent disconnect between policy and objective conditions. Deterrence, after all, is a relatively new term in English, at least in its contemporary guise, and is defined as a "thing that deters, esp. nuclear weapon of a State or alliance as deterring attack by another." The same reference defines 'deter' as "discourage or hinder (from) by fear, dislike of trouble, etc."
211
The same source defines détourner as possessing numerous meanings, among them "to turn aside, ward off or divert" (and notes that détourner un coup translates as "to ward off a blow"); and, of course, "to dissuade." There is no translation of 'deterrence' into French in the 1957 edition; the term had perhaps not yet come into sufficiently general usage in English to merit a translation.
As both English and French share Latin roots, it is worth noting that the English 'deter' (although not the French détourner, which is derived from the negation via the prefix dé-of the verb tourner) has its origins in the Latin words deterrƝre and absterrƝre, which, according to Cassel's New Latin Dictionary (1953 ed.), respectively mean "to frighten from, deter, discourage;" and "to frighten away, to drive away by fear." 
212
It is not entirely clear that the term as it is used in the West is accurately reflected in the various Chinese translations that have been proposed. According to Nan Li's 1996 discussion of the evolution of the PLA's warfighting doctrine, Chinese military philosophers traditionally rejected the notion of deterrence:
First, it was thought to brandish violent force (xuanyao wuli), glorify the domination of the strong over the weak (yiqiang linruo), and therefore supported unjust (shidao) wars. Secondly, deterrence has always been associated with aggression and expansion of imperialist countries, and is analogous to naked military blackmail... 
213
214
215
216
To a certain extent, China's military theorists and analysts appear to be struggling with many of the same issues that arose in the US during the 1950s and 1960s as their American counterparts attempted to come to grips with the growing realization that nuclear weapons, far from being nothing more than "bigger bombs", were fundamentally different. In both the US and the Chinese experience, one of the first places where the difference between conventional and atomic munitions became manifest was in target selection. In Making the Atomic Bomb, Richard Rhodes offers some details of the deliberations that resulted in the selection of Hiroshima and Nagasaki for the first combat use of the new weapon (as opposed to, for example, the former imperial capital of Kyoto, which had been the first choice of the Manhattan Project's chief, Major-General Leslie Groves). The key factors in the decision had little to do with eliminating the war industry of Japan, and much more to do with demoralizing the Japanese people (something that the firebombing of Tokyo and the deaths of 100,000 of its citizens had been unable to accomplish) and sending a message to the Japanese leadership (and, perhaps equally importantly, to Stalin) about America's capability and resolve. The hoped-for psychological impact of the strike, in other words, outweighed practical military concerns. This principle carried through US nuclear strike planning in the early decades of the superpower arms race, and continues to resonate to this dayincluding among Chinese strategists, who agree that "deterrence is psychological and that targets must be carefully chosen to deliver the right message and control escalation."
217
218
219
220
It is worth noting that this argument is equally valid from both directions: if one's intent is to fight and win local wars, then one needs the capability to do so in order to pose a credible deterrent threat; whereas if one's intent is simply to deter aggression, one still needs to build the capability to fight and win local wars if deterrence is to work. Intent, therefore, is irrelevant; the deterrent threat flows from the existence of a credible military capability and the perception that one possesses the political will to make use of it. This facilitates risk assessment by eliminatingto parse a Rumsfeldian phrase -'unknowable unknowns' like an adversary's intent, and basing the deterrent calculus instead upon somewhat more objective criteria, such as capability assessments. That said, China fits only uncomfortably into this mould; as Lewis notes, the rolling and largely minimalist nature of Chinese strategic force deployments means that China has never deployed as many strategic weapons systems as it has been capable of deploying. 
221
Some writers seem to think that China will continue to adhere it its limited deterrence policy for the foreseeable future
222
• cause the will of the enemy (and the populace) to waver;
• destroy the enemy's command and control system;
• delay the enemy's war (or combat) operations;
• reduce the enemy's force generation and war-making potential; and,
• degrade the enemy's ability to win a nuclear war. 
223
It is always risky to cite Chinese military authorities; as in the West, off-the-cuff bluster does not necessarily represent government policy. That said, however, as China's nuclear strategy is, according to Chinese sources, informed equally by political and military considerations, it is worth noting that Second Artillery's commander at the turn of the millennium, the aforementioned Zhao Xijun, is on record arguing that "one should employ nuclear weapons to initiate active nuclear deterrence against the enemy."
225
It is not clear from Zhao's words where such strikes would take place (e.g., on the territory of an enemy state; against an enemy formation on neighbouring terrain; or against enemy troops on Chinese territory); nor is it evident that China would, in accordance with its long-standing NFU policy, necessarily wait for an enemy to use nuclear weapons first before engaging in 'active nuclear deterrence'. Clearly there is a gulf between our understanding of China's nuclear strategy, our assumptions concerning China's approach to deterrence, our deconstruction of China's nuclear intentions, and what we may logically or reasonably infer from China's many statements on matters nuclear.
Some of these factors -for example, China's political intentions -are irreducible; 'black boxes', as it were, that cannot be decrypted without more insight into the internal deliberations of China's nuclear decision-making machinery than we presently enjoy, or are ever likely to. Others, however, like declaratory policy, are perforce more open and transparent, and thus may be subjected to more profound investigation. The next two chapters of this paper will undertake a more in-depth examination of the four foundational elements of China's declaratory nuclear policy: its long-standing NFU policy for nuclear weapons; its position and role in multilateral nuclear arms control and disarmament negotiations; its opposition, often vociferous, to Washington's development and deployment of strategic missile defences; and what appears to have been a gradual and often uneven evolution from a policy of minimal deterrence to one of limited or graduated response -or perhaps even counterforce.
As has already been noted, declaratory policy, precisely because of its key political role as a tool of diplomacy, can be misleading. Indeed, its very purpose may be to mislead. 
226
For this reason, a closer examination of some of the long-standing trends in China's declaratory policy vis-à-vis nuclear weapons is warranted. While China maintains one of the world's more secretive and deliberately opaque political systems, Beijing's ability to conceal its intentions continues to decrease. Satellite observation, the Internet, and perhaps most importantly a deliberate policy of expanding trade and financial interaction with key markets, all combine to inexorably increase the bi-directional permeability of China's national security barriers. Absent some unforeseen internal convulsion, China will never become an open society -but technology and policy are wearing away its defences. This trend increasingly enables analysts to compare policy to activity to see whether China's words match its deeds. This chapter will examine three trends that have emerged from China's four decades as a NWS. These trends -China's long-standing insistence that it maintains a strict no first-use policy for nuclear weapons; its perspective on the role of, and its gradually increasing participation in, international nuclear arms control and disarmament negotiations, albeit for purposes not entirely aligned with the ostensible goals of those negotiations; and its growing opposition to ballistic missile defences -are all key aspects of China's declaratory policy. The manner in which these elements of policy have evolved will serve as the segue into the final chapter of this paper, which will examine what appears to be a trend away from China's traditional policy of minimal deterrence. In addition to the inherent value of examination and discussion, these elements of declaratory policy will serve as a basis for later portions of this study, examining the correlationor lack thereof -between China's nuclear declaratory policy and its behaviour, both in terms of nuclear force modernization and expansion, and more broadly as a major actor in the Asia-Pacific region.
China has always stayed true to its commitments that it will not be the first to use nuclear weapons at any time and in any circumstances, and will unconditionally not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or in nuclear-weapon-free zones.

231
China's NFU pledge originates in the statement issued by Beijing on the occasion of its first nuclear test on 16 October 1964: "The Chinese government hereby solemnly declares that China will never at any time or under any circumstances be the first to use nuclear weapons." 232 As an exercise in declaratory policy, this first iteration of the NFU pledge was strategically sound. A nuclear test device is not necessarily a weapon, and even if it were, China had neither the number of weapons necessary to pose any sort of threat to either of the nuclear superpowers, nor the means to deliver them (especially vis-à-vis the US, which in 1964 had nearly 5,000 strategic nuclear weapons, and the ability to deliver them to China). China faced no credible threat of serious attack by any non-nuclear state, and using one or two nuclear weapons against the Soviet Union in the event of a border clash would have been ill-advised. In the strategic context in which it was devised, China's NFU pledge made sense.
Beyond this, however, an early NFU pledge also served a number of important political purposes. First, it allowed China to simultaneously showcase its technological savoir-faire while allowing the regime to perpetuate the Maoist doctrine that nuclear weapons were "paper tigers"; Beijing was bragging that while it could produce nuclear weapons, it disdained them in favour of the power of the moral over the material and the overwhelming superiority of People's War. Second, the pledge allowed Beijing to define, and then to seize, the moral high ground in the nuclear debate. The existence of that moral high ground remains open to debate. In the realm of nuclear deterrence, there is no special virtue in ruling out first use. Under the strategic condition of MAD, mutual survival depends on mutual restraint, which in turn depends on the credibility of the threat that any provocation will inevitably result in consequences out of all proportion to any expected benefits of aggression. The stability of such a relationship depends upon maintaining the firm belief on the part of all participants that nuclear use as a response to provocation -including first use -is not only possible but inevitable. A pledge never to use nuclear weapons first therefore undermines the deterrent relationship, unless the state making the pledge is not part of the deterrent relationship to begin with -and China in 1964 was not. Had China been a participant in the deterrent calculus, its pledge would have been dangerous. Because it was not, its pledge was irrelevant.
The complexities of such arguments, of course, tend to be lost on those unfamiliar with the often arcane nature of discussions of nuclear deterrence, and China was able to parlay its NFU pledge into a posture of moral superiority, especially vis-à-vis the US -which, after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, could never credibly claim a NFU, and which in any case, being a participant in the US-Soviet 'balance of terror', it could never do. Most foreign observers (many of whom were besotted with Mao and his visions of a socialist utopia even while the gruesome excesses of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were under way) overlooked the fact that any use of a nuclear weapon by China against a major nuclear power would have constituted national suicide, and therefore failed to recognize that China's NFU pledge simply made a political virtue out of a strategic necessity. Finally, the pledge cost Beijing nothing and, because policy may be altered at any time (the political plasticity enjoyed by centralized totalitarian regimes vastly exceeds that available to decision-makers in representative democracies), it placed no constraints upon Beijing's strategic flexibility.
There is some logic in the argument that China's NFU pledge is grounded in large part in its conventional military doctrine. The People's Republic was born as the result of victory in a largely conventional military context, and the long-standing People's War dogma put the maintenance of large (if not necessarily state-of-the-art) land forces at the forefront of policy.
There are numerous threads to the overall rationale for the size and scope of capabilities created and maintained by the PLA over the past sixty years, not all of them obvious to outside analysts, and not all of them related to external threats. To a certain extent, China maintained an enormous and technologically limited army because the founding of the People's Republic had depended on such a force, and its lack of a sophisticated scientific and industrial base prevented it from creating a force modelled on those of the victorious powers after the Second World War. The demands of internal security likewise augured in favour of a large army, as did that army's role in domestic engineering and infrastructure projects, as well as the social value of providing employment for large numbers of men of military age. The nature of external threats -e.g., from Russia, with both an enormous, sophisticated military force bolstered by nuclear weapons, and later from India, with a population approaching China's in size -also demanded a large force. Finally, China's lack of the nuclear option required an army that "could defeat a foreign invasion without using its nuclear weapons." 
233
China's nuclear weapons capabilities, while significant and growing, do not approach, and absent some unforeseen (and inexplicable) policy decisions on the part of Washington or Moscow will not exceed, those of its most likely adversaries; and China still does not face any significant threat of a land invasion. There is still value to maintaining a large military force, although China is, for reasons that will be discussed elsewhere, embarking upon a comprehensive programme of modernization and upgrades, with the result that China's capacity to respond to a conventional military attack either against its territory or in its immediate vicinity has greatly improved in recent years. 
234
Other trends, however, suggest that amendments to the NFU policy may be justified. As noted above, there are political benefits, and no operational downsides, to declaring a NFU policy when one is a relative underdog in terms of aggregate nuclear capability. China's arsenal, however, is expanding rapidly as a consequence of policy decisions taken in Beijing, while the arsenals of its principal rivals, the US and Russia, are shrinking (or at least stagnating) in response to arms reduction agreements like Bush's SORT and Obama's New START. As I have already argued, both above and elsewhere
235
236
There are valid reasons to be concerned about Beijing's commitment to this element of its declaratory policy. Some observers have drawn a distinction between China's NFU pledge and its promise never to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons "against non-nuclear weapon states or in nuclear weapon-free zones" -an undertaking generally referred to as a negative security assurance, or NSA. Beijing's 2006 Defence White Paper characterizes the NSA as an "unconditional pledge", whereas China has stated that is "firmly committed" to its NFU policy.
According to one US analyst, "one does not need to be an international lawyer or grammarian to understand that a 'firm commitment to policy' is not as strong a position as an 'unconditional pledge'." 237 This is a valid point. Moreover, it is worth noting that concerns about translation do not necessarily apply; the English translations of China's Defence White Papers are prepared exclusively for Western consumption as an exercise in declaratory policy, and it may therefore be assumed that they were crafted with an eye to careful and precise expression. It is also worth noting that the language in the 2008 iteration of the Defence White Paper changed slightly; while China still promises that it "will unconditionally not use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or in nuclear-weapon-free zones", Beijing in 2008 stated that it is "committed" -rather than "firmly committed", as was the case in 2006 -to its NFU policy. 
238
239
The NFU divides the 'nuclear haves' into two classes: a more moral group with no-first-use policies and a less moral group with first-use or conditional no-firstuse. Among the P5, the former Soviet Union and China were two states that belonged to the NFU category, while the other three fall into a different group. 
240
241
Beyond purely political considerations, of course, there are a number of strategic justifications underlying China's NFU pledge. In her testimony to Congress in the late 1960s, Alice Langley Hsieh explained the early rationale behind Beijing's policy: …the position that the Chinese have taken on the no-first-use of nuclear weapons suggests that China may see in the possession of a nuclear capability a means of enhancing the role of their conventional forces. The Chinese may believe that the threat of China's conventional involvement under a nuclear umbrella may make the United States reluctant to intervene in local crisis situations for fear either of ground confrontation with the Chinese or escalation to the nuclear level. 
242
The threat of a Chinese counter-value attack naturally raised the question of obviating that threat through pre-emptive counterforce strikes. This option was mooted early on in the US. In 1972, for example, an analyst writing in Foreign Affairs noted that "a first strike could very largely eliminate China's nuclear capabilities," and that this made Beijing's NFU pledge a smart political move:
In so far as a solemn declaration foreswearing first use tends to make it morally more difficult for others to use nuclear weapons against China, the P.R.C. continues to be well served by it. Moreover, it is also self-evident that, given the marked disparities between the Chinese nuclear force as it will be for the rest of the 1970s and the forces possessed by the United States and the Soviet Union, first use by China against either 'nuclear superpower' (a term the Chinese use only derogatorily) would be suicidal. 
243
244
Debate over the continued viability of the NFU pledge is nothing new; many Chinese analysts, particularly those of the uniformed persuasion, have been calling for review and reinterpretation of the policy since the late 1970s. In recent years, the calls have ranged from proposals for modification, if not necessarily renunciation 245 , to suggestions that Beijing needs to be more forthright in describing the conditions under which nuclear use would be considered -"for example, if an enemy's conventional attack threatened the survival of China's nuclear force, or of the regime itself." 246 This latter approach would be more in line with the new interpretation of the what, for example, Washington or Moscow might consider 'first use'. An attack against China's interests that had a disproportionate strategic effect, for example, might be deemed worthy of a nuclear response even if the attack was carried out with conventional weapons. In such circumstances, it becomes necessary for the adversary facing a potential Chinese response to calculate ante facto the potential impact of any proposed military operation.
One obvious example would be the use by the US, in time of severe crisis and in anticipation of a Chinese nuclear attack, of advanced conventional attacks to eliminate as much of China's strategic retaliatory capability as possible. This would require destroying, as a priority, those weapon systems capable of reaching the continental United States quickly (all deployed DF-5A and DF-31/31A ICBMs) or after a submarine cruise (the single Xia SSBN or its Jin successor); and those capable of directly targeting key US facilities in the Western Pacific and/or key US allies (the DF-3A and DF-4 MRBMs, DF-21 IRBMs and the H-6K bombers capable of carrying cruise missiles). The immediate strategic target set probably consists of 40 mobile and static ICBM launchers and a single submarine -a complex but probably not insurmountable tactical problem for the US military even if restricted to only conventional weapons. The strategic impact of such a series of conventional strikes, however, would be severe, and except in terms of collateral damage, would from Beijing's perspective be "indistinguishable from a disarming nuclear strike." The question, therefore, is whether China's NFU policy is, in the face of such a capability, still tenable.
251
Conventional attacks against China's strategic assets are not the only contingency that might trigger nuclear use. The US DOD perceives "some ambiguity over the conditions under which China's NFU policy would apply, including, for example, whether strikes on what China considers its own territory, demonstration strikes, or high-altitude bursts would constitute a first use." 
252
253
In this context, an comprehensive assessment of China's vital strategic interests becomes important. According to the 2008 White Paper, these are "the protection of national sovereignty, security, territorial integrity, safeguarding of the interests of national development, and the interests of the Chinese people." 
254
255
The insertion of a new degree of strategic flexibility as regards China's nuclear assets is also getting more play in official circles. This, as one author notes, is a relative novelty, a significant change after a long period of treating the topic of nuclear strategy as off-limits for those not in official government circles:
The continuity of China's no-first-use principle is also the result of the absence of policy discussions on nuclear doctrines. Until the 1990s civilian experts on foreign policy and national security, who were based in universities and research institutes, were largely excluded from policy deliberations. In the last ten years or so the situation has changed dramatically. The Chinese government now routinely solicits opinions from civilian experts on its foreign and security policies. However, nuclear doctrinal issues have remained a taboo area. 
256
257
258
The US DOD -admittedly a not entirely objective source -argues that the most important part of the phrase 'active defence' is the adjective rather than the noun. US assessments of Chinese doctrinal writings have led the DOD to conclude that "striking only after the enemy has struck does not mean waiting for the enemy's strike passively….It doesn't mean to give up the 'advantageous chances' in campaign or tactical operations, for the 'first shot' on the plane of politics must be differentiated from the 'first shot' on the plane of tactics." This suggests that Chinese interpretations of the implications of 'active defence' mean that "if any country or organization violates the other country's sovereignty and territorial integrity, the other side will have the right to 'fire the first shot' on the plane of tactics."
259
The Taiwan issue, which will be discussed at greater length in a later paper in this study, lies at the heart of concerns, both internal and external to China, over the continuing viability of Beijing's NFU pledge. Taiwan represents two vital national interests for China: over the longer term, the reincorporation of the island into the political structure of the mainland is a key political goal; while over the near term, the regime has defined the avoidance of a unilateral declaration of independence as a vital national interest. As a consequence of the emphasis that Beijing has placed on the question of Taiwan's future and the gradual emergence of nationalism alongside Maoism as a key national animating sentiment, it is widely assumed that either a declaration of independence by Taipei, alone or in company with a successful US intervention in a cross-Straits conflict leading to de jure Taiwanese independence under US sponsorship, would imperil the CPC regime in Beijing.
A recent analysis of China's NFU policy argued that because either of these outcomes would "jeopardize the most essential national interests of China…when a war in the Taiwan Strait looks imminent, China will be under tremendous pressure to rely on nuclear deterrence to prevent these worst case scenarios," as either of them "could trigger a collapse of the regime."
260
It is highly reasonable to assume that Chinese leaders, when facing imminent American intervention in the Taiwan Strait, may just choose a flexible approach to the no-first-use policy, since the consequence of not doing so could result in the worst possible military and political scenarios for China. 
261
263
Since it is impossible to predict the future, and because decisions are made by individuals whose reactions in time of crisis are likewise unpredictable, this fourth category may only be defined after the fact, on the basis of empirical observation of state conduct in time of crisis. To date China has never been faced with a crisis that has resulted in abandonment of the NFU pledge. By the same token, however, China has also never been faced with a crisis that posed a serious threat to its sovereignty, national security, economic development, territorial integrity, the "interests of the Chinese people", or the survival of the CPC regime. Given that Beijing has itself stated that it places the protection of these interests above all else, it is not unreasonable to assess that 'all else' includes self-imposed constraints on the employment of available assets the use of which could mean the difference between success and failure.
In her 1984 treatise, The March of Folly, Barbara Tuchman described 'self-interest' as "whatever conduces to the welfare or advantage of the body being governed," and "folly" as "a policy that in these terms is counter-productive." 
264
From Beijing's perspective, the NFU pledge is a pragmatic policy response to objective strategic conditions. Despite the moral connotations attending the pledge, it no more constitutes a seizure of the alleged moral high ground than would an earnest pledge by a welterweight boxer to the world heavyweight champion never to throw the first punch. It is a highly symbolic gesture, and has no stabilizing value in the East-West deterrent calculus, as "it is not verifiable and any violation of the pledge would not be detected until it is too late."
265
For the time being, Beijing has everything to gain and nothing to lose by maintaining NFU as a key element of its declaratory nuclear policy, as doing so allows the CPC regime to take the moral high road while retaining the option of abrogating the policy at any time. In combination with minimal/limited deterrence, NFU allows Beijing to avoid having to make the significant changes to its nuclear policy that the open pursuit of any approach other than NFU would dictate. China, for example, possesses neither the quantity nor the quality of nuclear forces necessary to a policy of nuclear pre-emption; it cannot adopt a policy of launch-on-warning, as it does not have the requisite suite of surveillance assets necessary to detect an attack before the detonations begin; and it cannot adopt a policy of launch-under-attack, as Beijing, for reasons of security, safety and incapacity, keeps its warheads separated from its missiles, its SSBNs out of range of likely US targets, and its longest-range strategic missiles unfuelled. In short, China's NFU pledge constitutes a long-standing policy of ascribing virtue to a strategic necessity, while reserving the right to use nuclear weapons in carefully circumscribed circumstances where China's vital national interests are at stake, and where, therefore, it would be both logical and necessary to do so. The pledge therefore consists of nothing more than a promise the China will never be the first to use nuclear weapons, except in those specific circumstances where it would make the most strategic sense for China to be the first to use nuclear weapons. The fact that this almost by definition makes the NFU pledge an empty gesture has not prevented Beijing from enjoying the praise of individuals, groups and states that are either unaware of the objective realities of the Sino-American strategic relationship, or that, by virtue of their dogged antipathy towards the US, are simply uninterested in them.
Faced with defeat in a conventional conflict over a matter impinging upon its vital national interests, would Beijing accept all of the anticipated internal consequences of failure, or would the regime, in extremis, fall back on its nuclear capability, and risk inviting an overwhelming and potentially devastating response? It is impossible to say. Beijing might prefer to signal its intentions with a nuclear strike against a theoretically deniable target -for example, rather than striking a US carrier battle group, Beijing might destroy a large ROC military installation on Taiwan, claiming the attack as a strike on Chinese territory. Such a move might be sufficient to deter a nervous US administration; but if it were not, then the question becomes, what next?
It is likely that the Chinese leadership would prefer to avoid escalating a conflict with a more powerful, nuclear-armed rival, but its ability to do so will depend on whether Beijing is able to decouple the outcome of the crisis from its own prospects for political survival. This will not be easy to do, especially with respect to threats against interests that the regime has defined as vital, and that Beijing has repeatedly used to excite nationalistic sentiment. The key concern in this connection is of course Taiwan, concerning the future of which the CPC regime has repeatedly and explicitly nailed its colours to the mast. This linkage could put Beijing -and with it the rest of the world -in a very uncomfortable position if the situation in the Strait were ever to come to blows.
There is a general belief in the peaceful character of the Chinese regime based on no more solid evidence than the natural desire of the peoples concerned and on the Chinese rulers' skill in using the term 'peace' with all the ambiguity which attaches to it in communist doctrine. 
266
269
Its regular pronouncements and condemnations notwithstanding, China's post-1964 commitment to nuclear non-proliferation, arms control and disarmament (NACD) has been largely oratorical rather than concrete, and has been driven -like all other aspects of its policy -by practical rather than altruistic motivations. Despite deriding nuclear weapons as "paper tigers" and disparaging them as inferior to the power of an aroused proletariat, China under Mao called routinely for universal disarmament, probably out of fear of the impact that an "early total nuclear strike" 270 would have had on China's plans for industrialization. Calls for universal disarmament are a logical tool for non-nuclear powers and emergent NWS; they are perceived as a means of diminishing disparities in the respective size and capability of arsenals, both through actual reductions in stockpile sizes and delivery systems, and also through a perceived process of what has in recent years been referred to as 'denormalization' (despite the lack of any evidence that such moral arguments affect the strategic calculus of rational states. They certainly have not, for example, affected Beijing's strategic calculus one whit).
In fact, China's approach to nuclear NACD has never been smooth or free from equivocation. In his first speech to the UN General Assembly on 15 November 1971, for example, China's Vice-Foreign Minister stated that "China's nuclear weapons are still in the experimental stage and China would never take part in the socalled [sic] nuclear disarmament talks behind the backs of the non-nuclear power [sic]", and urged the member states not to put the question of arms control and disarmament talks to a vote.

Lewis has described this attempted linkage as "largely symbolic", but this is a canard. China's arms control rhetoric has for decades been largely divorced from reality. This is not symbolism, but cynicism; a recognition by Beijing that it can say one thing and do another, and that it will not  
Inc., 1965), 232. 277
278
The dichotomy in China's use of moral arguments is revealed by the fact that Beijing "strongly condemned" the 1998 nuclear tests by India, a traditional adversary, while expressing only "deep regret" over the response by its client state, Pakistan. 
279
280
281
282
In essence, Beijing appears to view nuclear NACD not, as it claims, as a moral imperative to realize "the lofty aim of complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons" (1964) or to establish a world-wide "unequivocal commitment to the thorough destruction of nuclear weapons" ( 
2008
Other suggested arms control remedies may, as has so often happened in the past, be overtaken by technological developments. China, like the US, has signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT -neither has yet ratified it). This has led some observers to posit that "China's signature of the CTBT means that Beijing continues to accept the constraints imposed on its ability to test, a critical step in the development of new nuclear weapons, especially the miniaturization of nuclear warheads for new ballistic missiles currently under development." 286 This is not necessarily the case. Western proponents of the CTBT have argued that the US need not fear ratification, as new warhead designs may be tested by computer modelling -and China, in October 2010, announced that it had developed the fastest computer in the world. According to news reports, the Tianhe (Milky Way)-1A, at 2.5 petaflops (2.5 trillion calculations per second) is 47 percent faster than the 1.7 petaflops recorded by the XT5 Jaguar at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee 287 -which, perhaps not coincidentally, is the facility that performs highspeed modelling operations for the Department of Energy. China, therefore, is likely just as well positioned as the US to continue to explore new nuclear weapon designs regardless of whether it ratifies the CTBT.
In February 2008, one year after having conducted a test of a direct-ascent anti-satellite (ASAT) weapon, China, in cooperation with Russia, submitted a draft treaty to the Conference on Disarmament proposing an international agreement on "The Prevention of the Placement of Weapons in Outer Space and the Threat or Use of Force against Outer Space Objects." In its 2008 White Paper, Beijing stated, with enviable cheek, that the "Chinese government has all along advocated the peaceful use of outer space, and opposed the introduction of weapons and an arms

The dichotomy between what China says and what it does would only be a weakness if China intended its words to be consistent with its deeds. As the citation from Kissinger heading this chapter suggests, the meaning and purpose of declaratory policy (and the rhetoric with which it is often accompanied) must be understood in the context of the character of the government making the pronouncement. Analysts who look only at China's statements in isolation from its actions in all areas are unlikely to recognize this -particularly if they insist on ascribing philanthropic motives to proclamations that, as history demonstrates, are intended solely to advance China's strategic interests, and are rarely if ever backed up by deeds.
On 11 January 2010, China conducted a live-fire test of a mid-course interceptor for an antiballistic missile (ABM) system. According to a secret cable from the US, the interceptor destroyed the target missile, a CSS-X-11 (modified DF-11), at an altitude of 250 km. A Chinese news service provided only a very terse report: "On 11 January, China conducted a test on ground-based midcourse missile interception technology within its own territory. The test has achieved the expected objective. The test is defensive in nature and is not targeted at any country." It is worth noting that, according to the cable, the interceptor was based on the same rocket booster as that which lofted the kill vehicle for the successful 2007 ASAT test. 
299
306
307
Of these postulated concerns, only the first is credible. Washington has not transferred its GBI technology to either Taiwan or Japan -although it is not at all unlikely that further Chinese strategic force modernization coupled with the growing capability of the PLA to deny US forces access to China's maritime area of influence could increase the Taiwanese and Japanese threat perceptions to the point where Tokyo and Taipei might press for such technology transfers. The concern about 'unilateralism' is a canard; Washington is the only capital in recent memory to actually seek international authorization prior to launching any sort of military campaign. And it represents the height of chutzpah for Beijing to suggest that Washington's BMD program could "adversely impact" the nuclear NACD agenda when China has provided nuclear and ballistic missile assistance to dangerous state actors like Iran and Pakistan, conducted an unprovoked and highly contaminating ASAT test, and is the only state presently expanding its nuclear arsenal. This is not to say that concerns about the potential deleterious effect of the US BMD system on China's strategic deterrent are invalid. While in its present limited state the system could not defeat a massed Chinese ICBM strike against the continental US, a surprise attack is not the most likely scenario. It is more likely that an escalating crisis leading to nuclear threats by Beijing would prompt Washington to attempt to eliminate as many of China's strategic weapons as could be found. If many or most of China's ICBMs could be destroyed on the ground, those that remained could be engaged by sea-and ground-based interceptors, limiting the number of warheads that could reach the continental US. Such a conventional counterforce scenario likely lies at the heart of recent pronouncements by Chinese officials that a disarming conventional attack would be deemed sufficient cause to generate a nuclear response. The existence of a US missile defence system, therefore, should logically reduce China's incentive to rattle its nuclear sabre in time of crisis. No less an authority than Dyson has argued that ballistic missile defences reduce the crisis instability of strategic doctrines based on counterforce or limited nuclear options. 
308
The US 'unilateralism' argument, while not supportable on its face, 309 is perhaps less disingenuous when one considers that US 'unilateralism' is often understood to be code for US support to Taiwan. Some Chinese analysts have opined that the effective neutralization of China's deterrent capability would cause Washington to be "less cautious about drifting into a Taiwan Strait crisis." 310 Such language says more about the political predilections of the authors than about any rational concern. Washington, after all, is highly unlikely to "drift" into a potential confrontation with a nuclear-armed adversary; such a thing has yet to happen in the nuclear era. Moreover, it hardly constitutes drifting when defence and security support to Taiwan is mandated by legislation (e.g., the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act) and by Congressional resolutions reaffirming the principles of that legislation. 
311
The third chapter of this paper examined in detail the evolution of China's complicated relationship with the concept of deterrence. As has already been noted, the most common analytical assessment of China's approach to nuclear strategy is that it is based on a concept of minimal deterrence under which China deliberately maintains only that level of strategic nuclear forces necessary to ensure a survivable retaliatory strike capacity that is capable of inflicting unacceptable damage on a potential aggressor regardless of any pre-emptive or defensive measure that adversary may take. Other analysts argue that China either follows or aspires to a limited deterrence doctrine, the principle characteristics of which are the infrastructure and weapons systems necessary to execute a sequential nuclear exchange -in other words, limited nuclear warfighting. A third concept explored in this paper is the possibility that Beijing maintains a composite nuclear strategy consisting of both political and military elements, in which the former are grounded in a minimal deterrent strategy, but the latter, in order to maintain the credibility of the deterrent force, are grounded in military preparations to fight a limited nuclear war.
The fourth chapter expanded upon the composite nuclear strategy concept by examining three key elements of China's declaratory policy comprising important aspects of its multi-axis compendium of nuclear policy. While Beijing describes its NFU policy, its position on the international nuclear NACD regime and its opposition to missile defences in terms of moral imperatives and a quest for peace and security, its actions in each of these areas suggest that its policy is merely intended to temporarily offset the advantages, technological and otherwise, enjoyed by its adversaries until such a time as China is able to catch up or other neutralize those advantages (e.g., through asymmetric means). The political axis of Beijing's composite nuclear strategy, therefore, while seemingly disconnected from the reality of Beijing's strategic force development, deployment, doctrine, training and modernization activities, in fact appears to serve a broader political purpose by putting a benign face on the slow but steady transformation of China's strategic capability.
Opacity and lack of data necessitate speculation. Absent the disclosure of official documents providing a comprehensive and accurate depiction of the internal processes of key CPC decisionmaking bodies, those processes, and the substance of the debates that take place within them, are likely to remain obscure. What does seem clear is that China's approach to nuclear weapons, nuclear strategy, declaratory nuclear policy and nuclear doctrine all appear to be changing. New weapons systems, including new asymmetric capabilities, are being developed, introduced to military service, and deployed. The complexity and tempo of operational training for nuclear forces is being increased. Nuclear strategy is being increasingly discussed in scholarly as well as military circles. China has begun publicizing tests of strategic weapon systems. It is widely assumed that the purpose of these changes is to underwrite China's long-term strategic goals of diluting US power and influence in the Western Pacific; denying the US the ability to conduct military operations in China's area of interest; and cementing China's place as the dominant power in Asia. China presumably crafts its nuclear posture to support its broader political strategy. This chapter will examine the contention, frequently cited in the open literature, that China's nuclear posture is -whether deliberately or as a consequence of ongoing force structure and doctrinal changes -evolving away from minimal deterrence, and towards something else.
In the second chapter of this paper, we examined the proposition that China's modern military strategic thought has its roots in ancient philosophical and military treatises. The scholars that produced these treatises were, by and large, vocal advocates of limited warfare. Sun Tzu was a strong proponent of limited conflict, and the concept dovetails comfortably with the military experience of the Warring States period and the wars fought by successive dynasties. With the exception of the Mongol invasions of the 13 th Century that ended the Jin and Song Dynasties and established the Yuan Dynasty under Khubilai Khan, the bulk of China's military history has been one of what might be considered relatively limited wars conducted for relatively limited aims. There is, for example, no Chinese parallel to Alexander, expansionist Rome, Imperial Britain, Napoleonic France, Nazi Germany, or America's modern global economic and military empire.
For nearly all of its history prior to the so-called Century of Humiliation (bainian guochi, 1839-1949), China never had to exert more than a small fraction of its strength to achieve its military objectives. 
312
As Chapter 2 suggested, China's vastly different history and strategic culture may be the source of some of the cognitive dissonance on display when Beijing deployed its first generation of strategic weapons. People's War was paramount; men were more important than materiel; and yet China's early deployments were of low numbers of relatively inaccurate, liquid-fuelled missiles aimed at cities and armed with multi-megaton thermonuclear warheads. For safety reasons the missiles had to remain unfuelled until hours before launch; and for security reasons, the warheads were stored separately from the missiles, and had to be transported to the launch sites and fixed to the missiles prior to firing. These were not the weapons of limited warfare. They offered no possibility of finesse, of the fine calculations and careful judgements demanded by Sun Tzu. They could not effect a pre-emptive strike -certainly not against a vastly more capable adversary like the USSR or the US (and because there was no possibility of pre-emption, there was no political or operational cost to, and thus nothing particularly laudable in, implementing a NFU policy).
China's first generation of nuclear thinkers gradually came to grips with the fact that a minimal deterrent policy combined with primitive nuclear and missile technology necessitates a 'citybashing' posture. One strategist in the 1980s pointed out that it was "unnecessary…to achieve tremendous accuracy. If a nuclear war breaks out between China and the Soviet Union, I do not think there is too much difference between the results, provided China's ICBM misses its predetermined target, the Kremlin, and instead hits the Bolshoi Theatre."
314
During the 1969 Sino-Soviet conflict, for example, DF-4 units were moved to Qinghai to threaten Soviet targets -cities, most likely -with their multi-megaton warheads.
315
The principal conundrum facing nuclear theorists in an 'underdog' NWS is the inexorable calculus of deterrence. The credibility of any deterrent force rests on both the capability of that force vis-à-vis a potential adversary, and the political will of the government. Political will can be difficult to generate, but the problem is mitigated if one is in a position of extreme superiority. The credibility of a minimal deterrent, in stark contrast, depends on the willingness of a government to threaten and execute a retaliatory counter-value strike against a far better-armed opponent, in the full knowledge that doing so will invite a potentially devastating response. In China's case, in the event of a strategic conflict with the US, it is unlikely that Washington would be able to destroy all of China's ICBMs before they could be launched, or intercept all of the warheads carried by those that were launched. This is the basis of China's deterrent concept at present. But is it realistic? Would China actually launch a thermonuclear warhead at a US city (or, in some spasmodic götterdammerung, against the population centres of Washington's Asian allies), knowing that America could obliterate every Chinese population centre of significance in less than an hour? Is Beijing banking on Washington's willingness (and for that matter, its ability) to demonstrate restraint after suffering the loss of, for example, Los Angeles, and the deaths of millions of its citizens? Is China's deterrent policy based on a presumption of American selfcontrol and -for lack of a better word -humanity?
Minimal deterrence, simply put, is inherently unstable because it is rational only if the underdog in the deterrent relationship understands and accepts that a single retaliatory strike would constitute national suicide, and that every strategic crisis must therefore inevitably end in being forced to back down. In order to increase the stability of the relationship, the underdog must be able to engage in escalation, targeting less valuable assets with smaller warheads while retaining the ability to conduct more devastating strikes if provocations continue. This requires progressing beyond minimal deterrence to a limited deterrence posture based on some small degree of nuclear war-fighting capability -the capacity, as Godwin puts it, "to respond to any level of nuclear attack from tactical to strategic." 
316
317
"Enemy political and economic centers, especially important urban areas, with a goal of creating great shock in the enemy population's spirit and destroying their will to wage war;
"[…] the critical infrastructure of the enemy to weaken the enemy's capacity for war (examples for targets are petroleum refining, storage and shipping links; electric power generation and transmission lines; and major heavy industry); "Enemy transportation networks;
"Major military targets such as air force and navy staging areas and bases to degrade the ability of these services to wage war; and, "Major deployed military forces." 318
This sort of targeting doctrine goes much, much further than what would be necessary to support a minimal deterrent strategy. The first consideration alone would be sufficient for a strategic force capable only of ensuring that a few high-yield warheads will arrive at an enemy's cities. This list is more appropriate to a military that is planning not only on conducting a protracted nuclear war, but also on emerging victorious from it, and using its outcome to positively impact conventional military operations, presumably in related theatres. Moreover, from a perspective of escalation, the list is inverted. A limited war scenario generally assumes that escalation to nuclear use evolves from some sort of conventional crisis. A Taiwan scenario, for example, might see China use nuclear weapons first against major deployed US formations (e.g., carrier battle groups steaming towards the Strait) and air and naval staging areas in Japan, Korea, Guam and elsewhere in the region. Nuclear strikes against Hawaii or targets in the continental US, by contrast, would probably only be considered as a last resort; while an attack against a US population centre would -in view, as noted above, of the likely consequences -not under any circumstances be a rational act. presently enjoys, and the strategic doctrine to make use of them, further supporting the argument that China is deliberately effecting "a change from war-deterring capability to war-fighting capability." 319 Nor is this an isolated development. In recent years, discussions of nuclear strategy and the content of doctrinal publications have begun to draw an increasingly stark difference between large-scale retaliatory strikes and "small-scale nuclear counterattack campaigns" tailored to political and operational circumstances. 
320
321
The evolution of China's strategic force posture and strategic doctrine appears therefore to be more consistent with the temporary US fascination with limited deterrence and flexible response than it is with either minimal deterrence or, at the other end of the deterrence spectrum, mutual assured destruction. Limited, flexible nuclear options are not at all incompatible with China's strategic culture. While minimal deterrence might suit an insular state concerned with protecting domestic industrialization and development against outside interference, it does not necessarily suit a confident state intent on expanding its influence. China's evolving strategy is in this context a consequence of its evolving, self-appointed role in Asia; and such evolution is not only consistent with the philosophical roots of China's strategy, but is in fact advocated by it; no less an authority than Sun Tzu, after all, opined that while "Security against defeat implies defensive tactics…defeat[ing] the enemy means taking the offensive." 
323
• the expectation that an attack is inevitable (if not necessarily imminent);
• the expectation that an attack is both inevitable and imminent;
• the perception that a 'window of opportunity' exists to disarm or seriously disadvantage a potential attacker;
• the government places high value on strategic surprise; and/or
• the belief that one's offensive technology confers a marked advantage over defensive technology. 
325
Preventive wars tend to be motivated by the concern that operational conditions or the objective balance of forces will be less advantageous in the future, and as such tend to be highly controversial. Recent examples of preventive war include the 2003 US-led invasion of Iraq, and the 1981 Israeli bombing of Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor. An older example would be the Japanese attack against Pearl Harbour.
Some of these categories potentially apply to China's strategic situation, particularly with regard to long-standing flashpoints like Taiwan. Chinese strategic culture, as already noted, traditionally places enormous value on strategic surprise; Sun Tzu devoted whole chapters of his small tome to this principle. Beijing might consider using force -possibly even nuclear force, although theatre or tactical use would be far more likely than a strategic strike -in order to pre-empt or prevent US intervention in the event of a unilateral declaration of independence by Taipei. Exploitation of a perceived strategic 'window of opportunity' is less likely to result in a strategic-level exchange, although at the theatre level this would be China's preferred modus operandi. For example, if the US were to become heavily engaged in a naval or littoral operation elsewhere in the world that resulted in a drop in available naval and air forces in the Western Pacific, China might conceivably perceive an opportunity to accomplish the reintegration of Taiwan by force before US intervention was possible. Finally, much of China's ongoing military R&D and its force modernization process -for example anti-satellite weapons, anti-ship ballistic missiles, digital warfare and other examples of 'informationization' -appears to be aimed at developing asymmetric technologies intended to obviate the US advantage in key strategic areas. Once these developments reach operational capability, Beijing could perceive a strategic technological advantage that will only be degraded as the US develops countermeasures. A perceived lead, however temporary, could be sufficient incentive to motivate Beijing to act before that advantage can be diluted or negated. Is Beijing considering counterforce as a strategy? Shambaugh argues that China has diversified its targeting doctrine to include "both countervalue and counterforce targets,"
333
334
At present, where its strategic relationship with the US is concerned, China possesses none of these capabilities. Beijing lacks the surveillance and targeting satellites necessary to locate and identify strategic targets in the US, although given China's satellite technology and the state of its space launch programme, this lack could be overcome without a great deal of difficulty. More problematic is the fact that China's strategic forces are numerically two orders of magnitude behind the numbers of weapons available to the US, and although its missiles carry high-yield warheads, their accuracy may not be sufficient to enable them to threaten hardened targets like ICBM silos. And while Beijing is working to increase force readiness, its ICBM forces do not have the capability to execute short-notice operations. According to Wortzel, the Second Artillery force maintains three classes of readiness:
• Third Class (routine training, exercise and maintenance regime);
• Second Class (move/deploy to firing positions); and
• First Class (deployed with support elements, warheads and fuel, ready to fire). 
335
In short, a counterforce capability, at least as the concept is understood from the Western context and experience, does not appear to be China's strategic objective. Counterforce doctrines are a rational option only for states that have a reasonable chance of executing a disarming first strike. 
339
Adoption of a counterforce doctrine -especially with respect to a less capable NWS, like Indiawould be more likely to exacerbate tensions and inflame eventual crises. As Dyson argues, strategic doctrines based on counterforce and limited nuclear options targeting concepts are inherently crisis unstable. 340 This is because the incentive structure under such doctrines is weighted in favour of early use ('use them or lose them') rather than restraint. A far more likely scenario was posited by Hsieh who, writing in 1962 before China had detonated its first nuclear device, argued that while possession of a small number of atomic weapons would be unlikely to induce Beijing into directly challenging the US, a limited strategic capability could increase China's regional freedom of action by raising the potential cost of US intervention:
If she possessed even a limited nuclear capability, China might be willing to shoulder the risks of initiating a limited war with conventional weapons in the hope that the United States would be discouraged from a nuclear response through fear of an uncontrollable expansion of the conflict. In this way China might see a possibility of enhancing the military and political value of her conventional forces in the face of possible American intervention and, if successful, of casting doubt on the firmness of United States intentions in the area. 
341
342
343
Compared to India's nuclear forces (or for that matter, those of North Korea, in the unlikely event that Beijing ever loses patience with the mercurial regime in Pyongyang), China's strategic forces are numerically and qualitatively superior.
Comparisons of any strategic balance are impacted by change at both ends of the scale. While this study is focused on China's nuclear posture, the deterrent value of that posture vis-à-vis China's most likely adversary, the US, depends equally upon the quality and quantity of America's strategic forces -and those forces are both aging and, as a consequence of nuclear arms control and disarmament decisions made by the Obama Administration and its immediate predecessors, declining in numbers. Beijing will have no need to, as Lewis puts it, sprint upwards to nuclear parity if Washington continues -or accelerates -the more leisurely downward jog in which its strategic forces have for more than two decades been engaged. If there is an enduring principle to be drawn from this fact, it is that analyses of China's nuclear posture in isolation from that of its likely adversaries are almost certain to lead to false conclusions.
The purpose of this paper as described in the introduction was, as part of a larger study, to examine the evolution of China's nuclear strategy. Strategy is more than simply policy or even doctrine; it is a composite artefact, an amalgam based on history and shaped by strategic culture, and constrained by a vast array of drivers, many of which may be unique to a state's individual circumstances. China's nuclear strategy, at least in the earliest stages of its development, appears to have been grounded in classical military theory and informed by classical Chinese military philosophy to a greater degree than was the case in the US. It was subsequently shaped by the revolutionary and other military experiences of Mao and his successors, by the ideological commitment to People's War, and by unique adaptations of Marxist-Leninist military theory, first as a derivation from and later in opposition to Soviet military theory.
The evolution of China's approach to nuclear strategy has also been strongly influenced by its uneasy relationship with nuclear deterrence. Early iterations of declaratory policy decried nuclear weapons as "paper tigers", an ideological posture that was undercut by the effort and resources that Beijing dedicated to its nuclear weapons program. China's initial nuclear capability granted it an existential deterrent vis-à-vis its likely adversaries. By the early 1980s this had evolved, in terms of capability and doctrine, to a minimal deterrent based on a small number of inaccurate missiles carrying high-yield warheads, ensuring that even after a disarming first strike its strategic forces, China might retain the ability to inflict unacceptable damage on an aggressor.
Perhaps as an indication of its regional strategic objectives, Beijing in the 1980s and early 1990s put considerably more effort and resources into building up its tactical and theatre ballistic missile forces. More recent modernization programmes, by contrast, have been aimed at improving Beijing's capacity to challenge the ability to the US to operate freely, first in China's littoral waters, then in Beijing's area of influence and interest, and more broadly in the Western Pacific. China's long-range strategic forces are designed not to engage in a traditional deterrence relationship with the US, as the USSR did, over global aims, but rather to raise the potential cost to the US of interfering in China's prosecution of what it deems to be its regional interests. While this corresponds more to what in the US-USSR context would have been deemed limited deterrence than to China's self-described policy of minimum deterrence, the characteristics of the China-US relationship are such that the result is unique to contemporary circumstances. For all intents and purposes, that relationship, at least in the regional context that is the principal focus of China's political (or grand) strategy, is the product of a state of essential equivalence in nuclear capacity that is, as a consequence of China's ongoing force expansion and America's ongoing force reductions, evolving gradually towards parity.
Some comparisons to the past can certainly be made. For example, it has been suggested that the US-Taiwan security relationship bears some resemblance to the relationship between the USSR and Cuba in the 1950s. The substance of Moscow's commitment to Cuba's security rested on its willingness to risk a nuclear strike to deter the US from pressuring Cuba -and as it turned out, when push came to shove, Moscow was not willing to entertain this risk. The extent of Washington's commitment to Taiwan has yet to be similarly tested. As China's strategic forces and its conventional capability continue to grow, the key questions will be "where and how will Washington be willing to draw the line regarding possible Chinese challenges to US interests in 106 DRDC CORA TM 2011-156
East Asia," 344 and how hard will China be willing to push. The answers to these questions, especially the latter one, will provide important information about Beijing's intentions. If, as Beijing insists, Taiwan is the key rationale underlying China's strategic building, then China's insistence on expanding its nuclear forces at a time when the other 'legal' NWS are reducing theirs makes China "a certain kind of rising power" -and its acquisition of more, and more asymmetric, nuclear capabilities "indicate ambitions well beyond Taiwan [that] remain to be explained." 
345
Based on this analysis, the final chapter in this paper looked at where China's nuclear strategy appeared to be trending at the present moment -i.e., where on the aggregate curve of its overall trajectory it appears to be at time of writing. Analyses based on inferences rather than concrete sources age poorly. While suggestions that China may be attempting to develop a counterforce capability with respect to the larger NWS do not appear to be justified on the facts, Beijing undeniably seems to be attempting to increase the number of options -including nuclear options -available to counter attempts by the US and others to interfere with realization of its strategic objectives within its area of interest and influence. This includes the capacity not only to maintain and enhance the nature of the threat that China is able to pose to the continental United States but also to significantly expand its ability both to threaten targets, including US and allied forces in the Western Pacific, with nuclear strikes; and to outflank the conventional advantages enjoyed by the US and its key allies through asymmetric means. Accordingly, while it is not clear where the trajectory of China's nuclear posture may be leading, what is clear is that Beijing is no longer satisfied with its long-standing posture of minimum deterrence -if indeed it ever was. The first paper in this study described in very sparse terms the evolution of US nuclear strategy to serve as a benchmark for the more detailed examination of the evolution of China's nuclear posture. It is therefore worth asking how well the latter matches up with the former. The answer is, not well at all (the US conceptual and technological waypoints are described at Table 2 of that paper). 347 While China's first nuclear detonation was accompanied by a call for an international ban on nuclear weapons, this is assessed to have been an exercise in propaganda and an attempt to seize the moral high ground from China's better-armed adversaries. There was never any realistic prospect of China initiating nuclear disarmament -and Beijing's subsequent behaviour vis-à-vis the international NACD regime substantiates this judgement. As a new NWS facing much larger and more capable nuclear adversaries, Massive Retaliation was never an option for China. Beijing did entertain a doctrine of nuclear war-fighting (and continues to do so), but this was not credible until People's War had been modified to accommodate 'modern conditions'. Due to the nature of its strategic arsenal (inaccurate missiles bearing high-yield warheads), 'city-avoidance' has never been an option for China, and it is only very recently that the technological stage has been set for a very limited counterforce capability through the introduction of more accurate, solid-fuelled missiles with smaller warheads deployed either in hardened silos, or on mobile launchers.
Rather than mimicking the US experience, in short, China has taken the "road less travelled by", eschewing parallelism in favour of attempting to outflank potential adversaries by building up a suite of capabilities designed to exploit perceived systemic weaknesses. Weapons systems like the ASAT, China's nascent anti-ship ballistic missile (ASBM), long-range cruise missiles, and highperformance air defence systems are all aimed at negating, at minimal cost, areas of US superiority. These systems will not give China the capacity to fight the US and prevail on the high seas, but they could raise the cost of US intervention within first and second island chains, which Beijing regards as its area of interest and influence. The waypoints in China's strategic evolution, in other words, are different because China started late; has never attempted to match the US in strategic forces; and has instead, in recent years, adopted what some have deemed an 'asymmetric strategy' designed to dissuade Washington from interfering in the achievement of China's regional goals by developing the ability to threaten perceived areas of American military vulnerability. Whether the quest for 'asymmetry' is truly novel or simply an evolutionary adaptation of the ages-old 'active defence' strategy that predates People's War remains open to debate; the present author, as is hopefully clear from the foregoing, inclines toward the latter interpretation. This assessment will be investigated in greater depth in later papers in the course of this study.
It also necessitates a brief review of the ten caveats posited in the introductory paper. This analysis confirms the first caveat, which was that China's decision to begin its nuclear trajectory with a minimal deterrent vis-à-vis its principle adversaries necessarily means that its strategic evolution will differ from those of the US and other NWS. The second and eighth caveats are likewise reinforced; both America's and China's strategic evolutionary paths were highly influenced by their respective geostrategic circumstances. China, for example, only began to investigate sea-basing for its deterrent force comparatively late in its evolution as a nuclear power, and still has not mastered the capabilities necessary to maximize survivability. China appears to view the sea as a source of threats rather than opportunities, and has put relatively more resources into denying potential enemies the ability to freely navigate rather than maximizing the operational effectiveness of the PLAN. The third caveat was also borne out;
347 Neill, Background and benchmark, The fourth caveat posited that the fundamental differences between how democracies and totalitarian states are governed will necessarily result in differences in their strategic nuclear evolution. This also appears to have been the case. While it is customary in the salons of academe to ascribe similar motivations and behaviours to all states, it is a simple fact that totalitarian states like China are able to get away with acting in bad faith on the international stage (for example, in arms control negotiations) because the leadership is not accountable to the populace. A US administration that advanced logically implausible policy positions (e.g., that another nation's impending strategic force modernization was the cause of the force modernization programmes that had already been under way for years), or that signed an arms control agreement and was later found to be systematically and grossly violating it, could be punished for its mendacity at the polls. The CPC regime in Beijing faces no such checks on its behaviour. Similarly, the fifth and sixth caveats -which centre on the contention that strategy, doctrine and declaratory policy are not necessarily linked -has also been demonstrated by the foregoing analysis, which has shown that they may, indeed, be entirely unrelated. This reinforces the importance of focussing, in analysis, less on what a state says it wants to do than on what it can and cannot do.
The seventh caveat -the extent to which concern over the moral high ground can induce a state to modify its policy, and to a lesser extent its capability and doctrine -was likewise borne out by the analysis in this paper. China's adamant adherence to its NFU policy represents an attempt by Beijing to make a virtue out of a necessity, for two reasons: first, the list of states that are likely to engage in hostilities with China and that Beijing can safely threaten with nuclear weapons is very short (India, Japan and Taiwan -and two of those three are explicitly under the US 'nuclear umbrella'); and second, the NFU policy costs Beijing nothing and can be abandoned at a moment's notice. Its substantive value as a stabilizing factor in the China's deterrent relations, therefore, is precisely zero -but its utility as a tool of propaganda is considerable. Similarly, China has always advocated complete nuclear disarmament (which, if effected, would be of enormous advantage to a large industrialized country with the world's biggest population) and has, in recent decades, embraced the international NACD regime while simultaneously undermining it at the UN, and observing its strictures and principles only when it suits Beijing to do so. It is disingenuous, for example, to conduct the most polluting ASAT test in history, and then immediately call for a ban on the weaponization of space.
The ninth caveat -that in the nuclear field strategy and technology are intimately interconnected, but that the arrow of causality in the relationship is not necessarily always apparent -also came into play in this analysis. In both the US and Soviet cases, strategy -the intersection of what the state wanted to do with what it could do -was heavily influenced by the evolution of technology. This was not always the case in China's nuclear evolution; the decision by Mao, and later by Deng, to subordinate China's rise as a NWS to its rise as an industrial and economic power meant that China never deployed as many weapons systems as it could have done. There was, of course, little point in doing so, because there was no prospect of out-deploying either the US or the USSR (or for that matter, the UK and France); but the end result was that technology does not appear to have driven strategic evolution in China to as great an extent as it did in the US and Russia. Indeed, in recent years, as China has sought to exploit US technological weaknesses through asymmetric deployments, policy has been more likely to drive the search for new technologies.
The ASAT and ASBM are two key examples of this trend.
The tenth caveat argued that a state's strategic nuclear evolution may be heavily influenced by its strategic culture. This, I would argue, should go without saying. China's strategic culture is very different from that of the US, with the result that its approach to nuclear strategy has proven more likely to derive key principles from China's historical, cultural, philosophical and military roots than from those of its adversaries. 'Globalization' and other vast, impersonal forces allegedly deriving from modern applications of information technology are supposed to be homogenizing once-disparate nations, but there is no evidence that this is happening in the sphere of nuclear strategy. The challenge facing the analyst is manifested in something as simple as divergent definitions of supposedly well-understood concepts; 'deterrence' and 'defence', for example, have demonstrably different meanings in the Chinese context than they do in the West. The analyst must be cognizant of these differences when attempting to unpack the contents of foreign sources, even if -perhaps especially if -they have already been translated into English.
With respect to China's ongoing evolution as a NWS, it is not pleasant to contemplate the potential consequences of a shift from minimum deterrence to something that may resemble a strategy of limited nuclear war. It has often been postulated that any nuclear war would by definition be catastrophic, and must therefore be avoided at all costs. However, if war appears inevitable, then limited nuclear war confined to a regional context would doubtless seem preferable to a full nuclear exchange that might extend to counter-value strikes against population centres. In such circumstances, a series of limited strikes designed to eliminate the possibility of conventional interference in a regional Chinese adventure might seem the rational choice to a totalitarian government facing its worst fear -defeat in a vital strategic enterprise leading to collapse of the regime. For all its protestations about its growing strength and influence, China's nuclear posture -for the time being, at least -is such that it is far more likely that Beijing would use nuclear weapons out of a perception of weakness or desperation than as a deliberate and confident political act.
As noted in the introduction to this paper, in addition to theory, doctrine and declaratory policy, strategy comprises technological capacity, force structure and posture, weapons systems, and military R&D in the context of the location and geography of a state, its people and resources, its neighbours, and its past and present conduct. Based on an objective assessment of these criteria, it is possible to define an array of probable strategic trajectories for that state, and select therefrom those (or even the one) most likely to describe its preferred path towards its desired end-state. While Beijing, for the sake of diplomacy, will probably continue to maintain minimal deterrence as its official declaratory policy, China's nuclear posture -the sum total of its nuclear capabilities, its nuclear doctrine, and the answers that it is developing both within and outside of government and to past and evolving questions of nuclear strategy -is transforming into something else. While aspects of the transformation are likely to resemble (at least in part) some aspects of America's strategic nuclear evolution since 1945, the trajectory of China's strategic nuclear evolution since its first detonation nearly fifty years ago has been comparatively unique.
The next, third, paper in this study will examine and assess the current status of China's strategic nuclear forces, looking both at extant systems and their capabilities and the programmes that are currently underway to update, upgrade or augment them. The fourth paper will attempt to divine the contemporary factors and influences that constitute the fundamental drivers of China's 110 DRDC CORA TM 2011-156 declaratory policy, strategy and doctrine in the nuclear domain. These and previous studies will be subsumed in a capstone paper that will offer an assessment of the likely trajectory of China's nuclear thought and its strategic forces; propose recommendations for Canada and for allied states as they attempt to come to grips with the challenges and opportunities offered by China in the years ahead; and identify useful directions for further research into China's strategic intentions and capabilities.

Washington -again, in theory -extended its deterrent 'umbrella' (to the extent that such a term has any meaning) -to Japan, the ROK and the Republic of China throughout much of the period under investigation. US security guarantees of this sort demonstrably played a role in Chinese strategic planning.

The reference to unjust wars is likewise perplexing. Just war theory is an Augustinian construct. This may be less an appeal to jus ad bellum / jus in bello argumentation than to the 'unjustness' of the Western powers' domination of China in the 19 th and early 20 th Centuries.

Washington described its shoot-down as necessary to prevent damage on the ground from the uncontrolled re-entry of a satellite that still contained half a ton of volatile manoeuvring fuel. While this has been described as a slim pretext, it was at least credible; Beijing offered no explanation whatsoever. Moreover, the US exercise produced no enduring orbital contamination, while the Chinese shoot-down produced more than 3,000 pieces of debris large enough to be tracked by NASA, most of which are likely to remain in orbit for decades, and more than 150,000 pieces larger than 1 cm, making it the largest debrisgenerating space event in history, and forcing NASA and Russia to move the International Space Station to avoid hazards. [http://celestrak.com/events/asat.asp]. Accessed 7 March 2011. Amongst other things, the long-term debris threat to satellites and space travel posed by the Chinese shoot-down makes China's subsequent comments about the "possibility of damage to the security of outer space" and the need for the US to respect its "international obligations" somewhat galling.

Ce document est le deuxième volet d'une étude plus large dont l'objet principal est de déterminer la trajectoire de la Chine en matière de politique des armes nucléaires, la stratégie, la capacité et la doctrine. S'appuyant sur le premier document, qui a fourni un point de repère pour l'analyse comparative sous la forme d'un aperçu de l'évolution de la stratégie nucléaire américaine depuis le o fin de la Seconde Guerre mondiale, cet article discute les origines de la stratégie nucléaire de la Chine; son point de vue de la dissuasion; ce que certains éléments de sa politique déclaratoire révéler sur la stratégie nucléaire de Pékin, et où cette stratégie semble se tenir à l'heure actuelle. Le document conclut que, bien que l'évolution de la stratégie nucléaire de la Chine ont quelque ressemblance aux modèles occidentaux de l'évolution nucléaire, le processus a été en grande partie unique, et que, bien que Pékin va probablement maintenir un engagement officiel à la dissuasion minimale, la stratégie nucléaire de la Chine a progressé bien au-delà de ses politique déclaratoire, et continue d'évoluer rapidement. D'autres documents dans cette étude examinera la Chine forces nucléaires stratégiques, et d'enquêter sur les principaux moteurs de la politique déclaratoire de la Chine, la stratégie nucléaire, et la doctrine nucléaire. L'étude se terminera par un rapport complet discuter de la trajectoire apparente du dispositif nucléaire de la Chine et ses conséquences pour le Canada et ses alliés, et à suggérer des orientations pour la recherche future.

This paper is the second part of a larger study the principal purpose of which is to determine the trajectory of China's nuclear weapons policy, strategy, capability and doctrine. Building on the first paper, which provided a benchmark for comparative analysis in the form of an overview of the evolution of US nuclear strategy since the end o the Second World War, this paper discusses the origins of China's nuclear strategy; its view of deterrence; what certain elements of its declaratory policy reveal about Beijing's nuclear strategy; and where that strategy appears to stand at present. The paper concludes that while the evolution of China's nuclear strategy bear some resemblance to Western patterns of nuclear evolution, the process has been largely unique; and that although Beijing will probably maintain an official commitment to minimal deterrence, China's nuclear strategy has progressed well beyond its declaratory policy, and is continuing to change rapidly. Further papers in this study will examine China's strategic nuclear forces, and investigate the principal drivers of China's declaratory policy, nuclear strategy, and nuclear doctrine. The study will conclude with a comprehensive report discussing the apparent trajectory of China's nuclear posture and the implications thereof for Canada and its allies, and suggesting directions for future research.
