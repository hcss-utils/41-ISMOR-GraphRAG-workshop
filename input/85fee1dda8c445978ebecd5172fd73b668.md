The problem for France is how to reconcile its historical suspicion of arms control and disarmament with the desire to not disassociate or isolate itself from any newly emerging partnerships and lose any leverage it may have with allies, and, above all, compromise its own diplomatic or strategic independence.
In the French view, if the Soviet Union breaks up, Russia will remain the single largest military power in Europe, a power that necessarily must be somehow balanced.
How to balance this great, and possibly still unfriendly, military power and, equally important, how to prevent a Russian-German entente, is clearly a problem that is high on the French security agenda.
