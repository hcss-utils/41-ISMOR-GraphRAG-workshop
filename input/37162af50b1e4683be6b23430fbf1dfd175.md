Russia has been less successful in Eastern Ukraine but will also probably continue using gray-zone strategies.
When conflicts involving Soviet-supported (and, later, Russian-supported) separatist movements in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan and the Abkhazia and South Ossetia regions of Georgia bogged down in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Moscow mediated cease-fires between the belligerents, creating "frozen conflicts" in which active fighting was suspended without peace agreements.
When Georgia took steps toward joining NATO in 2008, Russia resumed its agitation in Abkhazia and South Ossetia and ultimately intervened with conventional military forces on the separatists' behalf when Georgia attempted to rein in the wayward regions.
It is debatable whether Eastern Ukraine is now a frozen conflict-repeated cease-fire agreements have failed and low-level fighting continues-but separatist forces effectively control the Donbas region and analysts observe that Russia can conserve its resources and wait for better conditions to escalate the fight.
