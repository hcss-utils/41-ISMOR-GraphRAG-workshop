In November 2020, I wrote a previous article for the Mad Scientists blog, titled "Would You Like to Play a Game?
Wargaming as a Learning Experience and Key Assumptions Check."
I argued that wargaming can help us visualize what the threat can be.
It can help us imagine it and provide context to our thinking about it.
It can help us check our assumptions, and perhaps even offer thoughts and ideas that we would never have considered.
It will not tell us the future, or lay out with certainty what will happen.
But it can offer us an opportunity to prevent a failure of imagination of the kind warned against in the 9/11 Commission Report.
By imagining the threat, we may be in a position to make better decisions during moments of crisis.
In the previous article, I played through GMT Games "Next War: Poland," which simulated a conflict between NATO and Russia over the Baltics and Poland.
This time, I'm using a copy of GMT Games "Next War: Taiwan" to help visualize what such a fight could entail.
