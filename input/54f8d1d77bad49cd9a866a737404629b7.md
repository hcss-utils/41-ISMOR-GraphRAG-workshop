# Fulltext:
In order to achieve the operational level of war within the gray zone it is first necessary to look at the definitions of the gray zone, their similarities, and origins.
All of the definitions are based on true premises.
In fact, when combining these truths, the gray zone conflict becomes the gray zone war.
Strategic thinkers such as Clausewitz, Sun Tzu, and contemporary political scientists and policy makers, confirm this gray zone war as part of the evolution of total war.
The connection is key because it explains how adversaries such as China, Russia and Iran account for conflict today.
These adversaries already consider themselves at war and design strategic thought and doctrine to account for this.
China's Unrestricted Warfare and its three warfares are exemplified through their recent actions.
Russia actively applies New Generation Warfare as seen in several case studies of Russian aggression against neighboring states.
