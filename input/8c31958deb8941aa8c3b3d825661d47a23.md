Russian soft power and information warfare, as demonstrated in Crimea in 2014, pose significant threats to the integrity of NATO.
The Baltic States present a unique vulnerability due to their geographic proximity to Russia and their significant Russian minorities that provide Russian influence a vector into Baltic societies.
Russian media, disinformation, propaganda, political manipulation, infiltration of Russian language education, and organization of ethnic Russians through formal and informal foreign policy structures may destabilize the Baltic States to the point that Russia can justify military intervention on the pretext of protecting ethnic Russian minorities.
This would present NATO with a strategic dilemma that leaves NATO and the US with no favorable outcome.
