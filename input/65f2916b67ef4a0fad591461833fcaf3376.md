The Romanian government could decide to nationalize the energy.
This would likely require the purchasing of all privately owned infrastructure that falls within Romanian territory.
While this course of action would potentially provide the most direct, sudden impact to solve the problem of Russian influence in the energy industry, the massive cost could potentially bankrupt the government and cause severe public or international backlash.
Additionally, Russia would most likely consider the move an act of hostility and possibly use it to justify aggressive actions toward Romania.
