To understand the nature, limits, and capabilities of Rus sian political warfare, this chapter proceeds in three parts.
First, we summarize the political and aca demic discourse around political warfare in Russia, highlighting the growth of the Rus sian concept of "new generation warfare," which sees nonmilitary elements playing an increasing role in warfare.
We trace the origins of this concept to Rus sian interpretations of U.S. activities, Soviet and Rus sian foreign policy, and domestic political trends in Russia.
Second, we catalog and characterize Russian capabilities to undertake different elements of political warfare.
We categorize these elements as diplomatic and proxy, information, cyber, military, intelligence, and economic.
We also discuss the development of coordination across the Rus sian government.
Finally, we use a case study on Rus sian political warfare in Estonia to develop new insights into how Russia undertakes political warfare in practice.
The case study emphasizes that Russia tends not to fully orchestrate political warfare from beginning to end, but instead acts to increase tension to make confrontation more likely, and then takes advantage of crises when they arise.
