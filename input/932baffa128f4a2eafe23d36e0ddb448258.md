The NATO Wales Summit 4-5, September 2014 intended to find immediate solutions against the threat from Russia.
The Ukrainian crisis forced the Alliance to revise its strategy and initiate diplomatic and military countermeasures against the hybrid threat.
The key military outcome of the Summit was the Readiness Action Plan including a Very High Readiness Joint Task Force (VJTF), which provides a more responsive, better-trained and better-equipped force to respond to the changed and broader security environment.
The Summit also recommitted to the Article 5 collective defense commitment, and emphasized the importance of Article 3, the individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack.
Members also agreed to increase military spending to satisfy their Article 5 and 3 obligations.
On diplomatic grounds, NATO "suspended all practical civilian and military cooperation with Russia, while leaving channels open for dialogue on the situation in Ukraine."
