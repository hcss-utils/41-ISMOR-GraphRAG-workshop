That explained the French emperor's interest in Bismarck.
In 1865, just one year before the Austro-Prussian War, Napoleon III hosted Bismarck in Biarritz.
This was an important summit; Bismarck had returned from the Paris embassy to take up the job of Prussian minister-president (prime minister) in 1862.
During a long walk on the beach, the two men discussed the future of Germany and Bonaparte agreed that Prussia would have a free hand in a war with Austria.
Strategically, the French emperor was guilty of terrible short-sightedness.
He wanted to weaken Austria in order eventually to break it up, into German, Hungarian, Czech, South Slav, and Polish states that would ally with Paris, still viewed as the "umpire of Europe" in the 1860s.
