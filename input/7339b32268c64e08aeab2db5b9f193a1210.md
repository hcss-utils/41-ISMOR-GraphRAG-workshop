In the shape phase, efforts focus on laying the groundwork for future legitimate overt actions, and identifying the potential for future insurgency within the PN population.
These efforts include identifying internal opposition (infiltrating if possible) and directing communications to that group as well as to the general population and Russia.
IO campaigns directed internally to opposition groups within the Baltic nations has not been researched, but it can be assumed that normal policing provides the consequences of interference in national security.
The partnerships and military operations intended to deter Russian conventional conflict communicates a strategic message to the general population as well as Russia, one that reinforces PN military security and alliances and therefore the population's trust in the nation.
These actions encourage Russian UW and IO in an attempt to fracture the alliance and the Baltic nations' internal security, but requires more time to counter the allied military presence.
Identifying and monitoring the communication of opposition groups, such as those identified in Latvia on social media, allows the Baltic nations to monitor, subvert, contain, and potentially act on these groups.
Additional strategic messages to Russia intended to deter conventional conflict include Estonia's district patrol competitions, intended to build and train a resistance force to occupation, communicates national will that doubly exploit in order to fracture each states' security psychological value proposition to the target population and to build discontent or insurgency until Russian intervention is justified.
