A digital twin is a computerized replication of an entity, in this case an individual person.
By building a biopsychosocial model that represents the key individual subsystems and traitssimply an aggregation of the kinds of models and data that are typically collected and used The COMPOEX System-of-Systems An interacting family of models can provide astonishing, yet legitimate and plausible outcomes  The economic and cultural ties that connect people, states, and regions are the source of both cooperation and conflict.
1 Even during this prolonged period of economic growth and peace 2 -or at least the absence of open warfare between great powers-the international system remains a competitive environment that presents many threats from global actors, most notably Russia and China.
The international system also encompasses environments in which conflict might need to be contained (e.g., Syria) or in which the rules of the road are actively contested (e.g., cyberspace).
In this chapter, we examine international competition waged through exponential technologies-most notably, modern social networking technologies whose reach and value scales exponentially with each new user 3 -through the lens of biological evolution and adaptation.
