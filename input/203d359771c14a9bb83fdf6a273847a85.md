While the US and UK administrations have been reducing the role of nuclear weapons in their respective national strategies, the Russian government has placed them at the very heart of its national security strategy.
Additionally, the Kremlin publicly threatened to use nuclear weapons against Russia's neighbors over the past three to four years, including an exercise in the fall of 2009 which simulated nuclear attacks against Poland.
It authorized Russian strategic bombers to repeatedly undertake highly provocative flights near and into UK, US, and other NATO airspace and published a "military doctrine" which named NATO as a military threat and suggested preemptive strikes against NATO ballistic missile defense (BMD) sites.
