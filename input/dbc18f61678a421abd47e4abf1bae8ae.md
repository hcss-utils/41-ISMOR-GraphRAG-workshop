Lessons from the Battle of the Bismarck Sea By Ben Ho G reat Power competition is back after a hiatus of over a quarter of a century since the end of the Cold War. The United States has acknowledged this fact with the release of the 2017 National Security Strategy and the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which speak of revisionist powers such as China and Russia seeking to challenge the current U.S.-led world order.

• land-based aircraft can play a key role in maritime interdiction
• we must innovate and improvise to deal with current and urgent problems
• the enemy should be overwhelmed with multidomain threats.
While one can argue that the Allies at the Bismarck Sea engagement were more akin to the A2/AD force by today's definition of the term, their actions during the battle and the lessons learned are relevant to today's counter-A2/AD forces. After all, the concept of A2/AD can work both ways. To illustrate, while the submarine is widely regarded as the quintessential access-denial platform, it can be similarly deployed to circumvent the A2/AD barrier. In the same vein, while Beijing may employ an A2/AD strategy to keep enemies far away from its shores, the concept can be turned on its head to keep the People's Republic of China bottled up within the so-called First Island Chain.

Despite the overwhelming success of the Americans at the Battle of Midway, the Japanese were still a force to be reckoned with in the Pacific after June 1942, especially in the SWPA of operations where they were ensconced in several key bases such as Rabaul. In August 1942, the United States went on the strategic offensive, with Marines capturing Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands. Over the next 6 months, the Americans were embroiled in a fiercely fought campaign that saw both sides taking heavy losses, but that the United States ultimately won. Concurrently, and several hundred kilometers away, the Allies were fighting to defend the crucial New Guinean city of Port Moresby that could be used to threaten Australia should it fall into Japanese hands. With the successful defense of Port Moresby, the Allies went on the offensive in New Guinea with the goal of neutralizing Rabaul. Following the decision in January 1943 to withdraw from Guadalcanal, Tokyo decided to focus its efforts in the SWPA on the New Guinea campaign. Therein lies the strategic context of the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.
General Douglas MacArthur called the Battle of the Bismarck Sea "one of the most complete and annihilating combats of all time." 8 Similarly, one Japanese navy captain termed his country's defeat in the battle as "unbelievable," adding that "never was there such a debacle." 9 Operation 81 consisted of eight troop transports and a similar number of destroyers as protective escorts. 10 There were 6,900 Japanese soldiers traveling with the convoy from Rabaul, and they were meant to be reinforcements for the vital garrison in Lae, New Guinea, from which imperial forces were trying to halt the Allied offensive in that former Australian territory (see map). Some 100 Japanese fighter planes When the smoke had cleared, all the transports and four destroyers had been sunk. Of the 6,900 Japanese troops with the convoy, only 1,200 made it to Lae, while another 2,700 were rescued and returned to Rabaul, from where they had come. The rest were killed. On the other hand, the Allies lost only a handful of aircraft. The Battle of the Bismarck Sea was Japan's last air offensive in the SWPA, and it set the stage for the Allied offensive in that theater from June 1943 onward.
One scholar opines that the battle was the turning point of the protracted New Guinea campaign, calling it the campaign's "Midway."

This lesson is especially relevant today given the debate over how the United States could best fight for sea control during a conflict with a Great Power. One student of the Bismarck Sea engagement contends that it "still stands as a striking example of the deadly effectiveness of land-based air power against naval targets."

While the Battle of the Bismarck Sea arguably marked the apogee of landbased aviation in the antisurface warfare (ASuW) role during World War II, there were also several other cases of terrestrial airpower successfully attacking ships during that conflict. Witness the deadliness of the Luftwaffe's Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor during the initial stages of the Battle of the North Atlantic. This medium bomber posed such a threat to Allied convoys that British Premier Winston Churchill called it the "scourge of the Atlantic." Indeed, two retired senior U.S. Navy officers, Wayne P. Hughes and Robert P. Girrier, assert that Luftwaffe head Hermann Goering's focus on land operations meant that "the service did not take as seriously the ship-attack remit."

Moreover, the significance of Allied land-based airpower in the ASuW role during the Pacific War is often understated as it is commonly believed that sea-based aviation was the key player in this respect. To be sure, carrier planes were behind the destruction of much of the imperial fleet. The U.S. Strategic Bombing Survey reveals, however, that land-based aircraft accounted for 14.5 percent of Japanese merchantmen losses, which is only slightly lower than the corresponding figure of 16.3 percent for carrier aviation.

Another shortfall that sea-based air has is that U.S. carrier strike groups (CSGs) may not be located near a crisis spot and may require a few days' steaming to reach their destination. With midair refueling, Air Force long-range bombers based even in the continental United States can, however, provide presence, albeit temporary, in most parts of the world within half a day. To be certain, critics can argue that heavy bombers like the B-1B by themselves are highly vulnerable to enemy fighters, but the long striking reach of their weapons (such as the LRASM) would enable them to stay farther out within any A2/AD envelope. Moreover, the socioeconomic well-being of America's key strategic rival, China, is highly dependent on keeping its sea lines of communication open. Indeed, the vast expanses of the Pacific Ocean and the limited number of friendly bases in that theater-for instance, Guam is over 2,000 kilometers away from the East and South China seas-would mean that there will be a premium placed on the extended striking reach of Air Force "heavies."
As much of the Joint Concept for Access and Maneuver in the Global Commons (JAM-GC) is classified, one may never know the true extent to which the Air Force is involved in the maritime interdiction portfolio. What is known, however, is that the Air Force has not been practicing maritime strike frequently since the end of the Cold War.

The next takeaway from the Battle of the Bismarck Sea is that innovation and improvisation could be key in allowing one side to gain an edge in military competition. The battle is noted for the perfection of emerging tactics that Allied fliers adopted against Japanese vessels. One innovative tactic used was skip-bombing, whereby an airplane dropped its bombs from a low altitude so that their forward trajectory would make them skip along the sea surface like a stone and impact on the side of the enemy ship. To be sure, skip-bombing was not entirely new, as the British had used it in the European theater with some success; however, the first decisive use of this tactic had to be credited to the Allies who perfected it during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.

What is viable about such proposals is that they are not about the introduction of entirely new capabilities-a process that is invariably drawn out and expensive-but about making do with what one has at hand. In a nod to this line of reasoning, the National Security Strategy contends that "Where possible, we must improve existing systems to maximize returns on prior investments."

Today, many believe that the U.S. military has lost the ability to overwhelm enemies. Part of that mindset is likely the lack of resistance encountered during operations carried out after 2001. Another reason is the collective U.S. obsession with fewer numbers of large, highly expensive-read much less expendableplatforms. How can you present massed, multidimensional/vectored threats to the enemy when you simply do not have enough numbers?
With the return of Great Power competition and the concomitant quest to reestablish maritime dominance, joint force planners must dare to think differently. In this respect, the National Defense Strategy is right on the mark when it argues for "chang[ing] . . . the way we organize and employ forces" and "developing operational concepts to sharpen our competitive advantages and enhance our lethality." 47 That being said, U.S. naval forces must plan for challenging the integrated, layered defenses of near-peer rivals, and this is far removed from handling the relatively weak systems of extremist groups and Third World nations. To this end, Washington should reconsider the U.S. way of war that emphasizes qualities such as agility and precision over overwhelming force à la the application of Allied airpower during the Battle of the Bismarck Sea.
The likes of China and Russia are emphasizing the latter attribute in their quest to negate U.S. military superiority in wartime. For instance, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is believed to have drawn up plans involving forces attacking from multiple dimensions-land, surface, sub-surface, and air-and vectors to overwhelm U.S. maritime forces. This involves pitting high-density, cheaper, and more expendable assets against the U.S. Navy battle force, which largely has the opposite of these characteristics and the magazine capacities of which could be depleted rapidly during a high-intensity missile exchange. James Holmes and Toshi Yoshihara note that "PLA saturation attacks will involve the concerted use of cruise, ballistic, and hypersonic missiles; aerial attack from manned and unmanned warplanes, mines; torpedo attack; electronic warfare and cyber warfare."

Fortunately, the United States has taken a few tentative steps in the right direction. For a start, U.S. ground forces, which have hitherto been left out of the counter-A2/AD calculus, are finally being factored in. This can be seen in the promulgation of concepts such as the Marines Corps expeditionary advanced base operations, where they would help the Navy establish sea control.

Indeed, there was a glimpse of this in the April 2018 military action against Syria, where U.S., British, and French air and naval forces attacked the Bashar al-Asad regime from the Mediterranean, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf. After the operation, Admiral Richardson stated that the U.S. Navy was studying the lessons learned to better prep itself for higher intensity conflict.

Military entities can be prone to inertia, and the Armed Forces are no exception. In the face of extant and emerging A2/ AD systems that could seriously undermine U.S. control of the seas, Pentagon leaders should step up their game in addressing this issue. To be sure, the U.S. sea services have taken some action in this respect, but perhaps more could be done. To this end, while it is always good to think of novel ideas, it is often instructive to look to history, especially some of its less famous episodes, for takeaways. Indeed, such lessons are of immense value and free for learning, provided they are considered.
Winston Churchill once stated, "The longer you can look back, the farther you can look forward." The sage British statesman was spot on here as historical events that seem far removed from the contemporary era can still provide lessons pointing to the way ahead. To be sure, the relatively lesser known Battle of the Bismarck Sea took place 76 years ago, and much in the operational environment has changed since then. We should also bear in mind the limitations of drawing lessons from a single historical episode.
Nevertheless, the fundamental challenges presented by a Great Power competitor remain the same, and the battle offers ample food for thought for Pentagon leaders in terms of coming up with a viable operational concept (think JAM-GC and related concepts), not only as a warfighting implement but also to act as a deterrent during peacetime against A2/ AD-centric near-peer rivals.
All in all, the three key takeaways of the Battle of the Bismarck Sea may seem trite at first glance, but a deeper look will arguably show their worth in the discourse to preserve the exalted U.S. status of primus inter pares in the maritime domain. Going forward, Admiral Richardson in Version 2.0 has alluded to a large-scale exercise in 2020 that will seek to test the Distributed Maritime Operations concept, as well as deliver an "initial cross-domain solution."
