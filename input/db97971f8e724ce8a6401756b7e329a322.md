Russia's strategic objectives in the war with Georgia can be divided into two categories.
The first category includes those objectives that do not relate directly to planning a military campaign.
With these objectives, Russia was signaling interests and intentions to other players in the international arena.
Clearly, Russia wanted to send a strong signal to the West that Russia has returned to the world as powerful player, is "capable of effectively acting in its periphery," and is willing and able to use military force to protect its interests.
