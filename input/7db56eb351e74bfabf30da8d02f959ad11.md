The nature of the rising conflict over information in the new global commons of space and cyberspace are far different from the mediums that the US currently operates in with nearly unchecked freedom of action.
Due to the attributes of the new global commons of space and cyberspace, this level of dominance will be lost.
Space and cyberspace will be an ambiguous environment marked by speed of light actions and challenging attribution resulting in a continuous, modulated level of conflict with the potential for rapid escalation.
This new reality will lead to an inevitable state of parity between the US, China, and Russia, driving a state of constant conflict in the struggle over space and cyberspace control.
