This research explores possible international and defense strategies that China might employ to outcompete the United States and achieve a position of international primacy. The posited strategies, although created by the authors, are framed by findings regarding Chinese political processes, concepts, policies, and national goals. The purpose of the analysis is threefold: to support U.S. planning and decisionmaking, to educate readers about China's strategy and policymaking process, and to spur discussion about the stakes and nature of the competition.

Chinese authorities frankly acknowledge the inevitability of competition but reject the notion that conflict is inevitable.

Focusing on the foreign policy and defense dimensions of the competition, the authors propose with this research to make three contributions. First and foremost, we intend the report to serve as a planning tool by positing international and defense strategies that could allow China to outcompete the United States. Such a tool could facilitate U.S. government efforts to formulate its own strategies and policies to protect U.S. interests. Second, the analysis is meant to educate readers on how the Chinese view the competition with the United States. In hopes of more closely approximating how Beijing might actually conceptualize the competition, the authors aim to reflect a Chinese perspective as much as possible. Third, we seek to raise awareness and encourage greater public debate about the stakes of a U.S.-China competition that has expanded in scope and complexity.
Because the authors seek to present competitive strategies from a Chinese perspective, we rely primarily on unclassified Chinese documents. U.S.-China relations remains a topic of intense interest among Chinese officials and analysts. An enormous volume of official docu-ments, commentaries, and scholarly writings has examined the relationship from many angles. This literature provides an important resource for discerning key themes and ideas in Chinese policy and debates. As much as possible, the team from the RAND Corporation has sought to adhere to the same authoritative sources and intellectual materials that Chinese officials would draw from to develop any foreign policy or defense strategy document. In addition to these documents, the authors also examined Western reporting and academic scholarship on issues related to the U.S.-China competition.
As presented by the authors, China's international strategy aims to establish the country's primacy in the Asia-Pacific region. It also seeks to establish Chinese leadership of the international order. However, China's contest for global leadership need not wait until after it has secured regional primacy. The strategy proposes that China pursue both at the same time, underpinned by the notion that progress toward either regional-or global-level objectives could enable progress toward the other. If successful, China will have surpassed the United States to become the paramount regional power and the leading global power. However, China's international leadership would bear little resemblance to the forms exercised by previous global leaders such as the United States and Great Britain. Exercising a partial global hegemony centered principally on Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa, Chinese international leadership would be characterized by a reliance on finance, diplomatic engagement, and security assistance to exercise influence while maintaining a modest overseas military presence.
As posited by the authors, China's standard for successful competition with the United States thus entails the following conditions by midcentury: (1) War with the United States is avoided, although this does not exclude the possibility of militarized crises or conflicts of a limited scope (e.g., proxy wars); (2) the United States respects China's authority as the global leader, even as the United States remains a powerful, but clearly inferior, nation; (3) the United States largely refrains from harming Chinese interests; (4) China has established primacy across much of Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa, principally through patronage of client states; (5) U.S. primacy has been reduced to the Americas, although it may still maintain a military, economic, xvi China's Quest for Global Primacy and diplomatic presence worldwide; (6) the United States and China manage their differences according to norms upheld by China; and (7) the two cooperate on shared concerns on terms defined largely by the Chinese.
The consequences of Chinese success in strategic competition could be severe for the United States. Sitting astride the heart of the global economy, Beijing would be well situated to privilege its needs and those of its clients over those of the United States and its allies. This situation would likely entail a deleterious downgrading in the prospects for the United States. Poorly positioned to unseat China or easily reverse its own flagging fortunes, the United States could face dwindling economic prospects, international marginalization, and a diminishing ability to shape global affairs.
The international strategy presented seeks to achieve this end state through peaceful methods, although it does not rule out the possibilities of militarized crises or even conflicts of a limited scope, such as proxy wars. The core of the proposed international strategy is a reliance on China's economic prowess and diplomatic maneuver to put Beijing into a position of advantage from which it cannot be dislodged by the United States. Regarding major powers, the posited strategy seeks to ensure the United States and Europe remain divided in their approach to China while Russia cooperates closely as a junior partner. The Asia-Pacific region remains a priority area, and the strategy envisions Beijing weakening U.S. alliances, expanding its own network of client states, renovating and leading regional multilateral institutions, and deepening the region's integration into a Chinese-led economic, political, and technological order. Beijing regards the developing world as a key constituency for its international leadership, and the strategy posited here aims to build a network of client states across Eurasia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. Chinese success in establishing itself as a principal arbiter in Middle Eastern affairs, as the main sponsor of Africa's economic development, and as a major partner in Latin America could result in a severe weakening in the strategic position of the United States as a global leader and undercut its position in the Indo-Pacific theater as well. In the multilateral domain, the strategy envisions a broad effort to shape rules, norms, and agendas to favor the interests of China and its clients at the expense of the United States. Beijing's global governance strategy similarly aims to bolster China's influence and delegitimize that of the United States in appropriate venues. For each section of this chapter, the authors have proposed objectives for the 2035 time frame that could guide the development of relevant criteria against which China's progress could be assessed. An appendix offers some sample subobjectives that could be used to evaluate Chinese progress toward relevant objectives.
Defense strategy plays an important but supplementary role to the proposed Chinese international strategy. A complementary defense strategy would aim to constrain Washington's ability to forestall or prevent its own eclipse by building a superior Chinese military that renders the risks of military conflict intolerably high in the Asia-Pacific theater. The defense strategy also aims to deter the United States from challenging China in any contingency along its periphery and provide support to gray-zone activities that incrementally change the status quo at the expense of the United States and its allies. A major military responsibility would be to support diplomatic efforts to shape a favorable international environment by building strong security ties with client states and discrediting or weakening the appeal of the United States as an alternative. The defense strategy also raises the possibility of engaging in proxy or other more-limited conflicts to protect the interests of client states and demonstrate the superiority of Chinese power. To address concerns about the risks of miscalculation and escalation in any incident involving the United States, however, the defense strategy emphasizes the importance of preventing conflict, managing crisis, and strict control of military forces by civilian authorities in any contingency. At the same time, the strategy leaves open the possibility for cooperation with the U.S. military on shared security threats.
The strategies depicted in this research should not be construed as predictions of how the competition may evolve. Whether China can prevail is hardly predetermined, and the United States continues to enjoy many strategic advantages. The outlook is further complicated by the sheer variety and types of factors-some of which may not be well understood today-that could affect the trajectory of the competition. The sudden emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic has already xviii China's Quest for Global Primacy shown how unexpected shocks can drive the international situation in unexpected directions. Moreover, China has serious liabilities that could impair its ability to compete with the United States. Some of these have been posited by Chinese analysts and commentators, but others can be deduced by analysis. The most-important vulnerabilities highlighted by Chinese leaders center on the country's domestic situation. China continues to face severe economic imbalances, problems of corruption, regional unrest, and daunting demographic challenges. In terms of international attributes, China suffers from a position of disadvantage as the rising power. It has a weaker leadership role in multilateral venues and an inferior influence on global discourse than the incumbent power, the United States. China's defense strategy has drawbacks as well. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) remains an unattractive partner for many countries, especially in Asia. And the military's lack of power-projection capabilities limits its ability to provide the public security goods that helped make U.S. global leadership so successful. These vulnerabilities suggest advantages for the United States, but they also underscore areas that China could address in coming years if it hopes to improve its competitive position. One final point deserves emphasis. The most-critical factors that will determine the outcome of U.S.-China competition are fundamentally domestic. Which side can build the more technologically innovative and prosperous economy, flourishing and well-governed society, and durable and responsive politics will likely be the side to gain a decisive advantage in competition. A thorough analysis of the potential trajectory of U.S.-China competition would examine such variables closely, but such a task lies beyond the scope of this analysis. The importance of domestic policy should nonetheless be borne in mind when analyzing the international and defense dimensions of competitive strategies.
The research carries several implications for U.S. decisionmakers and the Department of Defense (DoD). The first is the enduring importance of strengthening America's network of alliances and partnerships. China recognizes this network to be a tremendous strategic advantage for the United States, one that Beijing has struggled to match. This analysis has underscored the importance of initiatives undertaken by the past two presidential administrations to shore up U.S. influence and leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. The Indo-Pacific remains a critical domain of U.S.-China competition, and its importance for the broader global competition merits emphasis. U.S. policies that facilitate China's consolidation of influence and leadership in the Indo-Pacific could simply accelerate Beijing's efforts to challenge U.S. leadership at the global-systemic level.
The importance of areas outside the Indo-Pacific and of developing countries as constituencies for international leadership deserves emphasis as well. China's cultivation of client states and influence in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America could directly affect the ability of the United States to compete in the Indo-Pacific. As one example, Chinese success in consolidating influence with vital energy suppliers in the Middle East could affect the ability and willingness of countries like Japan and India to support measures that constrain Chinese power. The need to bolster the U.S. position in the Indo-Pacific may need to be balanced by the need to uphold U.S. credibility as a global leader. At the very least, closer coordination between competitive strategies both within and outside the Indo-Pacific will be imperative. In terms of developing countries, China's lack of allies leaves it in a weak position to challenge the United States. Washington could strengthen its hand further by bolstering its relationships with those states that have only recently experienced substantial growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Given the long-term trends favoring the rise of the "non-West," cultivation of support in the developing world appears prudent in any case.
While multilateral organizations and institutions for global governance have endured considerable criticism for their many failings and inefficiencies, this research has concluded that engagement with those entities will remain an important component of U.S.-China competition. Greater U.S. investments in shaping and reinvigorating international institutions and multilateral venues can help consolidate U.S. influence and restrain Chinese challenges. In some cases, this may involve initiatives to grant China more influence and extend cooperation. The goal here, as in other areas, is to weaken the force of Chinese criticisms by demonstrating responsive, effective U.S. leadership, xx China's Quest for Global Primacy thereby reducing the incentive for other countries to back Beijing's efforts to renovate those organizations in ways that harm U.S. interests.
In terms of defense strategy, the posited strategy has emphasized the importance of deterrence, crisis management, and military diplomacy in the competition. As presented in this report, China's defense strategy could expand the geographic range of potential crisis situations and contingencies. Along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) routes and as part of the effort to expand a network of client states worldwide, China has a strong incentive to offer arms sales, military training, and other forms of assistance. Such transactions have been increasing in recent years. In coming years, China may take on even more security responsibilities to protect its BRI investments. An imperative to demonstrate its credibility as a patron to client nations could incentivize PLA forces to carry out more-frequent acts of military diplomacy that coerce U.S. allies or partners, or even to contemplate the development of alliance-like obligations.
These possibilities suggest that the U.S. military faces a compelling need to bolster conventional deterrence and invest in capabilities to ensure the superiority of the armed forces in the future. A focus on traditional deterrence through conventional military superiority remains the bedrock of any security strategy to counter China. A robust U.S. military capability to defend its interests and those of its allies and partners provides a critical source of U.S. credibility as a leader in the Indo-Pacific. A strong conventional military capability is also essential for incentivizing regional powers, such as Japan, Vietnam, and others, to resist Chinese coercion and demands. By contrast, clear evidence that the United States had lost the military advantage could persuade other countries to either adopt a position of tacit submission and accommodation to Chinese demands or step up a potentially destabilizing arms race to shore up their defense.
Ensuring the capability to deter China in the short term will remain critical, but investment to ensure long-term advantage will be critical as well. Sustaining investment in the future capabilities of the U.S. military will be essential not just for ensuring the long-term credibility of U.S. deterrence, but also for bolstering America's position in the broader competition. Finding ways to better protect U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific but also in the cyber, space, and other domains can backstop broader competitive efforts. DoD may need to maintain a significant presence in the Middle East and other theaters to bolster the U.S. position in the Indo-Pacific as well.
Strengthening U.S. conventional capabilities and investing in a technologically advanced future force remain critical tasks. But military diplomacy could assume greater importance, too. The diplomatic struggle for influence and leadership suggests that the U.S. military could play an important role in incentivizing cooperation with the United States and helping countries resist unreasonable Chinese demands. U.S. experience in military advisory missions and assistance can help strengthen diplomatic partnerships and counter Chinese influence efforts. The provision of public goods, such as security for key shipping lanes and humanitarian aid in the face of disaster, can help maintain the appeal of the United States as the global leader.
As the competition intensifies, U.S. military planners may need to expand the portfolio of possible contingencies involving China. The flashpoints between the United States and China today may not be flashpoints in the future, or they may coexist alongside new ones. Scenarios involving Taiwan, the East and South China Seas, and cyberspace tend to occupy the concerns of military planners today, but these issues may be augmented by new ones that arise from China's efforts to exert greater leadership, especially along its BRI routes and with client states on other continents. As just one illustration, China's willingness to court Iran despite U.S. sanctions raises the possibility over time of proxy conflicts between forces backed by China and those by the United States in the Middle East. The more that China assumes the role of patron for client states, the higher the likelihood that, at some point, PLA forces or Chinese-backed host nation forces could engage in hostile acts against parties aligned with the United States.
The appeal and feasibility of Chinese military efforts to resolve longstanding issues, such as Taiwan, may need to be reexamined through the lens of the broader competition as well. From Beijing's perspective, the potential cost and risk of escalation in war increase the more the competition with the United States intensifies. Thus, it is in China's interest to delay the resolution of Taiwan's status and xxii China's Quest for Global Primacy that of other disputed regions until it has prevailed in its competition with the United States. This might mean that Beijing tolerates a stable cross-strait relationship premised on Taiwan's rejection of formal independence so long as the United States retains the international upper hand and a credible military intervention option. Other PLA missions may be more pressing for the near term. However, the calculus could change, should China succeed in gaining a decisive competitive advantage in international and regional leadership and in its military posture near Taiwan. Similarly, China may regard as satisfactory a continued reliance on gray-zone tactics that incrementally change the status quo within the first island chain in a low-risk manner while it prioritizes efforts to weaken the U.S. position in Asia and elsewhere. To maximize deterrence and the protection of U.S. interests, the defense and foreign policy dimensions of any U.S. competitive strategy may need to be even more closely coordinated.
Any Chinese deliberation on how to tailor the controlled use of force in any confrontation involving U.S.-backed forces would carry serious risks, of course. The dangers of escalation and miscalculation paradoxically underscore the importance of finding ways for both countries to cooperate and ease tensions as a component of successful competition. The development of a strategy that includes some degree of reassurance and cooperation could help stabilize the competition and reduce risks of miscalculation and dangerous incidents. Moreover, as the international security environment experiences more fragmentation and breakdown, collaboration between the world's two largest powers could prove nearly unavoidable in any case.
The return of great-power competition after decades of unchallenged U.S. global primacy has introduced new challenges and risks. Washington enters the contest burdened by fiscal strains, domestic political polarization, and competing international and domestic priorities. These constraints raise the imperative of developing effective strategies that allocate resources efficiently and effectively. The derivation of a Chinese strategy can, hopefully, provide a useful tool for that important task.
The United States has long played an outsized role in the foreign and security policies of the People's Republic of China (PRC). In the early decades of the Cold War, the two sides feuded bitterly and even fought a large-scale conflict in the Korean War. Beijing's turn toward reform and opening up in the late 1970s and its cooperation with the United States against the Soviet Union heralded a relaxation of tensions and a warming of bilateral relations. From the 1980s through the 2000s, both countries benefited enormously from largely cooperative relations and robust trade despite persistent tensions over Taiwan, human rights, and other issues. U.S. markets, investment, and capital helped fuel China's rapid economic growth, and greater diplomatic and popular engagement helped ease mistrust and stabilize China's security situation. Beijing may have resented the U.S. military presence in East Asia, but it also benefited from the regional stability that U.S. power provided. Beyond the Pacific, U.S. political leadership and military strength secured vital energy and shipping routes, enabling the global economy to prosper.
Since around 2010, however, U.S.-China relations have entered a new phase characterized by sharpening competition. As the gap in comprehensive national power has narrowed, Beijing's pursuit of national revitalization has coincided with a deepening of tensions with the United States over longstanding disputes regarding Taiwan, the South China Sea, and the U.S. military presence in Asia. In addition, new points of contention, including China's crackdown on Hong Kong and Xinjiang and escalating feuds over trade and technology have pushed bilateral ties to their worst condition in decades.

On the other hand, China also faces a growing array of incentives to weaken and erode the strength of the United States, which has become its chief competitor. U.S. power remains the single most important impediment to China's unification with Taiwan, the achievement of which Chinese leaders have deemed essential to national revitalization. U.S. efforts to counter a rapidly modernizing Chinese military by bolstering the U.S. position in the Asia-Pacific has complicated Chinese efforts to assert regional leadership. And, as its economy matures and converges in many ways with the structure of that of the United States, China's ability to achieve higher growth depends, in part, on its ability to outpace that of the United States. The global struggle for access to markets, technologies, and resources overlaps with an intensifying political struggle for influence and international leadership as both sides feud over the value of liberal democracy, human rights, and other issues.
Chinese authorities frankly acknowledge the inevitability of competition but also reject the notion that conflict is inevitable.

Focusing on the foreign policy and defense dimensions of the competition, the authors of this research propose to make three contributions. First and foremost, we intend this analysis to serve as a planning tool by positing international and defense strategies that could allow China to outcompete the United States. Such a tool could facilitate U.S. government efforts to formulate its own strategies and policies to protect U.S. interests. Second, we seek to educate readers on how the Chinese view the competition with the United States. Third, we seek to raise awareness and encourage greater public debate about the stakes of a U.S.-China competition that has expanded in scope and complexity.
A primary purpose of this research is to directly support U.S. planning efforts by positing international and security-related goals, objectives, and competitive strategies from a Chinese perspective. Because the project is envisioned as a planning aid, it prioritizes the function of planning support over fidelity to available sources. First, the authors seek to articulate a plausible set of international and defense strategies for China. The presentation of challenging Chinese strategies could help U.S. decisionmakers and planners better plan for and respond to the competitive challenge posed by Beijing. At the very least, this project could provide a starting point for evaluating how China approaches the competition.
While designed to support U.S. planning and spur public discussion, the report is also intended to avoid grossly misrepresenting Beijing's viewpoint by adhering as much as possible to the current state of knowledge on Chinese strategy and policy. The analysis is designed to simulate how Chinese leaders might approach the challenge. We achieved this by remaining faithful to the general approach, ideas, and ways and policies pursued by Beijing, as far as can be discerned from unclassified sources. China's goals and objectives may be presented in a more strenuous and challenging manner than publicly available Chinese documents show, but the strategies presented in the following pages should be broadly consistent with what we know about China's political system, national strategy, and foreign policy. Nor should anything presented in this project contradict established knowledge about China's strategic behavior and aims. Where gaps in the record exist or knowledge about a relevant topic incomplete, we note that here. However, on many topics related to China's intentions regarding competition with the United States, it is unrealistic to expect Beijing to publicly acknowledge its goals, given their sensitivity. This reality presents a methodological problem for researchers who want to rely on official Chinese documents to deduce China's strategy for U.S. competition.
To resolve this conundrum and fulfill this report's purpose of support to planning, the authors will, in some cases, propose objectives and goals that may not found in authoritative Chinese documents.
Caution is certainly required in doing so. The contents of this research should not be interpreted as a report on China's official strategy to compete with the United States. Absent access to authoritative government documents that clearly provide such content, China's actual strategy for U.S. competition remains unknown. If, in fact, one does exist, its contents will have to be deduced from clues. Accordingly, this report should be understood as an analytic construct based on careful analysis of Chinese documents, policies, and actions that collectively posit a plausible set of international and defense strategies for China to compete with the United States. If this analysis achieves its purpose, it will have balanced fidelity to Chinese sources and known Chinese strategies and policies with the imperative to present an insightful and useful planning tool for U.S. decisionmakers.
A second purpose of the report is to educate readers on Chinese perspectives regarding competition with the United States and on Chinese policymaking processes. A detailed analysis of Chinese documents on this topic lies beyond the scope of the study, but this report does provide a brief review of some of the more salient sources and what they say about how Chinese officials and analysts regard the competition. While Chinese leaders routinely call on the United States to "abandon a Cold War mentality" and enhance cooperation, they do not disavow competition with the United States. Indeed, as subsequent chapters will show, China's government has perceived itself to be in a strategic competition with the United States for more than a decade. Officials also regard successful competition with the United States as critical to their ambitions for national revitalization. At the same time, Chinese commentators and analysts generally express an optimism that the two countries can cooperate on shared threats and generally regard as unlikely the prospect of great power war. What is often left unsaid in these sources, however, is the question of how the Chinese will succeed in persuading the United States to accommodate itself to a position of inferiority if Beijing succeeds in outcompeting the United States. The unspoken conclusion appears to be that China can outcompete the United States in a way that leaves Washington little choice but to accommodate itself to the reality of its supersession.
As part of its educative purpose, this analysis also hopes to replicate, to some degree, China's approach to strategy and policy formulation. China's political system remains defined by its adherence to a Leninist political organization and Marxist ideology, albeit one so heavily attenuated as to bear little resemblance to the theories of class struggle that have traditionally defined orthodox Marxism. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) adheres to a method of analysis designed to reinforce the legitimacy of the political system, and this methodology informs its goals and policies. While a detailed description of this process and how it affects the CCP's approach to strategic competition lies beyond the report's scope, we do review several fundamental features to provide readers a sense of how Chinese leaders might conceive of the competition. An important lesson is that context is key to understanding why China may not have a specific strategy for U.S. competition. The authors of this report argue for the importance of viewing China's approach through the lens of its pursuit of national rejuvenation, also called the China Dream. The pursuit of the China Dream and the foreign policy and defense strategies undertaken to achieve that end state provide the framework within which any competitive strategy with the United States should be understood.
Whether and how China could carry out the proposed strategies is another matter, of course. Like any large country, China's government has experienced significant challenges in implementing and coordinating complex policies. As examples, ministries have failed to cooperate or share information, and provincial authorities have sometimes acted in a manner at odds with central directives. Poor implementation at other times has generated blowback that endangered entire initiatives. 
6
A third purpose of the analysis is to encourage greater awareness and stimulate a deeper examination of the U.S.-China competition. U.S. leaders and commentators have focused considerable attention on specific issues, such as Chinese trade practices, espionage, and efforts to influence political discourse. Much discussion has also centered on the struggle for influence in the Indo-Pacific. This research is intended, in part, to encourage greater debate about the competition for global influence and the linkages between the contests in the Indo-Pacific and other regions. We also hope that the report highlights important issues related to the international and defense dimensions of the competition, such as the way rivalry might influence Beijing's approach to flashpoints involving the United States or the importance of bilateral and multilateral cooperation as a means of stabilizing the competition.
As presented by the authors, China's international strategy aims to establish the country's primacy in the Asia-Pacific region. It also seeks to establish Chinese leadership of the international order. However, China's contest for global leadership need not wait until after it has secured regional primacy. The strategy proposes that China pursue both at the same time, underpinned by the notion that progress toward either regional-or global-level objectives could enable progress toward the other. If successful, China will have surpassed the United States to become the paramount regional power but also the leading global power. However, China's international leadership would bear little resemblance to the forms exercised by previous global leaders, such as the United States and Great Britain. Exercising a partial global hegemony centered principally on Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa, Chinese international leadership would be characterized by a reliance on finance, diplomatic engagement, and security assistance to exercise influence while maintaining a modest overseas military presence.
The consequences of Chinese success in strategic competition could be severe for the United States. Sitting astride the heart of the global economy, Beijing would be well situated to privilege its needs and those of its clients over those of the United States and its allies. This situation would likely entail a deleterious downgrading in the prospects for the United States. Poorly positioned to unseat China or easily reverse its own flagging fortunes, the United States could face dwindling economic prospects, international marginalization, and a diminishing ability to shape global affairs.
The research unfolds in two parts. The first part, constituting Chapters Two through Four, provides essential background information and context for the posited Chinese strategy for competition with the United States. Any plausible strategy for U.S. competition must serve the CCP's broader pursuit of national revitalization captured in the concept of the China Dream. These chapters provide critical context through the frameworks and archetypes that define key CCP strategies. The second part, in Chapters Five through Eight, outlines the posited strategies themselves. These chapters draw from the preceding ones as we explore the international and defense dimensions of a possible Chinese strategy for U.S. competition.
Chapter Two will provide a brief introduction to China's distinctive approach to strategy and policy formulation and implementation. Drawing from authoritative sources and scholarly studies of the ruling CCP's organization and ideology, we describe four key steps in the CCP's approach to strategy development, which inform any strategy proposed by the CCP, including any that might exist for U.S. competition. Because trend analysis forms an important intellectual context to all Chinese policymaking, this chapter reviews some of the key judgments that inform the most recent official policy documents. These trends inform the strategies and goals presented in the rest of the report and may be understood as a set of important "planning assumptions." We then describe the principal analytic framework used by the CCP to organize policy directives related to national development. We also briefly review the main tenets of the China Dream as the principal goal and aim point of all of the CCP's strategies and policies. These basic features of China's political system and national strategy provide the fundamental framework for the posited competitive strategies outlined in this report.
Chapters Three and Four provide additional important context for the analysis of China's strategy to compete with the United States. Chapter Three is an examination of the international dimension of China's strategy to achieve the China Dream; we describe the foreign policy framework that serves as the template for relevant work. Drawing from official sources and Chinese scholarly writings, we posit a potential international end state consistent with the national end state of the China Dream. To achieve such an end state or something like it, Chinese authorities have outlined a variety of directives and policies. In this chapter, we review the most relevant foreign policy directives. The foreign policy framework, end state, and directives provide essential context for understanding how China might organize and understand the international dimension of its competition with the United States.
Chapter Four outlines a similar approach for defense strategy. We define the principal framework used in Chinese defense policy and posit a possible end state for defense issues based on analysis of Chinese official documents. Because the military largely serves domestic and foreign policy objectives, a defense "end state" is largely described in terms of the military's readiness and ability to support relevant domestic and foreign policy objectives. Even so, the CCP has outlined goals for military modernization by midcentury, which we consider in this chapter. As with Chapter Two, the material presented in this chapter provides essential background for understanding how China might conceive the defense aspect of its competition with the United States.
In Chapter Five, we pivot more directly to the topic of China's competition with the United States. We begin by examining the competition from the perspective of Chinese leaders, analysts, and scholars. National leaders have given speeches and the government has issued white papers and other official documents addressing the topic of U.S.-China relations. These sources do not shy away from prescribing to U.S. policymakers recommendations on how to manage the relationship to minimize the risks of conflict and enable China to achieve its goals. Commentators, analysts, and scholars have generated volumes of papers on U.S.-China relations. These sources provide valuable insight into how authorities may regard the competition. For example, the drive to prevail in strategic competition does not necessarily stem from any particular animus toward the United States. In contrast to the Cold War, modern China is animated more by a desire for achieving national greatness, not by ideological imperatives to destroy global capitalism and realize communist revolution, as Mao Zedong hoped. Simply put, China's ability to deliver a high standard of living for the people and achieve a position of national greatness depends, in part, on its ability to outcompete the United States. As a corollary, Beijing appears to have judged that its interests are best served by an international order led by China, not the United States.
In Chapter Six, we build on the preceding chapters to propose a possible Chinese strategy for U.S. competition. This chapter outlines the desired end state for U.S.-China relations, as seen from Beijing's perspective. As posited by the authors, China's standard for successful competition with the United States thus entails the following conditions by midcentury: (1) War with the United States is avoided, although this does not exclude the possibility of militarized crises or conflicts of a limited scope (e.g., proxy wars); (

In Chapter Seven, we explore in more detail a posited Chinese international strategy for competing with the United States. Regarding major powers, the posited strategy seeks to ensure that the United States and Europe remain divided in their approach to China while Russia cooperates closely as a junior partner. The Asia-Pacific region remains a priority area, and the strategy envisions Beijing weakening U.S. alliances, expanding its own network of client states, renovating and leading regional multilateral institutions, and deepening the region's integration into a Chinese-led economic, political, and technological order. Beijing regards the developing world as a key constituency for its international leadership, and the strategy posited here aims to build a network of client states across Eurasia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. China's success in establishing itself as a principal arbiter in Middle Eastern affairs, as the main sponsor of Africa's economic development, and as a major partner in Latin America could result in a severe weakening in the strategic position of the United States as a global leader and undercut its position in the Indo-Pacific theater as well. In the multilateral domain, the strategy envisions a broad effort to shape rules, norms, and agendas to favor the interests of China and its clients at the expense of the United States. Beijing's global governance strategy similarly aims to bolster China's influence and delegitimize that of the United States in appropriate venues. For each section of this chapter, the authors have proposed objectives for the 2035 time frame that could guide the development of relevant criteria against which China's progress could be assessed.
Similarly, Chapter Eight maps the defense strategy component of competition with the United States. Military-related goals generally aim to support foreign policy, but a superior People's Liberation Army (PLA) also provides benefits to Beijing's pursuit of national prestige and influence. The defense strategy seeks to deter the United States from harming any of China's interests but also to provide support to grayzone activities that incrementally change the status quo. The defense strategy also calls on the military to support diplomatic efforts to shape a favorable international environment through security assistance and military engagements. Crafted with concern about the risks of miscalculation and escalation in any incident involving the United States, the defense strategy also emphasizes the importance of preventing conflict, managing crisis, and strict control of military forces by civilian authorities. At the same time, the strategy envisions Chinese leaders directing the PLA to leapfrog past the U.S. armed forces to become the world's premier military.
Chapter Nine lists an array of potential vulnerabilities in China's strategy. Some of these have been posited by Chinese analysts and commentators, but others can be deduced by analysis of Chinese strategy and policy. The most important vulnerabilities that could impair the nation's ability to compete stem from its domestic situation. In terms of international attributes, China suffers from a position of disadvan-tage as the rising power. It has a weaker leadership role in multilateral venues and an inferior influence on global discourse than the incumbent power, the United States. China's defense strategy has drawbacks as well. The PLA remains an unattractive partner for many countries, especially in Asia. And the military's lack of power-projection capabilities limits its ability to provide the public security goods that helped make U.S. global leadership so successful. Chapter Ten concludes with observations on the competition and implications for U.S. strategy and planning. An appendix provides a set of subobjectives that could be used to develop more specific indicators for evaluation. These are not meant to be definitive or exhaustive but could provide a starting point for analysts seeking to better understand Beijing's perspective on its relative progress in the competition.
The research approach adopted by the authors consists of analysis to derive a strategy for U.S. competition based on a careful examination of unclassified Chinese and Western official documents, news reports, and scholarly writings. The basic steps taken for this project involved first collecting and summarizing current knowledge about Chinese intentions regarding the nation's goals, especially regarding foreign policy and defense topics. Analysis of writings by Chinese scholars and experts, as well as authoritative commentary, provides insight into the meaning and logic of key concepts and directives. From this source material, we then construct international and defense strategies for U.S. competition. In constructing these strategies, we have tried to adhere as closely as possible to the frameworks, logic, and goals of Chinese authoritative sources. The strategies proposed in this report unavoidably involve some degree of speculation to fill out details not addressed in Chinese documents for one reason or another, which we readily acknowledge. In sum, although we have tried to provide a plausible roadmap for Chinese strategic competition with the United States, we emphasize that it is ultimately an analytic construct.
Because the study seeks to present a competitive strategy from a Chinese perspective, it will rely primarily on Chinese-language unclassified sources from around 2010 to the time of writing. China has been competing with the United States since before that time, of course, and much of the contextual information that we use dates from further in the past. However, we have chosen to focus on the years immediately preceding Xi Jinping's ascent to power and afterward because the striking change in policies toward a more vigorous challenge of U.S. power appears most relevant for our purposes.
U.S.-China relations remains a topic of intense interest among Chinese officials and analysts. An enormous volume of official documents, commentary, and scholarly writings have examined the relationship from many angles. These provide an important resource for discerning key themes and ideas in Chinese policy and debates. As much as possible, the research team from the RAND Corporation has sought to adhere to the same authoritative unclassified sources and intellectual materials that Chinese officials might draw from to develop any foreign policy or defense strategy document. The most important of these were issued under the collective authority of the top party leadership, such as Party Congress reports and Party Congress plenary decisions. Speeches by presidents Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping at venues such as Politburo study sessions and meetings or at work conferences provide authoritative guidance as well. Government documents, such as five-year plans, action plans, and other programmatic documents, record how officials intend to implement policy in accordance with the directives provided by the CCP central leadership. White papers provide concise summaries of official policy and are cited as appropriate as well. Analysis by Chinese experts and scholars in journals such as Outlook (Liaowang), Seeking Truth (Qiushi), and Study Times (Xuexi Shibao) helps illuminate the logic and thinking behind the strategy. These sources, many of which are available on Chinese-language websites, provide the key source materials from which we developed the report's intellectual framework and essential content.
The RAND team also examined Western and Chinese reporting, scholarly writings, and academic studies on topics related to Chinese strategy and policy. The basics of how Chinese leaders articu-late national strategy have been well established, for example. Western scholarship has described the central role that the CCP plays in developing and overseeing policy.

The reliance on unclassified sources for this research raises an immediately potential objection. Given the sensitivity and importance of the topic of competition, are unclassified documents really the best sources of information? Ought we not to expect the Chinese to disguise their intent in public and instead reveal their true policy intentions only in classified sources and documents? If the proposed strategy drawn from unclassified sources contradicts classified information, then this report may misinform U.S. planners. The objection is a reasonable one, especially given the tendency of past rising powers, most notably Germany and Japan in World War II, to prepare secret plans for war. However, the objection may be answered with two points. First, this report's main purpose is to present a Chinese perspective on the competition. To imaginatively construct a strategy from the Chinese perspective, immersion in the ideology, frameworks, logic, and concepts employed by CCP officials provided the most important source of information. These are all available from unclassified sources. Classified materials may build on, expand, or even fundamentally change the strategy depicted in this analysis, but the integration of such information represents a different, albeit no doubt important, task than that undertaken here. Second, the Chinese government has provided a surprising amount of information about its policies and intentions for those inclined to analyze Chinese-language documents that, admittedly, include considerable jargon.

As is well known by now, China's leadership has declared an intention to realize the country's revitalization as a great power by midcentury, an end state that authorities under Xi Jinping have hailed as the China Dream. The vision of national rejuvenation aims to comprehensively increase the standard of living for Chinese citizens and revitalize the nation as a wealthy, prosperous great power under the leadership of the CCP by the centenary of the founding of the People's Republic of China in 2049.

This chapter covers the basics of the process by which the Chinese government formulates and implements strategies and policies. Understanding this process is important for the purposes of this analysis because these processes inform the development of any strategy, including one that might support competition with the United States. Moreover, the goals, concepts, and logics related to Beijing's pursuit of the China Dream will also frame counterparts for the competitive strategy.
While the development and implementation of strategy and policy may be a cumbersome process in any modern country, the process 1 Xinhua, "Full Text of Xi Jinping's Report at 19th CPC National Congress,"  November 3, 2017d.  gains added complexity in China given the unusual role played by the CCP's Leninist political organization and Marxist-Leninist ideology. For example, the CCP relies on its Party Congress work report, widely acknowledged to be the most authoritative and important national strategy document, as a guiding document for the work of the nation. Developing the report, which is issued every five years, involves years of meetings, drafts, and revisions. Implementation of policy, in turn, involves a broad variety of planning and other documents, all of which are typically infused with an often abstruse political terminology and a dialectic logic derived from the official socialist ideology, albeit an ideology that has been so attenuated as to bear little resemblance to the orthodox Marxist doctrines of proletarian revolution.

Mastery of the CCP's unique political vocabulary, processes, and activities-in addition to those imposed by the Chinese languageposes a formidable obstacle to any serious student of China's politics and government. For purposes of this research, the Chinese strategy and policy-development process may be distilled into four steps. The steps represent tasks that any Chinese official involved in policy implementation would recognize, even without accepting the labels assigned by the report's authors. Most of these steps would be familiar to a policymaker in any country. Leaders and their staffs must analyze trends and gather facts, for example, before developing directives to address challenges and overseeing policy implementation accordingly. China's approach differs from others primarily in the way ideology plays a role in the analysis and interpretation of trends, as well as in the methods, derived from the Leninist system of rule, used to ensure policy implementation. These four steps are briefly reviewed in Figure

Trend analysis. Analysts located primarily within organizations that are subordinate to the Central Committee carry out authoritative analyses of broad trends in China's domestic and international situation to discern the most pressing challenges to the CCP's policy agenda. Key organizations include the Central Policy Research Office, Central Party School, and think tanks associated with the State Council.

virtually every policy document issued by central leaders provides a similar summary of the most relevant positive and negative trends as a prelude to any policy directives.
5
Theoretical interpretation. The CCP interprets the contradictions through the lens of its official ideology, known as "socialism with Chinese characteristics." CCP theorists propose major concepts derived from the theory to guide the resolution of the contradiction through the formulation of appropriate policies. The theory includes many concepts that have more-specific applications for policy purposes. Examples of key concepts derived from the official ideology include the "community of common destiny," "new security concept," "new type major power relations," and a "just and equitable international order."
To guide the development and implementation of major strategic tasks and all supporting work, the CCP has articulated an array of guiding principles and policies. PRC officials and media often refer to the collection of the party's guidance and policies, either in general or in regard to specific policy topics, as guidance-policy (zhidao fangzhen). Although these may appear to be general rules, they carry the force of law because of the close association with the leadership's intent and derivation from the guiding ideology. As with all of the party's principles and policies, the meaning of each may be updated when the party updates the guiding ideology.
Chinese leaders incessantly cite concepts drawn from the guiding ideology to justify relevant policies. The CCP most recently updated its guiding ideology at the 19th Party Congress to incorporate "Xi Jinping Thought." 
6
Central directives. The central leadership outlines the nation's strategy and issues broad guidance on how to achieve relevant goals through an array of strategy and policy directives, which may be understood as the set of authoritative instructions by central leaders to relevant party, government, and other organizations and bureaucracies. The highest-level document that carries such directives is the Party Congress report issued by the National Party Congress, a gathering of the collective leadership of the CCP that is held every five years. In 2017, the 19th Party Congress described the CCP's vision for national revitalization by midcentury, the China Dream, as well as interim strategic objectives for 2020 and 2035.

This concise summary of Chinese political processes has shown that the CCP's approach to developing strategy remains a highly centralized process. Owing to concerns about its political legitimacy, the CCP remains sensitive to the role that its ideology plays in the justifications for strategy and policy. However, in our summary, we have also suggested that the fragmented nature of the political system raises the possibility of miscalculation and misalignment. The United States has already experienced instances in which Chinese local officials may have exceeded the intent of authorities in Beijing in acting aggressively toward individual ships and airplanes operating within China's near seas, as in the 2001 EP-3 aircraft collision incident near Hainan Island. In such cases, the local authorities generally acted in accordance with the spirit of high-level guidance, but the vagueness of the directives allowed the same officials considerable latitude in interpreting them, occasionally resulting in dramatic incidents that authorities in Beijing then scrambled to manage. The deepening of U.S.-China competition, which involves a complex and balanced mixture of cooperative and competitive impulses, raises the possibility of miscalculation among various bureaucratic actors charged with policy implementation.
The CCP's judgment about the principal trends and countertrends inform its general strategy for achieving the China Dream. The trend analysis consists of two broad sections: a review of trends favorable to the CCP's political agenda, and countertrends that could threaten the party's agenda. All of the CCP's strategies and policies, including its foreign policy and defense policies, purportedly address and aim to resolve relevant contradictions in a manner that propels China closer to its desired end state of the China Dream. They will also inform the construction of any supporting strategy for U.S. competition. In the words of the 2019 "China and the World in the New Era" white paper, China's foreign policy and development strategy "comes from a profound understanding of the general trend of world development." 
12
Chinese official documents highlight several encouraging trends in the broader international situation. These include the persistence of peace and development, a shifting balance of global power, the deepening of economic globalization, a changing mode of global governance, and trends toward multipolarity.
Persistence of peace and development. Official documents observe that China continues to face a low risk of war for the foreseeable future. The 19th Party Congress report observed that "peace and development" had become "irreversible trends." 
13
14
15
16
Changing mode of global governance. The 19th Party Congress noted "accelerating changes" in the "global governance system and the international order." 17 The 2019 foreign policy white paper also highlighted growing opportunities for "collaboration in global governance."
Trend toward multipolarity. The 19th Party Congress repeated a judgment seen in official documents for at least a decade when it hailed trends toward multipolarity. Chinese officials and scholars have anticipated the arrival of a multipolar world since the fall of the Soviet Union. This judgment consistently appears in defense and foreign policy white papers as well.
In sum, the CCP views these positive trends as opportunities for advancing its goals of achieving the China Dream. These positive trends suggest that the power of the United States and its allies in the Western world will weaken, the power of China and its partners in the developing world will grow, and future global economic growth will depend on a reorganization of some aspects of the global economy. The trends also suggest that there are growing opportunities for China to expand its role in global governance and raise the possibility of achieving its strategic aims peacefully.
Despite some promising conditions, Chinese officials also identify a range of challenges. These are listed in the same authoritative documents as the ones that list the positive trends.
Increasing instability and diverse security threats. The 19th Party Congress report noted that "uncertainties and instability" had become 
16
"prominent." Other white papers have similarly noted evidence of disorder. The 2019 foreign policy white paper highlighted "deep seated problems" in the world, as well as the challenge of "increasing instability and uncertainties." Chinese official documents have also noted the variety of security challenges facing the nation. The 19th Party Congress stated that "regional hot spot problems rise one after another" and noted nontraditional threats including "terrorism, cyber security, major infectious diseases, and climate change." These sources also tend to highlight "hegemonism" and "unilateralism" as threats to international peace, which are thinly veiled criticisms of the United States.
Gaps in global governance. In its report, the 19th Party Congress hinted at problems of global governance when it noted that the "polarization between the rich and poor is becoming more and more serious." The 2019 foreign policy white paper more directly stated that "deficits in governance, trust, peace and development are growing." It cited as evidence the same evidence of widening inequality, which it attributed to "capital's excessive pursuit of profit." It also noted growing protectionism and deepening "global public and private debt" as evidence.
Slowing growth. The 19th Party Congress report observed that "the world's economic growth momentum is insufficient." The 2019 foreign policy white paper similarly cited the slowing global economy as a serious challenge.
Intensifying major-power competition. Official documents have noted a trend toward deepening international competition, especially among major powers, for years. The 2015 Military Strategy white paper, for example, noted an "intensifying" international competition for the "redistribution of power, rights and interests." 18 Defense white papers since the early 2000s have similarly observed an "intensifying international competition." These countertrends may be read as the flip side of many of the positive trends. From the Chinese perspective, they provide further evidence of an international order in transition from an older, U.S.dominated one to something featuring greater opportunity for China. To take advantage of the opportunity, China needs to develop appro-priate economic, diplomatic, and defense policies that respond effectively to both the positive and negative trends of the situation. If these policies are well designed, China's leaders could better position the country to reach its desired end state of the China Dream. However, each of the challenges carries a risk that missteps could result in serious setbacks and possibly endanger the nation's revitalization.

Given the size of its bureaucracy, some degree of standardization of political processes in China's political system is unavoidable. In fact, Chinese officials rely on a broad array of standardized conceptual schema and document types to communicate instructions. Among these, frameworks [buju], or templates, stand out as important for their role in presenting strategy and policy directives. Consistent adherence to a framework permits officials to efficiently and confidently identify changes to standing policy.
The CCP organizes all of its policy work to achieve the China Dream by a nested array of such frameworks. The most fundamental of these is that of national development. The realization of the China Dream ultimately hinges on the party's ability to oversee the nation's development. For this reason, all other frameworks serve and support the CCP's focus on national development. This chapter will briefly outline the national development framework, but an in-depth analysis of the domestic policies that most directly determine national development lies outside the bounds of this research. In subsequent chapters, we describe the frameworks for international and defense strategy.
The CCP organizes its work for the nation's development through a conceptual schema that it calls the general framework (zongti buju), which is often also called the five in one (wu weiyi ti) framework.

Although the CCP in the Mao era pursued utopian communist goals, in the reform era it has focused on the more pragmatic goal of realizing the country's potential as a wealthy and powerful nation. The leadership under Xi Jinping has designated this end state the China Dream, but previous governments since at least the early 1990s also used the term rejuvenation of the Chinese people. The features of this end state are updated at every party congress held every five years and were, thus, last revised in an authoritative manner at the 19th Party Congress in 2017.
Per the 19th Party Congress, the CCP aims to develop China into a "prosperous, strong, democratic, civilized, harmonious, and beautiful modernized socialist strong country." The report provides some detail on what each of these policy end states might entail, but details are understandably vague, given the distant time horizon. To briefly summarize, the CCP seeks to maintain its current political system and monopoly on power but also build a more responsive and effective government. Economically, the "common prosperity" of the populace will have been "basically realized," resulting in a high per capita gross domestic product (GDP) and elevated material standard of living. Culturally, the CCP's values prevail in China, and Chinese culture may be admired worldwide. In social welfare terms, the China Dream promises to provide citizens access to quality health care, education, welfare benefits, and other benefits. Ecologically, the end state promises to control pollution and to have restored a cleaner and healthier environment (Table 
2
Authoritative party documents outline a variety of policy benchmarks to be achieved by 2035. According to the 19th Party Congress report, China will have "basically accomplished modernization." Among a variety of political, economic, social welfare, and environmental goals, the report listed the aim of China becoming "a global leader in innovation." Although many of these development-related topics center on domestic policy, many have important implications for the international community because of China's size and integration into the global economy. Chinese leaders thus must consider the United States as an important factor for many key development-related strategic objectives.
In terms of unresolved territorial issues, Beijing's position on Taiwan and other disputed territories is unambiguous. The 19th Party Congress report stated, "Resolving the Taiwan question to realize China's complete reunification is the shared aspiration of all Chinese people." It emphatically declared that Beijing will "never allow anyone, any organization, or any political party, at any time or in any form, to separate any part of Chinese territory from China!"

Although there can be little doubt that Chinese leaders regard unification with Taiwan as a condition of the China Dream, it may not be possible to achieve both the development objectives listed in 26 Xinhua, 2017d.
27 State Council Information Office, "The One China Principle and the Taiwan Issue," February 21, 2000.
28 Xinhua, "Anti-Secession Law Adopted by NPC (Full Text)," China Daily, May 14, 2005. 
29
31
Similar judgments may be made about China's position regarding disputed regions, such as the East China Sea, South China Sea, and the disputed territories on the border with India. In each case, Chinese leaders have declared a firm commitment to controlling the regions in dispute. However, in practice, China has proceeded cautiously and avoided actions that could provoke conflict that might involve the United States. The value of recovering these other regions is less than that of Taiwan because they are mostly unoccupied or uninhabited. The maritime regions also lack the political salience of Taiwan as a symbol of an unfinished civil war. Thus, if forced to choose between peaceful tolerance of an unresolved status for disputed maritime regions and war with the United States to secure them, China has even less motivation to sacrifice the nation's China Dream development objectives for the sake of controlling uninhabited and desolate maritime regions. This should not mean that China will never risk a conflict in any disputed region, but only that the desire to achieve the China Dream by itself is unlikely to drive high-risk military actions to recover disputed regions. More likely, any crisis or conflict that does erupt in any disputed region will stem from a complex and overlapping mixture of intense threat perceptions, rivalry, competition for influence and dominance, and other structural drivers. 
32
This chapter has provided an overview of some of the fundamental features of China's political and strategy development process. Familiarity with the notion of trend analysis and the key trends highlighted by Chinese officials as especially important, the general framework for development, and the end state of the China Dream supplies foundational knowledge that informs any effort to articulate a Chinese strategy for competition. However, since this analysis focuses on foreign policy and defense strategy, a basic understanding of the government's approach to these topics provides essential context for constructing a Chinese competitive strategy in those domains. We turn to the first of these specialized topics, foreign policy, in the next chapter. 
This chapter summarizes China's international strategy to realize the China Dream. The international strategy provides essential background, as well as the basic structure within which the foreign policy dimension of any posited strategy for U.S. competition is likely to be nested. Drawing from authoritative documents and Chinese scholarly writings, we briefly review the CCP's framework for foreign relations before summarizing an international end state to accompany the China Dream. The chapter will then list some of the key directives for China's international strategy aimed at guiding foreign policy work to achieve this end state over the next decade or more.
Like the "general framework" that organizes the major strategic tasks for national development, the CCP central leadership has set a "general framework for foreign relations" (waijiao zongti buju) to organize foreign policy-related major tasks and policy objectives. The general framework for foreign policy is derived from a construct employed by Mao Zedong, who grouped countries according to whether they belonged to the first world (capitalist), second world (communist), and third world (all others). Deng Xiaoping refined this structure in less ideological terms by invoking major powers to take the place of first world, proposing the periphery or neighboring countries as a second category and dropping the second world, and refining the third world to developing countries. In subsequent years, CCP leaders added multilateral organizations and global governance, alternatively called domains (lingyu), to the schema. The CCP continues to adhere to this framework to organize its foreign policy directives, as can be seen in most any foreign policy-related speech or document. As with the "general framework," this framework provides Chinese diplomats and foreign policy officials with an easy-to-identify and consistent format for efficiently communicating directives (Table

Major powers [daguo]. This category of countries includes the wealthiest, most-powerful countries in the world. Countries in this category include the United States, those in the European Union, and Russia. Although daguo is often translated as great power, the Chinese meaning is different from the traditional Western understanding of great power. In traditional Western international relations theory, a great power is a sovereign state with the power and ability to profoundly influence and shape the global economic and political order.

Global governance/domains [quanqiu zhili/lingyu]. A category that Chinese documents employ inconsistently, this includes such global domains as international media, space, cyber, and global finance. It is mentioned in the 19th Party Congress report, which stated that China "will take an active part in reforming and developing the global governance system." 
10
The CCP's primary focus for the China Dream centers on domestic conditions, the true linchpin of the party's legitimacy. However, China's deepening integration into the global economy has increasingly blurred the line between domestic and foreign policy. China's ability to realize its domestic policy agenda, in many cases, depends in part on its international agenda. As one example, Chinese leaders have designated the BRI as a major foreign policy initiative, but they also regard it as an important element of domestic policy because of its potential to expand markets for Chinese construction and export industries.
Similarly, Chinese leaders have linked the domestic end state of a China Dream with that of a World Dream.
11

We begin by positing that China seeks a form of primacy at the level of the Asia-Pacific, but that it also seeks a form of leadership at the global level as well. The notion that China seeks primacy at the Asia-Pacific level stirred controversy years ago when experts debated the possibility of Chinese and U.S. competition in the region. 17 However, the notion is no longer seriously disputed after Chinese leaders made clear their intent to lead the region's economic integration and to take a more active role in leading security for the region as well. 
18
19
20
A second point to note concerns the concept of global leadership. This term is not immediately obvious in meaning. There are many possible interpretations of what global leadership might entail. Chinese leaders consistently criticize the notion that Beijing seeks global hegemony, which they seem to interpret as a sort of global dominance in which Beijing directly administers affairs in all or most parts of the world. This interpretation may resemble, in exaggerated form, a type of domination and control similar to that practiced by past European imperial powers. Such an argument may be a bit of a strawman because hegemony exercised in these terms would be beyond the capability of any country, including the United States. A Chinese effort to assert global dominance with a high degree of administrative control could also lead to war with the United States and many other coun-tries in any case, an unappetizing prospect that Beijing understandably appears keen to avoid. But Chinese officials may also mean that they renounce any ambition to replicate a U.S. style of global leadership. The United States exercises considerable influence around the world, in part through a worldwide network of alliances and partnerships. The United States maintains hundreds of military bases in over 70 countries and exercises considerable diplomatic influence around the world. Given its lack of alliances, competing domestic demands for spending, and slowing economy, China simply lacks the capability to replicate a U.S.-style leadership. 
21
But these are not the only options. It is possible to imagine alternative forms of global leadership featuring a much lower degree of direct control than either the United States or past colonial powers exercised. Global leadership could take the form of a "first among equals" partnership between major powers that oversee a sort of spheres-of-influence arrangement. The leadership could take the form of a country's predominant influence in setting international norms, rules, and values, owing to its leadership of a larger and more globally distributed network of client states than that of rivals and a preponderance of comprehensive national power. Such a large network of client states could provide the informal basis for exercising true global leadership, as demonstrated by the ability of the global leader to respond to international crises and coordinate global efforts to address shared problems. Leadership in formal global and regional multilateral organizations could complement the influence gained from a global network of supporters. The international order under such a global leader might look considerably different from the way it appeared in the era of U.S. primacy. For example, networks of client states of one leading major power might overlap geographically with those of another major power, resulting in a malleable and porous arrangement that dilutes considerably the boundaries of the spheres of influence. Such a form of leadership might appear considerably weaker and less orderly than that of the United States in the post-Cold War era. Even so, it could prove adequate to the needs of the global community, especially if alternatives appeared lacking.
Moreover, there are four reasons why China might seek some form of global leadership of the type just described. First, statements by Chinese leaders suggest a strong interest in exercising international leadership in a manner consistent with such a description. In addition to the many documents outlining ambitions to shape global rules and norms, the 19th Party Congress report stated that China should "become a global leader in terms of composite national strength and international influence."
22
23
Second, China's requirements for sustained economic growth, security, and influence as a major power provide a powerful incentive to seek global leadership. The CCP's ambition to achieve the China Dream ultimately depends, to a large extent, on its ability to sustain a healthy gross domestic product growth rate. Global leadership would greatly aid that task by enabling China to gain a disproportionate share of global growth by shaping international rules, norms, and institu-tions in a manner that privileges Chinese companies and industries. Politically, global leadership would also provide the CCP greater security because it would presumably entail a large network of supporting client states upon which Beijing could draw to help protect China's interests around the world and support its leadership of global norms, rules, and institutions. The CCP could also gain security by renovating the international order to become more compatible with the party's values and idiosyncrasies. And the more influence China exercises on the global level, the more confidently it can maintain a position of primacy in Asia. Similar such incentives have spurred past rising powers to seek the prize of global leadership, and there is no reason that China might not find them attractive as well.
Third, the end state is over three decades away, which provides ample time for China to contemplate such a path. Even if Chinese leaders sincerely reject any aspiration to global leadership today-despite evidence in their own documents to the contrary-there is ample time to reconsider that ambition. In the meantime, it would be in the best interest of the United States to think through how best to shore up its international position and prepare for a possibility, however remote, that could carry profound consequences for its own prosperity and security.
And fourth, the political science literature on hegemonic stability and international politics has provided a theoretical explanation of why China might pursue such an outcome. These writings underscore the considerable economic and strategic benefits that accord to any nation that reaches a position of global leadership. 
24
25
26
For these reasons, this report proposes that China seeks global leadership, but of a form that is considerably different from than that exercised by the United States. In this vision, China maintains a porous form of primacy in the Indo-Pacific, in which it coexists uneasily with major powers Japan, the United States, and India. In this theater, China is regarded by all nations as the single most important power and exercises considerable influence through a network of partner and client states, primarily among developing countries in Central, South, and Southeast Asia. Outside Asia, China serves more as the central interlocutor among major powers that, in turn, oversee a set of somewhat permeable spheres of influence. The vision of a "partial, loose, and malleable hegemony" offered by French scholar Nadège Rolland provides a good starting point for imagining how this end state might look. She explained that this vision of hegemony is "partial because the vision seems to imply the existence of a sphere of influence, as opposed to an ambition to 'rule the world.'" Rolland added, Left unclear is the size and extent of the sphere of influence on which China would exert its power. This order is loose because the vision does not seem to imply direct or absolute control over foreign territories or governments. And it is malleable because the countries included under China's hegemony do not seem to be strictly defined along geographic, cultural, or ideological lines. Immediate neighbors and far-flung countries, Asian and non-Asian powers, and democracies and autocracies could all be included, as long as they recognize and respect the primacy of Beijing's authority and interests. 27 Table

Major powers China is the global leader with the largest network of client states and predominant international influence; major powers maintain stable, cooperative ties with China under a permeable spheres-of-influence-type arrangement.
Major powers manage their differences according to norms established by China, but all respect the primacy of China's interests and authority worldwide.
China has become the predominant economic, political, and security power in the Indo-Pacific while coexisting with major powers, such as Japan and India. China leads a network of client states based primarily among developing countries in South, Southeast, and Central Asia.
China has developed a political and security constituency of developing countries around the world, based mainly along the BRI routes in Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa. Most of the developing world is integrated into BRI-related trade, investment, and infrastructure architecture led by China. China maintains clients, primarily along the BRI routes and into Latin America, that help protect Chinese interests and promote its authority.
The United Nations remains a key institution, but it has been renovated to uphold principles, norms, and values favored by China; established and newer Chinese-led regional and global multilateral relationships generally reflect Beijing's preferred norms, values, and clients.
Chinese discourse is dominant in Asia and widely understood globally; Chinese norms, values, and preferences are predominant in the global management of space, cyber, law, and maritime domains. China acts as a provider of global goods, principally in collaboration with its clients.
end state, China is the most indispensable global power, but its influence is most clearly felt in Asia. In other parts of the world, China may generally defer to other major powers that, in turn, coordinate policy with Beijing through institutionalized relationships reminiscent of a spheres-of-influence-type arrangement-but mediated through norms led by China. However, even in other parts of the world, China has client states and would accordingly expect relevant major powers to respect Beijing's relationship with those countries. As previously noted, authorities have proposed a community of common destiny, sometimes translated as "global community of shared future," which may be interpreted as a vision of such an end state. The community features a renovated international order in which countries interact with one another in accordance with norms and principles upheld by China. 
28
Such an end state follows the logic of a multipolar arrangement upheld by Chinese thinkers, albeit one in which China plays a leading role. Here, the United States maintains primacy in the Americas as one of several poles, with China as the most important broker. The European Union and the United States maintain a friendly relationship, but the tight alliance bonds have attenuated considerably. Meanwhile, China has developed close relations with Russia as one of its most important clients. The multipolar arrangement featuring China in a leadership role becomes more plausible if U.S. power has weakened to the point that it has little choice but to go along with the new arrangement.
In terms of the periphery, China, in this end state, has become the clear leader of the Asia-Pacific. In the developing world, China maintains an extensive network of client states, which, by midcentury, could include the largest and most important economies in the world. The relationship goes well beyond economics, although trade, investment, and infrastructure projects lie at the heart of China's client network. The BRI provides the principal mechanism by which China organizes its clients through associated economic, political, and security institutions.

As posited by this report, the international end state is thus the global situation that would best facilitate Beijing's realization of the China Dream. In this end state, Chinese power is demonstrated in part by a large network of client states, integrated into a BRI-based economic, political, and security collaboration that backs Chinese leadership.
To achieve an international end state to support the China Dream, the central leadership has outlined a series of foreign policy directives. No timeline has been provided in publicly available documents, but the objectives appear sufficiently broad that they could arguably remain in place for the next 15 years. The foreign policy directives provide important context for China's competitive strategy with the United States for two reasons. First, because the international strategy aims to directly serve the goal of national rejuvenation, any competitive strategy with the United States should nest under the broader strategy. Second, to maintain CCP authority and legitimacy as the political party uniquely capable of realizing the China Dream, officials have a compelling incentive to regard the strategy for successful competition with the United States as one that must accord within, or at least not contradict, the international strategy to achieve the China Dream. There may, no doubt, be classified policies and elaborations of the strategy to deal with the United States, but a broad conformity between the competitive strategy for the United States and the broader international strategy, as articulated by senior leaders, would best serve the party's needs for both attaining its strategic goals and reinforcing its political legitimacy.
The CCP has discussed the basic features of its international strategy in authoritative documents, some of the most important of which include the 19th Party Congress report, President Xi's directives issued at the 2017 Diplomacy Central Work Conference, and the 2019 foreign policy white paper on "China and the World in the New Era." The international strategy aims to guide the formulation and implementation of foreign policy for the near future and will be taken as basic guidance through 2035. Because the foreign policy white paper provides the most detailed description, it will be used as the principal source.
As presented in Table 
3
The first two directives carry clear implications for China's foreign policy work with major powers, the periphery, and the developing world. As explained in the white paper, the pursuit of "mutually beneficial cooperation and common development" refers to the idea of countries around the world deepening economic relations with China. 32 Among initiatives, it refers to the BRI's efforts to strengthen the integration of Eurasia, the Middle East, Africa, and parts of Latin America with the Chinese economy. It also involves policies designed to build political goodwill in the developing world, such as support for UN-led poverty reduction efforts. The second directive, "uphold and advance eco-nomic globalization," as explained in the white paper, calls for efforts to "oppose protectionism," expand trade zones, and promote renminbi internationalization. The 19th Party Congress report also adds requirements to "promote trade and investment." This requirement is also informed by the thinking about developing China as a "strong trading power" and may be read as a directive to bolster the country's leader- ship role in the global economy, in part by deepening the integration of countries along the BRI routes into China's economy.

Greater Chinese international leadership depends, in part, on the expansion of a supportive network of nations that support Chinese policies and preferences.

One study of the China-Cambodia relationship, for example, concluded that a Chinese model for patron-client ties might well prove "less intrusive but also less rewarding diplomatically and strategically than the U.S. model."

42
The directives to "support multilateralism" and "uphold international justice and equity" are interrelated and refer to a longstanding demand by Chinese leaders that the international order be renovated to more fairly represent Chinese power and preferences. Xi has stated that China should carry out policies that reflect "justice and equity" to win the support of the developing world and change the norms, values, and rules of multilateral institutions to reflect those values. Authorities also continue to regard the UN as a key institution, even as they advocate the renovation of the existing order to better reflect Chinese preferences and interests. 
43
Finally, the directive to step up China's role in global governance reflects Beijing's judgment that the country is uniquely positioned to increase its leadership role to compensate, in part, for a decline in the capacity of Western powers. In a 2019 meeting, Xi proposed the strengthening of the UN, a revising of governance rules, extensive consultations, and other measures to address the "global governance deficit." 
44
The overarching international strategy provides the basic lines of effort under which the competitive strategy with the United States is subsumed. Each of these lines of effort carries important implications for China's relationship with the United States, which will be discussed in Chapter Six.
In this chapter, we briefly review China's defense strategy to realize the China Dream. As with the preceding chapter, the material presented provides essential context, as well as the basic framework within which the defense aspect of China's strategy for U.S. competition should be nested. It will follow the pattern of the preceding chapter in describing the framework for defense strategies, desired end state, and key directives.
A national defense strategy is a government's authoritative guidance that defines defense-related strategic objectives and directs the ways and means to achieve those objectives. In the U.S. government, the strategy is produced by the civilian leadership of the defense department.

National security strategy. China's national security strategy exists as a subset and important part of its national strategy. The 2011 version of the PLA dictionary defines the national security strategy as the set of guiding principles and tactics that "guide actions to ensure comprehensive security for the nation's survival and development."

The military's assessment of the threats to China's security and development ultimately derives from the central leadership's overall assessment of strategic trends and threats to the CCP's agenda. The threat assessment provides an analytic foundation for much of the defense strategy. Following the broader trend analysis discussed in Chapter Two, authorities regard the security environment as generally favorable, but one that features persistent security threats and challenges. The 2019 defense white paper observed that China "continues to enjoy political stability, ethnic unity, and social stability." At the same time, the white paper highlighted persistent threats from Taiwan "separatist forces," which it characterized as the "gravest immediate threat to peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait." It also criticized unnamed "external separatist forces" for "Tibet independence" and in Xinjiang as "threats to China's national security and social stability." It also noted the persistence of disputes over land territorial boundaries and "maritime demarcation." However, threats that the PLA must address go beyond Taiwan and territorial issues. The white paper also noted "immediate threats" to overseas interests, including "international and regional turmoil, terrorism, and piracy," as well as "threats to outer space and cyber security." In addition, the paper warned of an "intensifying global military competition" in which the PLA "still lags far behind the world's leading militaries." 
11
12
As with its development and foreign policy work, the central leadership issues guidance to the military in the form of standard frameworks or templates. The basic framework for defense strategy consists of three main parts: (1) strategic missions, (2) force development, and (3) force employment. The most recent iteration of these frameworks can be seen in such authoritative documents as the 19th Party Congress report and the 2019 defense white paper.

As an instrument of national power, the military primarily serves the goals of domestic and foreign policy. Policy objectives regarding flashpoints, such as Taiwan, disputed islands, and other securities, rest in the domain of domestic or foreign policy, not the military. For objectives that overlap with both military and domestic and/or foreign policy, the central leadership is responsible for achieving the domestic or foreign policy end state. Relatedly, the decision of how to resolve hot-spot issues, such as Taiwan's status or that of disputed maritime territories, is, strictly speaking, a political question that lies outside the purview of military leaders, although they may advise on relevant military options. Military leaders, by contrast, are responsible for setting goals for military modernization and supporting the national leadership in executing strategies to achieve national goals. For this reason, we defined the end state for the military's strategic missions in terms of whether it is capable of and ready to carry out any and all missions assigned by the central leadership (Table 
4
In terms of force development, the 19th Party Congress report stated that by midcentury, China intends to build a "world class military." Given that the PLA is already one of the world's most powerful militaries, this wording may be interpreted to mean that China intends to build a military equal or perhaps superior to that of the United States

in some ways. However, this does not mean that China intends to build a force that surpasses the United States as a globally distributed military.

Chinese leaders have directed the military to support the focus on national revitalization for the next few decades. For purposes of this study, we will assume that the directives outlined in official documents in the past few years will persist, with minor variation, through 2035. In addition to traditional responsibilities regarding deterrence and preparation for hot-spot contingencies, recent documents emphasize the importance of building a "favorable strategic posture" and the need to "guarantee the country's peaceful development," in the words of the 2015 military strategy white paper. 
22
The recent adoption of an overall or holistic security concept suggests a blurring between the lines of traditional military affairs and broader issues of diplomacy, economics, and technology. According to the 2019 defense white paper, the expanded concept combines domestic and international security; security for the homeland with security for overseas citizens, enterprises, and other interests; and interests related to the nation's survival with those needed for its development. Security now encompasses 11 fields, including not only the political, economic, and military spheres but also territorial, cultural, social, scientific and technological, informational, ecological, financial, and nuclear domains. 
23
This changing view of security has somewhat blurred the lines between civilian and military tasks and actors. To support these broader security requirements, the military must carry out both war and nonwar missions. As the military steps up its involvement in nonwar activities, nonmilitary assets have become more involved in actions formerly reserved for the military. This can be seen in the maritime domain, where the Chinese Coast Guard was created from disparate maritime agencies in 2014, in part to defend Chinese maritime territory, and has now become militarized. 
25
26
The intensifying competition between China and the United States raises the risk of a crisis or even a clash. This, in turn, provides a compelling incentive for Chinese leaders to develop policies and mechanisms to control and manage any crisis. In 2013, Xi Jinping urged the United States to adopt a "new type of major power relationship" premised largely on U.S. strategic concessions as a way to reduce the risk of conflict.

The central leadership has refined the PLA's missions and responsibilities to focus on strategic support to the whole of government efforts to shape an international environment that favors China's rise as the premier power in Asia and, eventually, as the global leader (Table

The revised missions are to 1. "provide strategic support for consolidating the leadership position of the CCP and the socialist system." The article warned that "Western forces" have "stepped up efforts to Westernize and divide China" and "subvert and destroy the CCP." It called on the PLA to carry out duties to ensure CCP rule, presumably by deterring Western countries from carrying out cyber and other operations to erode CCP legitimacy. 2. "provide strategic support for the safeguarding of national sovereignty, unity, and territorial integrity." The PLA ensures the security of borders, coasts, air defense, maritime rights, and national unity. The article highlighted the importance of collaboration to shape the security environment, stating that the mission requires the PLA to "shape a peaceful, secure environment." The article also explained that the change reflected an interest in finding ways to manage and effectively control crisis situations and flashpoints so that they do not escalate into major conflict. It stated that the revised directive calls on the PLA to "prevent crisis, resolve confrontations, and deter conflict." The same mission reaffirms the importance for traditional missions to deter and prevail in conflict. As the article explained, the PLA must be able to "control and win wars as necessary." 3. "provide a strategic support to protecting China's overseas interests." The PLA "keeps up with the expansion of the country's overseas interests" and improves its ability to carry out "diversified tasks" to protect overseas personnel, resources, shipping lanes, and interests. 4. "provide strategic support for promoting world peace and development." Acknowledging the intensifying competition with the United States at the regional and global level, the PLA Daily article noted a "sharp and complex dispute" over "dominance of the regional order" and over international "rules" and "development paths." It called on the PLA to "strengthen bilateral and multilateral strategic consultations and dialogues" with countries around the world, to "promote multi-level development of military exchanges," and "actively participate" in a variety nonwar missions to "maintain regional stability and world peace."

The 19th Party Congress report directed the military to modernize in a manner that incorporates more information technology. It stated, for example, that officials should "intensify efforts to accomplish the dual historic tasks of military mechanization and full informatization, striving to basically complete military mechanization and make major progress in full military informatization." It stated that military modernization should focus on enabling the military to fight "localized wars under conditions of informatization." Chinese sources have already discussed a further evolution in the nature of informatization in the direction of a greater use of artificial intelligence. Some sources use the term intelligentization to describe an anticipated transformation in the way of war. The 2019 defense white paper stated that "there are indications intelligentized warfare is emerging." PLA writings explain that the future form of war is likely to involve a greater reliance on unmanned systems, autonomous decisionmaking, and artificial intelligence. 
35
36
The central leadership has directed the military to maintain the principles of active defense, in which the country remains strategically defensive but maintains operational flexibility. At the same time, authoritative documents emphasize the proactive use of military power to support the party's international strategies and shape a favorable security environment. According to the 2019 defense white paper, the mili-tary upholds the longstanding military strategic guidelines of active defense. For the "new era," the PLA will "strive to keep in alignment with and contribute to the general strategies of the CCP." The military will also "place emphasis on both containing and winning wars."

39
The U.S. government has identified the current era as one of "competition" and has labeled China as one of the United States' primary competitors. 
1
Chinese officials, scholars, and commentators generally agree that competition with the United States has become unavoidable owing to broad structural trends, particularly changes in the distribution of global power and the evolving structure of China's economy. Beijing's pursuit of regional primacy and global leadership also appears to be driven by the conviction that U.S. leadership threatens Chinese interests, that it is increasingly ineffective, and that it unfairly privileges the United States and the West over the needs of the rising non-West.
Officials and commentators perceive an intensifying competition for influence and leadership, primarily at the Asia-Pacific regional level but at the global level as well. In general, Chinese officials and commentators emphasize the diplomatic, economic, and technological dimensions as the most decisive domains in the competition. By con-trast, they tend to view the military as playing more limited but important roles in deterrence, crisis management, and supporting diplomatic efforts to build influence. However, despite the pursuit of robust military modernization and heightened tension over a proliferating array of issues, Chinese analysts describe the competition as one with a generally low risk of war because of the primarily economic nature of the competition and a disinclination in both capitals to risk war with the other.
Authoritative strategy and policy documents regularly depict the era as one featuring international competition. The same documents acknowledge the United States as a primary competitor, and official documents tend to criticize the United States for aggravating tensions in recent years. Defense white papers since at least 2002 have mentioned "intense competition" between the major powers. For example, the 2002 defense white paper version stated "competition in comprehensive national strength has become increasingly fierce," a point that has been regularly made in subsequent defense white papers.

Chinese leaders argue that U.S. international leadership harms China's interests by fomenting disputes and encouraging Taiwan and other countries in Asia to defy Beijing in territorial disputes. In Fu Ying's phrasing, Washington "meddles in the problems China has with its neighbors."

The structural drivers and specific criticisms of U.S. international leadership in Chinese sources directly inform how Chinese officials and analysts regard competition with the United States. A survey of authoritative and scholarly writings shows a focus on the diplomatic and economic dimensions of the competition at both the regional and global levels. However, officials also acknowledge a growing security competition, especially at the regional level. The desire to restructure Asia's political economy to better accord with the changing balance of global power and serve China's needs as a strong trading power underpins the intensifying competition for influence in Asia, as well as at the global level. Chinese officials have argued that changes to the political and security order are necessary to accommodate the changing economic reality of Chinese power. In explaining China's proposal for a new security architecture for Asia ostensibly led by China rather than the United States, for example, Xi Jinping stated in 2014 that "development is the foundation of security, and security is the necessary condition for development."

Despite the harsh criticisms, Chinese scholars generally regard the competition as having a low risk of war. A common theme in Chinese academic writings is the search for new terms and labels to describe a competition with the United States that they regard as distinctly different from the more dangerous variants typified by the early Cold War. Most Chinese scholars dismiss analogies with the competition between the United States and the Soviet Union. The experts point out that, unlike the Soviet Union, China participates in many of the same international institutions and mechanisms as the United States. They also note the far higher degree of economic integration between the United States and China than was the case between the United States and the Soviet Union. A typical scholarly analysis noted the relatively "low level" of "ideological competition" and the "shared major concerns" of climate change, nuclear proliferation, and other nontraditional threats that helped moderate the U.S.-China competition.

In sum, Chinese officials, scholars, and commentators regard an intensifying competition with the United States as unavoidable, owing to its origins in largely structural developments, most notably the changing balance of power between the West and non-West and pressures stemming from the changing development needs of China's economy. In particular, China's effort to restructure Asia's political and security order to better accord with a regional economy increasingly centered in Asia underpins the intensifying competition for influence and leadership in that region. Moreover, China's pursuit of greater influence over the global economic order has also fueled its pursuit of greater influence over the international political order. A competition for supporting and partner countries both reflects and has exacerbated the competition at the regional and global levels as well.
Despite consensus on the reality of an intensifying competition, and despite sharp criticism of U.S. international leadership, Chinese experts generally assess a low possibility of war. The principal factors cited for this belief include the restraining influences of economic interdependence, the involvement by both countries in a shared international order, a low level of hostility, and a belief that the irritants in the bilateral relationship are not severe enough to warrant the risks and hazards of great-power war. The commonly encountered recommendations by Chinese officials and commentators to establish various government-to-government mechanisms to stabilize the bilateral relationship and manage their differences are informed by such convictions. These views seem to imply that if push comes to shove, the United States will choose to peacefully accept its supersession by China rather than risk great-power war. This possibility also provides Beijing a compelling incentive to develop competitive strategies and policies that leave U.S. decisionmakers without a viable alternative to accepting such an outcome.
The preceding chapters provide important background for our analysis. To recap, our posited Chinese strategy for U.S. competition should proceed from the same general process that characterizes the CCP's approach to developing strategy and policy. It should respond, for example, to the same sorts of trends and countertrends identified by CCP thinkers and serve the same overarching goal of realizing the China Dream. The international dimension of a competitive strategy should nest within, or at least not contradict, the CCP's broader international strategy, and the defense component of the same strategy for U.S. competition should similarly be compatible with the broader defense strategy. In our survey of authoritative documents and Chinese commentary, we noted that officials regard competition as inevitable and fundamentally driven by long-term historical trends and the increasing importance of international influence for economic growth. We also noted common Chinese criticisms that suggested U.S. hegemony has outlived its usefulness and that China's prospects depend, in part, on its ability to exercise greater international leadership. This contextual information provides the intellectual material from which we will construct a Chinese strategy for U.S. competition.
A first step in articulating the competitive strategy is to define the end state, or the condition of successful competition, from the Chinese perspective. This end state provides the aim point for subsequent international and defense competitive strategies. In this chapter, we define the "victory" conditions for Chinese competition with the United States and consider end states for the foreign policy and defense aspects of the competition. For each of the end states, we present ideal outcomes from Beijing's perspective. Achievement of the end states provides the best hopes for achieving an international and security situation supportive of the China Dream. Failure to realize these end states diminishes prospects for national revitalization, although they do not discount them entirely. This provides a strong incentive for Beijing to organize and carry out relevant policies. It may also incentivize more risk-taking behavior if prospects for achieving the international and defense strategy end states begin to dim.
We have tried to keep assumptions to a minimum, but three deserve mention. First, the trends outlined in Chapter Two remain in place. These broad trends provide the intellectual foundation for the strategies and goals presented in the preceding chapters, and these, in turn, also inform the construction of an end state for U.S. competition. In particular, the continued relative decline in U.S. power and growth in Chinese power would make the prospect of China surpassing America plausible to Chinese decisionmakers. Similarly, the belief that competition will continue to intensify but that the general trends favor peace and development provides a strong incentive to develop competitive strategies that avoid war if at all possible.
A second, related assumption is that China and the United States tacitly agree to carry out the competition without resort to war. Given the inventories of nuclear weapons possessed by both countries and the industrial capabilities at their disposal, a decision to resolve the competition through war would be nothing short of catastrophic. 
1
A third assumption is that China has made reasonable progress on the domestic goals that make up the heart of the China Dream, especially those related to economic growth. Analysis of China's domestic agenda lies beyond the scope of this research, but its importance deserves emphasis. Progress toward its domestic agenda would leave Beijing in a much stronger position to contend with the United States. Progress also provides Beijing a compelling incentive to pursue a strategy that has as its goal the overtaking of the United States as a global leader. Conversely, a failure to realize the domestic agenda would leave China too weak to have any hope of surpassing the United States. In such a case, Beijing may find competition futile and instead find itself compelled to formulate a different national vision.
The first end state centers on the standing of China and the United States relative to each other. Currently, by virtually any metric, the United States is the superior power-a point Chinese analysts concede. The United States has the larger and more productive economy, a more powerful military, a higher level of technological innovation, and far greater international influence. 
2
3
In terms of influence and leadership, the end state envisions a Beijing that has successfully assumed a position of primacy at the Asia-Pacific level and achieved a greater degree of international leadership and influence than the United States. However, this does not mean that the two countries simply swap positions. Rather, China's ascent to regional primacy and global leadership would likely look very different from the historical U.S. approach. The 2019 foreign policy white paper offered a glimpse of China's vision of international leadership when it stated that major countries should fulfill their responsibilities "commensurate with their status." It explained that the "international status" of a country is "measured by its openness of mind, breadth of vision, and sense of responsibility rather than its size, strength or power." This formulation suggests that a country with inferior strength, such as China, deserves more responsibility than more-powerful but ostensibly irresponsible countries, such as the United States. Sharpening the contrast between China's ambitions and a thinly disguised criticism of U.S. leadership, the paper continued, "Major countries should direct their primary efforts to the future of humanity and assume greater responsibilities for world peace and development, rather than wielding their power to seek hegemony in international and regional affairs."

(3) the United States largely refrains from harming Chinese interests; (4) China has established primacy across much of Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa, principally through collaboration with a network of client states; (5) U.S. primacy has been reduced to the Americas, although it may still maintain a military, economic, and diplomatic presence worldwide; (6) the United States and China manage their differences according to norms upheld by China; and (7) the two cooperate on shared concerns on terms defined largely by the Chinese. These "victory" conditions are summarized in Table

U.S. and China avoid war. Aware of the potential catastrophe that could ensue, China has stated that it seeks to avoid war with the United States if possible. Chinese officials consistently disparage the idea of a Thucydides trap, in which the rising and status quo powers fight to determine the next system leader. Expressing a standard position of the government, Wang Yi rejected the notion that the two countries would fall into such a trap.

Another possibility is that the United States could be "dragged" into a war between China and a U.S. ally or partner, such as Taiwan or Japan. Whether China might be willing to risk major war with a U.S. ally would depend, in large part, on Beijing's assessment about the overall inevitability of conflict with the United States and the risks of escalation. It is theoretically possible for Beijing to engage in conflict with a neighbor-without intending to fight the United States-only to find that the situation escalates into a broader war. However, the idea that Beijing would wage war with a U.S. ally or partner without preparing for the possibility of U.S. intervention is implausible. Chinese military writings show a strong awareness of the risks of U.S. involvement in any conflict with an ally, and official opposition to U.S. alliances is informed, in part, by anxiety over the possibility of escalation to war with the United States. 
10
10
U.S. respects China's authority as global leader. In this end state, the United States adopts a deferential position regarding Chinese leadership globally. This does not mean that Washington must enthusiastically back Beijing as a system leader. It may be the case that the United States chafes at Chinese leadership or that the United States withdraws from most global institutions, perhaps in protest of Chinese influence in those venues. However, in either case, the United States recognizes the reality of its substantially weakened position and behaves in a manner that is consistent with a de facto acceptance of a position of inferiority. In practical terms, this could mean that the United States participates in global trade and investment according to rules, norms, and standards set by China, that it would modify its alliances and security policies to avoid threatening Chinese interests in Asia and elsewhere, and that it would manage differences with other countries primarily through dialogue and negotiation in a manner that generally avoids antagonizing Beijing. The 2019 foreign policy white paper provides a vision of international order that appears very much like a desired situation featuring Chinese leadership and U.S. deference. The paper stated the United States should "adapt to the development and prosperity of other countries and live in harmony with the rest of the world," which may be interpreted to mean that the United States should accommodate itself to the reality of Chinese power. It added, almost as a prescription to the United States, that this was the "principle major countries should always follow." 
11
12
China has established primacy across much of Eurasia, the Middle East, and Africa. As scholars have noted, past global leaders, such as the United States and Great Britain, based their supremacy on primacy in certain geographic regions. 
13
14
U.S. primacy narrowed to the Americas. Chinese leaders reject the idea of global hegemony, by which they mean, in part, the implausible idea of exercising direct administrative control over distant parts of the world. The concept of major power relations proposed by China as a way to better organize international relations includes the idea that major powers maintain a sort of sphere of influence, although Chinese officials reject a term loaded with such historical baggage. In this end state, U.S. primacy has been reduced to the Americas. Although the United States may retain a military, commercial, and diplomatic presence in Europe, Africa, the Asia-Pacific, and elsewhere, it would lack the ability to decisively shape events in those regions. Moreover, China advocates the idea that partnerships between great and smaller powers need not be geographically confined. This means China may have substantial interests in the Americas, which the United States would be expected to respect. Similarly, China would likely offer to avoid actions that endanger the lives of American citizens and their assets along BRI routes, although this would not preclude policies that disadvantage the United States. As an example, China might not demand that countries in the Asia-Pacific end their commitments with the United States. Rather, Beijing could insist that the alliances be weakened to the point that they no longer pose a threat to China, perhaps by insisting that U.S. allies establish security partnerships with China of comparable importance to those with the United States.
The United States and China resolve differences in accordance with Chinese norms. Chinese officials and analysts regard differences and disputes as to be expected between two great powers. However, as described in explanations of new-type major power relations upheld by Chinese officials as a template for major-power interactions, all differences and disputes should be handled via consultations and dialogues in accordance with Chinese norms. This might entail dialogues and summits or meetings in multilateral organizations, the spirit of national Herald Leader [国际先驱导报], April 7, 2015.
which would be governed by norms such as those embodied in the five principles of peaceful coexistence, which Chinese officials have upheld as guides for diplomacy. The principles call for a mode of interaction characterized by mutual nonaggression, mutual noninterference in the internal affairs of one another, and a commitment to peaceful methods of resolving disagreements.

The second end state concerns the international dimension of the Chinese competition with the United States (Table 
6
In terms of the periphery, the end state depicts China as the paramount power. China has become the most important economic, political, cultural, and technological partner across the Asia-Pacific. It maintains a strong network of client states in Central and Southeast Asia, as well as some countries in South Asia. China has set the standards, rules, and norms by which much of the global economy operates. The United States, by contrast, defers to China on its core interests related to Taiwan, the East and South China Seas, and in relation to BRI projects. The U.S. government has modified its policies to minimize criticism of China's domestic governance and politics. The United States participates in the economic and political life of the region on terms acceptable to China. U.S. alliances and partnerships, for example, may persist in name but no longer pose much of a threat to China.
Across the developing world, countries prioritize relations with China those with the United States, especially along the BRI routes. China maintains influence throughout Africa, the Middle East, and parts of Latin America through a network of client states nominally tied to the BRI. Most of the developing world favors, accordingly, Chinese terms for trade and investment over those preferred by the United States. China's discourse, values, and culture remain more influential and popular in these countries than those of the United States.
In both global venues and a variety of regional multilateral venues in Africa and Eurasia, China exerts more influence over the most important institutions than the United States. Chinese leaders have prevailed in setting norms, rules, and standards in international venues to favor Chinese companies, ensure that China gains a major share of economic growth, and privilege Chinese interests over those of the United States. Despite the reality of persistent friction and competi-tion, China's preferred end state also envisions cooperation with the United States in multilateral settings, principally those led by China, against shared threats, such as transnational terror, pandemics, natural disasters, and the effects of climate change.
The end state also envisions China playing a leading role in global governance. While enjoying primacy in the Asia-Pacific, China's leadership role outside that region consists primarily in being a coordinator and facilitator for other regional leaders and their partners to resolve problems and manage global affairs. In global domains, such as cyberspace, space, and international law, Chinese preferences prevail over those of the United States. China's view of maritime navigation, for example, has become the accepted international law. Similarly, China has succeeded in redefining human rights and democracy as relative values appropriate perhaps for Western countries but not the rest of the world.
China's end states for the defense-related aspect of its competition with the United States center primarily on the quality of its military and the contribution of the military to foreign policy. There is no evidence that China intends to initiate military aggression against the U.S. military to achieve its broader domestic and foreign policy objectives. Nor is there any incentive for China to do so, given the risks of war. Table 
6
The defense policy end state for China's competition with the United States consists primarily of a PLA that has achieved superiority in the Asia-Pacific as well, but not necessarily beyond that region. The end state also envisions deterrence of the United States across a variety of issues and core interests. In terms of the core interests of CCP rule and the socialist political system, the PLA and security services have successfully deterred the United States from cyber, information ops, and other challenges to CCP rule. The United States is also deterred from interfering in China's internal affairs through secret efforts to foment unrest and opposition to CCP rule. China's cyber capability is equal to or superior to that of the United States.
For the core interests of sovereignty, territory, and national unity, the PLA has become strong enough that it has successfully deterred the United States from intervening in any contingency along China's periphery. The credibility of U.S. military power in Asia has also been so seriously weakened that the PLA feels it can coerce and, if necessary, fight regional powers with little fear of a U.S. military response. In terms of overseas interests, the United States has acquiesced to an expanded Chinese presence around the Indian Ocean and in Africa.
It may monitor PLA activity in relevant bases and facilities but makes no effort to disturb them. The PLA cooperates with the United States occasionally to defeat transnational threats that imperil both U.S. and Chinese individuals and assets. An example might be cooperation to control maritime piracy or combat radical groups in unstable parts of Africa or the Middle East.
For the mission to "promote world peace and common development," an end state might be one in which countries along the BRI route prioritize security partnerships with China over those with the United States. In the Asia-Pacific, China has become the regional security leader through leadership in multilateral initiatives such as the SCO, CICA, and others. Chinese military leaders might also collaborate occasionally with Western European countries to combat transnational threats. Beyond Eurasia, China would welcome U.S. cooperation in UN missions to promote stability and peace, especially in areas featuring Chinese interests. In regional security-related multilateral organizations around the world, such as Africa, Chinese leadership and resources could help local governments control threats and build stronger relations with China. Chinese military diplomacy would thus reinforce diplomacy efforts aimed at bolstering Chinese leadership globally and regionally.
In terms of force development, China's desired end state by midcentury would result in a military that is qualitatively superior to that of the United States. It would operate using the most advanced technologies and warfighting concepts, an ideal alluded to by the Chinese concept of informatized warfare. However, the PLA need not replicate the U.S. distribution of military forces globally. Instead, it can aim to be a more effective security provider than the United States, especially to client states across Asia and Africa, and in other developing countries around the world. The PLA would rely primarily on arms sales, military assistance, and special forces operations to help client regimes control threats to Chinese interests. In terms of force employment, the PLA would have successfully deterred the United States or, in the event of a crisis or clash, managed escalation and practiced effective control to preserve prospects of achieving the China Dream.
The judgment that China seeks to ascend to the position of global leader unavoidably implies that the same end state requires a downgrading in U.S. status. Washington is unlikely to voluntarily submit to such an outcome unless it concludes it lacks another option. The United States might even be willing to risk war to defend its position if it judged China's demands to be unreasonable and unjust. Indeed, scholarship on past power transitions has noted a desultory pattern in which incumbent powers risk war rather than submit to a rising power. The Chinese are well aware of this possibility, which is why officials and commentators incessantly denounce the idea of a Thucydides trap. Chinese officials generally hold that such a trap is not an "inevitability," although they insist that the United States carries the responsibility for avoiding such a disaster by adopting policies of accommodation.
Although Chinese officials and scholars seek to avoid an open challenge to U.S. leadership, leaders seem to believe in a growing possibility that China could eclipse the United States as a global power someday. Statements by top leaders evince uncertainty and some anxiety about how the United States may respond to this possibility. In a startling acknowledgment of this sensitive issue, Xi directed greater efforts to study power transitions at the recent foreign affairs work conference, calling for "in-depth analysis of the law of how the international situation changes when the world comes into its transitional period." Xi indirectly referred to potential disruptions and uncertainties in the U.S.-China relationship, stating that in light of the "accelerated development of multi-polarization," it had become necessary to "attach great importance to the tendency of extensive adjustments in major-country relations" (emphasis added).

This chapter explores a possible strategy that China could employ in coming years to achieve the international desired end state for U.S. competition presented in Table 
6
For each of the sections, we have provided an overview of how China views its interests in the region, and how these affect its prospects for competition with the United States. We then posit potential policy objectives in a supporting table. To help analysts and planners evaluate how China might regard progress toward its goals, we have proposed subobjectives in the appendix. We also offer some suggestions for how China might pursue its objectives, although these represent mere conjecture offered as food for thought. The suggestions represent methods consistent with what we know about Chinese approaches, but they are by no means definitive predictions of how China will behave.
The 2019 foreign policy white paper listed the United States, Russia, and the European Union as the principal "major powers," and this section will use that list of countries accordingly (Table 
6
China's objectives regarding major powers in the competition with the United States center on the pursuit of a multipolar order in which China plays a more important role than the United States. As noted in the previous section, we argue that China's desired end state for major power relations is to establish itself as the "first among equals," in which the United States, Russia, and the European Union oversee permeable, de facto spheres of influence. Of the major powers, Beijing clearly regards Russia as a critical junior partner and the United States as a formidable competitor with whom relations must be handled with care. China regards the European Union, by contrast, as an important collaborator with whom Beijing hopes to nurture relations as an independent "pole" at odds with American power.
However, in this ideal arrangement, China has gained a measure of deference from the other major powers. Each of the major powers respects China's authority and interests in its respective "sphere." This might mean, for example, that official statements and documents by the other major powers tacitly accept China's position regarding the South China Sea or Taiwan. It might also mean that within their respective "spheres," the other major powers would cooperate with Chinese authorities to control individuals and organizations Beijing regarded as threatening, or at least avoid openly demonstrating official support for them. The major powers might also tacitly agree to refrain from harming the interests of Chinese client countries in their "back yards." China, in turn, would probably offer to similarly abstain from harming the citizens and their assets of other major powers in the Asia-Pacific region, although this would not preclude diplomatic efforts to minimize the influence of major-power competitors. Such objectives would, in some ways, represent an extension of current PRC policies. Chinese officials have demanded that countries demonstrate "mutual respect" by refraining from criticism of Chinese domestic politics and have for years wielded economic coercion and other diplomatic punishments against other countries that offended Beijing's sensitivities on such issues as Tibet, Xinjiang, human rights, and Taiwan. 
1
The United States plays a significant role in China's pursuit of its national development goals. Authorities continue to emphasize the importance of the U.S. relationship. The 2019 foreign policy white paper, for example, described it as "one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world." It called on Washington to adopt "cooperation" as the "only correct choice"-betraying an anxiety about potential U.S. responses to China's rise. For similar reasons, the paper insisted that China has "no intention of challenging the United States," even though, as noted in Chapter Five, officials and commentators have made clear an intent to curb U.S. power and assert greater Chinese international leadership at the expense of the United States. Consistent with long-standing policy, the paper called on the United States to "abandon the Cold War mentality." It recommended that the United States develop a "proper understanding of itself, China, and the world." 
3
On some issues, China may seek cooperation and collaboration with the United States, such as against transnational threats in which the U.S. ability to project military power around the world might be useful. On the other hand, China will have a strong and growing incentive to erode the credibility and appeal of U.S. international leadership. Beijing's efforts to contrast the effectiveness of its response to the COVID-19 pandemic with that of the United States is but one example of the competition for influence already shaping international politics. 
4
In the next few decades, China's interests would be best served if it maintained a stable, cooperative relationship with the United States even as it stepped up efforts to erode U.S. power and undercut America's international standing. China would also benefit if the United States remained divided on whether to adopt a primarily competitive approach or to adopt a more cooperative, deferential approach to growing Chinese power. This is an admittedly contradictory set of directives, and Beijing would require considerable skill to manage this balance. But too much drive in either direction, of excessive cooperation or competition, could hamper the pursuit of the China Dream. Accommodation to U.S. demands would mean accepting limitations on China's ability to sustain economic growth and a status quo regarding Taiwan and the South and East China Seas that Beijing regards as intolerable. But excessive confrontation risks destabilizing relations to the point of hostility and conflict, which, if left uncontrolled, could lead to a broader war that derails the China Dream.
China may, in the long term, seek to surpass the United States as a global leader, but this is not a feasible goal for at least the next decade or two. Thus, China's more proximate goal should be to build its comprehensive national power, avoid confrontational policies, and encourage a weakening of U.S. power. Domestically, resolving key economic and governance challenges should be a top priority in coming years if Beijing is to position itself more effectively against the United States. China's U.S. strategy in coming years should show considerable continuity with current efforts to balance cooperative elements with those of delegitimization. Beijing might seek a reduction in tariffs and an increase in trade and investment opportunities, as well as offers to cooperate on such shared concerns as humanitarian disaster and maritime piracy. At the same time, Beijing might compete more aggressively for international influence and to step up criticism of the United States. At the very least, China might abstain from helping the United States overcome any of its own difficulties and may, in some cases, carry out provocative policies aimed at eroding U.S. authority and credibility. A disturbing glimpse of such policies could be seen in the campaign of disinformation spread by Chinese authorities that blamed the spread of COVID-19 on the U.S. military.

Given its current inferiority to U.S. power, it would behoove China to delegitimize the status of the United States as the sole superpower and instead cast the United States as merely one, albeit the strongest, of several major powers. Consistent with this logic is the Chinese demand for treatment as an "equal" to the United States, a condition that Chinese leaders have insisted upon regularly in recent years. A typical formulation of this demand is Xi Jinping's statement that the United States and China should resolve their trade differences "on the basis of equality and mutual respect."

Regarding Europe, China views the European Union as a potentially important partner for strategic and economic reasons. In strategic terms, Europe could become an advocate for a multilateralism featuring a diminished United States. In economic terms, Europe appeals to Beijing as a lucrative market and a source of key technologies and investment. The 2019 foreign policy white paper described the European Union as an "important pillar in the world today" and hailed a "comprehensive strategic partnership" with it. The white paper called for both sides to extend cooperation and "make joint efforts to uphold multilateralism." The white paper did not address individual countries, but Beijing would benefit most if the European Union remained largely politically divided and unable to agree on a common strategy regarding China.
11
If the European Union remained divided over core issues of whether to support U.S. or Chinese technology, trade, and other economic standards, this would also facilitate China's ambitions. China need not build close partnerships with all European countries, just enough to ensure that the European Union remains politically divided and that Chinese firms gain a foothold in that lucrative market. A European Union that provided little more than token support to U.S. security activities in Asia would reassure China as well. To promote division and impede a unified approach, China could rely on the threat of economic sanctions, such as the cancellation of trade deals, restricting access to its market, and the curbing of investment. Beijing has notably wielded these threats in recent years to strong-arm various European countries on an array of issues. 12 China might rely on multilateral organizations that divide Europe to promote BRI-related projects, as it has done with the 17 Plus 1 organization that focuses on building client states in central and eastern Europe. A European policy paper, published in 2020, described the 17 Plus 1 program as a "hub and spokes logic of cooperation with China taking the lead in 'multilateral bilateralism.'" 13 United Front tactics to build a network of compliant advocates in various European countries could also help promote disunity and a policy stance favorable to Beijing by cultivating clients among businesses, political parties, universities, and individual leaders. 14
Chinese sources regard Russia as an important partner in the competition with the United States. The 2019 foreign policy white paper stated that Beijing has "prioritized its relations with Russia in its diplomatic agenda." It described the strategic partnership between the two as "enjoying the highest level of mutual trust and coordination and the highest strategic value." Hinting more directly at the role that the partnership could play in competing with the United States, the white paper stated that the China-Russia relationship will serve as "both a ballast and a propeller" in a "complex and volatile" international relationship. This language suggests that China regards Russia as an important partner for pushing through changes that shape the international order in terms amenable to Chinese leadership. Indeed, the white paper added that a close partnership between the two countries is imperative for "world peace, security, and stability."

In short, China would benefit most from an asymmetric relationship in which it had greater influence over Russia's behavior in exchange for providing various goods and benefits. This would be less of a true partnership between equals than the relationship of a partner and "junior partner," or perhaps that of a patron and client. A patronclient relationship would grant China more influence over Moscow's sale of arms to countries with relations antagonistic to Beijing, such as Vietnam and India. A more compliant Russia would allow China to more closely coordinate with Russia for key BRI projects, especially through Central Asian countries. Closer China-Russia coordination could more effectively erode Western power. Russia's declining prospects make the risk of deepening dependence on China already a real-ity. In 2019, Russia had the 11th-largest economy, trailing countries such as Canada and Brazil.

Chinese authorities regard the Asia-Pacific region as the geostrategic foundation of China's rise and have accorded the region a high diplomatic priority. The 2019 foreign policy white paper called the region the "foundation of China's development and prosperity." It stated that Beijing had assigned "top priority" to diplomacy to the region. The white paper also stated that China intends to "lead regional cooperation and safeguard regional peace and development." 20 Underscoring the importance of the region, in 2013, China held its first central work forum on diplomacy to the Asia-Pacific region, at which Xi Jinping outlined a strategy to consolidate Chinese influence over a span of years.

China's objectives for the United States in the Asia-Pacific are likely to be the most contentious and difficult of all its foreign policies, and yet this area is critical to the success of China's global ambitions. The region holds the greatest risks to China's security, as well as the greatest opportunity to enhance its economic development. To achieve a position of international superiority, China would benefit enormously if it could establish its primacy in this region. However, even if successful, China is unlikely to enjoy the sort of unchallenged primacy that the United States has in the Americas. Beijing will continue to face powerful neighbors, such as Japan, India, and strong middle powers, such as Australia and Korea, which will likely resist Chinese efforts to assert greater dominance. With these competing powers, China could perhaps hope to achieve a working relationship based on mutual interest. These competitors might grudgingly accept Chinese leadership and prioritize Chinese-led norms and rules regarding trade, investment, and infrastructure as perhaps the most workable of available options. These larger powers might agree to refrain from policies that offend Chinese sensibilities on domestic concerns and participate in Chinese-led multilateral organizations to manage the region's affairs. However, they do not necessarily defer consistently to Beijing and may resist many demands that they regard as unreasonable.
A plausible form of Chinese primacy might be one in which all Asian countries manage their own affairs, but they also generally, though perhaps not consistently, prioritize Beijing's preferences in matters of regional trade, infrastructure, investment, and security. This means that Chinese standards, rules, and norms prevail over those of other countries in the region's economic and political architecture. Chinese-led multilateral organizations would play the most essential role in governing the region, and Chinese-led security initiatives would play the most essential role in controlling transnational threats, managing crises, and maintaining regional order. At the same time, all countries would respect China's sensitivities regarding its core interests and modify their policies accordingly. The United States would not be excluded from the region, but its participation would be on terms acceptable to Beijing. This could mean U.S. companies participate in regional trade at a disadvantage and that U.S. officials are routinely excluded from the multilateral networks most essential to the regional order. In such a situation, the U.S. military would remain in the region, but it would operate in a nonthreatening manner. For example, U.S. allies and partners would generally prioritize relations with China over those with the United States in a condition of Chinese primacy. Thus, the alliances remain in name only and generally lack any real substance in terms of countering Chinese power.
In terms of objectives for U.S. competition by 2035, we posit that China should seek to both avoid provoking a conflict while gradually marginalizing its competitors and keep major Asian powers from forming an anti-China alliance. Consistent with these objectives would be a public statement welcoming U.S. involvement in the region that coincides with diligent efforts to undermine U.S. power and lay the foundations for a Chinese-led economic and political order. In fact, many Chinese policies toward the region are consistent with such an approach. Chinese officials insist that they have no intent to "exclude" the United States-nor is exclusion of the world's largest economy possible. At the same time, Beijing is building alternative institutions, such as the SCO, AIIB, and other multilateral institutions and mechanisms that aim to address the region's need without involving the United States. The following sections explore potential goals regarding specific countries and subregions and suggest some possible methods that could be used to achieve those goals; Table

Tokyo undoubtedly poses one of the most vexing and difficult challenges to Chinese efforts to consolidate its leadership in Asia. Historical animosities and Japan's traditional role as a competitor mean that Tokyo is unlikely to subordinate itself to China. Beijing's challenge is compounded by the fact that Japan remains one of Asia's most stalwart supporters of an alliance with the United States. The U.S. government also regards its alliance with Japan as critical. A State Department fact sheet called the U.S. alliance with Japan the "cornerstone of U.S. security interests in Asia" and "fundamental to regional stability and prosperity." 
25
China's interests could best be served by finding ways to divide the two allies in a manner that leaves Japan reassured. This is also admittedly a complex and contradictory requirement that will remain challenging for even the most skilled Chinese diplomats. Beijing could perhaps focus on bolstering practical cooperation, building goodwill, and promoting trust with Japan while promoting messages about the weaknesses and unreliability of the United States as an ally. China is unlikely to displace the United States as Japan's most important partner, but Beijing could perhaps hope to be treated as a country of equal importance to the United States in economic and political terms, if only for pragmatic reasons. Pragmatic cooperation could be centered on the pressing needs to build Asia's infrastructure, trade, and investment potential. If Japan could be persuaded to prioritize cooperation with China over the development of a competing array of initiatives led by the United States, this could be a significant achievement by 2035. It is also plausible that Japan concludes that working with China offers a better path to achieving its own economic goals than constructing an alternative. Indeed, many Western scholars have already characterized Japan's approach to China as featuring a mix of cooperation and competition aimed at enhancing its own strategic autonomy relative to both the United States and China. 
26
27
This does not mean that China needs to compromise on its interests, however. Beijing could continue to bolster its control of the Senkakus by relying on the gray-zone tactics that have confounded Tokyo and Washington. These tactics carry the cost of alienating Tokyo and hardening anti-China sentiments. Yet there are also compelling reasons for Beijing to maintain the gray-zone pressure, some of which are tied to the U.S.-China competition. Because the islands are a highly visible symbol of the competition for leadership between two traditional Asian giants, yielding to Japan on the issue could deal a major blow to perceptions of Chinese power. Rather, the islands provide a useful means of demonstrating Beijing's superior power over a declining Japan. Tokyo may never accept Chinese sovereignty over the islands, but it has little ability to resist China's growing presence and exploitation of resources near the islands. Observers have noted that the dispute over the islands has provided Beijing useful leverage to demand concessions from Japan on other issues, such as security arrangements with the United States, economic aid and sanctions, and other issues. Given that China's advantage near the islands will likely grow in the future, it has a strong incentive to maintain the dispute as a means of extracting even more concessions through coercion. 
28
In short, China's goals through 2035 regarding Japan could focus on building good relations, easing Tokyo's anxiety, and encouraging Japan to develop its autonomy from the United States, which might open the way to a peaceful coexistence in a Chinese-led order. China could maintain the dispute over the Senkakus as a way of demonstrating its growing edge over Japan to the entire region and of extracting concessions on other issues. However, Beijing would have little incentive to provoke a military conflict before a time when China could be relatively sure that the United States would not intervene on behalf of its ally.
China already has developed a strong economic and diplomatic relationship with South Korea. In recent years, the Republic of Korea (ROK) showed considerable deference to Beijing on such issues as how to approach North Korea. 
29
Managing South Korea's relationship with the United States is likely to remain challenging. Although the South Korean public may have ambivalent feelings about the U.S. military presence, distrust of China has also grown. Beijing's efforts to coerce Seoul into rejecting the deployment of a U.S. theater missile defense system severely damaged bilateral relations. 
30
31
32
China remains an official ally, but Beijing has distanced itself from the Cold War obligation in recent decades. Tensions remain over Chinese pressure on Pyongyang regarding its nuclear weapon program. The persistence of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) regime provides Washington a strong rationale for stationing substan-tial military forces on the Korean peninsula. Although Beijing would benefit if Pyongyang reconciled with Seoul and reduced tensions, this is obviously not something China can determine. Beijing can maintain outreach with the United States to manage the North Korea challenge while aiming to reduce overall tensions through the Six Party Talks (6PT) and other Chinese-led initiatives. China's interest in stability and peace on the peninsula also provides a compelling incentive to deter the United States from taking provocative military actions against the DPRK and its nuclear weapon program. China's DPRK goals might thus entail the provision of diplomatic and military cover to maintain stability and ward off U.S. efforts to adopt more aggressive military actions against Pyongyang's nuclear program.
The failure to realize unification remains a persistent sign of the humiliation suffered by China in the "century of humiliation." Chinese officials have consistently affirmed the view that the island remains a "part of China" and vowed to pay any price to defeat "separatists" who might seek to establish an independent Taiwan.

For the near term, China might hope to persuade U.S. officials to minimize their political and military support to the island. At the same time, Beijing might press Washington to restrain Taiwan from pursuing de jure independence, which would result in a serious military crisis and possibly war. However, deepening competition with the United States has incentivized Taiwan to pursue a closer relationship with the United States and eroded Washington's willingness to comply with Chinese demands regarding the island.

the competition. Ultimately, however, China's best prospect for securing Taiwan through military attack would be to delay resolution until China had gained the geopolitical and military upper hand against the United States. If China succeeds in outcompeting the United States, a weakened United States might concede that its position had become untenable and tacitly withdraw its support for the island.
The countries of ASEAN play an important role in China's vision for its revitalization. China's Maritime Silk Road consists of a series of collaborative infrastructure initiatives designed to further trade and investment primarily through seaborne trade. The route passes through Southeast Asia and along the Indian Ocean before terminating in Africa and Europe. It is designed to realize the economic potential of the Southeast Asian region, widely regarded to be a key driver of future global growth.
37
Given its economic importance and proximity to China, Southeast Asia may be a region that features a more military aspect to the competition. The importance of BRI projects to the region's economic prospects provides China a convenient justification for seeking both greater access for its military and a higher degree of security cooperation between ASEAN countries and the PLA.
We posit competition-related goals for the region to include the strengthening of a network of client states and weakening of U.S. security relationships. In particular, Beijing might hope, by 2035, to turn some of the poorer countries, such as Cambodia, Laos, and/or Bangladesh, into client states. The client states might permit Chinese air and naval forces to operate on a temporary basis from their territory in exchange for Chinese protection and economic benefits. These assets might carry out patrols or lead multilateral operations to counter shared threats to BRI investments in the region. However, such access would also allow Beijing to send an unmistakable political message of growing Chinese power and waning U.S. influence.
As countries become more involved in BRI-related collaboration, China could exploit its economic leverage to demand that countries curb their relations with the United States. Beijing might, for example, press Thailand to prohibit the U.S. military from staging any military forces that could be used in an offensive manner against China, rendering the alliance mostly hollow.

China could also wield economic incentives and the threat of punishment to dissuade such countries as Vietnam from expanding security ties with the United States. Even countries further removed from the mainland, such as Malaysia and Indonesia, might conclude that it is in their best interests to avoid measures that antagonize Beijing, such as drawing close to the United States. To underscore its primacy, China might even request more-regular port access for patrolling vessels in the South China Sea and promote regular multilateral collaboration and military exercises with ASEAN nations.
The disputes in the South China Sea would likely continue to irritate various ASEAN countries in contention with China. To manage the friction, China could avoid militarily aggressive acts to seize territory and instead continue to incrementally consolidate its position, bolster military defenses, and step up administrative efforts to exercise de facto control. Wearing down the rival claimants through a steady application of pressure, Beijing could also incentivize compliance through the manipulation of BRI-related economic benefits and the development of overwhelming military superiority against any ASEAN nation. Persuading Southeast Asian nations to accommodate themselves to the reality of Chinese primacy could be greatly aided by clear evidence that the PLA had surpassed the United States Armed Forces as the leading military in the region.
In sum, China's goals for Southeast Asia are to shape the emerging economic, political, and security architecture in a manner favorable to the exercise of Chinese leadership, while undermining U.S. influence in the region. China could leverage the BRI to build clients across Southeast Asia through economic, political, and military patronage. This could, in turn, permit China to exert greater influence and coercion across vital shipping lanes in Asia and the region as a whole.
South Asia is important to Beijing for at least three reasons. First, Chinese leaders seek to prevent the center of gravity in the region, India, from aligning with the United States against China. If this were to happen, then it could open up a new front on China's western flank that might distract attention from Beijing's priority theater in the Asia-Pacific, where it seeks to effectively handle several maritime and territorial disputes. To reduce the possibility of closer U.S.-India relations and a potential security alliance, China has turned to high-level engagement with India to build trust. Notably, Beijing in 2018 hosted an informal summit between Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at Wuhan, and Modi reciprocated by hosting Xi at Chennai in 2019.

Third, and finally, Beijing seeks to reduce the possibility that, with American security assistance over time, India might be able to project formidable military power into the Indian Ocean and even one day out to the Asia-Pacific region to make good on its "Act East" poli-cy. 
46
Chinese shipping and energy routes also skirt South Asia, providing a strong incentive for Beijing to explore ways of bolstering security along the sea route without exacerbating tensions with India. One possibility may be for China to expand its access to military logistics bases in client states, such as Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. In many locations, this might entail dual-use port facilities capable of providing logistics support to passing PLA Navy vessels. These dual-use facilities would probably be operated by Chinese civilian state employees. Over time, China might even turn some of these locations into PLA Navy bases, as it is reportedly considering in Gwadar, Pakistan. 
47
Central Asia has been a priority region for China since 1991, when Beijing first engaged with the independent post-Soviet republics. The Central Asian countries sit astride China's overland Silk Road route to Europe and thus occupy an important place in the strategy to integrate the Eurasian landmass under Chinese leadership. They also play an important role in China's domestic stability in Tibet and Xinjiang through cooperation to address potential transnational threats.

Chinese strategists envision a strategic space that eventually encompasses the second island chain. China has already sought to expand diplomatic and economic ties with many Pacific island states through loans and investments. In terms of competition with the United States, China might seek to expand its ability to monitor passing U.S. military forces and subtly coerce countries in Oceania by increasing the PLA's presence through the construction of dual-use facilities or military bases.

In keeping with its assessment of historical trends regarding the decline of the West and rise of the non-West, China regards the developing world as an important potential constituency. The 2019 foreign policy white paper presented a typical statement of Chinese policy when it emphasized the shared agenda, sense of solidarity, and possibilities for collaboration with the developing world, which it defined in terms pri-marily of countries in Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and Latin America. It stated, "China strengthens solidarity and cooperation with other developing countries in a spirit of sincerity, affinity, and good faith." Similarly, Xi Jinping stated that China should "speak for other developing countries" and directed officials to more actively advocate on behalf of developing world nations. 
53
In the developing world, Chinese officials and commentators regard Africa and the Middle East as the most important regions, second only to the developing countries in Asia, because of the potential for investment, sources of energy, markets, and commodities, as well as potential receptivity to Chinese influence. Latin America and the Caribbean are less important to China owing to distance and small volume of trade. However, China has sought to boost trade, influence, and political cooperation in those regions as well.

If successful, this approach could grant China a stronger hand in shaping world affairs and building its credibility as an alternative international leader.
Africa presents a unique strategic opportunity for China. Unlike the regions of Latin America, South Asia, or Central Asia, no major power asserts dominance. China's current engagement in Africa is experiencing several favorable trends, including increased tourism, media engagement, high-level government exchanges, multilateral engagement, and booming trade and investment. Despite these positive trends, Africa suffers from instability and various threats. Piracy, terrorism, and corruption continue to run rampant. Through both its foreign and security policy objectives, China's efforts have begun to bear fruit in Africa in terms of increased trade volume and influence as a norms-maker.

China's deepening involvement in the Middle East raises the possibility that it may assert leadership in an area that continues to provide vital energy supplies to the world economy and through which much of global seaborne trade passes. A stronger Chinese presence here could carry implications beyond the Middle East. A stronger partnership with Iran could significantly weaken India's strategic position, for example, perhaps rendering it even less willing to challenge China despite New Delhi's warming ties with Washington.

China values its relationship with Latin America because of its potential contribution to economic growth. Latin America has considerable natural resources, as well as an export market. Its historic experience as a victim of colonialism also makes at least some of the region's countries, such as Venezuela, potential political allies. China and Cuba have maintained a long-standing friendship as two of the world's last governments run by communist parties. Beijing recognizes the considerable U.S. influence in the region and thus holds more-modest expectations of how much the region might lean toward Chinese leadership in a global competition. Nevertheless, Beijing has stepped up efforts to cultivate clients in the Americas.
In 2015, China and Latin America established the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, a regionwide multilateral organization that excludes Canada and the United States. At the forum, China and various Latin American countries agreed to a fiveyear cooperation plan that covered a broad variety of topics, including trade, agriculture, people-to-people exchanges, infrastructure, and science and technology. China also invited Latin American countries to take part in the BRI.

75
In sum, the developing world offers China the potential of a broad constituency and access to the markets and resources that could help sustain its rise. Success in building clients along the BRI routes could pay off by enhancing China's global influence and strengthening its hand against the United States and its allies in the Indo-Pacific (see Table

China regards multilateral organizations as an important venue for exercising international leadership, as they offer a means of exerting influence in a less politically provocative manner. In the competition with the United States, China seeks to position itself as the leader of key multilateral organizations while delegitimizing the United States as a competitor. China also regards participation in multilateralism as a way to restrain the United States. Chinese official statements and commentary routinely contrast China's support and contributions with criticism of U.S. conduct, often disparaged as "unilateral" and irresponsible. The 2019 foreign policy white paper stated, for example, that China aimed to support "multilateralism" while opposing "unilateralism," a reference to U.S. policies. Beijing's approach to the international institutions may be characterized as one of "conditional support." 76 It enthusiastically backs those entities that feature Chinese leadership, such as the United Nations. It also promotes bilateral approaches to resolving disputes where it judges existing multilateral groups, such as ASEAN, are insufficiently responsive to Chinese demands. It also supports the multilateral trading system, which provides substantial benefits to the exportdependent China. As the foreign policy white paper stated, "China will remain committed to the multilateral trading system with the WTO at its core." 77 Within these existing institutions, Chinese leaders have directed efforts to increase the country's influence. Where existing institutions prove insufficiently responsive, authorities have set up rival versions-such as the AIIB, which serves as an alternative to the Asian Development Bank. In all cases, Chinese officials and media routinely contrast U.S.-led organizations, which they disparage as ineffective, with Chinese-led ones. For example, a 2017 People's Daily commentary noted a "decreasing efficiency" in "international economic mechanisms with the Group of Seven as the center." It hailed instead Chinese involvement in the G-20 and the emerging-economies association of Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, which it depicted as more responsive and effective.

In sum, competition for influence and status in multilateral organizations is likely to intensify within global institutions and many regional ones as well. Beijing intends to renovate existing institutions to better serve its purposes and create new ones where the changes appear inadequate (see Table

China surpasses U.S. leadership role in setting norms, rules, and agendas in existing political and economic multilateral organizations.
China's leadership is more effective than that of the United States in regional multilateral organizations.
Chinese-led multilateral groups play a more critical role in organizing the world economy than U.S.-led ones.
Collective security NATO lacks consensus on countering China.
Issues of global governance have risen significantly in importance in recent years. The Politburo has held two study sessions on the topic, on October 12, 2015, and September 12, 2016. At the latter event, Xi hinted at the erosion of Western power and the concomitant rise in Chinese national strength, stating that the "structure of global governance depends on the international balance of power." He declared that China "must make the international order more reasonable and just to protect the common interests of China and other developing countries." 80 Chinese officials have outlined an ambition to reform the system of global governance to favor Chinese values and norms. The 2019 white paper stated, "We must pursue the transformation of the global governance system by following the principles of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits." Answering its own rhetorical question-"What kind of international order and governance system best suits the world, and best suits the peoples of all countries?"the white paper's response was that China advocates that governance should be "decided by all countries through consultation, and not by a single country or a small minority of countries," 81 a clear disparaging reference to the United States and the West. China's government has also sought to back up its claims to morally superior leadership through actions. In the midst of the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, for example, Beijing aggressively moved to offer aid and support to countries grappling with the disease, which originated from China. 
82
China has embarked on a major exercise to reshape the world in accordance with its own interests, and its cyber and technology goals are important lines of these efforts. Strategically, China views its capabilities as a means of competition with the United States, as well as an opportunity to bolster its economic and technological abilities domestically.
China has garnered a plethora of data from the United States, including defense and military technology, patents, and trade secrets, through its offensive cyber activities. It remains actively engaged in improving its cyber and technology competencies as a means of national security. To date, effective cyber norms have not been established. Previous diplomatic agreements lack teeth for the CCP and have done little to curb its strategic desires. 
83
Although espousing a policy of the peaceful use of outer space, China nevertheless is actively developing a diverse set of military capabilities in this domain. Through the establishment of the PLA Strategic Support Force, China aims to enable more-effective military operations by leveraging space-based assets to disrupt or cripple the ability of U.S. forces to use assets in space. Chinese military theorists are fond of saying that "whoever controls space will control the Earth"-a view that is almost certainly driven by their observations of heavy U.S.

85
86
Within the context of great-power competition with the United States, Beijing seeks to control the terms of international behavior in outer space. For example, in conjunction with Russia, Beijing has, on several occasions, put forward the "Treaty on the Prevention of Placement of Weapons in Outer Space, the Threat or Use of Force Against Outer Space Objects"-commonly referred to as the PPWT.

In this chapter, we review the defense aspect of a posited Chinese strategy for U.S. competition. The chapter proposes potential objectives for 2035, principally centered on military missions to support China's strategy to wrest regional primacy and international leadership from the United States. The defense strategy also considers imperatives to build a superior military and operate military forces in a way that secures national goals at an acceptable level of risk. Because China's competitive effort with the United States presented here is premised on the persistence of trends introduced in Chapter Two, the defense strategy posited here similarly upholds generally peaceful methods. China's security priority in the competition is to support the nation's development as a great power, protect core interests, secure overseas interests, erode the credibility of U.S. military power in Asia, shape the regional security architecture, and enhance China's international influence-all without engaging in a general war with the United States. The logic of the Chinese competitive strategy presented here is that a successful economic and diplomatic contest would leave the United States in such a weakened strategic posture that China could more easily resolve any dispute with its neighbors at far lower risk than if it rushed prematurely into such a confrontation while the U.S. military remained formidable.
The posited competitive defense strategy seeks to avoid a general war with the United States, but this does not mean that the PLA should shy away from all confrontations with the United States. Chinese cyber forces may be directed to consider operations to probe weaknesses in the U.S. defense posture and extract valuable industrial and national security secrets. PLA forces, working in conjunction with proxy militaries, such as those of client states, may risk provoking a crisis with the forces of the United States and its allies. If tensions increase, or if Beijing judges that U.S. power has weakened to the point that Chinese leaders confidently believe that the PLA could easily prevail in a test of strength, Beijing might even be willing to pursue brinksmanship tactics that risk a direct clash between U.S. and PLA forces. In all of these circumstances, finding ways to manage escalation will remain imperative if Beijing is to avoid a spiral toward general war. The Chinese military's interest in concepts related to crisis management, conflict prevention, war control, effective control, and war containment all reflect an awareness of the imperative to balance the challenge of protecting an expanding array of national interests with the imperative to avoid unwanted war.
1
Given the risks of war, the PLA's primary responsibility is building a qualitatively superior military and carrying out an array of tasks to build up China's national power and leadership and weaken those of the United States. First and foremost, the PLA in this strategy would build and modernize a technologically and qualitatively superior force capable of major combat operations in the Asia-Pacific region. Such a military could also bolster China's reputation as a rising power and erode the credibility of a potential U.S. military intervention to a contingency. Such a development would greatly facilitate China's efforts to strengthen its influence throughout Asia; coerce concessions from neighbors, such as Taiwan; and perhaps persuade the United States to eventually reconsider its commitments in Asia. Global perceptions of the United States as a marginalized actor in Asia could, in turn, compound U.S. difficulties in maintaining its position as a global leader.
Military operations against allies of the United States carry high risks that incentivize caution for China. To protect its interests at lower risk, the PLA could continue to backstop civil-led efforts to incrementally consolidate Chinese control over disputed regions and extend Beijing's influence. The PLA could support maritime law enforcement in its efforts to incrementally coerce U.S. allies into concessions that damage the credibility of U.S. security assurances without crossing a threshold of armed conflict.

Deterrence is thus an important responsibility for the PLA in competition with the United States, but the military has other important duties as well. A substantial focus of the PLA's work in the competition could consist of military diplomacy to build the security capabilities of client states and thereby extend the range and geographic reach of PLA forces. This could eventually lead China to rethink its willingness to take on greater security obligations for clients, perhaps someday resulting in the forging of alliance-like arrangements with client states around the world. Some of the PLA's work may focus on diplomatic activity to erode U.S. alliances. One approach might be for Beijing to expand its own security relationships with host nations to compete with those of the United States. For example, the PLA might organize routine bilateral and multilateral exercises involving U.S. allies in Southeast Asia, such as Thailand and the Philippines, as a condition for receiving continued BRI-related investments. The PLA might also offer military assis-tance and arms sales to countries facing internal challenges to offset the influence gained through U.S. military aid.
Among client states, China may, in coming years, step up efforts to expand access for visiting military ships, aircraft, and troops, especially in developing countries along the BRI routes. While Beijing might cite the need to protect BRI investments to justify such deployments, a broader and more persistent PLA presence could also exert a strong influence on the region. PLA ships and aircraft could step up "gunboat diplomacy"-style pressure to warn Asian countries against taking measures that offend China's sensibilities or otherwise regard too lightly Beijing's preferences. Even powerful states like Japan and India may become more reluctant to antagonize China in such a situation. Other missions might aim to stabilize the competition through proposed collaborative efforts. Although Washington might not accept the offer, Beijing could seek cooperation with the United States to counter shared threats, such as natural disasters or terrorism.
Mission to protect CCP rule. The principal threat to CCP rule from the United States comes from potential cyber or information operations. The PLA could carry out its own cyber operations to root out suspected Western efforts to imperil the authority of the CCP. PLA psychological and information warfare experts may also support civil-

ian efforts to combat perceived Western efforts to erode the credibility of CCP rule. If tensions intensified, Beijing could direct the PLA to go on the offensive by interfering in U.S. domestic politics. Some analysts have reported evidence that China has already attempted to interfere in U.S. elections.

Operations to deter separatism in China's western provinces could consist of coordination with the SCO to control transnational threats and diplomatic pressure, aided by military intelligence, to isolate and weaken U.S. supporters of separatist movements. The establishment of PLA bases in select SCO countries could provide China a more effective means to counter transnational threats and collect intelligence on any potential U.S. activity to foment trouble in western China.
The flashpoints of Taiwan and the disputed maritime domains continue to pose a risk of a crisis or conflict involving U.S. forces. Through 2035, the PLA could prioritize efforts to build a powerful counterintervention capability. The military remains in the midst of a complex and difficult reorganization and modernization effort that will likely last for many years. War with the United States in a period of the PLA's transformation seems unacceptably risky, given the impossibility of predicting how the conflict could escalate. To protect China's interests and control risk, Beijing would be better served if it relied on the combination of the Chinese Coast Guard, maritime militia, and PLA Navy for gray-zone operations.

If the U.S.-China competition turned hostile, Beijing might even support operations by client militaries against governments or organizations backed by the United States. Assisting client states against adversaries, possibly including those aligned with the United States, need not involve PLA troops. Invoking tactics and methods honed by previous great powers, including the United States and Great Britain, China could employ a mix of host-nation military forces, civilian contractors, intelligence operatives, and private military companies. In later years, the PLA could, in some instances, adopt alliance-like arrangements, even if Beijing continued to resist the label alliance for political reasons. The result could be a range of proxy military conflicts and low-intensity struggles between states and within states. China and the United States could find themselves carrying out a multifront struggle for primacy in the Asia-Pacific and along BRI routes through hostilities involving competing countries, organizations, and factions.
Mission to promote world peace and common development. According to the 2019 defense white paper, the fourth mission includes tasks to "deepen bilateral and multilateral security cooperation," promote a "coordinated, inclusive, and complementary cooperation among security mechanisms," and contribute to a "security architecture featuring equality, mutual trust, fairness, justice, joint contribution and shared benefits."
9
In addition to offering "carrots" of cooperation in multilateral security initiatives and arms sales, China may also resort to gunboat diplomacy-style coercion to shape the terms of peace and stability. Deploying warships and fighter aircraft could warn weaker countries enacting policies against China's interests or preferences. Such situations would carry their own risks of miscalculation and potential escalation to conflict.
Although the competition for influence among militaries is a major part of this mission, some of the tasks also open opportunities for cooperation with the U.S. military. Given its limited expeditionary capabilities, the PLA might seek collaboration with the United States to promote peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief, and stability in areas featuring Chinese interests. Of course, given the tensions arising from competition, the United States may decline such cooperation. The lack of cooperation and persistent proxy skirmishing may result in a fragmented international system featuring a higher degree of disorder and instability than exists today. Alternatively, under terms of a hostile competition, China may seek to encourage the United States to abandon its involvement in the UN, thereby providing Beijing a freer hand to manipulate UN missions to protect its interests.
China's approach to all potential contingencies and its willingness to risk conflict depend on the political leadership's judgment about the broader competition and the strategic trends that underpin that competition. In the event that the broader trends discussed in Chapter Two should change in a dramatic fashion, especially via the onset of hostile and conflict-filled relations with the United States, the defense strategy could change significantly.
The PLA's execution of its missions and tasks in the U.S. competition depends on the type of military force used and guidance on how to employ that force in the execution of all missions. These topics are covered by the central and military leadership's directives regarding force deployment and employment (Table 
8
Force development. Beijing's ambition to build a "world-class" military provides a major imperative for the PLA to complete organizational reforms designed to facilitate integrated joint operations. Acquisitions and the fielding of new weapon systems and platforms, along with the introduction of advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, could enable the PLA to build a military that is, in qualitative terms, a peer in some ways of that of the United States. Military thinkers have expressed the view that the PLA should develop a force that surpasses in quality that of the United States, rather than merely follow its lead as in years past. This does not mean, however, that China has any ambition to build a force that replicates that of the United States in its distribution around the globe. Under most plausible scenarios, China will continue to prioritize the development of military advantage in the Asia-Pacific theater. It could develop a blend of military, law enforcement, and defense contractors and collaborate with client state militaries to provide security along BRI routes beyond Asia. 
10
10
In all crisis situations and contingencies involving the militaries of the United States and its allies, the PLA coordinates closely and strictly adheres to central directives to achieve objectives and control risk.
Fully prepare to execute combat operations against U.S. military forces and against U.S. proxies.
Operational units, fully capable of carrying out a full range of operations and activities to bolster the interests of China and its clients, weaken those of the United States and its allies in a manner that minimizes risk of escalation.
New doctrines, concepts, and tactics would be required to carry out more-risky operations involving conflict with proxies of the United States and its allies and partners. These might draw inspiration from U.S. counterinsurgency doctrines and special forces operations. The conduct of proxy conflict might also incorporate unorthodox troop types, including defense contractors, host nation militias, and other nonuniformed personnel. Finding ways of achieving military objectives and managing the risks of escalation while leading diverse troop types in locations far from China's shores would pose challenges unprecedented to the PLA.
The defense strategy presented here is premised on the notion that the Chinese leadership views the competition with the United States as a long-term one, whose center of gravity rests in the economic, technological, and diplomatic domains. From the Chinese perspective, the military plays an ancillary role in supporting the international strategy and deterring the United States from rash actions, but success or failure in the competition will ultimately depend on how well Beijing manages the nonmilitary dimensions of the competition. Of course, this strategic approach is based on the assumptions of a generally stable competition featuring some level of cooperation. A significant shift in the international strategy, most likely in response to the onset of a hostile, antagonistic relationship with the United States, would result in a change in the defense strategy as well.
both of these categories of sources may be reluctant to discuss sensitive topics related to domestic politics or other issues, we supplement analysis of the Chinese materials with our own observations about the posited Chinese competitive strategies.
By a large margin, Chinese official sources regard issues related to domestic development as the most pressing and urgent set of vulnerabilities. Weaknesses in the mode of growth and governance, problems of corruption and malfeasance, and the challenge of meeting the rising expectations of the people all pose formidable challenges to CCP rule. Should the central leadership fail to resolve these domestic difficulties, China's ability to compete with the United States could be severely impaired. However, Chinese official documents and commentary also recognize major potential vulnerabilities in the international and defense strategies to achieve the China Dream. Failure to perform adequately in these domains could also limit the country's ability to compete.
The imperative to achieve the China Dream serves as a major source of domestic political legitimacy for the CCP. Most polls and scholarly studies suggest that the CCP enjoys strong domestic support, in part resulting from the party's deliverance of sustained growth and emphasis on nationalism. 
1
Although Chinese leaders perceive a variety of possibly favorable trends that raise the prospect of achieving the China Dream, they also regard the outcome as far from certain. Chinese officials and academics have identified a slew of vulnerabilities that they worry could derail the country's revitalization if not properly managed. The most threatening vulnerabilities stem from the country's domestic situation and are generally economic and development-related in nature. The 19th Party Congress report warned that the people have evolved "higher demands" for "material and cultural life," as well as for "rule of law, fairness, justice, safety, and the environment."

China's international strategy for U.S. competition carries several vulnerabilities related to its efforts to shape a favorable international environment and put the United States at a disadvantage. These may be grouped according to the "foreign policy framework" introduced in Chapter Three. Authoritative sources also discuss international threats to China's development, which may be interpreted as a type of vulnerability. If China fails to control these threats, the damage to the nation's interests could be considerable. This, in turn, could impact the nation's ability to compete with the United States. Several of the more prominent vulnerabilities mentioned in the Chinese sources include the following:
Major powers. The strong emphasis placed on the strategic value of China's relationship with Russia suggests that Beijing regards collaboration with Moscow as critical to its international strategy. China's dependence on Russia as the only collaborator among major powers means that Beijing's international position would weaken significantly if its partnership with Russia were to be ruptured. Chinese officials have accordingly shown considerable sensitivity to efforts by the U.S. government to improve relations with Russia. When U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Russian President Vladimir Putin in 2019, Wang Yi anxiously warned the United States against trying to weaken China-Russia ties. 
6
Periphery. A major vulnerability in Beijing's strategy for the Asia-Pacific region, from the view of Chinese leaders, lies in the resistance of countries in the region to Chinese leadership. In his 2013 work forum on diplomacy to the periphery, Xi Jinping acknowledged the country's lack of appeal. He accordingly called on officials to do more to "warm the hearts of others so that neighboring countries will become even friendlier." He hoped that outreach would lead the region to "identify more with us" and "render more support." 7 Such comments reveal the recognition that failure to consolidate the Asia-Pacific as China's geographic base of support would dramatically undercut its ability to compete for global leadership. A variety of polls suggest that the United States still retains considerable appeal as a partner in the region, although the support is hardly uniform and China's appeal has grown. 
8
Multilateral. The principal vulnerabilities related to the pursuit of leadership in multilateral organizations lies in the possibility that Chinese-led initiatives prove no more effective than U.S.-led ones. As noted in Chapter Six, Chinese officials and commentators have criticized U.S. leadership for its many failings and trumpeted the supposed superiority of Beijing-led efforts. In its desire to contrast the tendency of the United States and a "small group of countries" to dominate multilateral organizations, Beijing has claimed that its advocacy of a more "democratic" form of international politics is "more just" and more effective. However, Chinese-led organizations have come under criticism for many failings. In the SCO, for example, the inclusion of India and other skeptics of Chinese power has complicated Beijing's ability to dominate the organization and raised questions about the effectiveness 8 Laura Silver, Kat Devlin, and Christine Huang, "International Views of China Are Mixed," Pew Research Center, December 5, 2019. 9 Li Daguang [李大光], "Li Daguang: China's 'No Alliances' Principle Doesn't Mean We Shouldn't Make Friends [李大光:中国不结盟并不意味着不结交朋友]," Global Times [环 球时报], February 27, 2012. of a group so divided.

11
Global governance domains. As a rising power, China faces the same vulnerability that other rising powers have faced: It labors under the shadow of the incumbent power, in this case the United States. In terms of global discourse, Chinese scholars have bemoaned the world's tendency to promote Western values, terms, and norms. A perceived backlash to China's authoritarian behavior and relentless propaganda in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic underscores the severe challenges China continues to face in shaping global discourse and norms.

In terms of the defense component of the posited Chinese strategy for U.S. competition, major vulnerabilities lie in the missions related to protection of sovereignty and overseas interests. The military's mission related to shaping a favorable security environment has weaknesses that could hamper the nation's China Dream prospects if mishandled.
China's security interests remain vulnerable to U.S. power in two principal ways. First, there is a risk that U.S. involvement in any contingency along China's periphery could escalate into a broader war with the United States that Beijing has understandably been reluctant to engage in. Second, China's antagonists could exploit this fear of Beijing's by engaging in provocative behavior that results in setbacks in China's effort to consolidate control of its interests. A common refrain in Chinese commentary on the U.S.-China competition concerns the risk of a turn toward a contest featuring high levels of hostility or even conflict. As researcher Wu Xinbo observed, the "major challenge facing both sides is how to manage and guide the competition" so that it avoids becoming a "destructive competition."

In the maritime domain, China similarly faces vulnerabilities in its ability to control disputed regions in the East and South China Seas. Growing tensions with the United States raise the risk that the two nations could find themselves in a crisis started by incidents in the first island chain. If such a situation occurred, Beijing would find itself with a difficult decision. As with Taiwan, the context of the great-power competition raises the stakes in any stand-off. Beijing might find itself under pressure to take aggressive steps in a crisis, raising the possibility of a disastrous miscalculation.
Overseas interests are less likely to become a liability in the U.S.-China competition, so long as the contest remains peaceful. The United States has little incentive to harm China's overseas citizens or their assets. However, the lack of PLA assets abroad and the vulnerability of Chinese people and their assets remain vexing security challenges for Beijing. China has benefited in the past from "free riding" on U.S. willingness to provide security for global commerce, but Washington need not continue this. If the United States opted not to help China provide security and stability in areas featuring its assets, then Beijing would have no choice but to step up investments and resource commitments to better protect its overseas interests. A withholding of U.S. cooperation on some shared threats, especially in the Middle East and Africa, would leave China considerably more exposed to different transnational threats. Similarly, closer partnership between the United States and India would leave China's shipping lanes along the Indian Ocean vulnerable to Indian pressure.
Should China turn more aggressive in the competition and opt to back client states in proxy conflicts with the United States and its allies, China would face another set of liabilities. The inexperience and weak power projection of the PLA could lead to disastrous performances and disappointment with Chinese military assistance. This could, in turn, weaken the appeal of Chinese patronage and its influence more generally.
Beyond its strategic missions, China's competitive strategy in the defense domain also suffers from the fact that the PLA remains unproven. The ambition to develop the world's premier force will not persuade anyone until the Chinese military can demonstrate its superiority in a decisive manner. The combat inexperience, persistent corruption, and incomplete nature of its reorganization all provide ample reasons to doubt the PLA's ability to achieve its vaunted goals. 
19
In sum, China's ability to compete with the United States faces numerous challenges, only some of which Beijing has the power to influence directly. Ultimately, the prospects for China's ability to outcompete the United States will depend on how well both countries manage their considerable domestic challenges. Beijing appears to face the more formidable obstacles, given the structural weaknesses of its political system, economy, and demographics. However, even if Beijing can overcome these, it faces serious liabilities in its international and domestic strategies. Most notably, Beijing's ability to compete with the United States would weaken considerably if Chinese-Russian relations turned antagonistic and if the United States and European Union formed a stronger partnership. Suspicion of Chinese power in the Asia-Pacific and the as-yet-unproven quality of Chinese international leadership also underscore the disadvantages that China has as the rising power. In the security domain, a polarizing competition will exacerbate the difficulty and risks of Chinese efforts to consolidate control over Taiwan and disputed maritime territories. The contest heightens the stakes for China to demonstrate its power and superiority in any showdown with the United States, which could incentivize disastrous and reckless behavior in a crisis. Growing tension with the United States also could disincentivize it to help China address security problems in regions featuring many PRC citizens and their assets, exposing China to greater threat abroad. And the unproven nature of the PLA raises questions about its ambition to build an untested world-class military.
For the first time in centuries, China appears poised to realize the vision of national revitalization that has captivated its political leaders and thinkers for so long. From one of the world's poorest countries in the 1970s to the second-largest economy in the world, China has experienced astounding growth. The country's population has experienced an unprecedented degree of prosperity, and the nation's military stands as one of the world's most powerful. Yet, according to the statements of Chinese leaders, national rejuvenation is not yet complete. Incomes have certainly increased, but overall per capita income remains low, and the environmental and social costs of older industries render the current mode of growth unsustainable. Recovery of lost territories, most notably that of Taiwan, remains elusive. And the pressures of economic deceleration, rising expectations, a fragmenting international order, and intensifying international competition threaten the nation's fragile gains.
China's prospects depend, in part, on its ability to arrange the economic and political order of Asia to ensure steady growth, stability, and security for its interests. Prospects could improve further still if the world's second-largest economy had a stronger ability than its competitors to shape the terms of global finance, trade, and investment. But ascending to the position of regional primacy and international leadership needed to exercise such influence presents a significant obstacle: an incumbent power eager to maintain the same privileges and influences-the United States. As we have shown, Chinese thinkers and national leaders recognized competition with the United States to be inevitable and necessary for the country to realize its vision of the China Dream. They have formulated strategies and policies to improve the nation's ability to achieve the China Dream. But the government has not issued any specific document outlining a strategy for U.S. competition. Nevertheless, we have argued in this report that the competition is foremost on the minds of strategists and policymakers who contemplate the nation's foreign policy and defense strategies. Drawing from authoritative sources and supplemental scholarly writings, we have posited an explicit strategy that might illuminate how Beijing approaches the competition.
While a comprehensive consideration of a Chinese approach to U.S. competition would include domestic development strategies, we have confined our research to the international and defense dimensions. In Chapter Two, we underscored the importance of overarching positive and negative trends for all Chinese strategies and policies, including those to manage U.S. relations. We also emphasized the importance of the China Dream as an end point for all strategy and policy. Any posited strategy for U.S. competition, we argued, should be nested within the broader strategy to achieve national rejuvenation. In Chapter Three, we reviewed China's international strategy and the reasons China seeks both a position of primacy at the regional level and greater international leadership at the global level. We surveyed the current foreign policy directives aimed at shaping a favorable international order for China's ascent. In Chapter Four, we similarly provided essential context by examining the country's defense strategy. We reviewed the central leadership's directives to the military to provide greater strategic support to the diplomatic and other tasks of laying the foundations for Chinese international leadership.
In Chapter Five, we explored how Chinese officials and analysts regard the competition with the United States. Chinese sources have tended to highlight structural drivers, most importantly the relative decline in Western power and rise of power in the non-West, as well as the country's changing needs as a large, maturing economy. Chinese leaders and commentators have also articulated a number of grievances about U.S. international leadership. Despite the criticisms, however, Chinese sources appear to regard great-power war as having a low likelihood, owing to the primarily economic nature of the contest, higher levels of interdependence, the risks of nuclear warfare, and a shared involvement in the international order. Chapters Seven and Eight described a posited Chinese international and defense strategy for competition with the United States. In these chapters, we proposed possible goals and objectives for China in 2035 that, if achieved, could enable the country to overcome U.S. resistance without conflict and position itself to achieve national revitalization. As was pointed out in Chapter Nine, however, China faces formidable domestic, international, and defense vulnerabilities. Failure to achieve key goals could leave the country in a weaker position, and severe setbacks could render unlikely China's ability to surpass U.S. power.
As proposed in this analysis, a major challenge for China is moving from a position of the second-most powerful nation to that of the world's most powerful. Often referred to as the problem of power transition, this has historically proven to be a perilous process. In the past, contenders for systemic leadership often depended on the crude and destructive process of large-scale warfare to shatter the power of the incumbent and clear the way for an ascending power. But not all power transitions occurred violently. 
1
The strategy that we have constructed accordingly adheres to a "peaceful" strategy consistent with policies outlined in official documents. But this leaves the problem unresolved: How does China surpass and subordinate the United States without conflict? Past examples of peaceful power transition have tended to feature one country that clearly and decisively outperformed its rival in economic, technological, and military terms. For example, the United States had surpassed Great Britain as early as the 1870s in per capita income and productivity before overtaking it as a global leader after World War I. Similarly, the Soviet Union abandoned the Cold War, in part, because Moscow had concluded that it had fallen hopelessly behind the United States.

In this last section, we would like to explore some of the implications of this report for the U.S. government and DoD. First, we argue that this analysis has underscored the enduring importance of U.S. alliances and partnerships. Second, the research has emphasized the importance of strengthening the U.S. leadership role in the Asia-Pacific. Third, the report has noted the importance of building U.S. partnerships with countries in the developing world. Fourth, reinvigorated leadership in multilateral venues can help shape Chinese choices and mute Beijing's efforts to shape those organizations in a direction detrimental to U.S. interests. Fourth, the analysis has raised questions about how the broader competition might change the dynamics of crises or confrontations that involve Chinese and U.S. military forces. More attention may need to be paid to the many creative ways in which Beijing could direct military action to gain positional advantages in a longterm competition. The research also raises the importance of finding ways to stabilize the security competition. America's interests may be best served with a balance of competitive and cooperative activities with China.
The research has reaffirmed the importance of America's network of alliances and partnerships. China recognizes this network to be a tremendous strategic advantage for the United States, one that Beijing has struggled to match. To improve its own prospects, China will be best served if it can facilitate or at least not impede the weakening of U.S. alliances and partnerships worldwide. A world order based on networks of partners, as Beijing has proposed, is one that would put the United States at a growing disadvantage compared with China. The United States has a compelling incentive to bolster its international influence and leadership by nurturing its alliances.
This report has drawn attention to the importance of initiatives undertaken by the past two U.S. presidential administrations to shore up U.S. influence and leadership in the Asia-Pacific region. This remains a critical domain of U.S.-China competition. Should Washington scale down its commitment to the region, China is likely to find that a consolidation of regional leadership would accelerate its ability to contest U.S. leadership at the global level.
The importance of areas outside the Indo-Pacific and of developing countries as a constituency for international leadership deserves emphasis as well. China's cultivation of client states and influence in the Middle East, Africa, and Latin America could directly affect the ability of the United States to compete in the Indo-Pacific and at the global level. As one example, Chinese success in consolidating influence in the Middle East could affect the ability and willingness of such countries as Japan and India to support measures that constrain Chinese power. There may be hard limits to how much the United States can afford to divert resources from the Middle East. At the very least, closer coordination between competitive strategies, both within and outside the Indo-Pacific, will be essential. In terms of developing countries, China's lack of allies leaves it in a weak position to challenge the United States. Washington could strengthen its hand further by bolstering its relationships with those states that have only recently experienced substantial growth in GDP. Given the long-term trends favoring the rise of the non-West, cultivation of support in the developing world appears prudent.
While multilateral organizations and institutions for global governance have endured considerable criticism for their many failings and inefficiencies, this analysis has concluded that engagement with those venues will remain an important component of regional and global leadership. Greater U.S. investments in shaping and reinvigorating international institutions and multilateral venues can help consolidate U.S. influence. The goal here, as in other areas, is to weaken the force of Chinese criticisms by demonstrating responsive, effective international U.S. leadership, thereby reducing the incentive for other countries to back Chinese over U.S. leadership.
In terms of defense strategy, the posited approach has emphasized the importance of deterrence, crisis management, and military diplomacy in the competition. As presented here, China's defense strategy could expand the geographic range of potential crisis situations and contingencies. Along the BRI routes and as part of the effort to expand a network of client states worldwide, China faces a strong incentive to offer arms sales, military training, and other forms of assistance. Such transactions have already been increasing in recent years. In coming years, China may take on even more security responsibilities to protect its BRI investments. An imperative to demonstrate China's credibility as a patron to client nations could incentivize PLA forces to carry out more-frequent acts of military diplomacy that coerce U.S. allies or partners, or even to contemplate the development of alliance-like obligations.
These possibilities suggest that the U.S. military faces a compelling need to bolster conventional deterrence and invest in the capabilities to ensure the superiority of the armed forces in the future. A focus on traditional deterrence through conventional military superiority remains the bedrock of any security strategy to counter China. A robust U.S. military capability to defend the interests of the United States and those of its allies and partners provides a critical source of U.S. credibility as a leader in the Indo-Pacific. A strong conventional military capability is also essential for incentivizing regional powers, such as Japan, Vietnam, and others, to resist Chinese coercion and demands. By contrast, clear evidence that the United States had lost the military advantage could persuade other countries to either adopt a position of tacit submission and accommodation to Chinese demands or step up a potentially destabilizing arms race to shore up their defense.
Ensuring the capability to deter China in the short term will remain critical, but investment to ensure long-term advantage will be critical as well. Sustaining investment in the future capabilities of the U.S. military will be essential, not just for ensuring the long-term credibility of U.S. deterrence, but also for bolstering the nation's position in the broader competition. Finding ways to better protect U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific and in the cyber, space, and other domains can backstop broader competitive efforts. DoD may need to invest in maintaining a significant presence in the Middle East and Africa to complement the competition in the Indo-Pacific.
Strengthening U.S. conventional capabilities and investing in a technologically advanced future force remain critical tasks. But military diplomacy could take greater importance as well. The diplomatic struggle for influence and leadership suggests that the U.S. military could play an important role in incentivizing cooperation with the United States and helping countries resist unreasonable Chinese demands. U.S. experience in military advisory missions and assistance can help strengthen diplomatic partnerships and counter Chinese influence efforts. The provision of public goods, such as security for key shipping lanes and humanitarian aid in the face of disaster, can help maintain the appeal of the United States as the global leader.
As the competition intensifies, U.S. military planners may need to expand the portfolio of possible contingencies involving China. The flashpoints between the United States and China at the time of this writing may not be the same in the future, or they may coexist alongside new ones. Scenarios involving Taiwan, the East and South China Seas, and cyberspace tend to occupy military planners, but these issues may be augmented by new ones that arise from China's efforts to exert greater leadership, especially along its BRI routes and with client states on other continents. As just one illustration, China's willingness to court Iran despite U.S. sanctions raises the possibility, over time, of proxy conflicts between forces backed by China and those backed by the United States in the Middle East. The more that China assumes the role of patron for client states, the higher the likelihood that at some point, PLA forces or Chinese-backed host nation forces could engage in hostile acts against parties aligned with the United States.
The appeal and feasibility of Chinese military efforts to resolve longstanding issues, such as Taiwan, may need to be reexamined through the lens of the broader competition as well. From Beijing's perspective, the potential cost and risk of escalation in war increases the more that the competition with the United States intensifies. Thus, China may opt to delay the resolution of Taiwan's status and that of other disputed regions until it has prevailed in its competition with the United States. This might mean that Beijing tolerates a stable crossstrait relationship premised on Taiwan's rejection of formal independence so long as the United States retains the international upper hand and a credible military intervention option. However, the calculus could change should China succeed in gaining a decisive competitive advantage in international and regional leadership and in its military posture near Taiwan. Similarly, China may regard as satisfactory a continued reliance on gray-zone tactics that incrementally change the status quo within the first island chain in a low-risk manner while it prioritizes efforts to weaken the U.S. position in Asia and elsewhere. To maximize deterrence and the protection of U.S. interests, the defense and foreign policy dimensions of any U.S. competitive strategy may need to be even more closely coordinated.
Any Chinese deliberation on how to tailor the controlled use of force in any confrontation involving U.S.-backed forces would carry serious risks, of course. The dangers of escalation and miscalculation paradoxically underscore the importance of finding ways for both countries to cooperate and ease tensions as a component of successful competition. The development of a strategy that includes some degree of reassurance and cooperation could help stabilize the competition and reduce risks of miscalculation and dangerous incidents. Moreover, as the international security environment experiences more fragmentation and breakdown, collaboration between the world's two largest powers could prove nearly unavoidable in any case.
The return of great-power competition after decades of unchallenged U.S. global primacy has introduced new challenges and risks. Washington enters the contest burdened by fiscal strains, domestic political polarization, and competing international and domestic priorities. These constraints raise the imperative of developing effective strategies that allocate resources efficiently and effectively. The derivation of a Chinese strategy can, hopefully, provide a useful tool for that important task.
The U.S. government and public lack consensus on whether China poses a threat.  
As part of its effort to renovate the international order, China seeks to gradually displace the United States as the most globally influential power.

The United States agrees to revise policies to accommodate Chinese preferences on Taiwan and other core interests. The United States refrains from interfering in China's internal affairs. U.S. involvement in confrontations between China and U.S. allies and partners in Asia is limited at most to symbolic gestures. The United States respects the interests of China's client states and generally refrains from policies that antagonize Beijing.

China's ability to outcompete the United States is far from determined. The outcome of the contest between the two great powers is likely to be affected by many factors, some of which lie beyond the scope of foreign policy and defense strategy. The most important factors that could determine the trajectory of the contest are likely to be those related to the domestic situations of each country. Whether China and the United States can overcome their respective economic and political challenges and build comprehensive national power superior to that of the competitor could prove decisive.
The vulnerabilities and strengths of each country could play significant roles as well. This chapter considers some of the potential vulnerabilities in the Chinese international and defense strategies reviewed in previous chapters. As used in this study, a vulnerability is a set of weaknesses that have the potential to otherwise undermine or significantly impair China's ability to prevail in competition with the United States. Our concern here is with vulnerabilities in the strategy as might be viewed from the Chinese perspective. For source materials, we consider the documents issued by government officials and writings by Chinese analysts and commentators. The official sources rarely discuss possible weaknesses in China's competition with the United States directly, but they do discuss liabilities in national, international, and defense strategies that could bear directly on the U.S. competition. Chinese commentators and scholars are more likely to discuss possible vulnerabilities in the competition with the United States, but such writings carry far less weight in terms of authoritativeness. Because
In this appendix, we offer some sample objectives and subobjectives for the international dimension of the derived U.S. competition strategy, using the Chinese framework. The subobjectives provide a sense of the more specific types of goals that China might pursue. These are not meant to be exhaustive or definitive. They merely provide a starting point for analysts who may want to develop more specific indicators for evaluation and assessment. 
The United States has modified policies to accommodate China's demands regarding its core interests.  Chinese-led multilateral organizations play a greater role in managing regional security and the regional economy than U.S.-led efforts.
1. CICA, SCO, 6PT, ARF, etc. become key venues for managing security issues in Asia. 2. The ASEAN Free Trade Area, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, AIIB, and BRI all play a greater role in organizing the region's economy than U.S.-led efforts.
Regional organizations accommodate Chinese norm-, rule-, and agenda-setting.
1. PRC officials dominate agenda-, norm-, and rule-setting or frustrate U.S. efforts in the Asian Development Bank, ASEAN, and other regional multilateral organizations. 2. Regional multilateral organizations consistently employ language and terminology that reflect China's preferences on core interest issues like Taiwan, Tibet, and human rights. 
China seeks to renovate the existing international order, strengthening and refining those institutions that facilitate Chinese leadership and subverting or circumventing those that limit its power. Where existing institutions fail to adequately serve China's needs, Beijing seeks to build alternative institutions. Multilateral organizations include both those at the global level and those at the regional level. China maintains secure defense of space assets.
1. Civilian and military space defense units are capable of defending critical infrastructure from U.S. attack.
PLA capable of launching offensive operations against U.S. space assets.
1. PLA units develop a robust inventory of space weapons that can target U.S. military command, communications, logistics, and civilian infrastructure networks.
ocusing on the international and defense dimensions of U.S.-China competition, the authors of this report make three contributions.
First, they intend this report to serve as a planning tool by positing international and defense strategies that could allow China to outcompete the United States. Second, they mean to educate readers on Chinese strategy and policy processes. Third, the authors seek to encourage greater public debate about the nature and stakes of the competition.
As presented by the authors, China's international strategy aims to establish the country's primacy in the Asia-Pacific region and leadership of the international order. The international strategy presented seeks to achieve this end state through peaceful methods, although it does not rule out the possibilities of militarized crises or even conflicts of a limited scope, such as proxy wars. The core of the proposed international strategy is a reliance on China's economic prowess and diplomatic maneuver to put Beijing into a position of advantage from which it cannot be dislodged by the United States.
A complementary defense strategy would aim to constrain Washington's ability to forestall or prevent its own eclipse by building a superior Chinese military that renders the risks of military conflict intolerably high. A major Chinese military responsibility would be to support diplomatic efforts to shape a favorable international environment by building strong security ties with client states and discrediting or weakening the appeal of the United States as an alternative.
