We cannot say with assurance that aid will place Russia on a path toward normality, and it cannot be proven that China's intertwining with the world economic system will secure a peaceful future.
Whether China emerges as a major military competitor to the United States will depend on factors we cannot control.
Particular circumstances will and should affect our tactical judgments about particular overtures (for example, when and under what conditions to provide funding for Russia, or to admit China to the World Trade Organization).
Our overarching strategy should be rooted in the proposition that investing in the development of China and Russia as full partners in the world system will be more effective, less expensive, and vastly more benign than another arms race.
