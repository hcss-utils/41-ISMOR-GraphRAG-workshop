The Americans and the French did not bask in a brotherly bond of camaraderie through the century that followed their respective Revolutions.
Such conflicts as the Napoleonic Wars and the war with Prussia dominated the history of the 19th century in France as did the Civil War and western expansion in the United States.
During this time, the world recognized France as one of the great powers and it actively pursued global expansion through colonialism.
The United States struggled for identity and concentrated on economic and continental growth.
Sea power and trade provided both nations the avenue for such national objectives.
Piracy, especially in the early 1800's, was a widespread occurrence.
American sea captains frequently pointed angry fingers, legitimately, toward French vessels and accused the owners of high sea robberies.
Shots were often fired as an attempt at deterrence or in desperate self-preservation.
