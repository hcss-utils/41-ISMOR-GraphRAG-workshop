In Lithuania, the National Defence Volunteer Forces organized as a TDF performs tasks related to anti-tank and urban operations.
Additionally, Lithuania has another volunteer organization, which prepares young people to join to the National Defence Volunteer Forces later on.
In both countries, Ministries of Defence increases spending on TDF matters in order to provide better equipment, training, readiness capability, and integration with professional forces.
Demographic crises affect the manning of TDF, so there are not enough volunteers to fill vacant position in armed forces.
After the annexation of Crimea, public interest increased and more citizens signed for professional or paramilitary forces, but the imminent threat from Russia reduced willingness to join the reserve or active formations.
