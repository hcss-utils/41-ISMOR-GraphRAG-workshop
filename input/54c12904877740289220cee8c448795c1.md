The United States was recognized as the sole international superpower following the Cold War and has since based its grand strategy on a universally acknowledged command of the global commons.
At the turn of the 21st century, the U.S. was fully dominant in its command of sea and space, and largely uncontested in its command of the air.
However, in the years since, China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea have made significant military advances in all three arenas and the global picture has expanded to include cyberspace and nonstate actors.
This work argues that the U.S. no longer commands the sea; offers implications for naval doctrine, strategy, and acquisitions; and provides vital lessons to inform U.S. grand strategy.
