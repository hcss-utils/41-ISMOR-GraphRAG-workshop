Because of the permissive operational environment in Afghanistan, Iraq, Horn of Africa, and even Libya, RPAs have enjoyed heavy utiliza tion.
This trend will continue for similar environments in the future.
However, in intense combat environments where the electromagnetic spectrum is compromised and not dominated by the United States or its allies, the utilization of remotely piloted assets could be extremely lim ited.
In such peerlevel conflicts with China or Russia, manned assets could potentially be the only useful platforms until the electromagnetic spectrum and air dominance are finally established.
Sending the manned fighter or bomber the way of the dinosaur would prove impru dent.
As has been our mantra for as long as I can remember, flexibilityin this case, piloted and remotely piloted-is the key to airpower.
