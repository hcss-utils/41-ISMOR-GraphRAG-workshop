While this statement had some interesting elements (e.g., the explicit expectation that U.S. nuclear weapons might help deter rogue states from using chemical or biological weapons), it was at once too vague and too specific to make a compelling case for what kind of nuclear capabilities the United States needs in the current world and why.
It was too vague because it does not explain what explicit strategy the United States would rely on to deal with, for example, a revanchist Russia.
Nor did it explain why lower levels of nuclear forces could not achieve the ends that Secretary Warner described.
It was too specific because it appeared to limit the role of U.S. nuclear weapons in nonnuclear situations to deterring use of biological or chemical weapons.
Essentially, this policy amounted to "treading water" while the United States figured out what it wanted to do with nuclear weapons in the future.
