This report was written to support research by Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) Toronto that is designed to enhance the ability of the Canadian Forces (CF) to plan, implement, and evaluate "influence" campaigns in future expeditionary operations. It contributes to a one-year scoping study that is being conducted to better define the CF's requirements for further research in this area. The report is based on a review of relevant academic disciplines and provides a broad, representative coverage of the area of investigation by clarifying the range of influence activities and providing a classification scheme for those activities. Canadian approaches to influence operations in the last half of the 20 th century and the early years of the 21 st are a particular focus of this work. Concluding material includes findings on multi-agency planning in the contemporary environment and suggestions for future research in the area of influence operations.
The notion of influencing adversaries, allies and neutrals to achieve one's goals with the minimum cost in blood and treasure is an ancient one. The writings of Sun Tzu and Thucydides, which are still used widely today in senior officer professional military education, show that actions like feints or demonstrations, threats and ultimata, as forms of coercion and deterrence, were all used as stratagems to influence adversaries, friends and neutrals. The ancients did not construct any specific models for applying their stratagems of influence; however, they used the stratagems regularly to achieve their goals while minimizing their losses, when possible. The classical writers on military thought, such as Clausewitz and Corbett, developed ideas related to influence operations, but the modern era of influence operations began with writings of the airpower theorists in the early 20 th century and then evolved in the writings of their successors in the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries.
The use of influence to achieve objectives is a constant theme in "small wars" and counterinsurgency operations. Generally speaking, Western approaches to small wars have evolved since the 19 th century so that non-kinetic effects have gradually replaced kinetic effects in the attempt to influence others. Asian approaches to small wars use all the stratagems of influence operations, but the Asian approaches do not rely on technology or explicit statements of doctrine to the same extent that Western armed forces do. For Asian practitioners of small wars, as well as Soviet theorists of war, the use of influence is implied throughout the whole of their political and military discourse.
Currently, the term "influence operations" is being used to define a fairly narrow set of activities, largely in a land force context, at the operational-level and tactical-level. However, there is a lack consistency among current conceptual models and ideas related to "influence operations," in Western doctrine. Some commonality is, nevertheless, visible in some Western doctrine on influence operations. While British doctrine uses the less restrictive term "activity," instead of the more restrictive term "operation" found in most US doctrine, the general notion of influence activities is compatible in many ways with the US term. Furthermore, the framework to coordinate all activities related to influencing a target audience within a theatre of operations is based on ubiquitous US doctrine.
Culture and historical experience, both national and service, affect how influence is characterized by various organizations and writers. For example, the practice of describing influence in terms of an operation, as in the term "influence operation," is common in armies who, since the last two decades of the 20 th century, have been strongly influenced by the paradigm of operational art. In this army paradigm, campaigns are sequenced with the conduct of various operations, which are limited by time and resources.
Navies, on the other hand, see the application of influence differently. From their perspective, naval assets are constantly exerting influence. From a ship's visit to a foreign port with a trade delegation aboard, to blockades, to full scale warfare, navies see themselves as constantly exercising influence along a continuum of violence.
Western air forces also view influence differently from armies because air forces have traditionally sought to link tactical actions (or outputs) to strategic outcomes without necessarily applying the operational art. For most Western air forces their current approach to operations, Effects Based Operations, is essentially about influencing various actors based on experience and theories that have evolved from the beginning of the 20 th century. The most recent NATO information operations doctrine appears to accept applying EBO to IO; however, US and Canadian land forces have not wholeheartedly done so. And their adoption of the term Effects Based Approach to Operations is a deliberate doctrinal statement to distance themselves from the air force EBO concept.
Canadian perspectives of attaining strategic influence arose from the crucible of the Second World War and are grounded in the historical experience of earning membership in a wartime alliance. Despite popular images of Canada as an unbiased and neutral nation, the reality of Canadian participation in the international community is grounded in pragmatism and a desire to maintain influence with global reach.
The experience of senior Canadian commanders in recent influence activities has been diverse, depending on the physical environment and the coalition or other organization in which the experience took place. Despite this diversity of experience, there are some common threads in it, including Canada's ready acceptance into coalition leadership positions based on competence, enlightened leadership and management techniques; the value of Canadian national culture with its characteristics of accepting diverse cultures associated with its traditions of bilingualism and multiculturalism; and the value of Canada's military culture with its history of alliance and UN operations and its judicious exploitation of available technology.
In order to address the key issues identified in the report, it recommended that research be pursued in the following areas: 1) clarifying the concepts related to influence operations and then identifying how influence activities might fit within a more rigorous lexicon; 2) examining the cultural dimension to influence activities, in both our own culture and v targets' cultures; 3) investigating measures of effects/effectiveness (MOEs) to support influence activities; 4) seeing how influence operations could fit into the operational art paradigm, for example, creating campaign design tools that incorporate influence operations explicitly and more completely into campaign design process than is currently the case with existing tools; 5) documenting and analyzing the experiences of senior Canadian commanders with influence activities, particularly in the post-9/11 era.
Le présent rapport a été rédigé pour appuyer les recherches que fait Recherche et développement pour la défense Canada (RDDC) Toronto pour améliorer la capacité de planification, de mise en oeuvre et d'évaluation des campagnes d'« influence » des Forces canadiennes (FC) au cours des futures opérations expéditionnaires. Il contribue à une étude de délimitation d'un an qui permettra de mieux définir la nécessité pour les FC de poursuivre les recherches dans ce domaine. Le rapport est fondé sur un examen des disciplines pertinentes et offre une couverture large et représentative du champ de l'enquête en précisant l'étendue des activités d'influence et en fournissant un plan de classification de ces activités. La façon d'aborder les opérations d'influence qu'a utilisée le Canada au cours de la dernière moitié du XX e siècle et au début du XXI e siècle met tout particulièrement l'accent sur ces travaux. La conclusion comprend des résultats de la planification multi-organismes dans l'environnement contemporain et des propositions concernant les recherches futures dans le domaine des opérations d'influence.
L'idée d'influencer les adversaires, les alliés et les neutres pour atteindre ses objectifs avec le moins de pertes humaines et financières possibles est ancienne. Les écrits de Sun Tzu et de Thucydides, qui sont encore largement utilisés aujourd'hui dans la formation militaire des officiers supérieurs, montrent que les mesures telles que les feintes ou les démonstrations, les menaces et les ultimatums, en tant que formes de coercition et de dissuasion, ont toutes été utilisées en tant que stratagèmes pour influencer les adversaires, les amis et les neutres. Les anciens n'ont pas construit de modèle précis pour appliquer leurs stratagèmes d'influence ; ils utilisaient toutefois régulièrement les stratagèmes pour atteindre leurs objectifs tout en réduisant leurs pertes au minimum, lorsque c'était possible. Les auteurs classiques sur la pensée militaire, tels que Clausewitz et Corbett, ont développé des idées se rapportant aux opérations d'influence, mais l'ère moderne des opérations d'influence a commencé avec les écrits des théoriciens de la force aérienne du début du XXe siècle et a évolué dans les écrits de leurs successeurs à la fin du XXe et au début du XXI e siècles. L'utilisation de l'influence en vue de l'atteinte d'objectifs est un thème qui revient constamment dans les « guerres de petite envergure » et les opérations antiinsurrectionnelles. Généralement parlant, les façons d'aborder les guerres de petite envergure de l'occident ont évolué depuis le XIX e siècle, si bien que les effets non cinétiques ont graduellement remplacé les effets cinétiques dans la tentative en vue d'influencer les autres. Dans leurs approches des guerres de petite envergure, les Asiatiques utilisent tous les stratagèmes des opérations d'influence, mais ils ne comptent pas sur la technologie ou sur les déclarations catégoriques de doctrine dans la même mesure que les forces armées de l'Ouest. L'utilisation de l'influence est sous-entendue dans l'ensemble du discours politique et militaire des praticiens asiatiques des guerres de petite envergure et des théoriciens soviétiques de la guerre. vii À l'heure actuelle, on utilise l'expression « opérations d'influence » pour décrire un ensemble assez étroit d'activités qui se situent largement dans le contexte des forces terrestres aux niveaux opérationnel et tactique. Il y a toutefois un manque de cohérence dans les idées et les modèles conceptuels se rapportant aux opérations d'influence dans la doctrine de l'Ouest. Une certaine communité est néanmoins visible dans certaines doctrines occidentales sur les opérations d'influence. Si la doctrine britannique utilise le terme « activité » moins restrictif plutôt que le terme « opération » plus restrictif qu'on trouve dans presque toute la doctrine des États-Unis, l'idée générale des activités d'influence concorde à bien des égards avec le terme américain. De plus, le cadre de coordination des activités relatives à la façon d'influencer un public cible dans un théâtre d'opérations est fondée sur l'omniprésente doctrine américaine.
L'expérience culturelle et historique, tant nationale que militaire, montre comment l'influence est caractérisée par divers organismes et auteurs. Par exemple, la pratique de décrire l'influence du point de vue d'une opération, comme dans le terme « opération d'influence », est fréquente dans les armées qui, depuis les deux dernières décennies du XX e siècle, ont été fortement influencées par le paradigme de l'art opérationnel. Dans ce paradigme de l'armée, les campagnes sont enchaînées avec la conduite de diverses opérations, qui sont limitées par le temps et les ressources.
Dans les forces maritimes, par contre, on envisage l'application de l'influence autrement. À leur point de vue, les ressources maritimes exercent constamment de l'influence. De la visite d'un navire à bord duquel il y a une délégation commerciale dans un port étranger jusqu'à la guerre totale, en passant par les blocus, les forces maritimes estiment être constamment en train d'exercer de l'influence dans un continuum de violence.
Les forces aériennes de l'Ouest envisagent aussi l'influence d'une autre façon que les forces terrestres parce qu'elles ont traditionnellement cherché à lier les actions (ou résultats) tactiques aux résultats stratégiques sans nécessairement appliquer l'art opérationnel. L'approche actuelle des opérations de la plupart des forces aériennes de l'Ouest, à savoir les opérations basées sur les effets, consiste essentiellement à influencer divers acteurs en fonction de l'expérience et des théories qui se sont développées depuis le début du XX e siècle. La doctrine la plus récente sur les opérations d'information de l'OTAN semble accepter l'application des opérations basées sur les effets aux opérations d'information; les forces terrestres américaines et canadiennes n'ont toutefois pas fait de même sans réserve et leur adoption du terme « approche opérationnelle basée sur les effets » est une déclaration doctrinale bien pesée leur permettant de prendre leur distance par rapport au concept des opérations basées sur les effets de la force aérienne.
Les perspectives canadiennes sur l'atteinte de l'influence stratégique viennent du creuset de la Seconde Guerre mondiale et sont fondées sur l'expérience historique de l'adhésion à une alliance de temps de guerre. En dépit des images populaires du Canada en tant que pays neutre et impartial, la réalité de la participation canadienne à la société des nations est fondée sur le pragmatisme et sur un désir de conserver une influence qui lui permet de manoeuvrer partout dans le monde. viii Au cours des activités d'influence récente, les commandants supérieurs canadiens ont acquis une expérience diversifiée suivant le milieu physique et la coalition ou les autres organismes au sein desquels ils l'ont acquise. Malgré sa diversité, l'expérience acquise a des points communs, dont l'acceptation facile du Canada à des postes de commandement de la coalition en fonction de la compétence, d'un leadership éclairé et de techniques de gestion, la valeur de la culture nationale du Canada caractérisée par l'acceptation de diverses cultures associées à ses traditions de bilinguisme et de multiculturalisme et la valeur de la culture militaire canadienne avec son histoire d'alliances et d'opérations de l'ONU et son exploitation judicieuse de la technologie disponible.
Pour aborder les principales questions définies dans le rapport, il est à conseiller de poursuivre les recherches dans les domaines suivants : 1) préciser les concepts relatifs aux opérations d'influence et déterminer ensuite comment les activités d'influence peuvent s'intégrer à un lexique plus rigoureux, 2) examiner l'aspect culturel des activités d'influence, tant dans notre propre culture que dans les cultures cibles, 3) étudier les mesures des effets/de l'efficacité soutenant les activités d'influence, 4) examiner la façon dont les opérations d'influence pourraient s'intégrer au paradigme de l'art opérationnel, par exemple créer des outils de conception de campagnes qui incorporent les opérations d'influence dans le processus de conception de campagne explicitement et plus complètement que ce que font actuellement les outils existants, 5) étayer et analyser l'expérience acquise par les commandants supérieurs canadiens dans le domaine des activités d'influence, et surtout au cours de la période postérieure au 11 septembre.
The notion that states and their armed forces attempt to influence the perceptions and behaviour of their adversaries, allies and others in various ways is an ancient one. This notion is at the heart not only of the practice of diplomacy, but also of theories of conflict. At the beginning of the 21 st century the term "influence operations" has been used to define a fairly narrow set of activities, largely in a land force context, at the operational-level and tactical-level. However, as the use of the term evolves, its meaning shows signs of expanding to include its broader historical roots.
This report has been written in support of that part of Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) Toronto's research that is aimed at enhancing the ability of the Canadian Forces (CF) to plan, implement, and evaluate influence 1 campaigns in future expeditionary operations. Owing to the novelty of this research area and the stillnascent CF efforts to build its capacity in this regard, this report will contribute to a oneyear scoping study that is being conducted to better defining the CF's requirements for further research in this area. This report, based on a review of relevant academic disciplines, provides a broad, representative coverage of the area of investigation by clarifying the range of influence activities and providing a classification scheme for those activities.
Conceptions of military operations have been evolving in the post-Cold War era. For example, in a 2005 concept paper, the US Marine Corps introduced the term "Distributed Operations" to portray its operations in the new security environment. "Distributed Operations" has its roots in "decentralized operations" described in the 1940 version of the US Marine Corps Small Wars Manual, which is discussed in more detail later in this paper. While still evolving, the term "Distributed Operations" seems to be displacing "Expeditionary Operations" in the Marine Corps lexicon, as there is no reference in the text of the concept paper to "expeditionary," only a Figure that refers to the need for an "expeditionary culture."

Since the end of the Cold War, the nature of military operations conducted by conventional forces has evolved: they have become longer in duration and more diverse in location and scope; they also require general purpose forces to perform more specialized tasks, and to distribute these tasks across all ranks and billets. This new mission profile is now understood as the 'Long War.' 
5
At the beginning of the 21 st century, the term "influence operations" is starting to gain some currency in the professional military literature and doctrine. The term is not well defined, however, and, when referring to operational-level and tactical-level activities, is generally used as a subset of either psychological operations (PSYOPS) or information operations by those who use the term "influence operations." For example, recent US Air Force doctrine on information operations lists influence operations as a capability of information operations:
The new framework of information operations groups the capabilities of influence

Information operations (IO) are described as the integrated employment of electronic warfare (EW), computer network operations (CNO), psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception (MILDEC), and operations security (OPSEC), in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt, or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own. 
8
Information operations is the employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to affect or defend information and information systems, and to influence decisionmaking.

10
The focus of IO is on the individual decision makers and the decision making process. IO is the ability to adversely influence enemy decision making processes while enhancing and protecting our own. Therefore, for IO to be successful, it demands an ability to understand people, cultures, and motivations. In the context of maneuver warfare, IO attempts to disrupt the observe, orient, decision, action (OODA) loop of the enemy, affecting his ability to act by causing the enemy to receive information that is inaccurate, incomplete, or received at an inopportune time.

INFO OPS [information operations] aims at achieving effects in the virtual and physical space in which information is received, processed and conveyed. It consists of the information itself and information systems. These information systems comprise personnel, technical components, organizational structures and information-based processes that collect, perceive, analyse, assess, create, manipulate, store, retrieve, provide, display, share, transmit and disseminate information.
NATO's use of INFO OPS becomes even more important as the Alliance moves towards Effects Based Operations (EBO) that are designed to influence the will of an adversary or neutrals through the co-ordinated application of military capabilities, in order to achieve desired objectives [emphasis added]. This focus on effects and their influence on behaviour rather than only attrition and targets will clearly require INFO OPS to define desired effects. 
15
The US Air Force currently provides the only detailed definition of the term "influence operations" in publicly available US doctrine. However, its definition of influence operations appears to overlap with that of information operations. Its definition may even contradict US joint doctrine, based on the joint doctrine definition of IO, as the military capabilities of influence operations in the US Air Force doctrine are very similar to the capabilities of IO in joint doctrine, as shown by the emphasized parts of the US Air Force definition:
Influence operations are focused on affecting the perceptions and behaviors of leaders, groups, or entire populations. Influence operations employ capabilities to affect behaviors, protect operations, communicate commander's intent, and project accurate information to achieve desired effects across the cognitive domain. These effects should result in differing behavior or a change in the adversary's decision cycle, which aligns with the commander's objectives. The military capabilities of influence operations are psychological operations (PSYOP), military deception (MILDEC), operations security (OPSEC), counterintelligence (CI) operations, counterpropaganda operations and public affairs (PA) operations. 
18
The fact that the authors of this US Air Force doctrine chose to highlight military capabilities of influence operations that are different from definitions in joint doctrine suggests that the US Air Force may be taking a different approach to influence operations than others. 
19
After developing target sets that affect key decision makers, influence planners then pair Air Force capabilities with those sets to change the behavior of the intended receiver. Photos of bomb craters and destroyed targets do not represent victory-capitulation of the adversary does. In the lexicon of influence operations, a change in observed behavior defines victory-not well-crafted messages or delivered information. 
20
This article appeared in the same year as the US Air Force IO doctrine cited above was published and its title suggests that the US Air Force interpretation of influence operations may be evolving from the tactical and operational levels to the strategic level. Furthermore, the reference to "target sets" implies a connection between influence operations and the US Air Force approach to Effects Based Operations, which could be interpreted as another way of looking at influence operations.

While navies have traditionally not shown a great deal of interest the doctrinal minutia that have been the domain of armies, and more recently some air forces, navies have been extremely cognizant of the influence that maritime forces can exert on friends, neutrals and adversaries. In summarizing over a century of maritime strategy, the Canadian Navy's strategic blueprint, Leadmark, notes that naval diplomacy can be used "to influence, not only potential adversaries, but also friends and partners."

The current Canadian approach to influence operations was summarized by General Rick Hillier when he was Commander International Security and Assistance Force in Afghanistan in July 2004:
In normal operations one attempts to overwhelm the enemy. There is an attempt to tear the enemy down instead of build yourself up. In post conflict environments one must constrain the growth of the threat forces and manage the perceptions that there is an increase in measurable government capacity. The military component is just one element of the overall campaign. [emphasis added] 28 However, at the time that General Hillier made that statement, no Canadian doctrine existed to reflect this approach. In an attempt to address quickly this lack of doctrine, the Canadian Land Force sought an immediate solution by adopting doctrine concerning influence activities that mirrors NATO doctrine. However, on closer examination as we have seen, this doctrine is based on British concepts of influence operations. 
29
One of the things that has remained a constant irritant for all in uniform, was the distance, our separation, from the population that begat us. Canadians mostly didn't know we existed, what we did, why we did it, or our importance to the country. We are determined to change that by actively linking to moms and dads across Canada with their sons and daughters in the Canadian Forces, and by reaching out to all Canadians so that they are all much more aware of us and educated about what we do and its value. Being military, we approached this as an operation with a strategic goal -"Recruit the Nation." Our aim is to have the population own its armed forces, through good times and bad, to help ensure that when we are asked to do things we have the wherewithal to do it, and that individually, we are supported within the communities where we live when deployments or tragedy strikes. Most importantly, when things go wrong, all Canadians feel they are a part of it and the terrible separation of population and Canadian Forces that occurred in and around the Somalia events never occurs again. We feel that much progress has been made, Canadians are more aware and understanding of their Canadian Forces than ever before, and the positive impact for all is immense. 
30
From this brief review it can be seen that there is a lack consistency among current conceptual models and ideas related to "influence operations." This inconsistency is apparent even among US joint and service doctrine. Nevertheless, in the current security environment, out of necessity, some synthesis of Western approaches to influence operations has occurred in NATO. On the one hand, the British model, based on referring to influence using the more expansive term "activity" instead of the more restrictive term "operation" found in most US doctrine, seems to be forming the basis for understanding the use of influence to alter behaviour. On the other hand, the framework to coordinate all activities related to influencing a target audience within a theatre of operations is based on US practices. In summary, NATO doctrine on influence operations is conceptually British with American implementation. Some critics of current US IO practices have distinguished between the information domain and the cognitive domain in dealing with conflict. For example, a former US Army officer with considerable experience in military intelligence and counter-terrorism, argues that exploiting, and if possible dominating, the cognitive domain is the key to achieving success in conflict situations. However, he contends that current US doctrine incorrectly, but increasingly, "defines Information Operations in terms of competition for the domination of cyber-space." This approach, he argues, focuses too much on the ability of information technology to transmit large quantities of data, but with "almost a total absence of consciousness of the cultural content or impact of that data, except at the lowest and most superficial levels…" He concludes that the successful exploitation of the cognitive domain will require the orchestration of "all instruments of national power" in order to "influence key actors, organizations and nations (friendly, hostile, and neutral) through their political constituencies." 31 This paper will explore the lineage of the concepts that have been used in the construction of various approaches to influence operations that now exist. It will start in the Ancient World with a brief discussion of Sun Tzu and Thucydides and then leap forward to the classical era to discuss Karl von Clausewitz and Sir Julian Corbett. Influence operations, in the twentieth century, have multiple sources, such as Soviet military thought, the airpower theorists and the literature on coercion. Each of these will be discussed, in turn, with a view to applying the four criteria of the definition and describing the various stratagems of influence operations, which will be discussed next.
The ideas behind influence operations are not new and have been used from the earliest days of warfare, even if they have not been explicitly articulated in the context of an overarching concept of influence operations. These ideas include deception, demonstrations or feints, fighting on the moral 32 (or psychological) plane, altering another's perception of a situation in order to achieve a specific outcome, shaping military operations to achieve particular effects such as causing fear and panic, information operations, deterrence or compellence, the provision of support or advisors, and the threat or use of discrete types of force. Due to the broad nature of the concept of influence operations, it is necessary to define it more precisely. Therefore, for the purposes of discussion, influence operations are defined as:
Targeted activities intended to cause the target to behave in a desired manner primarily through effects on their will, understanding and perceptions in order to support the achievement of objectives. 
31
3-4, 16. 32
The effects on the will, understanding and perceptions of the target in the definition means that the target of the desired effect of any influence operation is in the mind(s) of those to be influenced. An influence operation is intended to affect the target's decision calculus; that is to say, , to cause them to behave in the way desired by the influencer through effects on their will to act, their understanding of the situation or their perceptions of the situation or other parties. Therefore, the aim of an influence operation is to cause someone else to choose to behave the way the influencer desires.

The third criterion, which refers to the intent to cause the target to behave in a specific manner, is intended to limit the notion of influence operations in three ways. The first is to separate influence operations from other activities that have an influence on behaviour. An influence operation's purpose is to cause the target to behave in a specific manner and changes to the physical and mental states of a target must be a byproduct of the operation. In other operations, changes to the physical and mental state are the intent of the operation and any influence on their behaviour is a byproduct of the operation. If such a demarcation does not exist, influence operations could be said to be ubiquitous and the concept valueless. The second limitation is based on the fact that acts intended to deliberately influence another state or organization require interaction with and the coordination of activities with policymakers in order to ensure all instruments of national power 37 are used appropriately to obtain the desired effect. In other words, these acts are political uses of force as described by Barry Blechman and Stephen Kaplan:
A political use of the armed forces occurs when physical actions are taken by one or more components of the uniformed military services as part of a deliberate attempt by the national authorities to influence, or to be prepared to influence, specific behaviour of individuals in another nation without engaging in a continuing contest of violence.

Saudi Prince saw it rather differently, and was even insulted by his treatment in Schwarzkopf's memoirs; see, and HRH Prince Khaled Bin Sultan, Desert Warrior: A Personal View of the Gulf War By The Joint Forces Commander (London: HarperCollins, 1996), 189-265. 
37
38
Whereas, influence operations here are taken to be calculated actions with the intent to change the adversary's behaviour as opposed to unintended consequences of military operations.
While the military instrument of power has been associated with dealing with adversaries in a violent manner, this does not mean that the use of violence is necessarily appropriate in all cases, because the military instrument can be used to provide "carrots" as well as "sticks" in an influence operation. For example, as opposed to resorting to actual violence, it may be sufficient for the military to make demonstrations or threats or to provide limited support to certain groups to influence the decision calculus of a target. Alternatively, it may be possible to provide "carrots" to a group through support or training. This approach represents an application of the concept of the economy of force at the highest level; it could also be described as "winning without fighting," another means of achieving one's objectives.

important dimension of the Cartesian plane -the conversion of hesitant adversaries and third parties into allies would isolate adversaries and encourage further compliance or reduce resistance. The various stratagems are described briefly as follows:
• Provide Training -this involves providing an ally or third party with military training. It can be undertaken for a number of reasons, such as improving the professionalism of another force, increasing its capacity to undertake particular operations or seeking to influence a decision in one's favour. A Canadian example of this stratagem is the current Military Training Assistance Program.
Provide Material Support -this involves providing an ally or third party with military equipment. It can be undertaken for a number of reasons, such as increasing its capacity to undertake particular operations or seeking to influence a decision in one's favour. A Canadian example of this stratagem is the recent provision of armoured vehicles to the African Union for use in Darfur.
Reinforce -this involves deploying one's own forces to support an ally or third party. It can be undertaken to deter a third party or adversary from particular acts, to increase the resolve of an ally or to influence a decision in one's favour. One could argue that Canadian forces stationed in Europe represented a long-term reinforcement of an ally during the Cold War.
Demonstration -this involves the conduct of an actual or simulated military operation in full view of a third party or adversary to show them the capability and signal resolve to use that capability if so required. This can be undertaken to deter a third party or adversary from particular acts or to influence a decision in one's favour. 
43
Provide Advisors -this is similar to the provision of training, with the exception that the advisors remain with the supported force or government over a longer period of time. A Canadian example of this stratagem is the current Military Training Assistance Program or the ISAF efforts with the training of the Afghan National Army.
Feint -this involves the conduct of an actual or simulated military operation in full view of a third party or adversary in an attempt to cause the adversary or third party to redeploy their forces in a manner favourable to one's plans. A classic influence operation conducted as a feint was the pre-D-Day activities prior to June 1944 involving dummy forces, information operations and various deception operations to successfully keep the Germans guessing and unable to concentrate their forces against the actual landings.
Deterrence -this involves the deployment of military forces in such a manner that a third party or adversary chooses to not carry through with an action that they otherwise might choose. The deployment of nuclear deterrent forces by the Soviet Union, the US, Britain and France are classic examples of deterrence-based influence operations.
Threat / Demarche / Ultimatum -this involves the deliberate communication of a threatened use of violence, the nature of the decision, the desired outcome to a third party or adversary and a timeline. For example, President Kennedy's speech of 22 October 1962 combined with visible mobilization efforts of US forces and the imposition of a naval blockade on Cuba by the US Navy led to the Soviet decision on 28 October 1962 to withdraw its nuclear-armed missiles from Cuba. 
44
Influence in the Ancient World: Sun Tzu and Thucydides The Art of War comes across as a rather abstract treatise on the conduct of warfare with some short chapters dealing with practical applications of tactics. The former, for the purposes of influence operations, is far more useful. Sun Tzu offered two concepts relevant to this report in the treatise -the value of winning without fighting and the ubiquity of deception.
Sun Tzu believed that the highest form of the art of warfare was to defeat one's enemies without actually having to fight. He stated that: "To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without fighting."

Deception was described by Sun Tzu as the key to success in war. He saw it as a virtuous necessity. Deception, according to him, was about the manipulation of appearances in relation to actual situations to act as a force multiplier. He wrote that:
All warfare is based on deception. Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far away, we must make him believe we are near. Hold out baits to entice the enemy. Feign disorder, and crush him. If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him. If he is in superior strength, evade him. If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. Pretend to be weak, that he may grow arrogant. If he is taking his ease, give him no rest. If his forces are united, separate them. Attack him where he is unprepared, appear where you are not expected.

While they discuss the effects on the will, understanding or perceptions associated with particular violent and non-violent actions, they have been applied only to adversaries and the intent of those actions is not always to generate those effects.
Thucydides. The Melian Dialogues, from Thucydides' history of the Peloponnesian War has often been used to illustrate an early example of the concept of realism and the use of influence to students of international relations and senior officers in advanced professional military education. 
49
Melos was an island in the Cycladic chain that failed to join the Delian League. The Athenian Empire could not tolerate an independent and neutral island within the frontiers of its empire. The Melians tried to base their security on deterrence, believing that the Spartans would come to their aid against Athens. This, however, turned out to be a flawed assumption. The Athenian Empire, due to some defeats by the Spartans on land,

The first point of interest in the Dialogue is the Athenian view of the situation. The Melians asked:
Melians: And how, pray, could it turn out as good for us to serve as for you to rule?
Athenians: Because you would have the advantage of submitting before suffering the worst, and we should gain by not destroying you.
Melians: So that you would not consent to our being neutral, friends instead of enemies, but allies of neither side.
Athenians: No; for your hostility cannot so much hurt us as your friendship will be an argument to our subjects of our weakness, and your enmity of our power.
Melians: Is that your subjects' idea of equity, to put those who have nothing to do with you in the same category with peoples that are most of them your own colonists, and some conquered rebels?
Athenians: As far as right goes they think one has as much of it as the other, and that if any maintain their independence it is because they are strong, and that if we do not molest them it is because we are afraid; so that besides extending our empire we should gain in security by your subjection; the fact that you are islanders and weaker than others rendering it all the more important that you should not succeed in baffling the masters of the sea. 
53
Melians: You may be sure that we are as well aware as you of the difficulty of contending against your power and fortune, unless the terms be equal. But we trust that the gods may grant us fortune as good as yours, since we are just men fighting against unjust, and that what we want in power will be made up by the alliance of the Lacedaemonians [Spartans], who are bound, if only for very shame, to come to the aid of their kindred. Our confidence, therefore, after all is not so utterly irrational. 
54
In terms of the thought on influence operations, the Melian Dialogue showed an early awareness of the main requirement for the successful application of deterrence -a credible threat. Interestingly, the other point of the Dialogue was also related to credibility. Actions or the lack thereof taken towards a weaker adversary may lead others to perceive weakness. Melos was not attacked and besieged for Melos itself; it was attacked and besieged as an example for all the other potential resistors to Athens' rule.
The Melian Dialogues fit all four criteria of influence operations: it described a deliberate Athenian attempt to break the will of the Melians and ensure Athens was perceived as a strong power that enforced its will on others.
These are two examples of thought and practice regarding influence operations from the Ancient World. Sun Tzu advocated two streams of thought, namely the value of the economy of force and the use of deception through stratagems like feints or demonstrations as a force multiplier. Thucydides offered a historical example of the application of some of the stratagems, i.e. the Athenian's use of threats and ultimata and the Melians' attempt at deterrence. His contribution can be summarized as an early depiction of the political effects of military actions.
The writings of a large number of military practitioners, philosophers and theorists comprise the classical canon of literature on warfare, but the writings of two of them are the most germane to the discussion of influence operations. The first is Karl von Clausewitz, a Prussian Army officer and author of Vom Kriege (On War), and one of the seminal military thinkers in the western world. His work is cited frequently in the professional literature and the doctrinal writings of the US services, and his theories appear to guide the formulation of much of US doctrine.

Karl von Clausewitz. Karl von Clausewitz (1780-1831) has been quoted and invoked in any number of works, and some of his work on warfare pertains to influence operations. While he is often quoted, those quoting him do not understand his arguments as well as they may portray. His work is both abstract and philosophical, which can mislead the practical minded. On War is remembered for a number of different contributions to the history, philosophy and theory of warfare, but three elements stand out in particular. First, it offered a succinct statement of how politics and their conduct guided the nature and conduct of war. Second, it argued that moral, or psychological, factors were as important as physical factors in warfare. Third, it proclaimed a doctrine that is antithetical to notions like influence operations, and therefore opposing arguments such as Clausewitz's merit examination.
Clausewitz is most remembered for declaring that politics guides the conduct of warfare. His most well-known phrase that war is the continuation of politics by other means is followed by an important caveat: ". . . war is only a part of political intercourse, therefore by no means an independent thing in itself . . . It has, to be sure, its own grammar but not its own logic."

The 1991 Gulf War has been used as an example of this situation where the Iraqi armed forces were defeated thoroughly, but for a number of reasons, of which some were politically inspired, this defeat did not lead to the end of a confrontation with Iraq. 
63
Despite his advocacy of the physical defeat of an adversary, Clausewitz also acknowledged the existence of a moral, or psychological, plane of warfare. He argued that the moral factors of war (described as: ". . . the talents of the commander, the military value of the army, its national feeling . . ." 64 ) were as important as the physical factors in war. In On War, he wrote that: . . . the moral qualities are among the most important subjects in war. They are the spirits which permeate the whole sphere of war . . . The spirit and other moral qualities of an army, a general or a government, public opinion in provinces in which the war is proceeding, the moral effect of a victory or a defeat -these are thing which in themselves vary greatly in their nature, and which, according as they stand with regard to our object and our circumstances, may also have a very different kind of influence. 
65
Clausewitz was not blind to the moral effects of the application of particular stratagems in war. While the concept of surprise allowed for the creation of situations where superiority in numbers could be generated at the opportune time and location, he also noted that: "Surprise . . . is also to be regarded as an independent principle in itself, on account of its moral effect."
66
One of the other concepts that has become associated inextricably with Clausewitz is that of the "decisive battle." This concept holds that all activities in war ought to be devoted to the enemy's defeat as this outcome will serve both of the ultimate aims of wardestroying the enemy force so that it will no longer be a threat in the future and compelling the enemy to seek peace on the victor's terms. In a memorably poetic passage, he wrote that:
We content ourselves here with acknowledging in general their possibility as something pointing to the deviation of practice from theory and to the influence of particular circumstances. But we cannot avoid showing here at once that the bloody solution of the crisis, the effort to destroy the enemy's force, is the first-born son of war. When political objects are unimportant, motives slight and the tensions of the forces small, a cautious commander may skilfully try all sorts of ways by which, without great crises and bloody solutions, he may twist himself into a peace through the characteristic weakness of his opponent in the field and in the cabinet. We have no right to blame him if the assumptions on which he acts are well founded and promise success; but still we must require him to remember that it is a slippery path he is treading on which the god of war may surprise him, and to keep his eye always upon the enemy that he may not have to defend himself with a dress rapier if that enemy takes up a sharp sword. 
67
68
Some of the stratagems that we would consider as influence operations were a legitimate means of waging war in Clausewitz's eyes:
If we wish from the enemy only a small sacrifice, we are satisfied with winning by means of the war only a small equivalent, and we expect to attain that by moderate efforts . . . If this influence of the political object on war is once permitted, as it must be, there is no longer any limit, and we must put up with such warfare as consists in a mere threatening of the enemy and in negotiating.

Sir Julian Corbett. Sir Julian Corbett (1854-1922) was a naval historian and theorist in Great Britain at the turn of the twentieth century. He has been included in this review as he provides a naval perspective on warfare and the role of stratagems we would recognize as influence operations today. Furthermore, Corbett's Principles of Maritime Strategy represents in some ways a naval extension of Clausewitz's On War, and yet in others, especially on the role of battle, parallels Sun Tzu's advocacy of winning without fighting. 
73
Corbett, like Clausewitz before him, sought to classify war as "limited" or "unlimited" ("absolute" in Clausewitz's terms). Corbett believed that Clausewitz's use of the war aim or the political ends to be achieved, based on the point that war represented an extension of the political realm, as the means to distinguish between one type and the other was sound, but that the definition was somewhat incomplete. To Corbett, the means by which the war aim is pursued is equally as important to defining a war as either limited or unlimited. 
74
75
76
The major difference between Corbett's and Clausewitz's thoughts on warfare was that Corbett believed that Clausewitz's concept of "absolute war" was not supported by the historical record. While the idea of decisive battle was attractive to Corbett, the evidence suggested that the incidence of decisive battle in history was actually quite rare. 
77
78

81
Corbett also drew links between what naval fleets did in war and their other roles. He saw three basic roles for a fleet -these were support to land operations, commercial warfare and the prevention or finalization of alliances. 
82
Corbett's commentary on "commercial warfare" is valuable here as they frame the discussion of naval blockades and their modern descendants, economic sanctions and one of their enforcement mechanisms, maritime intercept operations. The logic of the blockade was the same logic used in siege warfare where one sought to contain an enemy in their fortifications until they opted to fight on ground of one's choice or their will to fight eroded as supplies dwindled. Corbett's commentary was influenced significantly by the Royal Navy's role throughout British history. He concluded that commerce was the driving consideration in British maritime strategy over time. 
83
Either [a blockade] prevented the enemy from using the sea for any use by bottling up his naval fleet and preventing commerce from using the sea lanes, or it provoked the enemy to engage an opposing fleet in an attempt to break Command of the Sea by the destruction of the opposing fleet. In either case, the aim of blockade was the exertion of pressure on the citizens and their collective life. 84
From the passage above, it is possible to ascertain that Corbett conceived of two different types of blockade, which he termed the "naval" blockade that was intended to prevent the fleet from getting out of port and forcing it to fight, and the "commercial" blockade that was intended to prevent commerce from occurring. While both types of blockade could occur simultaneously, their aims were different in that one sought the naval equivalent of "absolute war" and the other, while limited in nature, sought to achieve a much longerterm effect. 
85
For example, economic sanctions and their enforcement have operated under the same assumptions as Corbett's concept of "commercial" blockade. While economic sanctions represent the application of the economic instrument of power, blockades are the military means of enforcing sanctions. Should the Security Council consider that measures provided for in Article 41 would be inadequate or have proved to be inadequate, it may take such action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security. Such action may include demonstrations, blockade, and other operations by air, sea, or land forces of Members of the United Nations. 
86
They are, at their essence, a blunt instrument in that they create situations where noncombatants can be deprived of the necessities of life. Furthermore, those governments targeted by sanctions often deflect the deprivation from themselves to their populations for a variety of reasons. 
87
88
The recurring debate over sanctions can be applied to the discussion on influence operations, because whether they are used as an alternative to war or as a complement to war, they are designed to influence behaviour. If used as an alternative to war, economic sanctions are an example of the application of Sun Tzu's principle of "winning without fighting," sometimes referred to as the principle of economy of effort. If used as a complement to war, economic sanctions represent the full application of the diplomatic and economic instruments of national power through military means.

• Deterrence -to convince an adversary not to undertake actions that they otherwise might undertake  Signalling of resolve -to reduce the adversary's will to resist.

Soviet military thought offers a number of concepts that fit the criteria of influence operations as well as numerous examples of the stratagems of influence operations described at the beginning of this paper, as applied to warfare. Despite its revolutionary origins and the pervasive influence of Marxist-Leninist ideology, Soviet military thought was consistent with some of the ideas from the ancient world and the classical era, and Soviet thinkers referred directly to Clausewitz in their writings on influence.
From Clausewitz, the Red Army inherited the doctrine of political dominion over the conduct of warfare, although this came through the prism of Marxist-Leninist thought.
Early Soviet doctrine, such as Aleksandr Svechin's work on strategy in the 1920s, included versions of Clausewitzian thought.

The Soviets also owed an intellectual debt to Sun Tzu for the idea of the value of "winning without fighting"; however, this idea was subjected to the Soviet ideology and mindset. As a result of its early experiences in such conflicts as the Russian Civil War, the Soviet Union had a tremendous sense of inferiority. It remained, despite the best efforts of the Communist Party to modernize the state (albeit in a combination of comical ineptness and callous brutality), a technologically backward state that spread across the Eurasian landmass. The Soviets were not blind to their weaknesses and began to look to means other than the force of arms to ensure the sanctity of their revolution and foment world revolution. More subtle and psychological means, for example deception, subversion, and surprise, therefore became a means of improving the likelihood of victory for them.

The key Soviet contributions to the concept influence operations are the value of surprise, how surprise can be achieved through deception (Maskirovka), disinformation/propaganda, and how an adversary can be controlled through specific actions ("Reflexive Control"). Each of these contributions will be discussed in turn, and then some examples of how the Soviet Union employed these stratagems will follow.
The Soviet Armed Forces came to understand the value of surprise first hand. The German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 was a powerful lesson to them, although Stalin's refusal to accept any evidence that Germany, then his erstwhile ally, was preparing to attack made the German's task easier. 
102
103
104
If victory represented the ends, surprise represented a means to the end and deception the means of choice.
Maskirovka was the Soviet term for deception, and it could be described as one of the ubiquitous terms in Soviet doctrine. Its official definition was:
The means of securing combat operations and the daily activities of forces; a complexity of measures, directed to mislead the enemy regarding the presence and disposition of forces, various military objectives, their condition, combat readiness and operations, and also the plans of the command . . . maskirovka contributes to the achievement of surprise for the actions of forces, the preservation of combat readiness, and the increased survivability of objectives.

108

110
The Soviets did not remain a victim of surprise for very long, however. They became adept at deception during the Second World War and used it on a number of occasions.
Based on their experience they came to categorize the basic means of deceiving an adversary in two ways. The first was to deprive the adversary of information with the exception of providing false impressions. The other means was not so much about providing a fiction for the adversary to consume as providing a credible alternate to the truth. For example, Operations URANUS (the counter-offensive in the fall of 1942 to fight for Stalingrad against the German Army Group B) and MARS (the counteroffensive against German Army Group C) were originally planned as two simultaneous Soviet offensives. It was eventually decided that MARS would become a diversion for URANUS, yet the ambiguity surrounding both operations had a profound effect on the Germans. 
111
Soviet doctrine also noted that the establishment of good Maskirovka was dependent not only on sound operational security but also on the enemy's predisposition to deception and the timing, scale and location of military operations, especially offensive operations. Doctrine suggested that since it was often difficult to conceal the intent to attack an adversary, this situation could be turned to the attacker's advantage, because it was easier to feed disinformation to an enemy that expected an attack to and in these circumstances the enemy tended to misinterpret demonstrations and feints. The Soviets were less concerned about taking steps to conceal the scale and location of an attack because these were seen as the simpler of the tasks. The most difficult task, they believed, was deceiving an adversary with regard to the timing of an attack as this required a significant effort in terms of the coordination and control of activity.
112
Besides deception, the Soviets also showed a predilection for the use of a form of propaganda known as desinformatsiya or "disinformation." It represented the deliberate spreading of falsehoods about another state or individual through the distribution of forgeries, the spreading of rumours and the staging of events.
113
114
The Soviet military also developed a doctrine they called "reflexive control." Its definition is as follows:
Reflexive control involves creating a pattern or providing partial information that causes an enemy to react in a predetermined fashion without the enemy realizing that he is being manipulated. Its aim is to force an enemy commander to make a decision that, through the manipulation of information, was predetermined by the opposing side. 
115
• Distraction-during preparatory stages of combat operations, creating a real or imaginary threat against one of the most vital enemy places such as flanks and rear, forcing him to re-evaluate his decisions to operate on this or that axis.
• Overload-often manifested by sending the enemy a large amount of conflicting information.
Paralysis-creating the belief of a specific threat to a vital interest or weak spot.
Exhaustion-causing the enemy to carry out useless operations, thereby entering combat with expended resources.
Deception-during preparatory stages of combat operations, forcing the enemy to reallocate forces to a threatened spot.
Divisive techniques-causing the enemy to believe he must operate in opposition to coalition interests.
Pacification-through a peaceful attitude and approach cause the enemy to lose vigilance.
Deterrence-creating the impression of superiority.
Provocation-forcing enemy action advantageous to your side.
Suggestion-offering information that affects the enemy legally, morally, ideologically or in other areas.
Pressure-offering information that encourages society to discredit its own government. 117 115 Thomas, "Russian Views on Information-Based Warfare," 32. In another article, Thomas stated that V.A. Lefebfvre, a Soviet military theorist, defined reflexive control as: "a process by which one enemy transmits the reasons or bases for making decisions to another." See Thomas, "Reflexive Control in Russia," 61. 
116
Regretfully, the paucity of sources prevents one from exploring each of these stratagems more fully, and the Soviet use of semantics means that the terminology used to describe each type may be somewhat misleading. Other sources provide more detail on the nature of "reflexive control." For example, Timothy Thomas, a former US Army lieutenant colonel, translated elements of Major General M. Ionov's 1995 article in Morskoy Sbornik, which contained some principles of "reflexive control," for example, the controller must anticipate how the target will react to the situation the controller creates; the controller should consider how the activity used to generate the situation may be uncovered and develop counter-measures; the controller must consider the effectiveness of the target's reconnaissance assets and the controller should consider such measures in the light of social and other factors.

The notion of influencing the behaviour of adversaries, friends and neutrals was implicit in the works of the major ancient and classical writers on warfare, and a more explicit articulation of these theories was provided by the Soviets. Other, but different explicit theories on how to use military means to influence the behaviour of others, appear in the modern era in the writings of the airpower theorists, which will be discussed next.
The Early Days of Powered Flight. Less than ten years after the Wright Brothers launched the air age with their first tentative flights in 1903, heavier-than-air aircraft had already proved their worth on the battlefield. One of the first recorded uses of aircraft in war was in 1911 by the Italians in the Turkish province of Tripoli, now known as Libya. Italian aircraft flew over 300 sorties in roles ranging from reconnaissance to transport to bombing. The lessons of the Italian experience were recorded by the military correspondent of the Times of London, and the one that stands out as relevant today for influence operations was that the "casual dropping" of bombs and grenades was futile and had little effect.
At about the same time as the Italians were using aircraft in operations in North Africa, in Britain, the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was using aircraft, both fixed wing and lighter-than-air, its 1912 manoeuvres. The winner of the war games, General Sir James Grierson declared that aircraft had "revolutionized the art of war," based on the "decisive advantage" the continuous and immediate information he received from his airship's telegraph link. 
124
One of the first persons to actually write about how the air weapon might be used influence enemy actions was Lt Lord Tiverton of the Royal Naval Air Service who used statistics to conduct target analysis and bomb damage prediction. He also conducted a strategic analysis of the German war economy and advocated concentrated raids on the German chemical industry to disrupt it, which he believed would lead to the collapse of other key German war industries. While Tiverton's ideas were not put into practice for a number of reasons, not the least of which was the lack of a suitable British aircraft to conduct heavy bombing raids, his ideas did influence American aviators' concepts on how to use aircraft in future wars. 125 124 John Terraine, "Lessons of Air Warfare," JRUSI 137 (Aug 1992), 53-8. See also Phillip S. Meilinger, "Giulio Douhet and the Origins of Airpower Theory," in Phillip S. Meilinger, ed. The Paths of Heaven: The Evolution of Airpower Theory (Maxwell AL: Air University Press, 1997), 1-3. 
125
While British concepts of how to affect the outcome of the war by using aircraft against targets in the enemy homeland may have more advanced than others' concepts, it was the Germans who waged the first systematic air bombardment campaign against a civilian population. Sometimes referred to as the "first Battle of Britain," German Zeppelins and later purpose-built massive fixed wing bombers

127
Between the Wars -The Bomber Will Always Get Through. The First World War experience had a profound effect on military theorists of all stripes, including the new theorists of airpower. The latter published their ideas in various media and these ideas had an important impact on how people perceived war, which continues to this day. The theorists observed that the war had ended not in the traditional fashion by the capture of the defeated nation's capital, but with the collapse of the German government due to civil unrest and a lack of will to continue the war. They also observed that the Russia had left the war and made an armistice with Germany after its government had been overthrown by a revolution. Furthermore, both the French and Italian armies had mutinied in 1917, causing political crises in both countries including public demands, as with Britain, that each nation make a separate peace with their adversaries.
Based on these experiences, airpower theorists' ideas evolved to point where their supporters claimed that wars of the future could be won by destroying the enemy's will to resist instead of the enemy's military and naval forces. Victory was to be achieved by bombing major enemy cities with vast fleets of aircraft until the people demanded that their government sue for peace.
The leading airpower theorist, even today, was Giulio Douhet (1869-1930) as he was the first person to propose a coherent vision for this radical new form of warfare. Douhet's vision was conceived based on Italy's geostrategic situation, and he characterized his native land as resource poor and at the mercy of a potential enemy. Based on the First World War experience, Douhet assumed that future wars would be static with no decision reached by the actions of armies or navies. However, he argued that air forces would able to overcome the ineffectiveness of other arms and achieve a decisive victory. He also believed that future wars would be total wars for survival, and, therefore no distinction would be drawn between combatants and non-combatants. Douhet's theories evolved during his lifetime, but the key ideas for the purposes of this paper are summarized next. Douhet argued that to impose one's will on the enemy, one had to destroy both the enemy's material and morale. He suggested targeting large and important industries, public buildings, transportation assets, and areas inhabited by the civilian population. In a passage in his seminal work, Command of the Air, often overlooked by scholars, Douhet proposed that these attacks be conducted using a weapon mix, in a proportion of 1:3:6, of explosives (including some with delayed action fuses to hinder firefighting and rescue work), incendiary bombs, and bacteriological and chemical weapons. 
128
Despite the flaws in Douhet's ideas, their simplicity and conceptual unity led to his adoption by the US Air Force in particular as the "father" of airpower theory. While Douhet's ideas seemed less attractive to some after the inability of strategic bombing with conventional weapons to bring the Second World War to a quick conclusion, the dropping of the two atomic bombs on Japan in 1945 resurrected Douhet's ideas. A leading American strategist, Bernard Brodie, declared near the beginning of the Cold War that Douhet's ideas were "peculiarly pertinent to any general war in the nuclear age,"
129
130
In Britain, Sir Hugh Trenchard (1873-1956) presided over an air staff, from 1919 to 1929, that created its own theories of air warfare; however, they were not published in widely read books, like Command of the Air, but were to be found in doctrine manuals and personal accounts of those conducting air operations in the inter-war period. Trenchard's approach to airpower was unique in that he combined concepts from strategic bombing doctrine with practice from successful and relatively inexpensive "air control" campaigns, which might be termed expeditionary operations today, in British colonies. The principal aim of Trenchard's approach was to preserve the RAF's independence from the Army and Royal Navy by proving that the RAF could perform many of their roles more cheaply. Air control will be discussed later in the section on small wars.

Much of the influence of airpower was based on its new and ever improving technology, but its influence was also based on perceptions of aviators as almost superhuman beings, able to not only master new and incredibly complex technology but also able to withstand the rigours of flight in a harsh environment. In an age before pressurized aircraft and where many still flew in open cockpit aircraft without benefit of accurate meteorological information or navigation aids, aviators were seen in the same light as astronauts were seen in the second half of the 20th century -pioneers, with "the right stuff" on the edge of a new frontier. Some even attributed god-like characteristics to aviators. For example, when Charles Lindbergh visited Canada in 1927, Prime Minister MacKenzie King reflected the views of many on this continent when he recorded in his diary: "A more beautiful character I have never seen…He was like a young god who appeared from the skies in human form -all that could be desired in youthful appearance, in manner, in charm, in character, as noble a type of the highest manhood I have ever seen." 141 Other aviator's were worshiped as well, but sometimes their impact was more sinister. Marshal Italo Balbo, head of Italy's Aeronautica (air force), was also renowned for his exploits as an aviator. He accomplished one of the most spectacular feats ever seen to that

time when he led an armada of 23 large, multi-engine seaplanes (the Savoia Marchetti 55) on a round trip from Italy, across North America, to Chicago and back in the summer of 1933 as part of the Italian contribution to that year's Chicago World Fair whose theme was "A Century of Progress." Balbo's feat had a huge impact on the American psyche at the time for his 23 Italian air force planes riding at anchor in Chicago harbour sent a message that was interpreted by many Americans to mean that for the first time in their history a foreign power had the means to attack their industrial heartland.

A number of themes that emerge from the interwar period have a direct bearing on this discussion of influence operations. First of all, all the major interwar airpower theorists sought to describe the best way to influence the behaviour of various groups in their own society and other societies. The dominant theme in airpower theory was how to influence adversary, whether insurgents or other nations, behaviour through physical attacks or 145 "Raining Death on Cities Seen Plane's Role in War, [sic]" Toronto Star, 27 September 1938, 1. 
146
147
148
149
150
A second theme, in the study of interwar airpower theorists is that they were all engaged in struggles in their home countries to shape the use of airpower as a military tool. In the three nations from which the major theorists came, aviators struggled with soldiers and sailors for resources; therefore, interwar airpower theorists emphasized how air forces could achieve results "independently" of the other two services. 
151
152
Finally, in the context of this discussion it is worth re-emphasizing that while interwar airpower theorists have often been characterized as bloodthirsty because they advocated massive devastating attacks on enemy populations, this was not the case. All interwar theorists believed that the essence of the air weapon was its ability to attack specific targets to influence decision makers in the target group. While the damage inflicted by these attacks might not seem large by today's standards, by post-First World War standards they represented just enough damage to bring a conflict to a quick and decisive conclusion. Taken together, the views of the airpower theorists were so powerful that they had a significant effect on the conduct of operations for at least the first 12 months of the Second World War.
The Second World War. The literature on the influence of strategic bombing on populations and on the outcome of the war is vast and continues to grow. For the purposes of this study the key issues are summarized next. First of all, the fear of the "knock out blow" from the air, which had become so pervasive in the interwar years, led governments to limit the use of their bomber fleets against nations who had the power to retaliate against them. 
153
The RAF chafed at the restrictions imposed upon it and waited impatiently until it could take the "gloves off" and bomb Berlin, hopefully in a quick war-ending series of strikes. Of course, once the gloves were off the effects of strategic bombing did not live up to the promises of its advocates. Even the massive combined Allied bomber offensive against Germany in the winter of 1943 did not bring Germany to her knees. Moreover, the inaccuracy of the bombing systems eventually led Britain, Germany and the US to resort to the area bombing of targets in the hope of destroying the material and morale of the enemy. However, to the surprise of the students of the pre-war bombing theorists, civilian populations proved to be incredibly resistant to bombing attacks.

The approach to operations championed by the US Air Force, now formally known as Effects Based Operations (EBO), has become another buzzword in the current debate on how war and other operations should be conducted and it is a term now used frequently in the joint arena. 
170

174
In general terms, EBO focuses on casual explanations to see if actions that are planned or taken actually result in the desired effects. The key to achieving success with EBO is in predicting how physical actions can result in behavioural outcomes. In many ways EBO is a new way of describing an old concept because it has been at the heart of theories of air warfare since the earliest airpower theorists who were almost always concerned with the effects as much as the means of applying airpower. For example, Douhet's theories were based on the notion of using the physical action of bombing to effect behavioural changes in the leadership of a nation. Critics of EBO have, therefore, used the failures of airpower theorists to accurately predict the outcomes (effects) of aerial bombardment to illustrate why true EBO may not be possible.

Eleven years after the publication of Shock and Awe: Achieving Rapid Dominance, Ullman elaborated on the "Shock and Awe" concept in a way that made it seem very much like an influence operation. In May 2007, he claimed that "Shock and Awe" (or RDO) was based on the ideas of Sun Tzu and Clausewitz, and that it was "a strategy based on the simple principle of getting people to do what we wanted, and, conversely, to stop doing things we did not want done. The goal was to affect, influence and potentially control will and perception. The means were shock and awe." He went on to say that, "Shock and awe were derived from all of the physical and psychological elements of power to convince, cajole or coerce an adversary to accept our will with minimum or perhaps even no use of force, following Sun Tzu's advice that the best way to win a war was by not fighting." 181 And yet reading the 1996 work one can see why some believe that "Shock and Awe" was used in Operation Iraqi Freedom. In Shock and Awe:
Achieving Rapid Dominance Ullman and Wade do say that "Rapid Dominance is based on affecting the adversary's will, perception, and knowledge through imposing sufficient Shock and Awe to overcome resistance, allowing us to achieve our aims." They also state that, "The first priority of a doctrine of Rapid Dominance should be to deter, alter, or affect the will and therefore those actions that are either unacceptable to US national security interests or endanger the democratic community of states and access to free markets." Furthermore, Ullman and Wade state that even though the doctrine of Rapid Dominance is most applicable to "major and lower regional conflict scenarios," it could also be applied to "a variety of areas such as countering WMD, terrorism, and perhaps other tasks." However, many of the examples they give of ways that "Shock and Awe" should be applied, infer that the concept is Douhetian in origin and depends a great deal on the use of force to exert influence, for example they say that:
Rapid Dominance expands the art of joint combined arms war fighting capabilities to a new level. Rapid Dominance requires a sophisticated, interconnected, and interoperable grid of netted intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, communications systems, data analysis, and real-time deliverable actionable information to the shooter. This network must provide total situational awareness and supporting nodal analysis that enables US forces to act inside the adversary's decision loop in a manner that on the high end produces Shock and Awe among the threat parties. Properly detailed nodal analysis of this knowledge grid will enable the shutting down of specific functions or all essential functions near simultaneously. This will often times be netted pieces of data where the sum of the parts gives the answer and the battlefield advantage to the force possessing this rapidly netted information.
The 'rapid' part of the equation becomes the ability to get real-time actionable targeting information to the appropriate shooter, whether the shooter is a tank division, an individual tank, an artillery battery, an individual rifle man, a naval battle group, an individual ship, an air wing/squadron, or an aircraft in flight. This means the need to have the right shooter in the right place; locating and identifying the target correctly and quickly; allocating and assigning targets rapidly; getting the "shoot" order or general authority to the shooter; and then assessing the battle damage accurately. 
182
183
Critics of approaches to EBO that concentrate on targeting as a means of achieving outcomes caution that studying the theoretical foundations and historical examples of this type of EBO proves its futility as an approach to conducting operations. They note that strategic bombing theories, like those of Douhet and Warden, have underestimated the obstacles to achieving their goals because attempts to destroy an enemy's will to resist by strategic bombing failed, unless much of his infrastructure was destroyed and at least some of his territory was physically occupied, as was the case in the Second World War. As for the recent shock and awe variant of EBO theory, Kagan asserts that those who advocate this approach to warfare ignore the fact that the destruction of targets and resultant killing of civilians necessary to achieve the desired effect may undermine the political objectives of the campaign.

The US Air Force still accepts that Douhet and his contemporaries were correct in their assessment of the effects airpower could have. This belief in Douhet was illustrated near the end of the first Gulf War when a banner was put up in the US Air Force's Air University cafeteria proclaiming "Douhet and Mitchell Were Right!" in reference to a view that airpower had been the decisive factor in winning that war. 
188
Early airpower advocates argued that airpower could be decisive and could achieve strategic effects. While this view of airpower was not proved during their lifetimes, the more recent history of air and space power application, especially since the 1991 Persian Gulf War, has proven that air and space power can be a dominant and frequently the decisive element of combat in modern warfare. 
189
"Air Control." While the theory and practice of "Air Control," has come to be associated with counterinsurgency operations or "small wars," the topic of the next section, Air Control is fundamentally a theory for the use of airpower in specific situations. Furthermore, it was developed specifically by the RAF as a way of convincing decision makers and public opinion at home that the RAF deserved to maintain its recently won "independence" from the other two services. Therefore, it will be discussed in the section on airpower.
The British experiment with "Air Control," sometimes called "air policing," in the 1920s and 1930s is an example of one of the earliest examples, in the twentieth century, of using a new technology as the centrepiece of operations intended to influence the behaviour of actors in what might be called an insurgency today, but at the time was referred to as a "small war." Clausewitz's discussions of war being an extension of policy, but with a grammar all of its own applies particularly well to air control. Towards the end of the First World War, the British government had to consider the post-war international environment and its effects on the defence of the British Empire as well as the requirement for a "peace dividend" through a reduction of defence spending. Naturally, the latter would have an effect on the nature of the British defence establishment. The Royal Air Force (RAF) was established as an "independent" British fighting service in April 1918; however, both the Royal Navy and the British Army opposed this move at the time and continued to do so after the end of the First World War. Those two services wished to see the RAF broken up so that they could re-establish their own flying services, the Royal Naval Air Service and the Royal Flying Corps. To stave off the other two services' actions, Air Marshal Hugh Trenchard, then the Chief of Air Staff, took measures to ensure the RAF's continued independence.

Air action can be taken swiftly at the focus of trouble and before the disturbance against which it is directed has time to permeate a larger area.
It has the immense advantage that compared with the slow movements of ground forces over unfamiliar country it offers to the tribesmen no chance of loot or retaliation by ambush or concentration of small ground forces.

It could be argued that "Air Control" met all the criteria of influence operations. While it its application was not as well coordinated at the strategic or operational levels as similar air operations today, it did use all instruments of British national power extant in Iraq during the Mandate to provide the military with sufficient information to allow those practising Air Control to decide when and how to act in response to political crises. This shows that coordination between the military and diplomatic instruments of power had been decentralized to lower levels and still remained effective.
While Air Control was often presented by its advocates, in theory, as a largely independent use of airpower in counterinsurgency operation, in practice airpower has been a vital component of joint counterinsurgency operations, or small wars, since the beginning of the 20 th century. The notion of influence operations in small wars is discussed later. Another important aspect of Air Control was the notion of coercing recalcitrant tribesman to bend to imperial will; however, theories of coercion, which will be discussed next, were not formalized until the nuclear age.
The only use of nuclear weapons in human history was an influence operation. The dropping of two atomic bombs, the first on the Japanese city of Hiroshima and the second on Nagasaki, represented a demonstration of an American capability intended to cause the Japanese empire to surrender. In analyzing this influence operation it is important not to treat the Japanese government as a monolithic entity because the emperor, civilian officials and militarists in the government all reacted differently to the same events. For example, it was known at the time that the military members of the Japanese government would not accept surrender under any circumstances, but that the behaviour of the Emperor and the civilian members could be influenced. After the bombings, the civilian members of government sought the emperor's blessing to accept the allied terms of surrender, including the retention of Hirohito as emperor. He assented to the surrender based on the combination of the effects of the atomic bombs, of the sea blockade of the Japanese islands, of Japanese defeats on all fronts, and of the Soviet declaration of war on Japan.

Definition. Coercion is best described as the combined application of the diplomatic and military instruments of power in cases where violence or the threat thereof may be employed to attain national objectives by causing adversaries to make different decisions than they otherwise would have if coercion had not been used. Economic sanctions, a close cousin to coercion, are best described as the combined application of the economic and military instruments of power. The concept of coercion fits all four aforementioned criteria for an influence operation because coercion aims to effect the will, understanding and perceptions of others; it can be applied to adversaries, third parties and allies (although it might be used less frequently with allies); it is used to cause the target to behave in specific ways; and coercion does not necessarily require violence in its application. Coercion could be applicable to an ally or third party if one changed the mechanism of coercion from violence to "an act contrary to that state's interests."

Schelling, a professor at Yale University, sought to challenge the prevailing belief that war and diplomacy were mutually exclusive. He noted that the nuclear-inspired stalemate of the Cold War had led to a situation where military power was used as a form of bargaining by the two superpowers. 
210
There is a difference between taking what you want and making someone give it to you, between fending off assault and making someone afraid to assault you, between holding what people are trying to take and making them afraid to take it, between losing what someone can forcibly take and giving it up to avoid risk or damage. It is the difference between defense and deterrence, between brute force and intimidation, between conquest and blackmail, between action and threats. It is the difference between the unilateral, 'undiplomatic' recourse to strength, and coercive diplomacy based on the power to hurt . . . The purely 'military' or 'undiplomatic' recourse to forcible action is concerned with enemy strength, not enemy interests; the coercive use of the power to hurt, though, is the very exploitation of enemy wants and hurts. 
211
Coercion theories in particular and theories of "limited war" in general were discredited as a result the Johnson Administration's furtive attempts to apply "graduated pressure" (one of the variants of "limited war") during the Vietnam War. They faded from view during the 1970s and 1980s but enjoyed resurgence in the 1990s as a result of the chaos that emerged at the end of the Cold War. In the "new world disorder," coercion seemed to offer a solution for the Western problem of being confronted with conflicts that were important enough to act on in some way, but not vital enough to national interests to commit a nation to war. At the same time, based on the lopsided coalition victory in the 1991 Gulf War, which was attributed by some to air power, it seemed that air power could be a viable instrument of coercion.
Mechanism. The analogy of the "carrot and the stick" could be used to describe coercion with a heavy reliance on the "stick." Intuitively, reward and punishment (the "carrot and the stick") seem to offer the most fruitful approach to the behaviour modification posited by coercion theory. Using this analogy, one would reward compliance and punish intransigence, and this is why coercion can be seen as both a diplomatic and military activity. 
212
213
There were two major schools of thought on coercion that emerged in the 1990s. These schools were based on a methodological (and a transatlantic) divide. The American school of thought was based on social science methodology and the British school of thought was based on a more historical approach to the matter.
Robert Pape was a leader in the American social science approach to coercion. His book, Bombing to Win, was the first major work of the 1990s that discussed issues surrounding coercion in detail. Pape took a scientific and somewhat reductionist approach to coercion in accordance with the practice of the social sciences in the United States. Using cases where airpower was used to conduct strategic bombing in war, he conceptualized the adversary's choice in an equation, from which he could posit strategies: 214
where R: the degree of resistance, B: the benefits, p(B): the probability of obtaining the benefits, C: the costs and p(C): the probability of the costs. Success occurs when R<0. 
215
• "Punishment" -elimination of will to fight by targeting of civilians -the increase of C by the coercer;
• "Risk" -a weakened form of punishment, that starts small and escalates -the increase of p(C) by the coercer; • "Denial" -attacks intended to deny the enemy the ability to enact their strategy-the reduction or elimination of p(B) by the coercer; and • "Decapitation" -elimination of will to fight by targeting the enemy leadership-the increase of C and reduction or elimination of p(B). 
216

If Mueller also argued that there were three key elements to coercion, namely, credibility, capability and communication. 
221
222
The last contribution of note from the American school came from two researchers at the RAND Corporation. Daniel Byman and Matthew Waxman's works owe an intellectual debt to John Warden's theory of the enemy as a system as well as the Clausewitzian concept of the "centre of gravity."

• What did the coercer want the coerced to do?
• What behaviour will lead to the removal of the threat?
• What does the coerced's decision calculus look like?
• How (and by whom) are decisions made so that they match the policy direction and extent desired? • Has the threat and desired behaviour been communicated clearly? 
226

Taxonomy. One of the problems with the literature on coercion is that there are multiple terms in use that have similar meanings; therefore, it is easy to apply a term pertaining to coercion incorrectly. Some commentators have argued that coercion is merely an umbrella concept that can be subdivided, and they typically divide the concept based on a distinction between whether or not the desired effect is the maintenance of the status quo against a potential future action (deterrence) or the rescinding of an action already taken (compellence). 
230
Coercive Diplomacy. Coercive diplomacy is similar to coercion in that the intent to use force or the threat to use force remains the same as with coercion, i.e., threats or discrete uses of force are employed to obtain a particular form of behaviour from an adversary. However, coercive diplomacy is different from coercion in that coercive diplomacy always occurs outside the bounds of war, while compellence or deterrence may apply to both states of war and peace. For example, it has been argued that:
. . . Force is used in an exemplary, demonstrative manner, in discrete and controlled increments to induce the opponent to revise his calculations and agree to a mutually acceptable termination of the conflict . . . force is subordinated to what is essentially not a military strategy but rather a political-diplomatic strategy for resolving or reconciling a conflict of interests with the opponent . . . 
231
Deterrence. Traditionally, the concept of deterrence has been associated with strategic nuclear war. 232 Alexander George and Richard Smoke argued that: ". . . deterrence is simply the persuasion of one's opponent that the costs and/or risks or a given course of action he might take outweigh its benefits. . ." 
233
234
235
The assumption of rationality notwithstanding, the nature of deterrence creates some difficulties for the taxonomy, as the theory of deterrence requires a complete understanding of the adversary's intent. Therefore, it is possible to apply a strategy of deterrence and still not have a deterrence situation, because, as Richard Ned Lebow noted: ". . . it is important to distinguish between the theory of deterrence and the strategy of deterrence. The former pertains to the logical postulates of deterrence and the assumptions on which they are based . . . Deterrence strategy is concerned with applying the theory of deterrence . . ." 
236
237
Compellence. Compellence differs from deterrence in that it refers to a subset of coercion where actions are aimed at convincing the adversary to alter the status quo. 
238
240
241
Issues. There are a number of issues in the literature on coercion that affect our discussion on influence operations. First is the definitional concern about whether or not coercion can be applied in war, based on the criterion of choice. Second is the reliance on rationality in a great deal of coercion theory. Finally, there is the question of how coercion relates to concepts like influence operations.
One of the debates in the literature on coercion theories is the question of whether or not coercion can occur during a major conflict or war. Karl Mueller argued that: . . . most warfare is to a greater or lesser degree coercive. States usually seek the capitulation of their enemies rather than their complete incapacitation . . . The reasons are obvious: bringing the contest to an end while the enemy still has the means to resist offers the prospect of conflicts that are less expensive for the coercer and probably for the enemy as well, and successful coercion may avert warfare altogether through deterrence or compellence that relies on threats rather than the actual use of force. Often states pursue coercion in situations where they would never consider seeking victories through pure force because the costs of doing so would be prohibitively high. 
242
243
Another important debate in the coercion literature is the reliance of coercion theory on rationality. The aforementioned "carrot and stick" analogy is at the heart of the rational decision-making model, as a decision-maker is assumed to weigh the costs and benefits of any given action before making a decision and then acting on it. This is a simplistic approach, however, because we know that humans are not, by nature, completely rational beings. 
244
245
246
247
The final point to be discussed here is how coercion relates to influence operations. The works of coercion theorists are not particularly helpful in answering this question because they have focused on describing the phenomenon of coercion and have not spent as much effort on the methods used in coercion, with the notable exception of strategic airpower. Some answers to how coercion relates to influence operations can be discerned using the upper right hand quadrant of Figure 
1
In summary, despite the weaknesses in coercion theory, the act of coercion definitely constitutes an influence operation for these reasons: an act of coercion is intended to generate a deliberate effect on the will, understanding or perception of others; it may be applied to adversaries, third parties and allies alike, although in the case of the last two, it should be non-violent in nature; it is used to cause the target to behave in specific ways; and coercion does not necessarily require violence in its application.
Small war is a term which has come largely into use of late years, and which is admittedly somewhat difficult to define. Practically it may be said to include all campaigns other than where both the opposing sides consist of regular troops… The expression 'small war' has in reality no particular connection with the scale on which any campaign may be carried out; it is simply used to denote, in default of a better, operations of regular armies against irregular, or comparatively speaking irregular, forces. 
248
249
Callwell was well aware of the effects "decisive action" had in affecting the size of insurgent forces; therefore, he advocated the use of military force to achieve a "moral [or psychological] effect" in discouraging local populations from joining insurgent forces:
There is one very important point in which the hostile forces met with in small wars differ from those met in great campaigns. They swell and contract according to the moral effect which is produced, and quite apart from losses in action or the exigencies of the conflict. 
250
249
250
While direct action by regular forces was the primary means of achieving the effects envisioned by Callwell in Small Wars, T. E. Lawrence or "Lawrence of Arabia," came to see the use of indirect actions by irregulars as the most effective way to achieve effects in his circumstances. He found that countering regular Turkish troops with native tribesman required an intellectual bridge from the machinations of interstate conflict espoused by nineteenth century theorist Carl von Clausewitz and other European theorists to the war in which he was currently engaged. 
252
253
254
255
256
257
Lawrence put these ideas to great result during the Turkish campaign to "reach victory without battle by pressing our [Arab] advantages mathematical and psychological." He understood that his strength lay in avoiding direct confrontation with the enemy and instead he used all manner of other stratagems to fix the Turkish army in outposts throughout the Middle East. At the same time he allowed the Turks a trickle of supplies, which was sufficient for them to continue an extended form of strategic defence but not enough to conduct offensive tactical operations. In this fashion they were rendered irrelevant without large expenditures of Allied resources. 
258
A similarly legendary figure from the Second World War was Major General Orde Wingate, whose special operations exploits ranged from pre-war Palestine to the North African and Burma theatres. Unlike Lawrence, Wingate did not survive his war or leave first hand accounts of his exploits. However, the lessons that his form of warfare inculcated in senior commanders are contained in Field Marshal Viscount William Slim's seminal account of the China-Burma-India Theatre of Operations, Defeat into Victory: Battling Japan in Burma and India, 1942-1945.  A large part of Slim's memoirs deal with the necessity of building up and maintaining the psychological aspects of a military force that had been mauled by the Japanese. 
259
The strategic idea that a penetrating formation, operating behind the enemy, could be the decisive force was by no means new or unsound -I used it myself in the great Mandalay-Meiktila battle of 1945 -but what would have been unsound was to attempt it with his present force and with our present air resources.

For unlike industrial war, in war amongst the people no act of force will ever be decisive: winning the trial of strength will not deliver the will of the people, and at base that is the only true aim of any use of force in our modern conflicts. 
271
272
273
The former describes actions taken to influence "Will" and uses primarily, "Psychological Operations (PSYOPS), deception, Electronic Warfare (EW), specifically targeted physical destruction and Computer Network Operations (CNO)." "Influence Activities" can also include facets of operational manoeuvre like "force presence, posture and profile" and other related activities like "Media Ops and CIMIC." While the latter, "Counter-Command Activity," commonly utilizes "targeted physical destruction, the use of emerging technology, offensive EW and CNO" to affect an adversary. 
274
274
The term "Small War" is often a vague name for any one of a great variety of military operations. As applied to the United States, small wars are operations undertaken under executive authority, wherein military force is combined with diplomatic pressure in the internal or external affairs of another state whose government is unstable, inadequate, or unsatisfactory in the preservation of life and of such interests as are determined by the foreign policy of our nation. 
275
276
277
The historical context of American small wars is best provided by American journalist Max Boot, in his The Savage Wars of Peace: Small Wars and the Rise of American Power. Boot examines the contribution of small wars to the creation of American hegemony in the 20 th century and at the same time depicts the evolution of the American approach to these limited conflicts. In doing so, Boot provides some insights into the historical underpinnings to American forms of influence. 
278
279
280
This difficulty of immediate control and personal influence is even more pronounced in small wars on account of the decentralized nature of these operations. This fact is further emphasized because in the small wars we are dealing not only with our own forces, but also with the civil population which frequently contains elements of doubtful or antagonistic sentiments. The very nature of our own policy and attitude toward the opposing forces and normal 
278

According to Small Wars/21 st Century, civil-military operations consist of all attempts "to build and use associations with civilians in order to facilitate our primary military actions." These efforts, the manual argues, must be incorporated into all planning and execution, not simply treated as an add-on useful only during the conflict or post-conflict phases of operations.

While the US military has only recently invested a great deal of effort into studying the practice of small wars, some theorists have been examining this issue for many years. One of the leading current American theories of small wars is based on the concept of Fourth Generation Warfare (often abbreviated as 4GW). In 1989 William Lind and four co-authors coined the term, and despite its shortcomings as a model as identified by some,
294
295
296
Noting that the events in Iraq in 2003-2004 have marked "the end of the state's monopoly on war," 297 Lind and others have turned their attention to Idea-Driven Warfare, which according to Wilson et al was cited in an al-Qaeda-affiliated internet magazine as the foundation of al-Qaeda's military doctrine. 
298
299
300
Yet how the West can deal with foes using 4GW concepts, where the tactics of the weak confound the tactics of the strong, is still not well understood. A number of commentators argue that Western "targeteers" (using 2GW) are defining and attacking artificial, physical enemy centres of gravity with precision weapons -bringing to mind an old adage that when your only tool is a hammer, all your problems look like nails -when the real centre of gravity is a shared religious/ideological goal where common purpose and zealotry replace military equipment and command structure. Wilson, one of Lind's coauthors in the 1989 4GW article, concludes that: "…as technophiles Westerners are enraptured by weapons of great precision but have lost sight of the fact that people and ideas are the essence of why wars are fought and for how long." 
301
The Other Side of the Fence: Some Asian Views on Small Wars Some of the most well known perspectives on small wars, from the standpoint of the insurgents, come from China and Vietnam. The theory and practice of small wars from their perspective follows.
Twentieth and 21 st Chinese century military thought is based on Chinese cultural influences, such as Confucianism and Daoism, as well as a number of ancient Chinese texts, including those written by Sun Tzu.

Mao emphasised the need for the people and the conflict to be united in a war of resistance and, in a similar fashion, so did Ho.

The final part of this section will discuss some examples of Canadian approaches to influence operations in the last half of the 20 th century and the early years of the 21 st century. First we will examine the basis of Canadian foreign and security policy after the Second World War, which employed a variety of influence activities to establish and to maintain Canada's position as a "middle power" with "a place at the table" in various alliances and international organizations. Next we will examine post-Cold war influence activities of senior Canadian commanders in their leadership roles in various alliance and coalition operations in the new security and defence environment, because, in the absence of formal doctrine, their actions define current Canadian approaches to influence operations.
The last half of the 20 th century was characterized not only by omnipresent violence, but also by international tension and the threat of nuclear war. Although the formal cessation of hostilities in 1945 had concluded a worldwide struggle against fascism, it also marked the end of an uneasy wartime alliance of two other differing ideologies, those of communism and capitalism. In his 1949 preface to the 4 th edition of his seminal work Colony to Nation: A History of Canada, eminent Canadian historian Arthur Lower accurately captured the tensions that were present in the bipolar world of the late modern era and that threatened Canada's, and the world's, security and very existence:
It is from the outside world that the storms threaten. Two states of unparalleled power face each other in an uneasy 'peace.' Two ways of life, which is not too much to call religions, clash in mutual denunciations. State and religion in each case coincide. The atomic bomb hangs over humanity like Damocles' sword.

The groundwork of Canadian national strategy during the Cold War was provided in a 1947 address at the University of Toronto by Louis St Laurent, then Secretary of State for External Affairs and later Prime Minister from 1948 to 1957. St. Laurent's speech placed Canada firmly in the same camp as the Western allies and outlined how salience within that alliance would be achieved. First, he proposed that Canadian foreign policy would act as a unifying influence within the country and it could do this best by reflecting the values and ideals of Canadian society, as, "The role of this country in world affairs will prosper only as we maintain this principle, for a disunited Canada will be a powerless one." Second, Canada should support political liberty, thus "a threat to the liberty of Western Europe, where our political ideas were nurtured, was a threat to our way of life." Third, Canadian foreign policy should support the rule of law and St Laurent, in an allusion to the state of affairs within the Soviet Union, suggested that a lesson could be learned from "the hideous example of the fascist states of the evil that befalls a nation when the government sets itself above the law." Fourth, foreign policy should be based on "some conception of human values." St Laurent argued that Canada should "protect and nurture" these values and he emphasized that the rights of the individual should not be determined by considerations of material wealth. Last, arising from the desire to enact policy that was in keeping with the previous principle, Canada had an imperative to take on external responsibilities because the "security for this country lies in the development of a structure of international organizations." Unlike the devastated countries of Europe, Canada was intact and should act in concert with a number of like-minded countries, a list from which the Soviet Union was glaringly absent. The speech stressed the value of Canada's numerous treaties and agreements, and it attempted to steer clear of advocating too close a relationship with Great Britain to avoid criticisms from French-speaking Canadians. St Laurent said that Canada would avoid regionalism, but he acknowledged that this country had a close connection with the US complicated by the fact that a "relationship between a great and powerful neighbour and its smaller neighbour is at best far from simple." St. Laurent also stressed proportionality in Canada's policies because Canada was "a secondary power" and would cooperate in "constructive international action," but he could and would not advocate activities that only larger countries could undertake, saying that, "There is little point in a country of our stature recommending international action, if those who must carry the major burden of whatever action is taken are not in sympathy." 
323
Although the formation of the UN in 1945 had been met with high expectations, the effectiveness of the international body was soon in doubt. In September 1946, St Laurent characterized the UN as "impotent" and not a venue through which Canada could make an appropriate contribution to international security. 
324
The Charter had been based on the concept of an extension of the wartime alliance into peacetime. The 'United' in UN came from the Atlantic Charter of 1941 and referred to nations united in war, not in peace. The permanent members of the Security Council with the power of veto were the leaders of a victorious wartime alliance, and the Charter assumed, with a stunning lack of political realism, that they would stay united in supervising, and if necessary, enforcing, world peace.

The end of the Korean War also marked an increased western fear of Soviet nuclear and conventional forces. The Canadian relationship with the US at that time therefore became defined through the bipolar world of the Cold War and as a result Canada expanded its defence establishment to meet this new threat with Canada's NATO contributions solidifying Canada's self image as a staunch ally. 
341
RCAF participation in NORAD also exemplified this tendency. NORAD had developed from the Military Cooperation Committee-sponsored Joint Canadian-US Basic Security Plan of 5 June 1946 that, in turn, had evolved almost unchanged from bilateral wartime arrangements. This operational plan committed the air forces of both countries to a common air defence system, as well as the provision of air intercept capabilities for the protection of critical areas. 
342
In the context of these events, Canada's participation in UN missions gives lie to the populist myth of the Canadian altruistic peacekeeper.

There was little enthusiasm in meeting this request [to contribute to the Military Observer Group for India and Pakistan December 1948]. The matter was referred to the Cabinet by Hon. Brooke Claxton, and in his words the Cabinet was 'allergic' to the proposal, wondering why Canada had been asked and who else had accepted…The decision as to whether or not Canada should participate was left up to the Prime Minister and the S.S.E.A. [Secretary of State for External Affairs]... There can be no doubt that Mr. Pearson [the S.S.E.A.] carried the day. He even offered to have External Affairs pay the costs for two of the four officers requested.

Currently, Canada continues to maintain this tradition of seeking opportunities to demonstrate international salience. It has been argued by some that Canada's involvement in Afghanistan was in part due to a desire to be seen as relevant within NATO and, in particular, to the US. The following statement by Prime Minister Jean Chretien made on 7 October 2001 provides the context for Canada's ongoing commitment in Afghanistan: On Sept. 11, 2001, Canada and the world looked on in shock and disbelief as the deadliest terrorist attack in history was carried out against thousands of defenceless victims in New York and Washington.
This was an act of premeditated murder on a massive scale with no possible justification or explanation --an attack not just on our closest friend and partner, the United States, but against the values and the way of life of all free and civilized people around the world.
From the moment of the attack, I have been in close communication with President George Bush who has been a symbol to the world of calm, courage, resolve and wisdom. I told him that Canada stands shoulder to shoulder with him and the American people. We are part of an unprecedented coalition of nations that has come together to fight the threat of terrorism. A coalition that will act on a broad front that includes military humanitarian, diplomatic, financial, legislative and domestic security initiatives. 
351
Canada's armed forces have been called upon to engage in missions ranging from war to peacekeeping to military assistance activities in the post-Second World War era as part of her actions designed to attain strategic influence on the world stage. In the post-9/11 era, the CF's missions have been wide ranging and largely undocumented in the literature. The next section describes some of the recent influence activities conducted by senior Canadian commanders in various alliance and coalition operations in the new security and defence environment, based on interviews with them, as one way of gaining an awareness of some current Canadian approaches to influence activities.
Introduction. The physical and cultural settings in which armed forces operate, as has been noted in a recent book on networked operations, have a major impact on how they conduct operations. 
353

357
The lack of clear strategic objectives, a unifying concept of operations, and the resources of larger countries has forced the CF, in many cases, to construct hybrid human-technical networks in order to allow for interaction and to create cooperation among the numerous diverse groups involved in a particular mission. As noted earlier here, the post-Cold War Canadian naval experience has indicated that future operations at sea will likely be composed of ad hoc "coalitions of the willing," where the differences in culture, technology, capabilities, and command relationships in such coalitions dictate that "cooperation and coordination" replace "command and control" in the C 2 lexicon. This new paradigm of "cooperation and coordination" depends on leadership or influence behaviours among peers more than traditional concepts of command involving the exercise of authority over subordinates. From a Canadian Army perspective, successful commanders have had to place much greater emphasis on the creation of shared awareness in order to overcome the ambiguity and corresponding friction found in current operating environments. While mission command is practised differently in the land and sea environments, both the Army and the Navy have recognized the need to create shared awareness among all actors using mission command or command-byinfluence. Therefore, operations in an "integrated" or JIMP context will require the use of influence activities to create the effective social networks necessary for success. A significant challenge to achieving a common understanding of networked operations in theses circumstances is that there is no standard model for a networked system, because different missions and different operating environments require different types of networks.
358
For example Brigadier-General (now Major-General) Peter Devlin, Force Commander from 2003-2004 of the Kabul Multinational Brigade in Afghanistan, as part of the International Security Assistance Force, noted that with the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) in Kandahar the Canadian military was working along side the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade, the Canadian International Development Agency, "some economic development folks, maybe some Treasury Board folks, maybe some infrastructure folks." All those working together in this group, according to Devlin, shared "the information that's necessary for them to be able to make decisions, give some direction and then assess the results of that direction."
359
Establishing trust was equally important in a multinational naval operating environment, according to Commodore (now Rear-Admiral) Roger Girouard, commander of Task Force 151 from January to June 2003 during Operation Apollo/Enduring Freedom. He said: "It is about trust. It is about getting out there, certainly as a Mission Commander, getting out there and looking [in] your bosses' eyeballs and getting out there and doing that wonderful Nelsonian thing, looking in the eyeballs of your Captains." In his experience, this personal contact enabled him to talk frankly with his superiors and subordinates about issues and concerns in ways that would not be possible in message form or even in "chat" on the internet. With the pace and the risk (including political risk) involved in today's operations, he added, "trust matters more today than it ever has…"
360
Influence and Command Style. One of the key issues in influence operations in coalition and "integrated" operations is using the command style appropriate to achieve the desired influence among partners and colleagues. Based on the experience of Canadian commanders like Girouard, we have seen that in ad hoc "coalitions of the willing" C 2 is taken to mean "cooperation and coordination." This change reflects the reality of command in coalition, and arguably "integrated," operations where leadership or influence behaviours among peers has come to replace traditional concepts of command involving the exercise of authority over subordinates. Therefore, in these operations influencing others based on concepts such as emergent leadership and distributed leadership may be more useful than attempting to influence others based on concepts of authority.

Closely related to the issue of information requirements, according to Gosselin, is the necessity to improve the willingness of senior leaders to delegate decision making authority. He believes that while accountability remains with commanders, delegation of authority must be practised more frequently: "…you need to ask yourself very clearly; why do I have to make that decision? And [the reason given] should not be because the…[person] before me did it." 
368
Based on his experience with the US Army, Natynczyk stated that a major advantage of networked operations was that "…now the senior commander can see this incredibly complex theatre" and, when necessary, focus on just a few elements or indicators that "could really turn the tide between success and failure." He referred to these elements or indicators as "Actionable Metrics," which he described as "performance measurement tools that you can now apply based upon all of the inputs from the technology … to be able to see what kind of attacks were occurring [and] when." Actionable Metrics, according to Natynczyk, allowed the US Army in Iraq to establish trends and to see how the enemy changed tactics, and then respond to changes in enemy tactics.

Commanders and Technical Competencies. While most of those interviewed for the networked operations report felt that human networks and the interpersonal competencies required to establish and maintain them were vital competencies for successful commanders to possess,
380
Gosselin, for example, felt strongly that commanders must have the same degree of technical understanding of their supporting network technology as they do of any other major combat system so that they can specify their requirements in operational terms. Once commanders have defined their needs in operational terms, e.g., secure access to all liaison officers, it is the job of the technical experts to meet those needs. Unfortunately, according to Gosselin, the CF tends to take the reverse approach, whereby commanders ask technical specialists what they can provide in the way of capabilities and then commanders select from the menu of capabilities provided by the specialists. Gosselin blames senior leaders for this state of affairs because many commanders and senior staff often cannot articulate their C 2 needs adequately. He concluded that: "If you don't understand what it [technology] can do for you, if you don't take the time to ask the questions, then you're not helping. It's like if you don't understand the capability of your combat system…" Natynczyk implied that the Canadian Army did not understand enough of the technical dimensions of network-enabled systems to succeed in its transformation because, in his view, the technological aspect of Canadian Army transformation "to be quite frank has been a dismal failure" due to the kind of technology that was bought. The equipment that was purchased has not given the Army the ability to create the effects that it desires, he continued. Whereas, he suggested that the Canadian Navy is "much better off because they have an imperative to be interoperable with the US Navy," and the Canadian Air Force has essentially the same interoperability needs as the Canadian Navy because of the Air Force's close integration with the US Air Force in such organizations as NORAD. 
381
382
Girouard also noted that there has been significant progress in the connectivity, timeliness, rapidity of information transfer, and fidelity of networked systems. However, in his opinion, the challenge today is to present the commander with a manageable amount of information by sorting the relevant from the irrelevant. A combination of technological awareness and an awareness of the human dimension of command is required by commanders to discriminate between useful and irrelevant information provided by the network, according to Girouard. He did not think that either technical systems or those running them should be responsible for determining the value of information; he believed that the intelligence community and the operators had that responsibility. However, he did not believe that they were always as effective as they should be in discharging that responsibility, and that sometimes technical concerns were allowed to take precedence over operational imperatives. He concluded that getting "the right stuff at the right time to the right guy in need" is the "holy grail" of networked operations today. One way to approach this ideal is to take better advantage of the competencies of all of those, including NCMs, who are nodes in the network, and to encourage them to be disciplined and to provide commanders with the information that the commanders need based on their understanding of commander's intent. He elaborated on this idea by saying that individuals needed the competencies to understand where they fit into both the human and the technical networks, and, based on commander's intent, take the initiative to select what information the commander needed to focus on among the mass of data available and then make judgements about when to engage superiors with relevant information. 
383
A key issue in most discussions of influence operations is the nature of intelligence and how that intelligence is used in influence operations. However, there is little discussion in doctrine or in the literature about the different types of intelligence required by different forces, depending on the environment in which they are operating. Some senior Canadian naval commanders have drawn our attention to the significant differences in approaches to gathering and using intelligence in this context. For example, Girouard found that the Canadian approach to intelligence is still largely army-oriented, and this resulted in "Reams and reams… of data being pushed at you that really had no pertinence to the work that you were doing [in a maritime environment]…"

The following comments give the insights of an American analyst on how American culture affects the ability of the US to conduct operations in the cognitive domain. His comments are followed by the views of some senior Canadian military officers on the effects of Canadian military culture on Canadian operations.
An expert on military intelligence and counter-terrorism and former US Army officer, cited at the beginning of this report, offers these insights into the influence of American culture on how the US armed forces conduct operations in the post-9/11 era: Americans seem to be poorly equipped to engage in campaigns in the cognitive domain. Our culture is a material one; and this causes us to think in physical terms. Orders of Battle are relatively easy to tally. The inherent difficulty of tracking and assessing perceptions offends our fetish for the quantitative. In spite of W. Edwards Denning's exhortation that "The most important numbers are unknown and unknowable," many feel that "If it can't be measured, it's not worth knowing." It is common for people and institutions to simply ignore that which is not intuitively obvious or readily quantifiable.
Being consciously pluralistic and multicultural, our society reflexively avoids matters of culture. Even thinking about or discussing culture and values is often viewed as vaguely impolite, or possibly even subversive (the question of subversive of what remains an interesting paradox). We make a point of not noticing or acknowledging culture or values; and we are dutifully oblivious to them as they change around us, vigorously eschewing any efforts to consciously manipulate them. Our pluralism often results in abrupt shifts in foreign and military policies, which makes it difficult to maintain the consistency that is the necessary basis of successful strategy, most especially in the cognitive domain.
Americans, God love us, are a provincial people. As such, we tend to assume that that which we know is necessarily universal. Accordingly, we assume that other people are largely as we are, and largely share our values. Because of this, we generally seek to influence foreign peoples as we ourselves would be influenced. We see others through a "mirror image"; and we attempt to interact with them according to the rules that govern our paradigm. We routinely fail at this, or we ultimately succeed only at enormous and unnecessary expense. Trusting in faith and not in history, we do this again and again. Like any rational actor that finds themselves working on an unproductive path, but unaware of the existence (or even possibility) of any alternative path, when we determine that our efforts are fruitless, we redouble them. Thus, we find ourselves disposing of the world's largest economy and defense budget, striding the world like a colossus, the world's only "hyperpower," able to humble any armed force anywhere in the world, but unable to pacify occupied territories or persuade small groups of lightly armed people that we are not their enemies and that random killing innocent civilians is not a legitimate expression of religious devotion.
Recent advances in information technologies have enabled us to enhance our ability to transmit data; but here too, we do so in the almost total absence of consciousness of the cultural content or impact of that data, except at the lowest and most superficial levels (such as commercial product advertising). These facts have led us to focus on and dominate the physical and information domains; but to remain oblivious to actions in, and often even the existence of, the cognitive domain.
Most of our efforts and resources dedicated to conflict are only tangentially relevant to the central nature of conflict, especially the types of conflict that we now face. Human action is shaped, and wars are ultimately won and lost, in the cognitive domain. In view of this, all of our warfighting efforts should focus on ultimately achieving victory in that domain. Our existing doctrine and concept development work acknowledge the cognitive domain in passing; but do not focus on it, or acknowledge its primacy in war. As a consequence of this, there tend to be huge gaps in our offensive and defensive preparations for war and for military operations other than war, especially in the area of information operations (in its broadest sense). All of our preparations for conflict, starting with concept and doctrine development, should be structured with the need to dominate and win in the cognitive domain as both the point of departure and the ultimate goal.

Emerging Canadian Approaches to Influence Operations. Although Canada has yet to develop a comprehensive approach to the challenges of the post-Cold War security and defence environment, practice, as described in some sources, gives us an idea of the Canadian philosophy towards operations at the beginning of the 21 st century. Aspects of this philosophy were articulated in 2004 by General Rick Hillier (now CDS) when he was commander of the International Security Assistance Force:
In normal operations one attempts to overwhelm the enemy. There is an attempt to tear the enemy down instead of build yourself up. In post conflict environments one must constrain the growth of the threat forces and manage the perceptions that there is an increase in measurable government capacity. The military component is just one element of the overall campaign [emphasis added].

Post-Conflict Operations In an attempt to address the issues raised by Hillier, the Canadian Army has sought an immediate solution by adopting doctrine concerning influence activities that mirrors NATO doctrine, but, as noted at the beginning of this report, the NATO doctrine is based on concepts promulgated by the United Kingdom.
While this approach provides an immediate solution to the dilemmas presented in the contemporary environment of conflict, there is significant risk in adopting alliance or other nations' doctrine without careful analysis of one's own national experience. For 396 Fuller believed that the ultimate weakness of Clausewitzian theory to be its misunderstanding of the role that peace played in shaping warfare and that the violence of conflict disconnected from the strategy required for the establishment of a lasting peace results in nothing more than a temporary cessation of hostilities.

War, 1789

example, despite being taught in PME, this doctrine could be ignored and later discarded without ever being used, if, as noted earlier in this report, it does not reflect our national practice or if it is not congruent with our national or military cultures. Effective CF doctrine should be derived from an analysis of past CF operations to deduce reoccurring trends and to formulate hypotheses on which the body of material that constitutes doctrine can be based. At this point in time, the CF has a great deal of operational experience based on its activities in the Balkans and Afghanistan, there has been no systematic and rigorous analysis of this experience. In many ways, like the Canadian application of operational art, our ideas of influence may be unique to the Canadian experience and therefore need to be recognized as such. One thing that stands out clearly in this emerging Canadian approach to operations is that in order to "manage perceptions," as Hillier put it, there will be a need for CF influence activities in the future.
A workshop on the topic of Enhanced Influence Operations was held at DRDC Toronto 23-24 May 2007. About 30 participants with an interest in this topic were invited from the CF, DND and organizations in the UK and Australia. The aims of the workshop were 1) to enable discussion between researchers, subject matter experts, and practitioners relating to the development of influence concepts and their application within future military operations; 2) to support DRDC Toronto in defining research requirements in support of enhanced CF influence operations; 3) to provide an opportunity for project stakeholders to contribute to this process; and 4) to consider the potential for future research collaboration in the area of influence. A synopsis of the workshop activities are at Annex A to this report.
Some key issues that were discussed at the workshop are briefly discussed next. Perhaps the most problematic issue raised at the workshop was that there are competing doctrinal constructs of information operations and influence operations, and, therefore definitions and terminology relating to these topics are not consistent.
Another important issue that was raised frequently during the workshop was the importance of the cultural dimension to influence activities, both our own culture and targets' cultures.
A great deal of discussion revolved around the issue of suitable measures of effects/effectiveness (MOEs). There was consensus that MOE tools are required to support influence operations, but, at the moment there is limited scientific research on MOEs to support influence activities.
Military participants at the workshop were concerned that future research on influence activities has practical applicability to real-world operations. For example, there is a requirement to create campaign design tools that incorporate influence operations explicitly and more completely into campaign design than is currently the case with existing tools.
The final section of this paper, on future research, suggests ways of addressing these, and other, issues.
Military operations, to be deemed successful in the new security and defence environment, must assist with creating the conditions for a durable and lasting peace in joint, multinational and multi-agency efforts which involve numerous state and non-state actors. The military contribution to these efforts is exceedingly complex and involves various influence activities. In Canada, it has been acknowledged that it is necessary for the Canadian Forces to establish strong connections with the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and the Canadian International and Development Agency, as well as other organizations, to address the modern dilemmas of post-conflict environments, such as Afghanistan. This idea has been formalized in the paradigm that has become known as "3-D + C."
The 3D + C approach, involving defence, diplomacy, development and commerce requires an increased level of interoperability among agencies that often lack a common coordinating infrastructure or planning methodology. In the absence of shared conceptual approaches and procedures the results of from the use of the 3D + C approach have at times been less than optimal because the language and methodology of current military doctrine does not fully meet that interoperability requirement.
Current Canadian operations in Afghanistan have created an unprecedented desire to achieve interdepartmental and interagency cooperation and coordination. Ideas of influence, coupled with systems analysis and effects-based approaches to planning, may provide a holistic methodology for envisioning the complex problems within the contemporary environment and creating viable options to address those problems. One possible model for incorporating influence activities into campaign planning is shown at Figure

Framing the System "The framing of the system is an ensemble of conceptual insights that produces a perception of space. Assuming that space is not a definite striated entity, but rather, an interpretation of a system of relations between objects, resources, movements, and effects, than the system framing is a spatial conceptualization of a specific strategic circumstantial context." Shimon Naveh (2005) Western doctrinal methods of problem analysis and generating options to construct enduring plans are currently derived from theories put forward by classical military theorists, such as Clausewitz, who was discussed earlier in this paper. While still usable, these doctrinal approaches are more suited for application in an environment where the predominant form of conflict is between nation states. Therefore, these models are of limited utility in current times where one's opponent is often transnational and robustly networked, as well as difficult to detect, discern and destroy. Furthermore, schemes of analysis derived from military theoreticians are not attractive tools for non-military partners. As a result, ideas and methods that are understandable and are acceptable to all involved must be devised and utilized to coordinate a myriad of actors and activities across all elements of alliance or national power to successfully address exceedingly difficult challenges.
Of all the current approaches to strategic and operational planning, systems analysis and effects-based approaches to operations seem to offer the best options for acceptable whole-of-government, or multi-agency, processes address the intricate problems of the contemporary environment. Systems analysis has been advocated in recent years by Israeli military theorist, Shimon Naveh, who has researched and written extensively on the topic, under the rubric of "Systemic Operational Design," and discussed its usefulness in creating military plans. Simplistically, systems analysis is a heuristic dialectical method which permits one to frame a problem in terms of the multitude of systems that comprise it. Paramount in this approach is an understanding of all actors in the environment and their relationship to each other. Broad perceptions of influence are particularly useful in understanding these connections. For example, as part of the systems analysis one would attempt to understand the effects that should be created within those systems to shape desired outcomes.

the practical implementation and continual assessment and reassessment of any chosen option is the selection of relevant measures of effectiveness that can be collected and analyzed in a systematic and accurate manner. A great deal of practical work in this regard has already been done in recent years by operational research scientists employed with the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan.

The notion of influencing adversaries, allies and neutrals to achieve one's goals with the minimum cost in blood and treasure is an ancient one. The writings of Sun Tzu and Thucydides, which are still used widely today in senior officer professional military education, show that actions like feints or demonstrations, threats and ultimata, as forms of coercion and deterrence, were all used as stratagems to influence adversaries, friends and neutrals. The ancients did not construct any specific models for applying their stratagems of influence; however, they used the stratagems regularly to achieve their goals while minimizing their losses, when possible.
Two of the most influential classical military thinkers, Clausewitz and Corbett, were examined because their work provides the foundation for much of military thought today on aspects of influencing the behaviour of other actors in the security and defence realm. While Clausewitz's ideas do not fit very well the criteria for influence operations used here, he did put forward some basic notions that underpin the use of influence today, namely the primacy of political aims in the conduct of war, the importance of moral (or psychological) factors in warfare, and the possibility of using various stratagems that we would consider as influence operations, such as demonstrations and threats, as legitimate ways to achieve political aims economically. As a student of Clausewitz, Corbett's work builds on that of the Prussian master. Furthermore, since Corbett was writing in the era when modern technology was revolutionizing some aspects of warfare, his work is closer to the modern concepts of influence operations. Corbett's work is particularly relevant in describing the need to coordinate the instruments of national power and various means to effect change in actors' behaviour.
The Soviets showed themselves to be Clausewitz's intellectual heirs, insisting that all warfare was political and that all instruments of power should be dedicated to victory. The Soviet writings on influence are difficult to access because of the lack of translations of many of them. However, while not speaking of influence operations directly, Soviet theorists clearly referred to certain aspects of influence operations today, such as surprise, deception, disinformation, and "reflexive control," in their works. In fact, one could argue that the idea of influence was embedded in all Soviet strategies, as the very purpose of any war, in their eyes, was to achieve influence over others.
In some ways the modern era of influence operations began with writings of the airpower theorists in the early 20 th century and then evolved in the writings of their successors in the late 20 th and early 21 st centuries. A number of themes found in the writings of the early airpower theorists have had a substantial impact on discussions of how to best influence the behaviour of adversaries and others. The most important of these themes was that airpower theorists were concerned with influencing the behaviour of all actors, not just adversaries; that, while they focussed on kinetic means, they were aware of and used non-kinetic means to achieve their effects; that the theorists' emphasis on aircraft acting "independently" to achieve effects was more related to their struggle for resources with other services that any empirical data; and that each theorist's ideas were adapted to be accepted by the particular national and service audience for which he was writing. Finally, the lurid nature of some of the airpower theorists' writings, the sensational depiction of their ideas in popular culture, and the devastation caused by Second World War bombing campaigns led many to characterize their theories as advocating massive destruction of societies to achieve their ends. However, in fairness to the airpower theorists, it should be remembered that even if their methods entailed some destruction, their goal was to use airpower to bring a quick and efficient end to conflict. The heirs of Douhet and other early 20 th century airpower theorists now use the term Effects Based Operations to describe their approach to conflict. At the heart of EBO is the intent to achieve effects by influencing a variety of actors in various ways, both kinetic and nonkinetic.
"Air Control" was an approach to what was sometimes called "imperial policing" that met all the criteria of influence operations. Theories of Air Control, based on the ideas of some airpower theorists and involving coercing recalcitrant tribesman to submit to British rule, despite their weaknesses are the basis for some forms of influence activities today including establishing no-fly zones and air operations, like Operation Allied Force in 1999, to coerce adversaries to change their behaviour.
The application of airpower in the Second World War seemed to disprove the airpower theorists' ideas, especially the idea of the "knockout blow from the air," as even unprecedented destruction in a number of countries did not bring the war to a quick conclusion. The theorists' ideas were resurrected in the "Air Atomic Age," however, based on the effect of the atomic bombs on Japan and the power of atomic bomb and then the hydrogen bomb which increased the destructive capabilities of air-delivered weapons to unimaginable size.
The nuclear age spawned a host of theories based on influencing various actors in different ways. As airpower practitioners focused on the technical application of the early airpower theories, a whole new field of study related to influence arose, which was dominated by academics and scientists. The main influence theories in nuclear age are now classified under the rubric of coercion theory, which is comprised of compellence, deterrence and coercive diplomacy. The coercion theorists postulated that victory through political concessions could be attained by the use of threats or discrete uses of force without having to resort to war. Coercion theories tend to be broken into two schools of thought -the largely American technical approach and the metaphysical approach. The analysis here suggests that, given the current state of knowledge, the technical approach has limited utility to the practical applications of influence operations. However, despite its limitations, the metaphysical approach, because some of its intellectual roots come from such ideas as John Warden's theory of the enemy as a system as well as the Clausewitzian concept of the centre of gravity, may be more appealing to military professionals.
The use of influence to achieve objectives is a constant theme in the "small wars" examined here. The British approach to small wars has evolved since the 19 th century so that non-kinetic effects have gradually replaced kinetic effects in the attempt to influence others. The American approach to small wars, while different in detail, is generally similar to the British approach. Both these approaches have come to rely on technology and explicit articulation of influence operation doctrine. The Asian approaches to small wars that were examined here use all the stratagems of influence operations, but the Asian approaches do not rely on technology or explicit statements of influence operation doctrine to the same extent that Western armed forces do. In fact, for Chinese and Vietnamese practitioners of small wars, the idea that influence would be limited by an "operation" might seem foreign to them, as the use of influence is implied throughout the whole of their political and military discourse.
Currently, the term "influence operations" is being used to define a fairly narrow set of activities, largely in a land force context, at the operational-level and tactical-level. However, from the doctrinal review conducted for this report, it can be seen that there is a lack consistency among current conceptual models and ideas related to "influence operations," even in US joint and service doctrine. Some commonality is, nevertheless, visible in some Western doctrine on influence operations. While British doctrine uses the less restrictive term "activity," instead of the more restrictive term "operation" found in most US doctrine, the general notion of influence activities is compatible in many ways with the US term. Furthermore, the framework to coordinate all activities related to influencing a target audience within a theatre of operations is based on ubiquitous US doctrine.
How influence is characterized by various organizations or writers is a function of culture and historical experience, both national and service. For example, the practice of describing influence in terms of an operation, as in the term "influence operation," is common in armies who, since the last two decades of the 20 th century, have been strongly influenced by the paradigm of operational art. In this army paradigm, campaigns are sequenced with the conduct of various operations, which are limited by time and resources.
Navies, on the other hand, see the application of influence differently. From their perspective, naval assets are constantly exerting influence. Whether from a ship's visit to a foreign port with a trade delegation aboard, to blockades, to full scale warfare, navies see themselves as constantly exercising influence along a continuum of violence.
Western air forces, particular the US Air Force and RAF, also view influence differently from armies because air forces have traditionally sought to link tactical actions (or outputs) to strategic outcomes with relatively small forces, compared to armies, and without necessarily applying the operational art. For most Western air forces their current approach to operations, Effects Based Operations, is essentially about influencing various actors based on experience and theories that have evolved from the beginning of the 20 th century. As noted above, the most recent NATO information operations doctrine appears to accept applying EBO to IO; however, US and Canadian land forces have not wholeheartedly done so. And their adoption of the term Effects Based Approach to Operations is a deliberate doctrinal statement to distance themselves from the air force EBO concept.
Canadian perspectives of attaining strategic influence arose from the crucible of the Second World War and are grounded in the historical experience of earning membership in a wartime alliance. During that conflict Canada's statesmen learned the realpolitik of grand and national strategy. They recognized the manner in which smaller countries could contribute and optimize their voice within alliances or international organizations and have consistently done so throughout the 20 th and 21 st centuries. Bilateral arrangements with the US, membership in NATO, NORAD and the UN, as well as recognizing individual opportunities to reinforce national interests, have provided the means through by which Canada achieves relevancy. In the final analysis, one can argue that despite popular images of Canada as an unbiased and neutral nation, the reality of Canadian participation in the international community is grounded in pragmatism and a desire to maintain influence with global reach.
The experience of senior Canadian commanders in recent influence activities has been diverse, depending on the physical environment and the coalition or other organization in which the experience took place. Despite this diversity of experience, there are some common threads in it, including Canada's ready acceptance into coalition leadership positions based on competence, enlightened leadership and management techniques; the value of Canadian national culture with its characteristics of accepting diverse cultures associated with its traditions of bilingualism and multiculturalism; and the value of Canada's military culture with its history of alliance and UN operations and its judicious exploitation of available technology.
Despite the significant experience of senior Canadian commanders in the domain of influence activities, Canadian doctrine on influence operations is immature and largely based on the doctrine of Britain and the US. Recent actions and comments by General Hiller, based on his Afghanistan ISAF experience and Canadian involvement in Afghanistan since then, point to an emerging Canadian approach to influence operations, but until there is rigorous study of this approach, it is unlikely to become part of Canadian doctrine.
The working definition contained in this paper provided four criteria to describe what might constitute an influence operation. In the paper, a pattern emerged from the identification of the criteria in relation to each contribution to the thought surrounding influence operations. Two of the criteria appeared to be covered by all cases in some form, those being the effects on the will, understanding or perceptions and the intent to create such effects as the primary goal of an action. The other two criteria, namely the universal applicability of influence operations and no necessity for the use of violence, were present in some cases but not all.
Based on this report and input received at the Enhanced Influence Operations Workshop (see above), the following areas seem to offer the most potential for future research.
The general confusion in terminology concerning a number of concepts of war and of other operations extends to the term influence operations. Consequently, one vital area for future research lies in clarifying these concepts and then identifying how influence operations or influence activities might fit within a more rigorous lexicon. One suggestion, based on research to date, is that influence is more appropriately seen as a philosophy or concept of operations rather than an "operation" or even an "effect." Cultural Issues. Another crucial issue is the importance of the cultural dimension to influence activities, both our own culture and targets' cultures. Specifically, research should focus on our own culture, culture in the environments in which the CF is operating or expects to operate in, and cultural change.
Measures of Effects/Effectiveness. Given the limited amount of scientific research on measures of effects/effectiveness (MOEs) to support influence activities, this appears to be a fruitful area for future research.
402
Influence Operations and Operational Art. One concept that dominates current military missions is the operational art; therefore, some research effort should be devoted to seeing how influence operations could fit into the operational art paradigm. For example, there is a requirement to create campaign design tools that incorporate influence operations explicitly and more completely into campaign design process than is currently the case with existing tools.
Canadian Experience with Influence Activities. Another area where profitable research could be conducted by DRDC would be to document and analyze the experiences of senior Canadian commanders with influence activities, particularly in the post-9/11 era.
Users of research related to influence activities, especially members of the CF, emphasized that future research on influence activities should have practical applicability to real-world operations.
General. A workshop on the topic of Enhanced Influence Operations was held at DRDC Toronto 23-24 May 2007. About 30 participants with an interest in this topic were invited from the CF, DND and organizations in the UK and Australia. In order to encourage a high degree of participation from those attending, the workshop format consisted of not only formal presentations, but also a series of syndicate and plenary discussions.
The aims of the workshop were 1) to enable discussion between researchers, subject matter experts, and practitioners relating to the development of influence concepts and their application within future military operations; 2) to support DRDC Toronto in defining research requirements in support of enhanced CF influence operations; 3) to provide an opportunity for project stakeholders to contribute to this process; and 4) to consider the potential for future research collaboration in the area of influence.
Aim. The aim of this report is to provide a synopsis of the main issues that arose from the syndicate and plenary sessions during the DRDC-sponsored workshop on Enhanced Influence Operations.
The intent of this syndicate session was to discuss the introductory presentation given by Keith Stewart and to explore the concepts contained in the draft KMG paper, "Influence Operations: Historical and Contemporary Dimensions dated 29 March 2007.  A specific critique of the model presented in the KMG paper, particularly the diagram in Figure 
1
Another issue that was raised concerned differing implications for Influence Operations at the strategic, operational, and tactical levels. Some questioned the need for the criterion of direction and coordination at the strategic and operational levels because it was unrealistic. The criterion was intended to capture the idea of coordinating the instruments of national power, but this interpretation excludes any influence activities below the operational level. The critique of this interpretation was based on the observation that, in many cases, operational-level elements have drafted their own strategic guidance and solicited its approval because, in reality, strategic level guidance from the strategic-level is often lacking.
The question of where "influence" is properly situated, whether at the strategic, operational and/or tactical level, or, in organizational terms, whether in the "2" or "5" cell in a joint headquarters. In the CF "influence" is subordinated to information operations, and is considered a "ways and means" or an activity carried out at the tactical level. In the British Army, "influence" is not something that is done at the operational level, the reason being that the term is seen as too tied up with activities at the strategic level; it is seen as more a conceptual rather than an operational term.
Others took issue with the phrase "direction and coordination at the strategic or operational levels" in the KMG paper definition. They said that there were many things that needed to be coordinated, and they raised the questions: coordination with what? what is being coordinated, with whom, and for what purpose?
A number of participants argued that the phrase "psychological and cognitive effects" in the KMG paper's definition is problematic. These terms were seen as not being very useful because they could mean virtually anything to anybody. Another critique of the definition in the paper was that "effects" are not something we "do" -we do activities and hope that the effects follow.
One syndicate proposed that the more general term "activities" be substituted for "operations" in the term "Influence Operations." In this context "activities" could include everything from psychological operations to public affairs to the manoeuvring of a tank unit. Another syndicate felt a greater need to specify whether influence operations were intended to target attitudes, intentions, or behaviours.
Approaching the definition from a different angle, influence activities can involve three elements or steps: 1) change, maintain, or enforce an attitude, belief, or will; 2) adopt, follow or desist from a behaviour; 3) follow or desist from a course of action. If only the first two steps are involved, it was hypothesized that this is propaganda activity, more properly a task for the political/diplomatic elements rather than the military.
Further syndicate discussion produced the following refinement of the definition: "Activities primarily intended to have a psychological and/or cognitive effect upon the will, understanding and/or perception of an adversary, third party, or ally."
In this conceptualization, the aim of influence activities is "to get inside the head" of the target, whether that target is an adversary, third party or ally. Accordingly, the phrase "upon the will, understanding and/or perception" was added to the definition to reflect this aim.
The question was then raised whether there is also a need to specify in the definition the broader purpose or context of the activities, i.e., to indicate why the military is bothering to undertake these activities. For example, should one include at the end of the definition the phrase: "…in support of campaign [or, alternatively, strategic] objectives."
It was argued that, in the Canadian context, this is not necessary, as the definition would be integrated into other doctrinal statements, thereby providing the broader context. In the UK experience, such a statement would normally be included to reflect the government's Comprehensive Approach.
This refined definition was then discussed in the context of the Oka crisis, specifically addressing whether (1) the local deployment of artillery, and (2) Gen de Chastelaine's statement that "we cannot not fail," leading to a rapid de-escalation of the crisis, could be considered influence activities consistent with the elements of this definition. It was generally thought that the "fit" of the activities with the definition in this instance was good.
Another syndicate suggested that, perhaps more problematic than finding a precise definition for Influence Operations, is the perception that "influence" is a negative, emotion-laden term, conjuring up images of government propaganda and underhanded manipulation. The question was posed as to whether these perceptions were the result of a disconnect between civil and military society in the West. If so, the question was asked if there was a greater role that Public Affairs should be playing in addressing this disconnect. Furthermore, the issue was raised of how much effort should be placed, when crafting the influencing message, in knowing that it may garner domestic awareness and commentary. In finding a solution to this negative perception issue, it was suggested that research into other options/terms, including a look at other languages' equivalences, should be conducted.
Other Critiques of Influence Operations. It was observed that military doctrine on influence operations was a prisoner of its constituency, i.e., it is doctrine because particular parts of the military community espouse it, and it may lack empirical evidence to support it.
Other Definitions of Influence Operations. It was pointed out that the UK's definition of Influence Operations is based on targeting the adversary's will and understanding. This approach is also supported by an increasing emphasis on media and marketing techniques, and is similar to that proposed in a recent RAND study.
403
Problems with Defining the Term "Influence Operations." A key issue that arose in the syndicate discussions was the potential confusion in using the term "influence" because it has been used to refer to ways, means, and/or ends.
The definition of "influence operations" may, in one sense, miss the key problem the military currently faces in the theatre of operations: cultural intelligence preparation of the battlefield. What the military needs to know is how the people in-theatre perceive the effects of the military's operations, and, yet this aspect of influence operations has not been fully developed.
Finally, the question was posed whether Influence Operations is actually more of a mindset, than an operation, per se?
An Alternative Approach to Defining Influence Operations. Many traditional approaches to defining concepts, in an attempt to clarify terminology, use the idea of a box to draw "hard and fast" boundaries around concepts like Influence Operations. In this traditional approach, the box would incorporate a set of specific influence capabilities. This traditional approach is the one that militaries are inevitably driven towards, because the allocation of budgetary funds among branches of the military and other organizations demands the drawing of boundaries. However, the traditional approach -drawing firm boundaries around a set of activities or capabilities -may not be a helpful way to move forward with our understanding of the concept of influence.
An alternative approach involves not thinking that we have a box at all, but to define the "centre point" of the concept and draw a radius, that changes over time, around it. In this approach, what we want to achieve is what lies at the "centre point" and "activities" then fall within the radius, the more relevant activities lying closer to the centre point. The key is this alternative approach is not to think of a box or even "to think outside the box.
In the Session 1 plenary session, the following issues were raised:
1. The term "influence" has multiple connotations and the following definitions could help to achieve more precision in understanding the term: a. Ends -an effect or series thereof b. Means -a method to achieve an effect c. Ways -resources to achieve an effect 2. Who determines the political acceptability of influence operations? 3. In influence operations it is important to understand the target of the operations in terms of: a. Attitudes b. Behaviour c. Intention 4. Understanding the target's culture is an important part of influence operations 5. Are influence activities acceptable in domestic operations? 6. In the definition of "influence operations" in the paper, the definition is confusing because the term "cognitive" has a specific meaning in psychology and is too limiting for the purposes of the definition. 7. Some felt that the criterion of strategic/operational in the definition in the paper too limiting 8. The diagram in the paper needs to highlight the importance of third parties 9. Measures of Effect/Effectiveness are difficult to achieve and their formulation requires careful consideration
The aim of the second session was to discuss CF information operations in light of the briefing the workshop received from LCol Hobbes on the state of CF doctrine pertaining to information operations and the related issues. Some of the issues raised included the practicality of measures of effectiveness/measures of performance, policy gaps and the integration of kinetic and non-kinetic activities into operations.
Doctrinal Differences. It was noted that there were a number of different approaches to Influence Operations in Western doctrine. One syndicate recommended that the concept contained in the NATO Coordination Draft version 1.8 be considered as a baseline. The concept, depicted in Figure 
2
Coordination function for a series of activities to obtain an effect Despite its provenance as NATO doctrine, this concept, does not reflect the opinions of all western militaries on the matter. For example, the US has a different concept in mind than the other militaries where it differentiates between kinetic effects (described as "Fires") and non-kinetic effects (described as "Influence"). A different approach has been taken by ABCA which holds that the terms "information operations" and "influence activities" are synonymous. There are dangers with the last two concepts that ought to be considered. First, if one treats all activities as leading to "effects," then an effects assessment board will cover all activities. This could lead to the concept of information operations withering. Second, the existence of multiple concepts within a number of overlapping multinational military organizations suggests that the issue of terminology is crucial. Any doctrinal concept must be clearly defined, without resorting to tautologies, and fit both the "'users"' and the target audience of the doctrine.
The issue of integrating both kinetic and non-kinetic activities within the rubric of a single operation was also raised. The discussion of this issue included the consideration of whether or not information operations ought to be an annex to an operations order or part of the main body and how commanders could be advised on information operations. Consensus quickly developed that relegation of information operations to an annex would perpetuate the confusion between information operations as a combination of effects and information operations as a collection of non-kinetic enablers. More discussion followed on how tactical commanders from sub-unit and higher have advisors at hand to assist them with other activities, i.e., artillery advisor, engineer advisor, political advisor, legal advisor, development advisor, etc., but seldom did they have an advisor on information operations. This issue requires more careful consideration, but the commander's role in integrating both types of activity to achieve specific effects is crucial.
It was noted that influence activities have taken on greater importance in the post-Cold War world. During the Cold War competition with the Soviet Union, the concern of the West was to contain tactical and operational activities in order to keep the confrontation from escalating to the strategic level. In the post-Cold War world, however, with the eyes of the media (and the cameras and cell phones of soldiers themselves, e.g., Abu Ghraib) focused on operations in the field, tactical actions increasingly have a strategic impact -the "strategic corporal" problem. This new circumstance has to be taken into account in the planning process.
Given these new circumstances, the question was raised as to how does one train personnel in influence activities. Do we have the means to train in these activities, or is this something than can only be done during course of operations? In its training, the CF tries to replicate the operational environment. For example, at the operational level wargaming has evolved from the Cold War years in that more non-military people, e.g., psychologists, other government officials, politicians, etc., are brought in to represent the adversary (or Red Team). This is consistent with the "whole of government," or integrated approach to operations advocated by the CF.
It was also observed that the Provincial Reconstruction Teams (PRTs) -civil-military transition teams -deployed in Afghanistan are influence capabilities unto themselves.
Because of the integrated make up of these teams, their various members are pipelines directly to their own organizations in the "whole of government." This uncoordinated and fragmented reporting networks raises some questions as to where various members of the PRTs fit into the chain of command. Nevertheless, PRTs are a good indicator of what the future may look like with respect to integrated influence activities.
The importance of language for influence activities was highlighted by one syndicate.
The question was posed whether the traditional academic approach to language training was appropriate for current influence activities. The skills such training imparts may be completely wrong for what the corporal needs on the ground. Moreover, there is the problem of anticipating what language skills will be needed over the long term, given that resources for language training are not unlimited. Multicultural countries such as Canada have an advantage, however, in that there is a wide diversity of cultural communities with the requisite language and cultural skills upon which the government may draw.
Given a recurring theme of cultural awareness being key to Influence Ops, a positive aspect of the CF's Reserve focus in this area is the reality that most of the units and personnel involved are from large cities with disparate ethnic communities, where cultural awareness and diversity may not be unusual. While the military members were painfully aware of raising Reserve Restructure issues, in order to exploit this situation it was suggested that greater emphasis be placed on recruiting Info Ops capabilities within urban areas, and that Combat Arms and non-Intelligence Combat Support recruiting be more focused on rural communities.
It was noted that most of the CF's current Influence Ops capability, i.e., the PsyOps and CIMIC capabilities, is embedded within the Reserves. Some wondered if this was the optimal structure given Reservists' limited training time (seen as two-week blocks) and the absence of "modular options" for much of the Info Ops training.
Currently, in the CF, Influence Operations are the purview of the J5 staff. The suggestion was made that Influence Operations should fall under the J3, closely informed by the J2. This suggestion was based on the view that since the J5 was not intimately involved with current operations the J5 was taken less seriously by commanders than other members of their staff because commanders tend to focus on current operations in order to respond to government and media pressures. Given the recognition of importance of Influence Ops some believed that it should migrate to the J3 organization in order to garner appropriate consideration. It was also noted that there is a need for a cultural shift within the senior military ranks with regard to the importance of influence activities for operations. They should not be an "Annex O add-on," but must be an integral part of J3/J5 planning included from the start of the process.
It was suggested that there was a need to coordinate the message being given by the public affairs and the information operations functions. This coordination has been achieved, in part, by the use of the "at a glance" sheet. The sheet is not a comprehensive plan, rather it is a summary of the plan used to task public affairs and info ops personnel, so that each may then go off to "do their own thing" within the framework of an overarching plan.
More generally, it was felt that there should be a higher level authority coordinating the public affairs national level campaign theme and the info ops military theatre campaign theme to ensure that they are not at odds with each other. The reality, however, is that there are often tensions between the two themes.
Measures of Effect/Effectiveness. The issue of Measures of Effect/Effectiveness (MOE) was first raised in Session 1 and discussion on this topic continued throughout the workshop. The question was raised of whether we were talking about Measures of Effect or Measures of Effectiveness. This question was not resolved by the group.
It was noted that MOEs are necessary for planning influence activities as well as for measuring campaign effectiveness. They are also necessary as a means of demonstrating value for money to senior leaders. In this context, the question was raised if we really know how to do MOE in the context of influence activities? Given the current lack of MOEs for influence activities, is the problem simply one of insufficient resources to gather MOEs? Or is there a gap in our understanding of the concept of MOE in the context of influence activities? This discussion raised the question of what tools we need to do MOE. Do they already exist, making it a matter of selecting the appropriate tools, or do we need to develop other valid tools? Some participants noted that these issues are linked to the Effects Based Approach to Operations.
Related to the discussion of understanding MOEs, was the question of how and when one measures the effects of the activities intended to target the adversary's will and understanding of a situation. While the issue underlying the debate is too complex to address in a short discussion, it did lead to the conclusion that the cultural context of any influence operation is crucial. In practical terms, this meant that not all MOE data could be gathered remotely, and that a certain amount needed to be gathered "on the ground." From a resource perspective, it was noted that every Measure of Effectiveness meant that tactical forces had to gather at least one element of information in the course of their normal, often extremely hectic, duties. This was a warning to collect only the information that was vital as opposed to merely useful.
An issue related to the gathering and interpretation of MOEs was idea that reality is often inferred and seldom shared. Different individuals and organizations will construe events differently, and, within one's own forces, the assessment of any given situation will vary. Third parties and adversaries will see events in a different way again and this leads to the requirement for "red lens" or "red team" activities to understand how an adversary depicts reality. In addition, this problem may require research on how to build an understanding of a complex adaptive system as an environment as well as war being a contest between two complex adaptive systems.
Another issue that was raised focused on when it was best to collect information and the management of expectations of those receiving the information, i.e., some senior leaders expected more precision than was currently possible from MOEs related to influence operations.
In the Session 2 plenary session, the following issues were raised:
1. There are competing doctrinal constructs of information operations and influence operations 2. Any terminology used in doctrine should take both users and the audience into account 3. Measures of Effect/Effectiveness require: a. Realistic time intervals between data collection and analysis b. A credible process (results must relevant to users) c. Links to EBAO d. Clearly defined tasks for tactical forces 4. The integration of information operations into traditional operations may be difficult to achieve, and may require an information operations advisor to assist Commanders in understanding because Commanders tend to come from operational backgrounds and have little familiarity with information operations 5. Is more training, of not only military personnel but also politicians and civil servants required, to effectively conduct information operations? How do you train all ranks to be better "sensors" for information operations? 6. A gap analysis is required for on key leader engagement activities but it appears that soldiers to have some language and cultural skills to do this activities effectively 7. Should influence operations be assigned to the J2 or J3 staff function? 8. Can information flow faster to Canada to improve on force generation activities? 9. Culture needs to be understood on three levels: a. Own culture b. Day-to-day culture of the operating environment c. Cultural change
The intent of this syndicate session was for each syndicate to identify at least five research questions for the DRDC -Toronto Adversarial Intent Section in light of LCol Vanasse's presentation on his recent experiences in Kabul and Kandahar and the other presentations and discussions in the Workshop.
The presentation indicated that there was clear dissatisfaction with influence operations in Afghanistan to date, attributed primarily to a lack of awareness by leadership of both the capabilities and the requirements to facilitate those capabilities. While it was noted that "operations were being planned by people who had never met an Afghan or left the camp," much of the blame was placed upon the CF Lessons Learned system. There were divergent views, however, on what precisely was the problem. Discussion centred on some possible ways to address the current shortcomings in influence operations.
The question was asked if there are different knowledge requirements for commanders, operators, and analysts? If so, what are the differences? When should influence operations be introduced into CF training and education activities.
It was observed that the CF does not have an effective lessons learned capability and that the most active lessons learned capability is the Canadian Army's Lessons Learned system. However, the Army's system appears to be more effective at the tactical than at the strategic level, because this is where the Army's focus of collecting information currently lies (i.e., lessons to improve soldiers' combat effectiveness and survivability).
The question was then raised that, with the demise of the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff Group as the CF's central body for joint lessons learned and joint doctrine with the latest CF transformation initiatives, who should collect information on strategic/operational lessons, and who is adjusting operations accordingly?
A weak link in current operations is in deployed intelligence support for those operations -in both its focus on briefing "peripherally-involved NDHQ staff" as opposed to staffs conducting current operations and in the degree of cultural and operational awareness held by many intelligence personnel. Suggestions to improve deployed intelligence support for current operations ranged from assigning personnel to specialize in focussing on a limited regions through significant periods in their careers, as opposed to the current emphasis on training generalist intelligence personnel, to accepting an extended predeployment period (12-18 months), in which language, history, and cultural awareness is acquired through civilian institutions.
Another suggestion to address current shortcomings in influence operations was that the CF may wish to restrict its activities to mainly planning Influence Operations, leaving the majority of the execution of operations to the local citizens, as they would be more credible messengers. In this context by T.E. Lawrence noted that "it is better that they do it badly, than we do it perfectly."
In the Session 3 plenary session, the following issues were raised:
1. A clear conceptual framework for information operations, complete with accepted terminology, is needed 2. What kinds of tools or organizations are required for such as influence operations and deception? 3. Suitable measures of effects/effectiveness tools to support information operations 4. A Target Audience Analysis framework is required 5. Information operations assets are frequently misused because they are misunderstood (see point 4 from plenary Session 2) 6. Cultural awareness and training are required for influence operations conducted as part of counterinsurgency operations 7. There is a need to better understand the media's role as they affect domestic perceptions of influence operations 8. There is a requirement to create campaign design tools that incorporate influence operations explicitly and more completely than is currently the case with existing tools 9. New campaign design tools should be able to model the adversary "system"
In the final session, the group considered possible questions/tasks for future research based on the state of the scientific literature on influence operations.
State of the Scientific Literature on Information Operations. It was noted that context is lacking in much of the research on military influence operations. Most authors focus on demonstrable scientific (what some termed "sterile") research, with no concept of applicability to real-world operations. Extant Western cultural studies do not address the issue of universality of principles, and are therefore of limited or questionable value in considering what may influence a non-Western audience. It was argued that there is a requirement to research what techniques are working for various adversaries' influence operations in order to produce a counter-campaign, or at least to minimize the effectiveness of their campaign.
The following issues related to the scientific literature and future research on influence operations were raised:
1. In researching the relationship between perceptions and attitudes a number of variables are at work that complicate the situation 2. Some participants emphasized the need to provide operationally relevant scientific support through an understanding of the operational context, including focused research on decision-making in contexts and influence through others as well as the influence of others. 3. The possible relevance of social marketing/recruiting practices to influence operations, as described in the scientific literature, was raised 4. The existence of inconsistent concepts and the application of them in the field of influence operations was detrimental to research efforts 5. From a research perspective, Zimbardo's model suggests a holistic/experimental view of the world as opposed to a rational/deconstructionist view 6. When framing research questions, one must be clear as to the purpose of the research: is it to understand better a gap in capabilities, or is it to develop ways to close the gap? 7. Influence should be seen as a dynamic process, for example, not only does the CF conduct influence operations outside of Canada but the CF is influenced by its experiences in such places as Afghanistan.
Research Questions. The following research questions were suggested by the participants in plenary session:
Cultural Intelligence Preparation of the Battlefield (CIPB). The research task would be to develop a methodology, which applies irrespective of geographic area, to understand cultural nuances in order to create the capabilities to succeed in an area and predict effects. Understanding the gap in our knowledge, we must then develop tools for conducting CIPB.
Key Leader Engagement (KLE). What do we want to do in KLE, and what is our ability to conduct KLE? How do others do it; and what can we learn from non-military KLE?
Campaign Design Tools. Do we understand the lines of operations in influence activities? How are influence activities articulated in campaign design tools? In these tools, all elements of national power must come together in a comprehensive, whole-ofgovernment approach.
How should influence activities be planned and coordinated with non-influence activities?
Is there a way of establishing how to address the "quick hits"? How does one get to know the situation (political, military, economic, societal, informational and institutional) so that one can make informed decisions on actions? This is a means of rephrasing how to shorten the intelligence to operations cycle.
What is the importance of and relationships to the Canadian military culture and the target audiences?
What is the relationship between international military effort and civil societies and how does it differ among nations?

Sun Tzu. Sun Tzu was a general who lived in the state of Wu (what is now the area surrounding Shanghai in China) in the Sixth Century BCE. French Jesuit missionaries translated his treatise on warfare, The Art of War, in 1782 and since that time it has been read widely across both the eastern and western worlds.

This is not really a new idea; Clausewitz stated that: "…the term diversion is understood such that an attack on the enemy's country as draws off forces from the principal point. It is only when this is the chief intention, and not the gaining of the object attacked on the occasion, that it is an enterprise of a special character; otherwise it is only an ordinary attack."

The authors would like to thank Lieutenant-Colonel William Cummings, The Royal Canadian Regiment, for his assistance in the formulation of this discussion.
In Sharpe and English, "Network Enabled Operations," 6, and above, Natynczyk gave an example of using Actionable Metrics at the section and platoon level from his experience in Iraq. However, these metrics were more oriented towards tactical operations than influence operations.

Enhanced Influence Operations Workshop
Syndicate 1
1. Can a clearer influence operations conceptual framework be developed to inform subsequent policy and doctrine development? The framework must include clear and comprehensible terminology that is not tautological. 2. What kinds of tools or organizations are required for influence operations? Do we adapt existing tools and organizations or do we start from first principles? 3. What kinds of tools or organizations are required for deception? Do we adapt existing tools and organizations or do we start from first principles? 4. Are there suitable and standardized measures of effectiveness that are universal?
If so, could a template be developed to save time and effort in future operations? Are there better tools to support the measurement of effects? 5. Could the Target Audience Analysis framework be revisited to make the process simpler?

1. Can the misuse of information operations assets be addressed? What solutions are there to this issue, i.e. structural, doctrinal, procedural, training? 2. How can a force develop a COIN [counterinsurgency] mindset? Does this require experience or can a suitable training environment provide the necessary experiences? How does one develop a sense of cultural awareness without experiencing the culture first hand? 3. Can a better understanding of the media's role on affecting domestic issues be developed and addressed through doctrine? 4. What cultural competency training is required to make every soldier an appropriate sensor? What is required to make analysts more effective? 5. Could a Target Audience Analysis framework be the foundation for a deeper understanding of an adversary or ourselves? Syndicate 3
1. Could the terminology surrounding influence operations and information operations be clarified with a view to conceptual coherency? 2. Could a gap analysis on the conduct of key leader engagements be undertaken? 3. Are there high-level influence activities distinct from lower-level activities?
Could this question be considered along the same lines as the levels of war? 4. Could campaign design tools be created to support the implementation of influence concepts in operations? 5. Can one model an adversary "system" in order to improve the understanding of adversary behaviour? 6. Can one template measures of effectiveness so as to have a "start state" for every operation?
These other research questions were also raised during the workshop. 13. ABSTRACT (A brief and factual summary of the document. It may also appear elsewhere in the body of the document itself. It is highly desirable that the abstract of classified documents be unclassified. Each paragraph of the abstract shall begin with an indication of the security classification of the information in the paragraph (unless the document itself is unclassified) represented as (S), (C), (R), or (U). It is not necessary to include here abstracts in both official languages unless the text is bilingual.) 14. KEYWORDS, DESCRIPTORS or IDENTIFIERS (Technically meaningful terms or short phrases that characterize a document and could be helpful in cataloguing the document. They should be selected so that no security classification is required. Identifiers, such as equipment model designation, trade name, military project code name, geographic location may also be included. If possible keywords should be selected from a published thesaurus, e.g. Thesaurus of Engineering and Scientific Terms (TEST) and that thesaurus identified. If it is not possible to select indexing terms which are Unclassified, the classification of each should be indicated as with the title.)
