# Fulltext:
The preceding chapters largely examined the Russian General Staff's behavior, organization, and culture through an operation-agnostic lens.
The purpose of Chapters Five and Six is to place this body in the context of two recent military efforts, Russian military operations in Ukraine (2014-2021) and Syria (2015-2019).
These case studies afford the opportunity to observe the roles, responsibilities, and authorities of the General Staff in practice.
