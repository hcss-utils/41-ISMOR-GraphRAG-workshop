Russian culture forms the basis for a holistic view of information war in Russian society, and Soviet-era deception techniques were employed continually through the Cold War, even in the absence of hostilities.
While the US definition of "information operations" limits the scope to measures applied specifically during military operations, Russia approaches information warfare as a continual exploitation of history, culture, language, and nationalism for political advantage, regardless of the presence or absence of military conflict.
Given this definition and the evidence at large, European and American security officials must recognize that Russia is in the initial phases of information war as part of a broader hostile posture.
This acknowledgment should also be included in any overall assessment of Russia's military disposition, or the phase of conflict in the Baltic and Eastern European region.
