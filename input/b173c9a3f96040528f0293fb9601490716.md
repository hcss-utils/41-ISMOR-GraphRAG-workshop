The Russian leadership has a Clausewitzian-style understanding of war, essentially meaning that it is a test of society.
Their view is that despite Russia's actions during the war in Ukraine, and its intervention in Syria, Russia is not yet ready for such a test.
xii This is because the Russian system, although in some respects powerful, is often dysfunctional.
The leadership faces numerous problems, not only from Russia's Soviet inheritance including a limited and decrepit infrastructure, but also from post-Soviet problems, including corruption and passive opposition from the bureaucracy.
The military has also endured many years of underfunding and neglect.
At the same time, there are other important pressures, such as longerterm economic stagnation that has developed into a sharper contraction over the last 2 years.
This Letort Paper thus emphasizes the point that not only is Russian strategy not made in a vacuum, but also that the process of forming this strategy is itself a complex and arduous task.
