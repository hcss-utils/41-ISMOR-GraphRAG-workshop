This same persistence will mark Chinese military activities.
There will, on the one hand, be a growing effort on the part of the Chinese military to obtain information about potential adversaries, including not only the United States but Taiwan, Japan, Vietnam, India, and also Russia.
This will include not only technical information about weapons systems but information about organization and processes-how decisions are made, who staffs those decisions, what procedures are followed.
All of this provides insights both about whom to target, when, and with what types of capabilities.
It might be determined that it would be more advantageous to defer attacking a target until it has become a single point of failure (e.g., attacking satellites after first damaging undersea cables which carry far more bandwidth).
Or there may be circumstances where it is determined that it would be more useful to employ trusted agents to alter information rather than employ hard-kill methods to destroy physical infrastructure.
Much of this will depend upon peacetime gathering of information.
